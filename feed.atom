These models yield very good results, but more importantly they are very easy to use as I have always captioned my images as one would use natural spoken language (no weird booru tags and all that jazz). The most labor intensive processes in the workflow is image captioning. For example, my last project had almost 10000 images in the data set. Every single image was manually captioned by me as the quality of all automated solutions I tried is subpar and has too many accuracy issues. I have tried Blip auto captioning and LLava, but they still were not accurate enough for what I needed. I am hoping someone here can suggest a solution, if one exists, thanks.

 I’m not really getting along with OpenPose and MediaPipe don’t show really good results.
 In my project, I would like to detect hand keypoints in assembly scenarios. It would be ok to use 2 cameras or a depth camera if necessary.
 Does anybody knows any models / tools to use?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Langchain offers a wide array of vector databases for text embedding models. I need to create a vector database for around 3 million sentence embeddings, each being of dimension 384. I'm building a prototype, so it has to be local and free of charge to use.
 So far, I've hit limits for Chroma (41,666 max). I've also tried Redis, QDrant and FAISS - each of these gets so large that it eats up all the RAM and the process gets killed, or with QDrant, just errors out.
 I've used Pinecone before, but I don't really want to pay for a prototype as I have plenty of disk space.
 I was thinking of chunking the 3 million documents into local vector stores of size 41,666 using ChromaDB - but there isn't a whole lot out there about whether Chroma would allow me to merge all ~70 of these smaller databases into a bigger one for search. I also cannot find whether it would be possible to load all 70 of these into memory and search each one individually.
 So what are my options?
 My other thought was just creating a large Doc2Vec model, however I would like to use something more sophisticated like Huggingface embedding models.

 I am struggling with prooving convergence for an optimizer which uses adaptive step-size with heavy ball algorithm for convex and non-convex functions. In some literature, I could find a regret bound analysis/proof for convex functions and proving that the estimated gradient at t -> inf goes to zero for non-convex functions. 
 There are some assumptions and preconditions:
  
The algorithm is heavy ball momentum with adaptive step-size. '
 X_(k+1) = X_k - \eta_k . \nabla(f(x_k)) + \beta(x_k - x_(k-1))
 
The following assumptions are made: 
  
A. The function is smooth. B. The function is Lipschitz. C. The gradients are Lipschitz. 
 I attempt to prove the convergence to a critical point or a local minima. Where the estimate of the gradients at any instance k goes to zero. i.e. E[\nabla(f(x_k))] = 0 as t -> inf. 
 Could anyone please guide me through the process of convergence proof for non-convex functions or give me literature recommendations for the same.
 Thank you very much in advance.

 Context:
 I have DICOM images which I already extracted the useful meta-data I want to use.
 Those images are for a task, classification-detection pipeline of some disease.
 So as I already asked, what are the benefits of converting those DICOM files to PNG's rather then just using pydicom and the dicom pixel_array?
 Reason I ask this is because I saw many top 5 users on kaggle do this when dealing with DICOM images.
 If I understand how networks actually works, they get as input an array of pixels as floating point numbers no? So what's the differences between DICOM pixel_array to PNG's pixel array and numpy array or tensor? both are eventually will be fed to the network as a tensor of floating numbers.
 Is the reason is because PNG's are usually faster to train?
 Is the reason is because PNG's have more libraries support for preprocessing / augmentation / etc. ?
 Is the reason is because PNG's are the format many pre-trained models expect to? (I write this knowing it's 99% not true, as mentioned the tensor thing)
 Thanks in Advance, and Please, forgive my English (I could use AI tools to fix it but I feel addicted already)

 Abstract:
  
Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications such as multi-round dialogue, where long interactions are expected, is urgently needed but poses two major challenges. Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of wind…]]></summary>

However, transformers don't have this kind of inductive bias, and as a result, take much more data and compute to reach similar levels of performance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When trying to get language models to solve complex math problems, researchers kept running into limits. Models like GPT-3 and ChatGPT still struggle with advanced algebra, calculus, and geometry questions. The math is just too abstract and symbol-heavy for them.
 To break through this barrier, researchers from Tsinghua University and Microsoft taught models to combine natural language reasoning with calling external math tools.
 The key is their new "tool-integrated reasoning" format. Models generate a natural language plan first, then write code to invoke tools like SymPy to solve equations. They take the output results and continue verbal reasoning.
 By interleaving natural language and symbolic computations, they get the best of both worlds - semantic understanding from language models and rigorous math from tools.
 They trained versions of the LLaMA model this way, producing their Tool-Integrated Reasoning Agent (TORA). They present some strong results:
  
In evaluations on 10 math datasets, TORA substantially outperformed prior state-of-the-art methods, achieving 13-19% higher accuracy on average.
 On one competition test, TORA-7B scored 40% accuracy, beating the previous best model by 22 percentage points.
  
This demonstrates that integrating tools directly into the reasoning process can significantly enhance mathematical capabilities, even for large models like GPT-4.
 However, tough problems involving geometry and advanced algebra are still there. New techniques for symbolic reasoning and spatial understanding will likely be needed to push further.
 Overall though, tool integration seems a promising path to improve reasoning skills. Applying this to other domains like logic and programming could also be impactful.
 TLDR: Teaching language models to use math tools helps them solve way more complex problems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We developed a statistical model to estimate “How many unique identities can a generative face model generate?” without exhaustively generating a lot of faces.
 Abstract: There has been tremendous progress in generating realistic faces with high fidelity over the past few years. Despite this progress, a crucial question remains unanswered: “Given a generative face model, how many unique identities can it generate?” In other words, what is the biometric capacity of the generative face model? A scientific basis for answering this question will benefit evaluating and comparing different generative face models and establish an upper bound on their scalability. This paper proposes a statistical approach to estimate the biometric capacity of generated face images in a hyperspherical feature space. We employ our approach on multiple generative models, including unconditional generators like StyleGAN, Latent Diffusion Model, and “Generated Photos,” as well as DCFace, a class-conditional generator. We also estimate capacity w.r.t. demographic attributes such as gender and age. Our capacity estimates indicate that (a) under ArcFace representation at a false acceptance rate (FAR) of 0.1%, StyleGAN3 and DCFace have a capacity upper bound of 1.43 million and 11,900, respectively; (b) the capacity reduces drastically as we lower the desired FAR with an estimate of 17,960 and 562 at FAR of 1% and 10%, respectively, for StyleGAN3; (c) there is no discernible disparity in the capacity w.r.t gender; and (d) for some generative models, there is an appreciable disparity in the capacity w.r.t age.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If I already have a trained reward model, say a sentiment classification model, that I'd like to use for PPO-based RLHF, I believe the standard method would be to instantiate the Critic/value function using the reward model, and train it further during PPO, correct?
 Would it even make sense to try PPO for RLHF without using the GAE term and thus without the value function, and just directly using the reward model's output as the advantage?
 It seems that this would be require viewing the entire generation as a single action (rather than each token's generation as an action), but most of the articles I've read on RLHF seem to treat it that way. On the other hand, all the code implementations I've seen have an Actor-Critic model producing values at each token, which I think implies that each token is an action.
 Edit: Apologies if any of this is just me having fundamental gaps in my understanding!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a machine learning engineer and researcher. I got fed up with how difficult it is to understand why neural networks behave the way they do, so i wrote a library to help with it.
 Comgra (computation graph analysis) is a library you can use with pytorch to extract all the tensor data you care about and visualize it graphically in a browser.
 This allows for a much more detailed analysis of what is happening than the usual approach of using tensorboard. You can go investigate tensors as training proceeds, drill down into individual neurons, inspect single data sets that are of special interest to you, track gradients, compare statistics between different training runs, and more.
 This tool has saved me a ton of time in my research by letting me check my hypotheses much more quickly than normal and by helping me understand how the different parts of my network really interact.
 I first published this a month ago and have made some improvements since then. I would be happy to hear even more feedback!
 My goal is to make this the go-to library used both by novices who want to understand what's going on under the hood, and by researchers in neural architecture design.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I am trying to find NE using rl algorithms for a turn based deterministic graph pursuit game. I have a way of checking if the strategies of players 1,2,3 are a NE and thought of using Q-Learning and see if it converges to a NE. Thus far it doesnt seem to work and I wonder if I made a mistake.
 The state is described as: St = [x1 x2 x3 p] where current player is p and x1,x2,x3 are the locations of the players in the graph
 Players have value functions Q^1(St), Q^2(St), Q^3(St)
 The way I update my value function is:
 player i choose e-greedy action a_t and the new state St_new
 Q^i(St) = (1-alpha)*Q^i(St)+alpha*gamma*Q(St_new)
 I have tried using a memory buffer but I havent improve the convergence success. I check if the if the values are a NE every 1000 iterations. It only converges for simple graphs.
 Do you think the way I update my value function is correct? Do you have any other traditional algorithms to suggest? Shall I move to deep learning? I am worried if simple algorithms cant converge the neural networks wont either... 
 I tried to implemenet Nash Q learning following the paper:https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume4/hu03a/hu03a.pdf
 but I am not sure if implemented correctly for a turn based game

 Youtube: https://youtu.be/Q0pP782dSh0?si=MiJAlK5k-KEyQ-Zr 
 Abstract:
  
Large multimodal models (LMMs) extend large language models (LLMs) with multi-sensory skills, such as visual understanding, to achieve stronger generic intelligence. In this paper, we analyze the latest model, GPT-4V(ision), to deepen the understanding of LMMs. The analysis focuses on the intriguing tasks that GPT-4V can perform, containing test samples to probe the quality and genericity of GPT-4V's capabilities, its supported inputs and working modes, and the effective ways to prompt the model. In our approach to exploring GPT-4V, we curate and organize a collection of carefully designed qualitative samples spanning a variety of domains and tasks. Observations from these samples demonstrate that GPT-4V's unprecedented ability in processing arbitrarily interleaved multimodal inputs and the genericity of its capabilities together make GPT-4V a powerful multimodal generalist system. Furthermore, GPT-4V's unique capability of understanding visual markers drawn on input images can give rise to new human-computer interaction methods such as visual referring prompting. We conclude the report with in-depth discussions on the emerging application scenarios and the future research directions for GPT-4V-based systems. We hope that this preliminary exploration will inspire future research on the next-generation multimodal task formulation, new ways to exploit and enhance LMMs to solve real-world problems, and gaining better understanding of multimodal foundation models.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meta Platforms recently introduced Llama 2 Long, a revolutionary AI model that outperforms top competitors with its ability to generate accurate responses to long user queries.
 For the latest advancements in AI, look here first.
 https://preview.redd.it/geqqd3k5rprb1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=e72a67fc7ef7e85902169f3061529c136beadc87
 Meta's new AI model
  
As an enhancement of the original Llama 2, Llama 2 Long deals with larger data containing longer texts and is modified to handle lengthier information sequences.
 Its stellar performance outshines other models such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and Claude 2.
  
How Llama 2 Long works
  
Meta built different versions of Llama 2, ranging from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters, which refines its learning from data.
 Llama 2 Long employs Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) technique, refining the way it encodes the position of each token, allowing fewer data and memory to produce precise responses.
 The model further fine-tunes its performance using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and synthetic data generated by Llama 2 chat itself.
  
Impressive feats and future aspirations
  
Llama 2 Long can create high-quality responses to user prompts up to 200,000 characters long, which is approximately 40 pages of text.
 Its ability to generate responses to queries on diverse topics such as history, science, literature, and sports indicates its potential to cater to complex and various user needs.
 The researchers see Llama 2 Long as a step towards broader, more adaptable AI models, and advocate for more research and dialogue to harness these models responsibly and beneficially.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If an AI were to take on this task, it would primarily rely on data mining and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. First, the AI would scrape digital platforms to collect works authored by various people. Platforms could range from academic databases like PubMed or ArXiv to blogs, forums, and social media. The goal would be to capture a wide array of intellectual output, irrespective of the person's titles or accolades.
 Next, an NLP model would evaluate the collected content based on factors like originality, complexity, and coherence. Advanced sentiment analysis could be employed to gauge the depth of understanding and nuances in the arguments made. Specialized algorithms could also be developed to assess the impact of each piece of work, using metrics such as citations, social shares, or subsequent works that build upon it.
 The AI would then create a shortlist based on these evaluations. This stage might also involve unsupervised machine learning techniques like clustering to find patterns or commonalities among the top contenders.
 The final stage would be validation, possibly using reinforcement learning. The AI could simulate various scenarios or problems and predict how the content created by these individuals would contribute to solving them. It would then refine its list based on the simulated outcomes.
 This all-AI approach would drastically reduce human bias and could be executed relatively quickly. However, it's important to note that any such system would need to be designed carefully to avoid introducing biases present in the training data or algorithms.

In practice, as requirements become more complex, you often end up with fairly lengthy prompts, especially when using methods like RAG. I was wondering, how effective are LLMs at following instructions as the system prompt grows in size and complexity?
 I did some quick experiments on this and found that, unsurprisingly, GPT-4 can follow a lot of rules (up to 50) quite accurately. But even GPT-3.5 slowly degrades and Llama-2-70b-chat starts to fail after just a few rules.

Stuff like Bing search and Google search cost around $5 or more per 1000 searches, so how can they even afford to do this kind of search. Do they have their own search index.
 Also, I don't know how they pull in the data from these sources so fast? I've played around with some things like this with Langchain with retrieval, but the speed of splitting and tokenizing website html is not very fast. Have they already pre-scrapped the websites from the search results and tokenized them for LLM retrieval?

 A while back, I stumbled upon an interesting paper that applied Reinforcement Learning to Object Localization. I got fascinated by how computer vision tasks could be transformed into a reinforcement learning problem, making it feel like a Markov decision process !
 So, i've decided to create a repository to compile all the existing (published) papers that delve into Reinforcement Learning in Computer Vision : https://github.com/rayanramoul/RLCV-Papers
 If you have any papers in mind or recommendations to enhance the repository, please don't hesitate to share them. Your input would be greatly appreciated!
 Thank you! :)

 Let me know if you need any further information!!
 EDIT: 
 One of the tasks my app needs to do is to convert image to text (aim to implement image captioning). So, if i give metaGPT the requirements for my project, is it possible it will give me the code which I need. I need to save certain tasks here so that I can focus more on operation and design side. 
 Edit: it seems, such kind of vague questions are not encouraged on this platform, I will work and will straigh away ask questions which are quite good and meet the standards of this platform. Thanks!!
 Thanks!!
 Always have a massive respect for this community!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When visualizing the inner workings of vision transformers (ViTs), researchers noticed weird spikes of attention on random background patches. This didn't make sense since the models should focus on foreground objects.
 By analyzing the output embeddings, they found a small number of tokens (2%) had super high vector norms, causing the spikes.
 The high-norm "outlier" tokens occurred in redundant areas and held less local info but more global info about the image.
 Their hypothesis is that ViTs learn to identify unimportant patches and recycle them as temporary storage instead of discarding. This enables efficient processing but causes issues.
 Their fix is simple - just add dedicated "register" tokens that provide storage space, avoiding the recycling side effects.
 Models trained with registers have:
  
Smoother and more meaningful attention maps
 Small boosts in downstream performance
 Way better object discovery abilities
  
The registers give ViTs a place to do their temporary computations without messing stuff up. Just a tiny architecture tweak improves interpretability and performance. Sweet!
 I think it's cool how they reverse-engineered this model artifact and fixed it with such a small change. More work like this will keep incrementally improving ViTs.
 TLDR: Vision transformers recycle useless patches to store data, causing problems. Adding dedicated register tokens for storage fixes it nicely.
 Full summary. Paper is here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's some evidence [1] [2] that it's possible to run text2text language model at substantially (potentially on the order of magnitude) better inference speed by keeping the decoder shallow.
 I'm curious whether some general reasoner SOTA (small model for machine translation available at [3]) style models are publicly available for this sort of thing.
 If not, how would one go about training one?
 Would it be necessary to do it entirely from scratch (extremely costly)? Or would it be possible to take, say, Flan-UL2 (20B), chop off its decoder, and train a much smaller decoder on top of it with the UL2 encoder frozen (ie how one trains adapter layers).
 Assuming the decoder hyperparameters are kept small, would this be possible within reasonable compute budget? Would that even meaningfully converge with small amount of compute (assuming same training objective as is for UL2)?
 Would the strength (ie somewhat comparable to 10B if we cut 20B in half) transfer from the SOTA encoder, or would cutting off half of the model layers kneecap it too badly?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there any notable work on duplicating layers in large feed forward models? In contrast to e.g. the brain which is essentially a directed graph most networks utilized nowerdays use a feed forward approach. E.g. transformers are able to attend to past tokens, but generate the tokens in a way where for a given token a given weight is not utilized at different stages in the feed forward pass. In my intuition this would lead to an issue where concepts (factual data as well as learned "algorithms") might be duplicated as they are needed at different depths in the generation process and are sequentially dependent on one another. This does not directly make the model less capable, as it might learn the same concept at two layers sufficiently well, but it reduces the data and parameter efficiency and and might impact generalization capabilities. Using a full on brain like graph might be hard to implement/optimize/scale on current hardware and is tricky with the backprop. But is there any work on duplicating a few layers, placing them at different depths in large models. I would guess that this would be more impactful for large models. One would essentially trade compute for better data efficiency.

Agents get a +1 reward for eating an apple (by stepping onto it). Agents clean the dirt also by stepping on it (no reward). Agent can go up, down, left, right. The game goes on for 1000 steps. Apple's spawn probability depends on the amount of dirt (less dirt, higher the probability). Currently, the observation for each agent has the manhatten distance to their closest apple and dirt.
 I have tried multiple ways of training this, including changing the observation space of the agents. But it seems the result does not outperform random agents by any significant amount.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meta has launched chatbots with personalities similar to certain celebrities, which some experts believe could be dangerous.
 
These chatbots have their own faces and social media accounts, and Meta is working on giving them a voice.
 
However, experts argue that the idea of chatbots with personalities is impossible, as algorithms cannot demonstrate intention or free will.
 
There is also a risk that chatbots with personalities could express problematic opinions, as seen in Meta's testing.
 
Meta's project is driven by profit, as users are more likely to engage with chatbots that seem human.
 
Experts believe that Meta should have explained the limits of these chatbots instead of emphasizing their human characteristics.

 Some way to translate numbers of parameters into seconds on a given GPU/CPU, any rules of thumb better than just setting up everything every time?

 I have 4 yoe in a start up company and a phd four publications 2 in high level math journals and 2 CV/DL papers in A journals and also 4 patents. I have experience with most common Cv tasks eg object detection, Multi object tracking, 2d/3d human pose estimation and monocular depth estimation. I’m well versed in typical network building blocks eg conv nets, FFNs, transformers, Diffusion etc. I have a little experience with NLP like NLTK and TTS networks. Also some other general dev technologies like ec2,s3,sql,mongoose, etc. 
 That all being said I can’t seem to even get interviews these days just straight rejections not talking to recruiters. On the other hand in 2020, I was just searching for jobs passively and had something like a 75% success rate with getting interviews. I know the job market has changed but I’m a lot more experienced at this time than then and having abysmal luck.
 Anyone have any advice would be happy to share my resume if that would make it easier to give advice. Also open to hearing what other technologies o should/could learn.

Before the night was over I went online and bought the domain name of GoGoAIGo . com and then the .ai version also. I put the dot com version up on Sedo (sedo.com/search/details/?domain=GoGoAIGo.com) for sale and I actually now own the .com .ai .org and .net versions of that phrase. Not only my decade but the two generational decades in front of me and the one generational decade behind me can remember our ole Inspector Gadget friend whom had a similar phrase, but not exact, that he would say.
 I'm an individual whom may hold onto something if I feel it has intrinsic value for a future development, which I think this can if laid out in an appropriate fashion. I'm working on another business project right now and I own some trademarks for my other business project so I'm not exactly a newbie in ways here I'm just kind of fresh to the AI realm studies. I think it's overblown right now but will be fine tuned over the next 5-7 years better and society will find a better seat for it.
 I could see this domain being like a search engine or something, maybe even something to do with robots. I expect AI robots moving forward will be regulated and have various classes that they are placed into as we integrate certain ones in our society. Let's be honest, the light-switch isn't flipping overnight or even in one quick year over this AI stuff. I'm in no rush to have a piece of AI wash my dishes for me to be honest. The last robotic thing I was thinking about getting was a robot mower to cut a field, I believe they are working on those now.
 Anybody have any unique ideas for me? I used to play with lego robots way back in high school in the early 2000's.... Seems like this website would make a great search engine but honestly there are other phrases that can be put into play with society also.
 Thanks for any mental stimulation you can toss in my direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Imagine an app that's like a helpful buddy in your pocket, always looking out for the best moments to nudge you into some real-world socializing. For example, say you're a fan of watching sports. The app notices you frequently check scores or read articles on sports sites during weekends. Right before a big game, it pops up and says, "How about inviting some friends over to watch the game?"
 Now let's talk about making socializing a sort of game. Think of the way Fitbit rewards you for walking 10,000 steps. Similarly, this app could reward you with "social points" for various activities. Invite a friend for coffee? 10 points. Call your mom? 15 points. Organize a barbecue? 50 points. And so on. These points could unlock virtual badges or even real-world rewards like discounts at local restaurants to encourage you to keep going.
 When it comes to setting personal goals, let's say you've been wanting to improve your relationship with a sibling. You set a goal in the app to have at least one meaningful conversation with them each week. The app then reminds you on a lazy Sunday afternoon, suggesting, "Why not call your sister now? It’s a good time to catch up."
 And for reflection, after you've hung out with your friends to watch the game or had that talk with your sister, the app asks you to rate how good you felt on a scale of 1-10. Over time, you'll see a graph of your happiness levels correlated with your social activities, making it super clear that quality time with people is a mood booster.
 The whole idea is to keep it simple but effective, helping you to naturally weave more social interactions into your life without making you feel overwhelmed or stressed.

(2) Neuro-symbolic approaches are apparently the way to get accuracy to 100% and solve other shortcomings.
 So question is (3) What are the promising research in LLMs+Symbolic architectures? (4) And how close is it to production, rather than academic? (5) Do we need non-LLM based architectures instead?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI has the potential to be a platform shift, similar to previous shifts like personal computers, the internet, and mobile.
 
Platform shifts change the dominant layer that applications are built on and can capture the majority of value from the previous generation.
 
AI could change distribution, business models, and what's possible in workflows.
 
Changes in distribution could lead to new aggregators replacing old ones, making the aggregation of quality content more difficult.
 
The business model may not change significantly, with AI likely being delivered as software-as-a-service.
 
AI can enable new workflows and drastically change existing ones.
 
While incumbents may accrue significant value, new platforms could also replace old ones.

 But what happens when you want a LLM to do a specific job, surely it only needs a fraction of the data a general-purpose model does.
 Potential benefits of SLMs:
  
Less data.
 Potentially faster.
 Less space to hallucinate/go wrong.
 Smaller set of potentials for complete testing.
 Running costs reduced.
 Lower spec hardware needs.
  
Has anyone tried dedicating a LLM to a specific job/task and then optimizing its data size to create a SLM?
 TLDR; How large does a LLM have to be for a toaster or microwave?

if multiple geographically distributed agents perform their separate RL tasks
cooperatively. Different from multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) where
multiple agents are in a common environment and should learn to cooperate or
compete with each other, in this case each agent has its separate environment
and only communicates with others to share knowledge without any cooperative or
competitive behaviour as a learning outcome. In fact, this scenario exists
widely in real life whose concept can be utilised in many applications, but is
not well understood yet and not well formulated. As the first effort, we
propose group-agent system for RL as a formulation of this scenario and the
third type of RL system with respect to single-agent and multi-agent systems.
We then propose a distributed RL framework called DDAL (Decentralised
Distributed Asynchronous Learning) designed for group-agent reinforcement
learning (GARL). We show through experiments that DDAL achieved desirable

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Classifiers built upon vision-language models such as CLIP have shown
remarkable zero-shot performance across a broad range of image classification
tasks. Prior work has studied different ways of automatically creating
descriptor sets for every class based on prompt templates, ranging from
manually engineered templates over templates obtained from a large language
model to templates built from random words and characters. In contrast,
deriving zero-shot classifiers from the respective encoded class descriptors
has remained nearly unchanged, that is: classify to the class that maximizes
the cosine similarity between its averaged encoded class descriptors and the
encoded image. However, weighting all class descriptors equally can be
suboptimal when certain descriptors match visual clues on a given image better
than others. In this work, we propose AutoCLIP, a method for auto-tuning
zero-shot classifiers. AutoCLIP assigns to each prompt template per-image
weights, which are derived from statistics of class descriptor-image
similarities at inference time. AutoCLIP is fully unsupervised, has very low
overhead, and can be easily implemented in few lines of code. We show that for
a broad range of vision-language models, datasets, and prompt templates,
AutoCLIP outperforms baselines consistently and by up to 3 percent point
accuracy.]]></summary>

learning (SSL) algorithms due to their exceptional performance. However, they
mainly depend on domain-specific data augmentations, which are not usable in

Pseudo-labeling (PL) is a general and domain-agnostic SSL approach that, unlike
consistency regularization-based methods, does not rely on the domain. PL
underperforms due to the erroneous high-confidence predictions from poorly

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Compositional generalization is a key ability of humans that enables us to
learn new concepts from only a handful examples. Machine learning models,
including the now ubiquitous transformers, struggle to generalize in this way,
and typically require thousands of examples of a concept during training in
order to generalize meaningfully. This difference in ability between humans and
artificial neural architectures, motivates this study on a neuro-symbolic
architecture called the Compositional Program Generator (CPG). CPG has three
key features: modularity, type abstraction, and recursive composition, that
enable it to generalize both systematically to new concepts in a few-shot
manner, as well as productively by length on various sequence-to-sequence
language tasks. For each input, CPG uses a grammar of the input domain and a
parser to generate a type hierarchy in which each grammar rule is assigned its
own unique semantic module, a probabilistic copy or substitution program.
Instances with the same hierarchy are processed with the same composed program,
while those with different hierarchies may be processed with different
programs. CPG learns parameters for the semantic modules and is able to learn
the semantics for new types incrementally. Given a context-free grammar of the
input language and a dictionary mapping each word in the source language to its
interpretation in the output language, CPG can achieve perfect generalization
on the SCAN and COGS benchmarks, in both standard and extreme few-shot
settings.]]></summary>

classification models using labeled and unlabeled datasets. However, existing
SSL methods rely on a large unlabeled dataset, which may not always be
available in many real-world applications due to legal constraints (e.g.,
GDPR). In this paper, we investigate the research question: Can we train SSL
models without real unlabeled datasets? Instead of using real unlabeled
datasets, we propose an SSL method using synthetic datasets generated from
generative foundation models trained on datasets containing millions of samples
in diverse domains (e.g., ImageNet). Our main concepts are identifying
synthetic samples that emulate unlabeled samples from generative foundation
models and training classifiers using these synthetic samples. To achieve this,
our method is formulated as an alternating optimization problem: (i)
meta-learning of generative foundation models and (ii) SSL of classifiers using
real labeled and synthetic unlabeled samples. For (i), we propose a
meta-learning objective that optimizes latent variables to generate samples
that resemble real labeled samples and minimize the validation loss. For (ii),
we propose a simple unsupervised loss function that regularizes the feature
extractors of classifiers to maximize the performance improvement obtained from
synthetic samples. We confirm that our method outperforms baselines using
generative foundation models on SSL. We also demonstrate that our methods
outperform SSL using real unlabeled datasets in scenarios with extremely small
amounts of labeled datasets. This suggests that synthetic samples have the
potential to provide improvement gains more efficiently than real unlabeled

real-time scenarios. To enable fast control of flexible robots, we propose a
framework for a safe approximation of NMPC using imitation learning and a
predictive safety filter. Our framework significantly reduces computation time
while incurring a slight loss in performance. Compared to NMPC, our framework
shows more than a eightfold improvement in computation time when controlling a
three-dimensional flexible robot arm in simulation, all while guaranteeing

architectures, practical applications, and their respective advantages and
disadvantages. In particular, detailed information is provided on advanced
models for price forecasting, such as Transformers, generative adversarial
networks (GANs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and deep quantum neural networks
(DQNNs). The present contribution also includes potential directions for future
research, such as examining the effectiveness of deep learning models with

Federated meta-learning is a promising answer to this question, as it addresses
the scarcity of labeled data and heterogeneous data distribution across devices
in the real world. However, deploying TinyML hardware faces unique resource

collaborative training of a neural network initialization that can be quickly
fine-tuned on new devices. It offers communication savings and privacy
protection through partial local reconstruction and Top-P% selective

client heterogeneity through few-shot learning. The evaluations on three TinyML

developing applications that allow patients to self-monitor their recovery. An
important component of this is the segmentation of eczema region from such

such as convolutional (CNN)-based U-Net or transformer-based Swin U-Net. While
effective, these methods require high volume of annotated data, which can be
difficult to obtain. Here, we investigate the capabilities of visual in-context
learning that can perform few-shot eczema segmentation with just a handful of
examples and without any need for retraining models. Specifically, we propose a
strategy for applying in-context learning for eczema segmentation with a
generalist vision model called SegGPT. When benchmarked on a dataset of
annotated eczema images, we show that SegGPT with just 2 representative example
images from the training dataset performs better (mIoU: 36.69) than a CNN U-Net
trained on 428 images (mIoU: 32.60). We also discover that using more number of
examples for SegGPT may in fact be harmful to its performance. Our result
highlights the importance of visual in-context learning in developing faster

for deep neural networks. The existing regularization techniques mainly rely on
the i.i.d. assumption and only consider the knowledge from the current sample,
without the leverage of the neighboring relationship between samples. In this
work, we propose a general regularizer called \textbf{Patch-level Neighborhood
Interpolation~(Pani)} that conducts a non-local representation in the
computation of networks. Our proposal explicitly constructs patch-level graphs
in different layers and then linearly interpolates neighborhood patch features,
serving as a general and effective regularization strategy. Further, we
customize our approach into two kinds of popular regularization methods, namely
Virtual Adversarial Training (VAT) and MixUp as well as its variants. The first
derived \textbf{Pani VAT} presents a novel way to construct non-local
adversarial smoothness by employing patch-level interpolated perturbations. The
second derived \textbf{Pani MixUp} method extends the MixUp, and achieves
superiority over MixUp and competitive performance over state-of-the-art
variants of MixUp method with a significant advantage in computational
efficiency. Extensive experiments have verified the effectiveness of our Pani
approach in both supervised and semi-supervised settings.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Federated learning has gained popularity as a means of training models
distributed across the wireless edge. The paper introduces delay-aware
hierarchical federated learning (DFL) to improve the efficiency of distributed
machine learning (ML) model training by accounting for communication delays
between edge and cloud. Different from traditional federated learning, DFL
leverages multiple stochastic gradient descent iterations on local datasets
within each global aggregation period and intermittently aggregates model
parameters through edge servers in local subnetworks. During global
synchronization, the cloud server consolidates local models with the outdated
global model using a local-global combiner, thus preserving crucial elements of
both, enhancing learning efficiency under the presence of delay. A set of
conditions is obtained to achieve the sub-linear convergence rate of O(1/k) for
strongly convex and smooth loss functions. Based on these findings, an adaptive
control algorithm is developed for DFL, implementing policies to mitigate
energy consumption and communication latency while aiming for sublinear
convergence. Numerical evaluations show DFL's superior performance in terms of
faster global model convergence, reduced resource consumption, and robustness
against communication delays compared to existing FL algorithms. In summary,
this proposed method offers improved efficiency and results when dealing with
both convex and non-convex loss functions.]]></summary>

high-stakes settings, it becomes important to ensure that predictions of these
models are not only adversarially robust, but also readily explainable to

simultaneously achieved or if there exist trade-offs between them. In this
work, we make one of the first attempts at studying the impact of adversarially
robust models on actionable explanations which provide end users with a means
for recourse. We theoretically and empirically analyze the cost (ease of
implementation) and validity (probability of obtaining a positive model
prediction) of recourses output by state-of-the-art algorithms when the
underlying models are adversarially robust vs. non-robust. More specifically,
we derive theoretical bounds on the differences between the cost and the
validity of the recourses generated by state-of-the-art algorithms for
adversarially robust vs. non-robust linear and non-linear models. Our empirical
results with multiple real-world datasets validate our theoretical results and
show the impact of varying degrees of model robustness on the cost and validity
of the resulting recourses. Our analyses demonstrate that adversarially robust
models significantly increase the cost and reduce the validity of the resulting
recourses, thus shedding light on the inherent trade-offs between adversarial

data, the acquisition of quality labels often involves laborious human
annotations or slow and expensive scientific measurements. Machine learning is
becoming an appealing alternative as sophisticated predictive techniques are
being used to quickly and cheaply produce large amounts of predicted labels;
e.g., predicted protein structures are used to supplement experimentally
derived structures, predictions of socioeconomic indicators from satellite
imagery are used to supplement accurate survey data, and so on. Since
predictions are imperfect and potentially biased, this practice brings into
question the validity of downstream inferences. We introduce cross-prediction:
a method for valid inference powered by machine learning. With a small labeled
dataset and a large unlabeled dataset, cross-prediction imputes the missing
labels via machine learning and applies a form of debiasing to remedy the
prediction inaccuracies. The resulting inferences achieve the desired error
probability and are more powerful than those that only leverage the labeled
data. Closely related is the recent proposal of prediction-powered inference,
which assumes that a good pre-trained model is already available. We show that
cross-prediction is consistently more powerful than an adaptation of
prediction-powered inference in which a fraction of the labeled data is split
off and used to train the model. Finally, we observe that cross-prediction
gives more stable conclusions than its competitors; its confidence intervals
typically have significantly lower variability.]]></summary>

Federated Non Target Distillation, which retains inter-domain knowledge while

polynomial control policies for control-affine nonlinear systems which
guarantees runtime stability to a goal state, when using visual observations

Lyapunov analysis to formulate the problem of synthesizing such policies. This
problem is nonconvex in the policy parameters and the Lyapunov function that is
used to prove the stability of the policy. To solve this problem approximately,
we propose two approaches: the first solves a sequence of sum-of-squares
optimization problems to iteratively improve a policy which is provably-stable
by construction, while the second directly performs gradient-based optimization
on the parameters of the polynomial policy, and its closed-loop stability is
verified a posteriori. We extend our approach to provide stability guarantees
in the presence of observation noise, which realistically arises due to errors
in the learned perception module. We evaluate our approach on several
underactuated nonlinear systems, including pendula and quadrotors, showing that
our guarantees translate to empirical stability when controlling these systems

accepting probabilistic notions of universal approximation and invariance can
reduce our resource requirements. More specifically, we propose a class of
binary classification models called Randomized Linear Classifiers (RLCs). We
give parameter and sample size conditions in which RLCs can, with high
probability, approximate any (smooth) function while preserving invariance to
compact group transformations. Leveraging this result, we design three RLCs
that are provably probabilistic invariant for classification tasks over sets,
graphs, and spherical data. We show how these models can achieve probabilistic

this work, we propose a novel method to alleviate these problems that we call
odd-$k$-out learning (OKO), which minimizes the cross-entropy error for sets
rather than for single examples. This naturally allows the model to capture
correlations across data examples and achieves both better accuracy and
calibration, especially in limited training data and class-imbalanced regimes.
Perhaps surprisingly, OKO often yields better calibration even when training
with hard labels and dropping any additional calibration parameter tuning, such
as temperature scaling. We provide theoretical justification, establishing that
OKO naturally yields better calibration, and provide extensive experimental
analyses that corroborate our theoretical findings. We emphasize that OKO is a
general framework that can be easily adapted to many settings and the trained
model can be applied to single examples at inference time, without introducing
significant run-time overhead or architecture changes.]]></summary>

group nodes into different clusters. Better augmentation techniques benefit the
quality of the contrastive samples, thus being one of key factors to improve
performance. However, the augmentation samples in existing methods are always
predefined by human experiences, and agnostic from the downstream task
clustering, thus leading to high human resource costs and poor performance. To
this end, we propose an Attribute Graph Clustering method via Learnable
Augmentation (\textbf{AGCLA}), which introduces learnable augmentors for
high-quality and suitable augmented samples for CDGC. Specifically, we design
two learnable augmentors for attribute and structure information, respectively.
Besides, two refinement matrices, including the high-confidence pseudo-label
matrix and the cross-view sample similarity matrix, are generated to improve
the reliability of the learned affinity matrix. During the training procedure,
we notice that there exist differences between the optimization goals for
training learnable augmentors and contrastive learning networks. In other
words, we should both guarantee the consistency of the embeddings as well as
the diversity of the augmented samples. Thus, an adversarial learning mechanism
is designed in our method. Moreover, a two-stage training strategy is leveraged
for the high-confidence refinement matrices. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of AGCLA on six benchmark datasets.]]></summary>

DynaBench, for learning dynamical systems directly from sparsely scattered data
without prior knowledge of the equations. The dataset focuses on predicting the
evolution of a dynamical system from low-resolution, unstructured measurements.
We simulate six different partial differential equations covering a variety of
physical systems commonly used in the literature and evaluate several machine
learning models, including traditional graph neural networks and point cloud
processing models, with the task of predicting the evolution of the system. The
proposed benchmark dataset is expected to advance the state of art as an
out-of-the-box easy-to-use tool for evaluating models in a setting where only
unstructured low-resolution observations are available. The benchmark is
available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/code-2022-dynabench/.]]></summary>

post-injury complications, e.g., infection, malunion, or hardware irritation,
in patients with lower extremity fractures. The research focused on the
proficiency of supervised machine learning models predicting complications
using consecutive gait datasets. We identified patients with lower extremity
fractures at an academic center. Patients underwent gait analysis with a
chest-mounted IMU device. Using software, raw gait data was preprocessed,
emphasizing 12 essential gait variables. Machine learning models including
XGBoost, Logistic Regression, SVM, LightGBM, and Random Forest were trained,
tested, and evaluated. Attention was given to class imbalance, addressed using
SMOTE. We introduced a methodology to compute the Rate of Change (ROC) for gait
variables, independent of the time difference between gait analyses. XGBoost
was the optimal model both before and after applying SMOTE. Prior to SMOTE, the
model achieved an average test AUC of 0.90 (95% CI: [0.79, 1.00]) and test
accuracy of 86% (95% CI: [75%, 97%]). Feature importance analysis attributed
importance to the duration between injury and gait analysis. Data patterns
showed early physiological compensations, followed by stabilization phases,
emphasizing prompt gait analysis. This study underscores the potential of
machine learning, particularly XGBoost, in gait analysis for orthopedic care.
Predicting post-injury complications, early gait assessment becomes vital,

critical for obtaining a comprehensive and accurate perception of the real
world. Drawing inspiration from neuroscience, we develop the
Information-Theoretic Hierarchical Perception (ITHP) model, which utilizes the

that aim to incorporate all modalities as input, our model designates the prime
modality as input, while the remaining modalities act as detectors in the
information pathway. Our proposed perception model focuses on constructing an
effective and compact information flow by achieving a balance between the
minimization of mutual information between the latent state and the input modal
state, and the maximization of mutual information between the latent states and
the remaining modal states. This approach leads to compact latent state
representations that retain relevant information while minimizing redundancy,
thereby substantially enhancing the performance of downstream tasks.
Experimental evaluations on both the MUStARD and CMU-MOSI datasets demonstrate
that our model consistently distills crucial information in multimodal learning
scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art benchmarks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graph unlearning has emerged as a pivotal method to delete information from a
pre-trained graph neural network (GNN). One may delete nodes, a class of nodes,
edges, or a class of edges. An unlearning method enables the GNN model to
comply with data protection regulations (i.e., the right to be forgotten),
adapt to evolving data distributions, and reduce the GPU-hours carbon footprint
by avoiding repetitive retraining. Existing partitioning and aggregation-based
methods have limitations due to their poor handling of local graph dependencies
and additional overhead costs. More recently, GNNDelete offered a
model-agnostic approach that alleviates some of these issues. Our work takes a
novel approach to address these challenges in graph unlearning through
knowledge distillation, as it distills to delete in GNN (D2DGN). It is a
model-agnostic distillation framework where the complete graph knowledge is
divided and marked for retention and deletion. It performs distillation with
response-based soft targets and feature-based node embedding while minimizing
KL divergence. The unlearned model effectively removes the influence of deleted
graph elements while preserving knowledge about the retained graph elements.
D2DGN surpasses the performance of existing methods when evaluated on various
real-world graph datasets by up to $43.1\%$ (AUC) in edge and node unlearning
tasks. Other notable advantages include better efficiency, better performance
in removing target elements, preservation of performance for the retained
elements, and zero overhead costs. Notably, our D2DGN surpasses the
state-of-the-art GNNDelete in AUC by $2.4\%$, improves membership inference
ratio by $+1.3$, requires $10.2\times10^6$ fewer FLOPs per forward pass and up
to $\mathbf{3.2}\times$ faster.]]></summary>

question, we examine a variety of prompting methods for encoding structural
information, in settings where textual node features are either rich or scarce.
For the ``why'' questions, we probe into two potential contributing factors to
the LLM performance: data leakage and homophily. Our exploration of these
questions reveals that (i) LLMs can benefit from structural information,
especially when textual node features are scarce; (ii) there is no substantial
evidence indicating that the performance of LLMs is significantly attributed to
data leakage; and (iii) the performance of LLMs on a target node is strongly
positively related to the local homophily ratio of the node.]]></summary>

component to safe planning in autonomous vehicles. Here, we represent
continuous trajectories as sequences of discrete motion tokens and cast

anchors or explicit latent variable optimization to learn multimodal
distributions. Instead, we leverage a single standard language modeling
objective, maximizing the average log probability over sequence tokens. Second,
our approach bypasses post-hoc interaction heuristics where individual agent
trajectory generation is conducted prior to interactive scoring. Instead,
MotionLM produces joint distributions over interactive agent futures in a
single autoregressive decoding process. In addition, the model's sequential
factorization enables temporally causal conditional rollouts. The proposed

images is the lack of sufficient labeled training data, owing to the cost of
acquiring such data. Realizing that object detection methods for the RGB
modality are quite robust (at least for some commonplace classes, like person,
car, etc.), thanks to the giant training sets that exist, in this work we seek
to leverage cues from the RGB modality to scale object detectors to the IR
modality, while preserving model performance in the RGB modality. At the core
of our method, is a novel tensor decomposition method called TensorFact which
splits the convolution kernels of a layer of a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) into low-rank factor matrices, with fewer parameters than the original
CNN. We first pretrain these factor matrices on the RGB modality, for which
plenty of training data are assumed to exist and then augment only a few
trainable parameters for training on the IR modality to avoid over-fitting,
while encouraging them to capture complementary cues from those trained only on
the RGB modality. We validate our approach empirically by first assessing how
well our TensorFact decomposed network performs at the task of detecting
objects in RGB images vis-a-vis the original network and then look at how well
it adapts to IR images of the FLIR ADAS v1 dataset. For the latter, we train
models under scenarios that pose challenges stemming from data paucity. From
the experiments, we observe that: (i) TensorFact shows performance gains on RGB
images; (ii) further, this pre-trained model, when fine-tuned, outperforms a
standard state-of-the-art object detector on the FLIR ADAS v1 dataset by about
4% in terms of mAP 50 score.]]></summary>

demographic subgroups such as elder and female. Recently, fair representation
learning (FRL) trained by deep neural networks has demonstrated superior
performance, whereby representations containing no demographic information are
inferred from the data and then used as the input to classification or other
downstream tasks. Despite the development of FRL methods, their vulnerability
under data poisoning attack, a popular protocol to benchmark model robustness
under adversarial scenarios, is under-explored. Data poisoning attacks have
been developed for classical fair machine learning methods which incorporate
fairness constraints into shallow-model classifiers. Nonetheless, these attacks
fall short in FRL due to notably different fairness goals and model
architectures. This work proposes the first data poisoning framework attacking
FRL. We induce the model to output unfair representations that contain as much
demographic information as possible by injecting carefully crafted poisoning
samples into the training data. This attack entails a prohibitive bilevel
optimization, wherefore an effective approximated solution is proposed. A
theoretical analysis on the needed number of poisoning samples is derived and
sheds light on defending against the attack. Experiments on benchmark fairness
datasets and state-of-the-art fair representation learning models demonstrate
the superiority of our attack.]]></summary>

\geq 2t+1$ compute nodes are required to ensure privacy against any $t$
colluding adversarial nodes. By allowing for some controlled amount of
information leakage and approximate multiplication instead of exact
multiplication, we study coding schemes for the setting where the number of
honest nodes can be a minority, that is $N< 2t+1.$ We develop a tight
characterization privacy-accuracy trade-off for cases where $N < 2t+1$ by
measuring information leakage using {differential} privacy instead of perfect
privacy, and using the mean squared error metric for accuracy. A novel
technical aspect is an intricately layered noise distribution that merges ideas
from differential privacy and Shamir secret-sharing at different layers.]]></summary>

randomized controlled trials to the target population where we only have the
control group data. Previous works rely critically on the mean exchangeability

exchangeability assumption might be violated. Motivated by the synthetic
control method, we construct a synthetic treatment group for the target
population by a weighted mixture of treatment groups of source populations. We
estimate the weights by minimizing the conditional maximum mean discrepancy
between the weighted control groups of source populations and the target
population. We establish the asymptotic normality of the synthetic treatment

as a novel complementary approach when the mean exchangeability assumption is

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Decision forests are widely used for classification and regression tasks. A
lesser known property of tree-based methods is that one can construct a
proximity matrix from the tree(s), and these proximity matrices are induced
kernels. While there has been extensive research on the applications and
properties of kernels, there is relatively little research on kernels induced
by decision forests. We construct Kernel Mean Embedding Random Forests (KMERF),
which induce kernels from random trees and/or forests using leaf-node
proximity. We introduce the notion of an asymptotically characteristic kernel,
and prove that KMERF kernels are asymptotically characteristic for both
discrete and continuous data. Because KMERF is data-adaptive, we suspected it
would outperform kernels selected a priori on finite sample data. We illustrate
that KMERF nearly dominates current state-of-the-art kernel-based tests across
a diverse range of high-dimensional two-sample and independence testing
settings. Furthermore, our forest-based approach is interpretable, and provides
feature importance metrics that readily distinguish important dimensions,
unlike other high-dimensional non-parametric testing procedures. Hence, this
work demonstrates the decision forest-based kernel can be more powerful and
more interpretable than existing methods, flying in the face of conventional
wisdom of the trade-off between the two.]]></summary>

aspects. However, when applying them to the highly specialized, safe-critical
legal domain, it is unclear how much legal knowledge they possess and whether
they can reliably perform legal-related tasks. To address this gap, we propose
a comprehensive evaluation benchmark LawBench. LawBench has been meticulously
crafted to have precise assessment of the LLMs' legal capabilities from three
cognitive levels: (1) Legal knowledge memorization: whether LLMs can memorize
needed legal concepts, articles and facts; (2) Legal knowledge understanding:
whether LLMs can comprehend entities, events and relationships within legal
text; (3) Legal knowledge applying: whether LLMs can properly utilize their
legal knowledge and make necessary reasoning steps to solve realistic legal
tasks. LawBench contains 20 diverse tasks covering 5 task types: single-label
classification (SLC), multi-label classification (MLC), regression, extraction
and generation. We perform extensive evaluations of 51 LLMs on LawBench,
including 20 multilingual LLMs, 22 Chinese-oriented LLMs and 9 legal specific
LLMs. The results show that GPT-4 remains the best-performing LLM in the legal
domain, surpassing the others by a significant margin. While fine-tuning LLMs
on legal specific text brings certain improvements, we are still a long way
from obtaining usable and reliable LLMs in legal tasks. All data, model
predictions and evaluation code are released in
https://github.com/open-compass/LawBench/. We hope this benchmark provides
in-depth understanding of the LLMs' domain-specified capabilities and speed up
the development of LLMs in the legal domain.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Batch reinforcement learning (RL) defines the task of learning from a fixed
batch of data lacking exhaustive exploration. Worst-case optimality algorithms,
which calibrate a value-function model class from logged experience and perform
some type of pessimistic evaluation under the learned model, have emerged as a
promising paradigm for batch RL. However, contemporary works on this stream
have commonly overlooked the hierarchical decision-making structure hidden in
the optimization landscape. In this paper, we adopt a game-theoretical
viewpoint and model the policy learning diagram as a two-player general-sum
game with a leader-follower structure. We propose a novel stochastic
gradient-based learning algorithm: StackelbergLearner, in which the leader
player updates according to the total derivative of its objective instead of
the usual individual gradient, and the follower player makes individual updates
and ensures transition-consistent pessimistic reasoning. The derived learning
dynamic naturally lends StackelbergLearner to a game-theoretic interpretation
and provides a convergence guarantee to differentiable Stackelberg equilibria.
From a theoretical standpoint, we provide instance-dependent regret bounds with
general function approximation, which shows that our algorithm can learn a
best-effort policy that is able to compete against any comparator policy that
is covered by batch data. Notably, our theoretical regret guarantees only
require realizability without any data coverage and strong function
approximation conditions, e.g., Bellman closedness, which is in contrast to
prior works lacking such guarantees. Through comprehensive experiments, we find
that our algorithm consistently performs as well or better as compared to
state-of-the-art methods in batch RL benchmark and real-world datasets.]]></summary>

goal is to simultaneously achieve ($i$) second order gradient adaptivity; and
($ii$) comparator norm adaptivity also known as "parameter freeness" in the
literature. Existing regret bounds (Cutkosky and Orabona, 2018; Mhammedi and
Koolen, 2020; Jacobsen and Cutkosky, 2022) have the suboptimal $O(\sqrt{V_T\log
V_T})$ dependence on the gradient variance $V_T$, while the present work
improves it to the optimal rate $O(\sqrt{V_T})$ using a novel
continuous-time-inspired algorithm, without any impractical doubling trick.
This result can be extended to the setting with unknown Lipschitz constant,
eliminating the range ratio problem from prior works (Mhammedi and Koolen,
2020).

Concretely, we first show that the aimed simultaneous adaptivity can be
achieved fairly easily in a continuous time analogue of the problem, where the
environment is modeled by an arbitrary continuous semimartingale. Then, our key
innovation is a new discretization argument that preserves such adaptivity in
the discrete time adversarial setting. This refines a non-gradient-adaptive
discretization argument from (Harvey et al., 2023), both algorithmically and
analytically, which could be of independent interest.]]></summary>

Additionally, NNBF is scalable to the number of single-antenna user equipments

oscillations and granulation, thereby offering key insights into the internal
structure and evolutionary state of stars. Conventional asteroseismic
techniques have been largely confined to power spectral analysis, neglecting
the valuable phase information contained within light curves. While recent
machine learning applications in asteroseismology utilizing Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) have successfully inferred stellar attributes from light
curves, they are often limited by the local feature extraction inherent in
convolutional operations. To circumvent these constraints, we present
$\textit{Astroconformer}$, a Transformer-based deep learning framework designed
to capture long-range dependencies in stellar light curves. Our empirical
analysis, which focuses on estimating surface gravity ($\log g$), is grounded
in a carefully curated dataset derived from $\textit{Kepler}$ light curves.
These light curves feature asteroseismic $\log g$ values spanning from 0.2 to
4.4. Our results underscore that, in the regime where the training data is
abundant, $\textit{Astroconformer}$ attains a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of
0.017 dex around $\log g \approx 3 $. Even in regions where training data are
sparse, the RMSE can reach 0.1 dex. It outperforms not only the K-nearest
neighbor-based model ($\textit{The SWAN}$) but also state-of-the-art CNNs.
Ablation studies confirm that the efficacy of the models in this particular
task is strongly influenced by the size of their receptive fields, with larger
receptive fields correlating with enhanced performance. Moreover, we find that
the attention mechanisms within $\textit{Astroconformer}$ are well-aligned with
the inherent characteristics of stellar oscillations and granulation present in

taken anywhere on Earth. This task has considerable challenges due to immense
variation in geographic landscapes. The image-to-image retrieval-based
approaches fail to solve this problem on a global scale as it is not feasible
to construct a large gallery of images covering the entire world. Instead,
existing approaches divide the globe into discrete geographic cells,
transforming the problem into a classification task. However, their performance
is limited by the predefined classes and often results in inaccurate
localizations when an image's location significantly deviates from its class
center. To overcome these limitations, we propose GeoCLIP, a novel
CLIP-inspired Image-to-GPS retrieval approach that enforces alignment between
the image and its corresponding GPS locations. GeoCLIP's location encoder
models the Earth as a continuous function by employing positional encoding
through random Fourier features and constructing a hierarchical representation
that captures information at varying resolutions to yield a semantically rich
high-dimensional feature suitable to use even beyond geo-localization. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work employing GPS encoding for
geo-localization. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method via extensive
experiments and ablations on benchmark datasets. We achieve competitive
performance with just 20% of training data, highlighting its effectiveness even
in limited-data settings. Furthermore, we qualitatively demonstrate
geo-localization using a text query by leveraging CLIP backbone of our image

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Auxiliary data sources have become increasingly important in epidemiological
surveillance, as they are often available at a finer spatial and temporal
resolution, larger coverage, and lower latency than traditional surveillance
signals. We describe the problem of spatial and temporal heterogeneity in these
signals derived from these data sources, where spatial and/or temporal biases
are present. We present a method to use a ``guiding'' signal to correct for
these biases and produce a more reliable signal that can be used for modeling
and forecasting. The method assumes that the heterogeneity can be approximated
by a low-rank matrix and that the temporal heterogeneity is smooth over time.
We also present a hyperparameter selection algorithm to choose the parameters
representing the matrix rank and degree of temporal smoothness of the
corrections. In the absence of ground truth, we use maps and plots to argue
that this method does indeed reduce heterogeneity. Reducing heterogeneity from
auxiliary data sources greatly increases their utility in modeling and
forecasting epidemics.]]></summary>

the i.i.d. assumption and only consider the knowledge from the current sample,

work, we propose a general regularizer called \textbf{Patch-level Neighborhood

in different layers and then linearly interpolates neighborhood patch features,
serving as a general and effective regularization strategy. Further, we
customize our approach into two kinds of popular regularization methods, namely
Virtual Adversarial Training (VAT) and MixUp as well as its variants. The first
derived \textbf{Pani VAT} presents a novel way to construct non-local
adversarial smoothness by employing patch-level interpolated perturbations. The
second derived \textbf{Pani MixUp} method extends the MixUp, and achieves
superiority over MixUp and competitive performance over state-of-the-art
variants of MixUp method with a significant advantage in computational

grids, especially wind and solar generation, results in increased operational
uncertainty. In that context, accurate forecasts are critical, especially for
wind generation, which exhibits large variability and is historically harder to
predict. To overcome this challenge, this work proposes a novel
Bundle-Predict-Reconcile (BPR) framework that integrates asset bundling,
machine learning, and forecast reconciliation techniques. The BPR framework
first learns an intermediate hierarchy level (the bundles), then predicts wind
power at the asset, bundle, and fleet level, and finally reconciles all
forecasts to ensure consistency. This approach effectively introduces an
auxiliary learning task (predicting the bundle-level time series) to help the
main learning tasks. The paper also introduces new asset-bundling criteria that
capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of wind power time series. Extensive
numerical experiments are conducted on an industry-size dataset of 283 wind
farms in the MISO footprint. The experiments consider short-term and day-ahead
forecasts, and evaluates a large variety of forecasting models that include
weather predictions as covariates. The results demonstrate the benefits of BPR,
which consistently and significantly improves forecast accuracy over baselines,

models and adversarial defense techniques. They pose severe security problems
for deep learning applications because they can effectively bypass defense
mechanisms. However, previous attack methods often utilize Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), which are not theoretically provable and thus
generate unrealistic examples by incorporating adversarial objectives,
especially for large-scale datasets like ImageNet. In this paper, we propose a
new method, called AdvDiff, to generate unrestricted adversarial examples with
diffusion models. We design two novel adversarial guidance techniques to
conduct adversarial sampling in the reverse generation process of diffusion
models. These two techniques are effective and stable to generate high-quality,
realistic adversarial examples by integrating gradients of the target
classifier interpretably. Experimental results on MNIST and ImageNet datasets
demonstrate that AdvDiff is effective to generate unrestricted adversarial
examples, which outperforms GAN-based methods in terms of attack performance

the risk prediction for the events of interest can support an informative
outlook for a patient's medical journey. Given the existence of data censoring,
an effective way of survival analysis is to enforce the pairwise temporal
concordance between censored and observed data, aiming to utilize the time
interval before censoring as partially observed time-to-event labels for
supervised learning. Although existing studies mostly employed ranking methods
to pursue an ordering objective, contrastive methods which learn a
discriminative embedding by having data contrast against each other, have not
been explored thoroughly for survival analysis. Therefore, in this paper, we
propose a novel Ontology-aware Temporality-based Contrastive Survival (OTCSurv)
analysis framework that utilizes survival durations from both censored and
observed data to define temporal distinctiveness and construct negative sample
pairs with adjustable hardness for contrastive learning. Specifically, we first
use an ontological encoder and a sequential self-attention encoder to represent
the longitudinal EHR data with rich contexts. Second, we design a temporal
contrastive loss to capture varying survival durations in a supervised setting
through a hardness-aware negative sampling mechanism. Last, we incorporate the
contrastive task into the time-to-event predictive task with multiple loss
components. We conduct extensive experiments using a large EHR dataset to
forecast the risk of hospitalized patients who are in danger of developing
acute kidney injury (AKI), a critical and urgent medical condition. The
effectiveness and explainability of the proposed model are validated through
comprehensive quantitative and qualitative studies.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We consider the task of generating diverse and realistic videos guided by
natural audio samples from a wide variety of semantic classes. For this task,
the videos are required to be aligned both globally and temporally with the
input audio: globally, the input audio is semantically associated with the
entire output video, and temporally, each segment of the input audio is
associated with a corresponding segment of that video. We utilize an existing
text-conditioned video generation model and a pre-trained audio encoder model.
The proposed method is based on a lightweight adaptor network, which learns to
map the audio-based representation to the input representation expected by the
text-to-video generation model. As such, it also enables video generation
conditioned on text, audio, and, for the first time as far as we can ascertain,
on both text and audio. We validate our method extensively on three datasets
demonstrating significant semantic diversity of audio-video samples and further
propose a novel evaluation metric (AV-Align) to assess the alignment of
generated videos with input audio samples. AV-Align is based on the detection
and comparison of energy peaks in both modalities. In comparison to recent
state-of-the-art approaches, our method generates videos that are better
aligned with the input sound, both with respect to content and temporal axis.
We also show that videos produced by our method present higher visual quality
and are more diverse.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) have recently emerged as a
novel and powerful technique for self-supervised representation learning. They
aim to learn an energy-based model by predicting the latent representation of a
target signal $y$ from a context signal $x$. JEPAs bypass the need for data
augmentation and negative samples, which are typically required by contrastive
learning, while avoiding the overfitting issues associated with
generative-based pretraining. In this paper, we show that graph-level
representations can be effectively modeled using this paradigm and propose
Graph-JEPA, the first JEPA for the graph domain. In particular, we employ
masked modeling to learn embeddings for different subgraphs of the input graph.
To endow the representations with the implicit hierarchy that is often present
in graph-level concepts, we devise an alternative training objective that
consists of predicting the coordinates of the encoded subgraphs on the unit
hyperbola in the 2D plane. Extensive validation shows that Graph-JEPA can learn
representations that are expressive and competitive in both graph
classification and regression problems.]]></summary>

locomotion and interaction capabilities, which is generally referred to as
mobile manipulation (MoMa). MoMa tasks are difficult due to the large action
space of the robot and the common multi-objective nature of the task, e.g.,
efficiently reaching a goal while avoiding obstacles. Current approaches often
segregate tasks into navigation without manipulation and stationary
manipulation without locomotion by manually matching parts of the action space
to MoMa sub-objectives (e.g. learning base actions for locomotion objectives
and learning arm actions for manipulation). This solution prevents simultaneous
combinations of locomotion and interaction degrees of freedom and requires
human domain knowledge for both partitioning the action space and matching the
action parts to the sub-objectives. In this paper, we introduce Causal MoMa, a
new reinforcement learning framework to train policies for typical MoMa tasks
that makes use of the most favorable subspace of the robot's action space to
address each sub-objective. Causal MoMa automatically discovers the causal
dependencies between actions and terms of the reward function and exploits
these dependencies through causal policy gradient that reduces gradient
variance compared to previous state-of-the-art reinforcement learning
algorithms, improving convergence and results. We evaluate the performance of
Causal MoMa on three types of simulated robots across different MoMa tasks and
demonstrate success in transferring the policies trained in simulation directly
to a real robot, where our agent is able to follow moving goals and react to
dynamic obstacles while simultaneously and synergistically controlling the
whole-body: base, arm, and head. More information at

maximise the performance during model training and then minimise the
memory/area footprint of the trained model for deployment on edge devices
targeting CPUs, GPUs, microcontrollers, or custom hardware accelerators. This
paper proposes a methodology for automatically generating predictor circuits
for classification of tabular data with comparable prediction performance to
conventional ML techniques while using substantially fewer hardware resources
and power. The proposed methodology uses an evolutionary algorithm to search
over the space of logic gates and automatically generates a classifier circuit
with maximised training prediction accuracy. Classifier circuits are so tiny
(i.e., consisting of no more than 300 logic gates) that they are called "Tiny
Classifier" circuits, and can efficiently be implemented in ASIC or on an FPGA.
We empirically evaluate the automatic Tiny Classifier circuit generation
methodology or "Auto Tiny Classifiers" on a wide range of tabular datasets, and
compare it against conventional ML techniques such as Amazon's AutoGluon,
Google's TabNet and a neural search over Multi-Layer Perceptrons. Despite Tiny
Classifiers being constrained to a few hundred logic gates, we observe no
statistically significant difference in prediction performance in comparison to
the best-performing ML baseline. When synthesised as a Silicon chip, Tiny
Classifiers use 8-18x less area and 4-8x less power. When implemented as an
ultra-low cost chip on a flexible substrate (i.e., FlexIC), they occupy 10-75x
less area and consume 13-75x less power compared to the most hardware-efficient
ML baseline. On an FPGA, Tiny Classifiers consume 3-11x fewer resources.]]></summary>

be characterized using classical Gaussian processes. More flexible spatial
extremes models exhibit appealing extremal dependence properties but are often
exceedingly prohibitive to fit and simulate from in high dimensions. In this
paper, we develop a new spatial extremes model that has flexible and
non-stationary dependence properties, and we integrate it in the
encoding-decoding structure of a variational autoencoder (XVAE), whose
parameters are estimated via variational Bayes combined with deep learning. The
XVAE can be used as a spatio-temporal emulator that characterizes the
distribution of potential mechanistic model output states and produces outputs
that have the same statistical properties as the inputs, especially in the
tail. As an aside, our approach also provides a novel way of making fast
inference with complex extreme-value processes. Through extensive simulation
studies, we show that our XVAE is substantially more time-efficient than
traditional Bayesian inference while also outperforming many spatial extremes
models with a stationary dependence structure. To further demonstrate the
computational power of the XVAE, we analyze a high-resolution satellite-derived
dataset of sea surface temperature in the Red Sea, which includes 30 years of
daily measurements at 16703 grid cells. We find that the extremal dependence
strength is weaker in the interior of Red Sea and it has decreased slightly
over time.]]></summary>

sizes, prompting practitioners to find new tuning methods using a proxy of

the optimal hyperparameters for small width networks transfer to networks with
arbitrarily large width. However, in this scheme, hyperparameters do not

are supported and motivated by theory. Using recent developments in the

where two positive views generated through data augmentation are made similar
by an attraction force in a data representation space, while a repulsive force
makes them far from negative examples. Non-contrastive learning, represented by
BYOL and SimSiam, further gets rid of negative examples and improves
computational efficiency. While learned representations may collapse into a
single point due to the lack of the repulsive force at first sight, Tian et al.
(2021) revealed through the learning dynamics analysis that the representations
can avoid collapse if data augmentation is sufficiently stronger than
regularization. However, their analysis does not take into account
commonly-used feature normalization, a normalizer before measuring the
similarity of representations, and hence excessively strong regularization may
collapse the dynamics, which is an unnatural behavior under the presence of
feature normalization. Therefore, we extend the previous theory based on the L2
loss by considering the cosine loss, which involves feature normalization. We
show that the cosine loss induces sixth-order dynamics (while the L2 loss
induces a third-order one), in which a stable equilibrium dynamically emerges
even if there are only collapsed solutions with given initial parameters. Thus,
we offer a new understanding that feature normalization plays an important role
in robustly preventing the dynamics collapse.]]></summary>

by considering larger and more sophisticated local search neighborhoods hence
allowing to swap multiple centers at the same time. Our algorithm achieves a $9
+ \varepsilon$ approximation ratio, which is the best possible for local
search. Importantly we show that our approach yields substantial practical
improvements, we show significant quality improvements over the approach of
Lattanzi and Sohler (ICML 2019) on several datasets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We introduce the modified planar rotator method (MPRS), a physically inspired
machine learning method for spatial/temporal regression. MPRS is a
non-parametric model which incorporates spatial or temporal correlations via
short-range, distance-dependent ``interactions'' without assuming a specific
form for the underlying probability distribution. Predictions are obtained by
means of a fully autonomous learning algorithm which employs equilibrium
conditional Monte Carlo simulations. MPRS is able to handle scattered data and
arbitrary spatial dimensions. We report tests on various synthetic and
real-word data in one, two and three dimensions which demonstrate that the MPRS
prediction performance (without parameter tuning) is competitive with standard
interpolation methods such as ordinary kriging and inverse distance weighting.
In particular, MPRS is a particularly effective gap-filling method for rough
and non-Gaussian data (e.g., daily precipitation time series). MPRS shows
superior computational efficiency and scalability for large samples. Massive
data sets involving millions of nodes can be processed in a few seconds on a
standard personal computer.]]></summary>

challenging problem. Intractable gradients, high-dimensional spaces, and
non-linear model functions are typically problematic without large
computational budgets. A recent body of work in that area has focused on
Bayesian inference methods, which consider parameters under their statistical
distributions and therefore, do not derive point estimates of optimal parameter
values. Here we propose a new metaheuristic that drives dimensionality
reductions from feature-informed transformations (DR-FFIT) to address these
bottlenecks. DR-FFIT implements an efficient sampling strategy that facilitates
a gradient-free parameter search in high-dimensional spaces. We use artificial
neural networks to obtain differentiable proxies for the model's features of
interest. The resulting gradients enable the estimation of a local active
subspace of the model within a defined sampling region. This approach enables
efficient dimensionality reductions of highly non-linear search spaces at a low
computational cost. Our test data show that DR-FFIT boosts the performances of
random-search and simulated-annealing against well-established metaheuristics,

spatial transformations found in natural data. Traditionally, this is done
using data augmentation or hard-coding invariances into the architecture.
However, too much or too little invariance can hurt, and the correct amount is
unknown a priori and dependent on the instance. Ideally, the appropriate
invariance would be learned from data and inferred at test-time.

We treat invariance as a prediction problem. Given any image, we use a
normalizing flow to predict a distribution over transformations and average the
predictions over them. Since this distribution only depends on the instance, we
can align instances before classifying them and generalize invariance across
classes. The same distribution can also be used to adapt to out-of-distribution
poses. This normalizing flow is trained end-to-end and can learn a much larger
range of transformations than Augerino and InstaAug. When used as data
augmentation, our method shows accuracy and robustness gains on CIFAR 10,
CIFAR10-LT, and TinyImageNet.]]></summary>

distributions whose densities are known up to a normalizing constant. In
particular, there is strong interest in unadjusted Langevin algorithms (ULA),
which directly discretize Langevin dynamics to estimate expectations over the
target distribution. We study the use of transport maps that approximately
normalize a target distribution as a way to precondition and accelerate the
convergence of Langevin dynamics. We show that in continuous time, when a
transport map is applied to Langevin dynamics, the result is a Riemannian
manifold Langevin dynamics (RMLD) with metric defined by the transport map. We
also show that applying a transport map to an irreversibly-perturbed ULA
results in a geometry-informed irreversible perturbation (GiIrr) of the
original dynamics. These connections suggest more systematic ways of learning
metrics and perturbations, and also yield alternative discretizations of the
RMLD described by the map, which we study. Under appropriate conditions, these
discretized processes can be endowed with non-asymptotic bounds describing
convergence to the target distribution in 2-Wasserstein distance. Illustrative
numerical results complement our theoretical claims.]]></summary>

learning policies without active interactions, making it especially appealing
for autonomous driving tasks. Recent successes of Transformers inspire casting
offline RL as sequence modeling, which performs well in long-horizon tasks.
However, they are overly optimistic in stochastic environments with incorrect
assumptions that the same goal can be consistently achieved by identical
actions. In this paper, we introduce an UNcertainty-awaRE deciSion Transformer
(UNREST) for planning in stochastic driving environments without introducing
additional transition or complex generative models. Specifically, UNREST
estimates state uncertainties by the conditional mutual information between
transitions and returns, and segments sequences accordingly. Discovering the
`uncertainty accumulation' and `temporal locality' properties of driving
environments, UNREST replaces the global returns in decision transformers with
less uncertain truncated returns, to learn from true outcomes of agent actions
rather than environment transitions. We also dynamically evaluate environmental
uncertainty during inference for cautious planning. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate UNREST's superior performance in various driving scenarios
and the power of our uncertainty estimation strategy.]]></summary>

explanation methods (like LIME and SHAP) have led to the rise of model-precise

theoretically sound and rigorous, abductive explanations suffer from a major
issue -- there can be several valid abductive explanations for the same data

insufficient; on the other hand, providing all valid abductive explanations can
be incomprehensible due to their size. In this work, we solve this issue by
aggregating the many possible abductive explanations into feature importance
scores. We propose three aggregation methods: two based on power indices from
cooperative game theory and a third based on a well-known measure of causal
strength. We characterize these three methods axiomatically, showing that each
of them uniquely satisfies a set of desirable properties. We also evaluate them

storing factual knowledge within their parameters and achieving remarkable
results when fine-tuned for downstream natural language processing tasks.
Nonetheless, their capacity to access and manipulate knowledge with precision
remains constrained, resulting in performance disparities on
knowledge-intensive tasks when compared to task-specific architectures.
Additionally, the challenges of providing provenance for model decisions and
maintaining up-to-date world knowledge persist as open research frontiers. To
address these limitations, the integration of pre-trained models with
differentiable access mechanisms to explicit non-parametric memory emerges as a
promising solution. This survey delves into the realm of language models (LMs)
augmented with the ability to tap into external knowledge sources, including
external knowledge bases and search engines. While adhering to the standard
objective of predicting missing tokens, these augmented LMs leverage diverse,
possibly non-parametric external modules to augment their contextual processing
capabilities, departing from the conventional language modeling paradigm.
Through an exploration of current advancements in augmenting large language

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To leverage training data for the sufficient training of ML models from
multiple parties in a confidentiality-preserving way, various collaborative
distributed machine learning (CDML) system designs have been developed, for
example, to perform assisted learning, federated learning, and split learning.
CDML system designs show different traits, for example, high agent autonomy,
machine learning (ML) model confidentiality, and fault tolerance. Facing a wide
variety of CDML system designs with different traits, it is difficult for
developers to design CDML systems with traits that match use case requirements
in a targeted way. However, inappropriate CDML system designs may result in
CDML systems failing their envisioned purposes. We developed a CDML design
toolbox that can guide the development of CDML systems. Based on the CDML
design toolbox, we present CDML system archetypes with distinct key traits that
can support the design of CDML systems to meet use case requirements.]]></summary>

labeled images with instance masks and classifications, which is often
expensive to procure. Active learning addresses this challenge by striving for
optimum performance with minimal labeling cost by selecting the most
informative and representative images for labeling. Despite its potential,
active learning has been less explored in instance segmentation compared to
other tasks like image classification, which require less labeling. In this
study, we propose a post-hoc active learning algorithm that integrates
uncertainty-based sampling with diversity-based sampling. Our proposed
algorithm is not only simple and easy to implement, but it also delivers
superior performance on various datasets. Its practical application is
demonstrated on a real-world overhead imagery dataset, where it increases the
labeling efficiency fivefold.]]></summary>

which exhibit representation power through ensemble statistics, and also
tractable gradient descent dynamics. Ensemble averages of Renyi entropies are
expressed in terms of neural network correlators, and architectures that
exhibit volume-law entanglement are presented. A general framework is developed
for studying the gradient descent dynamics of neural network quantum states
(NNQS), using a quantum state neural tangent kernel (QS-NTK). For $\infty$-NNQS
the training dynamics is simplified, since the QS-NTK becomes deterministic and
constant. An analytic solution is derived for quantum state supervised
learning, which allows an $\infty$-NNQS to recover any target wavefunction.
Numerical experiments on finite and infinite NNQS in the transverse field Ising

$\infty$-NNQS opens up new opportunities for studying entanglement and training
dynamics in other physics applications, such as in finding ground states.]]></summary>

machine learning method for spatial/temporal regression. MPRS is a
non-parametric model which incorporates spatial or temporal correlations via
short-range, distance-dependent ``interactions'' without assuming a specific
form for the underlying probability distribution. Predictions are obtained by
means of a fully autonomous learning algorithm which employs equilibrium
conditional Monte Carlo simulations. MPRS is able to handle scattered data and
arbitrary spatial dimensions. We report tests on various synthetic and
real-word data in one, two and three dimensions which demonstrate that the MPRS
prediction performance (without parameter tuning) is competitive with standard
interpolation methods such as ordinary kriging and inverse distance weighting.
In particular, MPRS is a particularly effective gap-filling method for rough
and non-Gaussian data (e.g., daily precipitation time series). MPRS shows
superior computational efficiency and scalability for large samples. Massive
data sets involving millions of nodes can be processed in a few seconds on a

sizes, prompting practitioners to find new tuning methods using a proxy of
smaller networks. One such proposal uses $\mu$P parameterized networks, where
the optimal hyperparameters for small width networks transfer to networks with
arbitrarily large width. However, in this scheme, hyperparameters do not
transfer across depths. As a remedy, we study residual networks with a residual
branch scale of $1/\sqrt{\text{depth}}$ in combination with the $\mu$P
parameterization. We provide experiments demonstrating that residual
architectures including convolutional ResNets and Vision Transformers trained
with this parameterization exhibit transfer of optimal hyperparameters across
width and depth on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. Furthermore, our empirical findings
are supported and motivated by theory. Using recent developments in the
dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) description of neural network learning
dynamics, we show that this parameterization of ResNets admits a well-defined
feature learning joint infinite-width and infinite-depth limit and show
convergence of finite-size network dynamics towards this limit.]]></summary>

applies multiple univariate tests on the individual features, followed by
p-value adjustments. Such an approach suffers when the data carry numerous
features. A number of studies have shown that classification accuracy can be
seen as a proxy for two-sample testing. However, neither theoretical
foundations nor practical recipes have been proposed so far on how this
strategy could be extended to multidimensional paired-sample testing. In this
work, we put forward the idea that scoring functions can be produced by the
decision rules defined by the perpendicular bisecting hyperplanes of the line
segments connecting each pair of instances. Then, the optimal scoring function
can be obtained by the pseudomedian of those rules, which we estimate by
extending naturally the Hodges-Lehmann estimator. We accordingly propose a
framework of a two-step testing procedure. First, we estimate the bisecting
hyperplanes for each pair of instances and an aggregated rule derived through
the Hodges-Lehmann estimator. The paired samples are scored by this aggregated
rule to produce a unidimensional representation. Second, we perform a Wilcoxon
signed-rank test on the obtained representation. Our experiments indicate that
our approach has substantial performance gains in testing accuracy compared to
the traditional multivariate and multiple testing, while at the same time
estimates each feature's contribution to the final result.]]></summary>

have made large-scale protein structures accessible, paving the way for machine
learning-based functional annotations.The field of geometric deep learning
focuses on creating methods working on geometric data. An essential aspect of
learning from protein structures is representing these structures as a
geometric object (be it a grid, graph, or surface) and applying a learning
method tailored to this representation. The performance of a given approach
will then depend on both the representation and its corresponding learning
method.

In this paper, we investigate representing proteins as $\textit{3D mesh
surfaces}$ and incorporate them into an established representation benchmark.
Our first finding is that despite promising preliminary results, the surface
representation alone does not seem competitive with 3D grids. Building on this,
we introduce a synergistic approach, combining surface representations with
graph-based methods, resulting in a general framework that incorporates both
representations in learning. We show that using this combination, we are able
to obtain state-of-the-art results across $\textit{all tested tasks}$. Our code

stressful task for drivers that can be mitigated by systems that know in
advance the nearest parking space available.

To this end, image-based systems offer cost advantages over other
sensor-based alternatives (e.g., ultrasonic sensors), requiring less physical
infrastructure for installation and maintenance.

Despite recent deep learning advances, deploying intelligent parking
monitoring is still a challenge since most approaches involve collecting and
labeling large amounts of data, which is laborious and time-consuming. Our
study aims to uncover the challenges in creating a global framework, trained
using publicly available labeled parking lot images, that performs accurately
across diverse scenarios, enabling the parking space monitoring as a
ready-to-use system to deploy in a new environment. Through exhaustive
experiments involving different datasets and deep learning architectures,
including fusion strategies and ensemble methods, we found that models trained
on diverse datasets can achieve 95\% accuracy without the burden of data
annotation and model training on the target parking lot]]></summary>

with a backbone and produce both semantic predictions and segmentation slices.
The segmentation slices are used to perform majority voting on the predictions.
The network is trained to assign the most likely class label of a segment to
its pixels, learning the concept of farmlands rather than analyzing
constitutive pixels separately. We evaluate our method using images from the
National Agriculture Imagery Program. Our method achieved an average accuracy

Existing imitation learning (IL) approaches for robots still grapple with

challenge can be addressed within the human cognitive priors. Heuristically, we
extend the usual notion of action to a dual Cognition (high-level)-Action

propose a novel skill IL framework through human-robot interaction, called
Cognition-Action-based Skill Imitation Learning (CasIL), for the robotic agent
to effectively cognize and imitate the critical skills from raw visual
demonstrations. CasIL enables both cognition and action imitation, while
high-level skill cognition explicitly guides low-level primitive actions,
providing robustness and reliability to the entire skill IL process. We
evaluated our method on MuJoCo and RLBench benchmarks, as well as on the
obstacle avoidance and point-goal navigation tasks for quadrupedal robot
locomotion. Experimental results show that our CasIL consistently achieves

entities and relations of a given graph by mapping them into a vector space.
Although the majority of these methods focus on static knowledge graphs, a
large number of publicly available KGs contain temporal information stating the
time instant/period over which a certain fact has been true. Such graphs are
often known as temporal knowledge graphs. Furthermore, knowledge graphs may
also contain textual descriptions of entities and relations. Both temporal
information and textual descriptions are not taken into account during
representation learning by static KGC methods, and only structural information
of the graph is leveraged. Recently, some studies have used temporal
information to improve link prediction, yet they do not exploit textual
descriptions and do not support inductive inference (prediction on entities
that have not been seen in training).

We propose a novel framework called TEMT that exploits the power of
pre-trained language models (PLMs) for text-enhanced temporal knowledge graph
completion. The knowledge stored in the parameters of a PLM allows TEMT to
produce rich semantic representations of facts and to generalize on previously
unseen entities. TEMT leverages textual and temporal information available in a
KG, treats them separately, and fuses them to get plausibility scores of facts.
Unlike previous approaches, TEMT effectively captures dependencies across
different time points and enables predictions on unseen entities. To assess the
performance of TEMT, we carried out several experiments including time interval
prediction, both in transductive and inductive settings, and triple
classification. The experimental results show that TEMT is competitive with the
state-of-the-art.]]></summary>

function optimization tasks, requires practitioners to carefully select priors
that well model their functions of interest. Rather than specifying by hand,
researchers have investigated transfer learning based methods to automatically
learn the priors, e.g. multi-task BO (Swersky et al., 2013), few-shot BO
(Wistuba and Grabocka, 2021) and HyperBO (Wang et al., 2022). However, those
prior learning methods typically assume that the input domains are the same for
all tasks, weakening their ability to use observations on functions with
different domains or generalize the learned priors to BO on different search
spaces. In this work, we present HyperBO+: a pre-training approach for
hierarchical Gaussian processes that enables the same prior to work universally
for Bayesian optimization on functions with different domains. We propose a
two-step pre-training method and analyze its appealing asymptotic properties
and benefits to BO both theoretically and empirically. On real-world

applications in various fields of artificial intelligence, including natural

heavy syntactic preprocessing and syntax-dependent network architecture make
them impracticable on larger and real-world data sets. In this paper, we

Specifically, we introduce the self-attention mechanism into quantum neural

as a sensible quantum version of self-attention. As a result, QSANN is
effective and scalable on larger data sets and has the desirable property of
being implementable on near-term quantum devices. In particular, our QSANN
outperforms the best existing QNLP model based on syntactic analysis as well as
a simple classical self-attention neural network in numerical experiments of

prostate cancer discovery", a feedforward neural network with biologically
informed, sparse connections (P-NET) was presented to model the state of
prostate cancer. We verified the reproducibility of the study conducted by
Elmarakeby et al., using both their original codebase, and our own
re-implementation using more up-to-date libraries. We quantified the
contribution of network sparsification by Reactome biological pathways, and
confirmed its importance to P-NET's superior performance. Furthermore, we
explored alternative neural architectures and approaches to incorporating
biological information into the networks. We experimented with three types of
graph neural networks on the same training data, and investigated the clinical
prediction agreement between different models. Our analyses demonstrated that
deep neural networks with distinct architectures make incorrect predictions for
individual patient that are persistent across different initializations of a
specific neural architecture. This suggests that different neural architectures
are sensitive to different aspects of the data, an important yet under-explored
challenge for clinical prediction tasks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graphon estimation has been one of the most fundamental problems in network
analysis and has received considerable attention in the past decade. From the
statistical perspective, the minimax error rate of graphon estimation has been
established by Gao et al (2015) for both stochastic block model (SBM) and
nonparametric graphon estimation. The statistical optimal estimators are based
on constrained least squares and have computational complexity exponential in
the dimension. From the computational perspective, the best-known
polynomial-time estimator is based on universal singular value thresholding
(USVT), but it can only achieve a much slower estimation error rate than the
minimax one. It is natural to wonder if such a gap is essential. The
computational optimality of the USVT or the existence of a computational
barrier in graphon estimation has been a long-standing open problem. In this
work, we take the first step towards it and provide rigorous evidence for the
computational barrier in graphon estimation via low-degree polynomials.
Specifically, in both SBM and nonparametric graphon estimation, we show that
for low-degree polynomial estimators, their estimation error rates cannot be
significantly better than that of the USVT under a wide range of parameter
regimes. Our results are proved based on the recent development of low-degree
polynomials by Schramm and Wein (2022), while we overcome a few key challenges
in applying it to the general graphon estimation problem. By leveraging our
main results, we also provide a computational lower bound on the clustering
error for community detection in SBM with a growing number of communities and
this yields a new piece of evidence for the conjectured Kesten-Stigum threshold
for efficient community recovery.]]></summary>

biomedical literature to answer timely and disease-specific questions. During
the early days of the pandemic, one of the biggest challenges we faced was the
lack of peer-reviewed biomedical articles on COVID-19 that could be used to
train machine learning models for question answering (QA). In this paper, we
explore the roles weak supervision and data augmentation play in training deep
neural network QA models. First, we investigate whether labels generated
automatically from the structured abstracts of scholarly papers using an
information retrieval algorithm, BM25, provide a weak supervision signal to
train an extractive QA model. We also curate new QA pairs using information
retrieval techniques, guided by the clinicaltrials.gov schema and the
structured abstracts of articles, in the absence of annotated data from
biomedical domain experts. Furthermore, we explore augmenting the training data
of a deep neural network model with linguistic features from external sources
such as lexical databases to account for variations in word morphology and
meaning. To better utilize our training data, we apply curriculum learning to
domain adaptation, fine-tuning our QA model in stages based on characteristics
of the QA pairs. We evaluate our methods in the context of QA models at the
core of a system to answer questions about COVID-19.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common cardiac
arrhythmias that affects millions of people each year worldwide and it is
closely linked to increased risk of cardiovascular diseases such as stroke and
heart failure. Machine learning methods have shown promising results in
evaluating the risk of developing atrial fibrillation from the
electrocardiogram. We aim to develop and evaluate one such algorithm on a large
CODE dataset collected in Brazil.

Results: The deep neural network model identified patients without indication
of AF in the presented ECG but who will develop AF in the future with an AUC
score of 0.845. From our survival model, we obtain that patients in the
high-risk group (i.e. with the probability of a future AF case being greater
than 0.7) are 50% more likely to develop AF within 40 weeks, while patients
belonging to the minimal-risk group (i.e. with the probability of a future AF
case being less than or equal to 0.1) have more than 85% chance of remaining AF
free up until after seven years.

Conclusion: We developed and validated a model for AF risk prediction. If
applied in clinical practice, the model possesses the potential of providing
valuable and useful information in decision-making and patient management
processes.]]></summary>

in neuroscience. While spontaneous reactivation of memories during sleep in
rodents is known to support memory consolidation and offline learning,
capturing memory replay in humans is challenging due to the absence of
well-annotated sleep datasets and the substantial differences in neural
patterns between wakefulness and sleep. To address these challenges, we
designed a novel cognitive neuroscience experiment and collected a
comprehensive, well-annotated electroencephalography (EEG) dataset from 52
subjects during both wakefulness and sleep. Leveraging this benchmark dataset,
we developed the Universal Sleep Decoder (USD) to align neural representations
between wakefulness and sleep across subjects. Our model achieves up to 16.6%
top-1 zero-shot accuracy on unseen subjects, comparable to decoding
performances using individual sleep data. Furthermore, fine-tuning USD on test
subjects enhances decoding accuracy to 25.9% top-1 accuracy, a substantial
improvement over the baseline chance of 6.7%. Model comparison and ablation
analyses reveal that our design choices, including the use of (i) an additional
contrastive objective to integrate awake and sleep neural signals and (ii) the
pretrain-finetune paradigm to incorporate different subjects, significantly
contribute to these performances. Collectively, our findings and methodologies
represent a significant advancement in the field of sleep decoding.]]></summary>

particularly for in-situ exploration and sampling to stand in for human
explorers. Currently, humans drive robots to meet scientific objectives, but
depending on the robot's location, the exchange of information and driving
commands between the human operator and robot may cause undue delays in mission
fulfillment. An autonomous robot encoded with a scientific objective and an
exploration strategy incurs no communication delays and can fulfill missions
more quickly. Active learning algorithms offer this capability of intelligent
exploration, but the underlying model structure varies the performance of the
active learning algorithm in accurately forming an understanding of the
environment. In this paper, we investigate the performance differences between
active learning algorithms driven by Gaussian processes or Bayesian neural
networks for exploration strategies encoded on agents that are constrained in
their trajectories, like planetary surface rovers. These two active learning
strategies were tested in a simulation environment against science-blind
strategies to predict the spatial distribution of a variable of interest along
multiple datasets. The performance metrics of interest are model accuracy in
root mean squared (RMS) error, training time, model convergence, total distance
traveled until convergence, and total samples until convergence. Active
learning strategies encoded with Gaussian processes require less computation to
train, converge to an accurate model more quickly, and propose trajectories of
shorter distance, except in a few complex environments in which Bayesian neural
networks achieve a more accurate model in the large data regime due to their
more expressive functional bases. The paper concludes with advice on when and
how to implement either exploration strategy for future space missions.]]></summary>

by enabling direct material joining and offers several advantages such as
cost-effective manufacturing of complex parts, reducing manufacturing waste,
and opening new possibilities for manufacturing automation. One group of
materials for which additive manufacturing holds great potential for enhancing
component performance and properties is Functionally Graded Materials (FGMs).
FGMs are advanced composite materials that exhibit smoothly varying properties
making them desirable for applications in aerospace, automobile, biomedical,
and defense industries. Such composition differs from traditional composite
materials, since the location-dependent composition changes gradually in FGMs,
leading to enhanced properties. Recently, machine learning techniques have
emerged as a promising means for fabrication of FGMs through optimizing
processing parameters, improving product quality, and detecting manufacturing
defects. This paper first provides a brief literature review of works related
to FGM fabrication, followed by reviewing works on employing machine learning
in additive manufacturing, Afterward, we provide an overview of published works
in the literature related to the application of machine learning methods in
Directed Energy Deposition and for fabrication of FGMs.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent advances in federated learning (FL) enable collaborative training of
machine learning (ML) models from large-scale and widely dispersed clients
while protecting their privacy. However, when different clients' datasets are
heterogeneous, traditional FL mechanisms produce a global model that does not
adequately represent the poorer clients with limited data resources, resulting
in lower accuracy and higher bias on their local data. According to the Matthew
effect, which describes how the advantaged gain more advantage and the
disadvantaged lose more over time, deploying such a global model in client
applications may worsen the resource disparity among the clients and harm the
principles of social welfare and fairness. To mitigate the Matthew effect, we
propose Egalitarian Fairness Federated Learning (EFFL), where egalitarian
fairness refers to the global model learned from FL has: (1) equal accuracy
among clients; (2) equal decision bias among clients. Besides achieving
egalitarian fairness among the clients, EFFL also aims for performance
optimality, minimizing the empirical risk loss and the bias for each client;
both are essential for any ML model training, whether centralized or
decentralized. We formulate EFFL as a constrained multi-constrained
multi-objectives optimization (MCMOO) problem, with the decision bias and
egalitarian fairness as constraints and the minimization of the empirical risk
losses on all clients as multiple objectives to be optimized. We propose a
gradient-based three-stage algorithm to obtain the Pareto optimal solutions
within the constraint space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EFFL
outperforms other state-of-the-art FL algorithms in achieving a
high-performance global model with enhanced egalitarian fairness among all
clients.]]></summary>

neural networks, integrating uncertainty estimation into their predictive
capabilities.

This comprehensive primer presents a systematic introduction to the

associated with training and inference in BNNs.

Furthermore, we explore advanced topics within the realm of BNN research,
acknowledging the existence of ongoing debates and controversies. By offering
insights into cutting-edge developments, this primer not only equips
researchers and practitioners with a solid foundation in BNNs, but also
illuminates the potential applications of this dynamic field. As a valuable

specific tasks have created a strong interest in model reuse and composition. A
key challenge in composing iterative generative processes, such as GFlowNets
and diffusion models, is that to realize the desired target distribution, all
steps of the generative process need to be coordinated, and satisfy delicate
balance conditions. In this work, we propose Compositional Sculpting: a general
approach for defining compositions of iterative generative processes. We then
introduce a method for sampling from these compositions built on classifier
guidance. We showcase ways to accomplish compositional sculpting in both
GFlowNets and diffusion models. We highlight two binary operations
$\unicode{x2014}$ the harmonic mean ($p_1 \otimes p_2$) and the contrast ($p_1
\unicode{x25D1}\,p_2$) between pairs, and the generalization of these
operations to multiple component distributions. We offer empirical results on
image and molecular generation tasks.]]></summary>

data dimensions. When applying Copulas, we can estimate multivariate
distribution functions by initially estimating independent marginals, an easy
task, and then a single copulating function, $C$, to connect the marginals, a
hard task. For two-dimensional data, a copula is a two-increasing function of
the form $C: (u,v)\in \mathbf{I}^2 \rightarrow \mathbf{I}$, where $\mathbf{I} =
[0, 1]$. In this paper, we show how Neural Networks (NNs) can approximate any
two-dimensional copula non-parametrically. Our approach, denoted as 2-Cats, is
inspired by the Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Sobolev Training
literature. Not only do we show that we can estimate the output of a 2d Copula
better than the state-of-the-art, our approach is non-parametric and respects
the mathematical properties of a Copula $C$.]]></summary>

classification models using labeled and unlabeled datasets. However, existing
SSL methods rely on a large unlabeled dataset, which may not always be
available in many real-world applications due to legal constraints (e.g.,
GDPR). In this paper, we investigate the research question: Can we train SSL
models without real unlabeled datasets? Instead of using real unlabeled
datasets, we propose an SSL method using synthetic datasets generated from
generative foundation models trained on datasets containing millions of samples
in diverse domains (e.g., ImageNet). Our main concepts are identifying
synthetic samples that emulate unlabeled samples from generative foundation
models and training classifiers using these synthetic samples. To achieve this,
our method is formulated as an alternating optimization problem: (i)
meta-learning of generative foundation models and (ii) SSL of classifiers using
real labeled and synthetic unlabeled samples. For (i), we propose a
meta-learning objective that optimizes latent variables to generate samples
that resemble real labeled samples and minimize the validation loss. For (ii),
we propose a simple unsupervised loss function that regularizes the feature
extractors of classifiers to maximize the performance improvement obtained from
synthetic samples. We confirm that our method outperforms baselines using
generative foundation models on SSL. We also demonstrate that our methods
outperform SSL using real unlabeled datasets in scenarios with extremely small
amounts of labeled datasets. This suggests that synthetic samples have the
potential to provide improvement gains more efficiently than real unlabeled
data.]]></summary>

method, which makes sequential decisions based on a Bayesian model, typically a
Gaussian process (GP), of the function. To ensure the quality of the model,
transfer learning approaches have been developed to automatically design GP
priors by learning from observations on "training" functions. These training
functions are typically required to have the same domain as the "test" function
(black-box function to be optimized). In this paper, we introduce MPHD, a model
pre-training method on heterogeneous domains, which uses a neural net mapping
from domain-specific contexts to specifications of hierarchical GPs. MPHD can
be seamlessly integrated with BO to transfer knowledge across heterogeneous

of MPHD and its superior performance on challenging black-box function

opportunities for artificial general intelligence but concurrently amplify
safety concerns, such as potential misuse of AI systems, necessitating
effective AI alignment. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has
emerged as a promising pathway towards AI alignment but brings forth challenges
due to its complexity and dependence on a separate reward model. Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed as an alternative, and it
remains equivalent to RLHF under the reverse KL regularization constraint. This
paper presents $f$-DPO, a generalized approach to DPO by incorporating diverse
divergence constraints. We show that under certain $f$-divergences, including
Jensen-Shannon divergence, forward KL divergences and $\alpha$-divergences, the
complex relationship between the reward and optimal policy can also be
simplified by addressing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. This eliminates the
need for estimating the normalizing constant in the Bradley-Terry model and
enables a tractable mapping between the reward function and the optimal policy.
Our approach optimizes LLMs to align with human preferences in a more efficient
and supervised manner under a broad set of divergence constraints. Empirically,
adopting these divergences ensures a balance between alignment performance and
generation diversity. Importantly, $f$-DPO outperforms PPO-based methods in
divergence efficiency, and divergence constraints directly influence expected
calibration error (ECE).]]></summary>

medical field to manufacturing and wireless communication. Generating realistic
and useful exemplars and prototypes is a fundamental data analysis task. In
this paper, we investigate a novel approach to generating realistic and useful
exemplars and prototypes for time series data. Our approach uses a new form of
time series average, the ShapeDTW Barycentric Average. We therefore turn our
attention to accurately generating time series prototypes with a novel
approach. The existing time series prototyping approaches rely on the Dynamic
Time Warping (DTW) similarity measure such as DTW Barycentering Average (DBA)
and SoftDBA. These last approaches suffer from a common problem of generating
out-of-distribution artifacts in their prototypes. This is mostly caused by the
DTW variant used and its incapability of detecting neighborhood similarities,
instead it detects absolute similarities. Our proposed method, ShapeDBA, uses
the ShapeDTW variant of DTW, that overcomes this issue. We chose time series
clustering, a popular form of time series analysis to evaluate the outcome of
ShapeDBA compared to the other prototyping approaches. Coupled with the k-means
clustering algorithm, and evaluated on a total of 123 datasets from the UCR
archive, our proposed averaging approach is able to achieve new

domains, but their widespread applicability is hindered by inherent limitations
such as overconfidence in predictions, lack of interpretability, and
vulnerability to adversarial attacks. To address these challenges, Bayesian
neural networks (BNNs) have emerged as a compelling extension of conventional
neural networks, integrating uncertainty estimation into their predictive
capabilities.

This comprehensive primer presents a systematic introduction to the
fundamental concepts of neural networks and Bayesian inference, elucidating
their synergistic integration for the development of BNNs. The target audience
comprises statisticians with a potential background in Bayesian methods but
lacking deep learning expertise, as well as machine learners proficient in deep
neural networks but with limited exposure to Bayesian statistics. We provide an
overview of commonly employed priors, examining their impact on model behavior
and performance. Additionally, we delve into the practical considerations
associated with training and inference in BNNs.

Furthermore, we explore advanced topics within the realm of BNN research,
acknowledging the existence of ongoing debates and controversies. By offering
insights into cutting-edge developments, this primer not only equips
researchers and practitioners with a solid foundation in BNNs, but also
illuminates the potential applications of this dynamic field. As a valuable

applies multiple univariate tests on the individual features, followed by
p-value adjustments. Such an approach suffers when the data carry numerous
features. A number of studies have shown that classification accuracy can be
seen as a proxy for two-sample testing. However, neither theoretical
foundations nor practical recipes have been proposed so far on how this
strategy could be extended to multidimensional paired-sample testing. In this
work, we put forward the idea that scoring functions can be produced by the
decision rules defined by the perpendicular bisecting hyperplanes of the line
segments connecting each pair of instances. Then, the optimal scoring function
can be obtained by the pseudomedian of those rules, which we estimate by
extending naturally the Hodges-Lehmann estimator. We accordingly propose a
framework of a two-step testing procedure. First, we estimate the bisecting
hyperplanes for each pair of instances and an aggregated rule derived through
the Hodges-Lehmann estimator. The paired samples are scored by this aggregated
rule to produce a unidimensional representation. Second, we perform a Wilcoxon
signed-rank test on the obtained representation. Our experiments indicate that
our approach has substantial performance gains in testing accuracy compared to
the traditional multivariate and multiple testing, while at the same time
estimates each feature's contribution to the final result.]]></summary>

batch of data lacking exhaustive exploration. Worst-case optimality algorithms,
which calibrate a value-function model class from logged experience and perform
some type of pessimistic evaluation under the learned model, have emerged as a
promising paradigm for batch RL. However, contemporary works on this stream
have commonly overlooked the hierarchical decision-making structure hidden in
the optimization landscape. In this paper, we adopt a game-theoretical
viewpoint and model the policy learning diagram as a two-player general-sum
game with a leader-follower structure. We propose a novel stochastic
gradient-based learning algorithm: StackelbergLearner, in which the leader
player updates according to the total derivative of its objective instead of
the usual individual gradient, and the follower player makes individual updates
and ensures transition-consistent pessimistic reasoning. The derived learning
dynamic naturally lends StackelbergLearner to a game-theoretic interpretation
and provides a convergence guarantee to differentiable Stackelberg equilibria.
From a theoretical standpoint, we provide instance-dependent regret bounds with
general function approximation, which shows that our algorithm can learn a
best-effort policy that is able to compete against any comparator policy that
is covered by batch data. Notably, our theoretical regret guarantees only
require realizability without any data coverage and strong function
approximation conditions, e.g., Bellman closedness, which is in contrast to
prior works lacking such guarantees. Through comprehensive experiments, we find
that our algorithm consistently performs as well or better as compared to
state-of-the-art methods in batch RL benchmark and real-world datasets.]]></summary>

inpainting models that can produce high-quality, plausible image content in
unknown regions, but the content these models hallucinate is necessarily
inauthentic, since the models lack sufficient context about the true scene. In
this work, we propose RealFill, a novel generative approach for image
completion that fills in missing regions of an image with the content that
should have been there. RealFill is a generative inpainting model that is
personalized using only a few reference images of a scene. These reference
images do not have to be aligned with the target image, and can be taken with
drastically varying viewpoints, lighting conditions, camera apertures, or image
styles. Once personalized, RealFill is able to complete a target image with
visually compelling contents that are faithful to the original scene. We
evaluate RealFill on a new image completion benchmark that covers a set of
diverse and challenging scenarios, and find that it outperforms existing
approaches by a large margin. See more results on our project page:

been developed to highlight the edges and nodes in the graph that contribute
the most to the model predictions. However, it is not clear yet how to evaluate
the correctness of those explanations, whether it is from a human or a model
perspective. One unaddressed bottleneck in the current evaluation procedure is
the problem of out-of-distribution explanations, whose distribution differs
from those of the training data. This important issue affects existing
evaluation metrics such as the popular faithfulness or fidelity score. In this
paper, we show the limitations of faithfulness metrics. We propose GInX-Eval
(Graph In-distribution eXplanation Evaluation), an evaluation procedure of
graph explanations that overcomes the pitfalls of faithfulness and offers new
insights on explainability methods. Using a retraining strategy, the GInX score
measures how informative removed edges are for the model and the EdgeRank score
evaluates if explanatory edges are correctly ordered by their importance.
GInX-Eval verifies if ground-truth explanations are instructive to the GNN
model. In addition, it shows that many popular methods, including
gradient-based methods, produce explanations that are not better than a random
designation of edges as important subgraphs, challenging the findings of
current works in the area. Results with GInX-Eval are consistent across
multiple datasets and align with human evaluation.]]></summary>

where two positive views generated through data augmentation are made similar
by an attraction force in a data representation space, while a repulsive force
makes them far from negative examples. Non-contrastive learning, represented by
BYOL and SimSiam, further gets rid of negative examples and improves
computational efficiency. While learned representations may collapse into a
single point due to the lack of the repulsive force at first sight, Tian et al.
(2021) revealed through the learning dynamics analysis that the representations
can avoid collapse if data augmentation is sufficiently stronger than
regularization. However, their analysis does not take into account
commonly-used feature normalization, a normalizer before measuring the
similarity of representations, and hence excessively strong regularization may
collapse the dynamics, which is an unnatural behavior under the presence of
feature normalization. Therefore, we extend the previous theory based on the L2
loss by considering the cosine loss, which involves feature normalization. We
show that the cosine loss induces sixth-order dynamics (while the L2 loss
induces a third-order one), in which a stable equilibrium dynamically emerges
even if there are only collapsed solutions with given initial parameters. Thus,
we offer a new understanding that feature normalization plays an important role
in robustly preventing the dynamics collapse.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In representation learning, regression has traditionally received less
attention than classification. Directly applying representation learning
techniques designed for classification to regression often results in
fragmented representations in the latent space, yielding sub-optimal
performance. In this paper, we argue that the potential of contrastive learning
for regression has been overshadowed due to the neglect of two crucial aspects:
ordinality-awareness and hardness. To address these challenges, we advocate
"mixup your own contrastive pairs for supervised contrastive regression",
instead of relying solely on real/augmented samples. Specifically, we propose
Supervised Contrastive Learning for Regression with Mixup (SupReMix). It takes
anchor-inclusive mixtures (mixup of the anchor and a distinct negative sample)
as hard negative pairs and anchor-exclusive mixtures (mixup of two distinct
negative samples) as hard positive pairs at the embedding level. This strategy
formulates harder contrastive pairs by integrating richer ordinal information.
Through extensive experiments on six regression datasets including 2D images,
volumetric images, text, tabular data, and time-series signals, coupled with
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that SupReMix pre-training fosters
continuous ordered representations of regression data, resulting in significant
improvement in regression performance. Furthermore, SupReMix is superior to
other approaches in a range of regression challenges including transfer
learning, imbalanced training data, and scenarios with fewer training samples.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Standard practice within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
involves optimizing against a Reward Model (RM), which itself is trained to
reflect human preferences for desirable generations. A notable subject that is
understudied is the (in-)consistency of RMs -- whether they can recognize the
semantic changes to different prompts and appropriately adapt their reward
assignments -- and their impact on the downstream RLHF model.

In this paper, we visit a series of research questions relevant to RM
inconsistency: (1) How can we measure the consistency of reward models? (2) How
consistent are the existing RMs and how can we improve them? (3) In what ways
does reward inconsistency influence the chatbots resulting from the RLHF model
training?

We propose Contrast Instructions -- a benchmarking strategy for the
consistency of RM. Each example in Contrast Instructions features a pair of
lexically similar instructions with different ground truth responses. A
consistent RM is expected to rank the corresponding instruction and response
higher than other combinations. We observe that current RMs trained with the
standard ranking objective fail miserably on Contrast Instructions compared to
average humans. To show that RM consistency can be improved efficiently without
using extra training budget, we propose two techniques ConvexDA and
RewardFusion, which enhance reward consistency through extrapolation during the
RM training and inference stage, respectively. We show that RLHF models trained
with a more consistent RM yield more useful responses, suggesting that reward
inconsistency exhibits a trickle-down effect on the downstream RLHF process.]]></summary>

systems (CPS). However, due to the increasing complexity of attacks and CPS
themselves, anomaly detection in CPS is becoming more and more challenging. In
our previous work, we proposed a digital twin-based anomaly detection method,
called ATTAIN, which takes advantage of both historical and real-time data of
CPS. However, such data vary significantly in terms of difficulty. Therefore,
similar to human learning processes, deep learning models (e.g., ATTAIN) can
benefit from an easy-to-difficult curriculum. To this end, in this paper, we
present a novel approach, named digitaL twin-based Anomaly deTecTion wIth
Curriculum lEarning (LATTICE), which extends ATTAIN by introducing curriculum
learning to optimize its learning paradigm. LATTICE attributes each sample with
a difficulty score, before being fed into a training scheduler. The training
scheduler samples batches of training data based on these difficulty scores
such that learning from easy to difficult data can be performed. To evaluate
LATTICE, we use five publicly available datasets collected from five real-world
CPS testbeds. We compare LATTICE with ATTAIN and two other state-of-the-art
anomaly detectors. Evaluation results show that LATTICE outperforms the three
baselines and ATTAIN by 0.906%-2.367% in terms of the F1 score. LATTICE also,
on average, reduces the training time of ATTAIN by 4.2% on the five datasets
and is on par with the baselines in terms of detection delay time.]]></summary>

lesser known property of tree-based methods is that one can construct a
proximity matrix from the tree(s), and these proximity matrices are induced
kernels. While there has been extensive research on the applications and
properties of kernels, there is relatively little research on kernels induced
by decision forests. We construct Kernel Mean Embedding Random Forests (KMERF),
which induce kernels from random trees and/or forests using leaf-node
proximity. We introduce the notion of an asymptotically characteristic kernel,
and prove that KMERF kernels are asymptotically characteristic for both
discrete and continuous data. Because KMERF is data-adaptive, we suspected it
would outperform kernels selected a priori on finite sample data. We illustrate
that KMERF nearly dominates current state-of-the-art kernel-based tests across
a diverse range of high-dimensional two-sample and independence testing
settings. Furthermore, our forest-based approach is interpretable, and provides
feature importance metrics that readily distinguish important dimensions,
unlike other high-dimensional non-parametric testing procedures. Hence, this
work demonstrates the decision forest-based kernel can be more powerful and
more interpretable than existing methods, flying in the face of conventional
wisdom of the trade-off between the two.]]></summary>

of sparse features. Input sparsity makes obtaining high-quality embeddings for
rarely-occurring categories harder as their representations are updated
infrequently. We demonstrate a training-time technique to produce superior
embeddings via effective cross-category learning and theoretically explain its
surprising effectiveness. The scheme, termed the multi-layer embeddings
training (MLET), trains embeddings using factorization of the embedding layer,
with an inner dimension higher than the target embedding dimension. For
inference efficiency, MLET converts the trained two-layer embedding into a
single-layer one thus keeping inference-time model size unchanged.

Empirical superiority of MLET is puzzling as its search space is not larger
than that of the single-layer embedding. The strong dependence of MLET on the
inner dimension is even more surprising. We develop a theory that explains both
of these behaviors by showing that MLET creates an adaptive update mechanism
modulated by the singular vectors of embeddings. When tested on multiple
state-of-the-art recommendation models for click-through rate (CTR) prediction
tasks, MLET consistently produces better models, especially for rare items. At
constant model quality, MLET allows embedding dimension, and model size,
reduction by up to 16x, and 5.8x on average, across the models.]]></summary>

memory-limited, performant robots. Finding these smaller neural network
architectures can be time-consuming. We propose HyperPPO, an on-policy
reinforcement learning algorithm that utilizes graph hypernetworks to estimate
the weights of multiple neural architectures simultaneously. Our method
estimates weights for networks that are much smaller than those in common-use
networks yet encode highly performant policies. We obtain multiple trained
policies at the same time while maintaining sample efficiency and provide the
user the choice of picking a network architecture that satisfies their
computational constraints. We show that our method scales well - more training
resources produce faster convergence to higher-performing architectures. We
demonstrate that the neural policies estimated by HyperPPO are capable of
decentralized control of a Crazyflie2.1 quadrotor. Website:

of visual field (VF) progression based on unsupervised machine learning and to
discover factors associated with fast VF progression. Participants: A total of
3133 eyes of 1568 ocular hypertension treatment study (OHTS) participants with
at least five follow-up VF tests were included in the study. Methods: We used a
latent class mixed model (LCMM) to identify OHT subtypes using standard
automated perimetry (SAP) mean deviation (MD) trajectories. We characterized
the subtypes based on demographic, clinical, ocular, and VF factors at the
baseline. We then identified factors driving fast VF progression using
generalized estimating equation (GEE) and justified findings qualitatively and
quantitatively. Results: The LCMM model discovered four clusters (subtypes) of
eyes with different trajectories of MD worsening. The number of eyes in
clusters were 794 (25%), 1675 (54%), 531 (17%) and 133 (4%). We labelled the
clusters as Improvers, Stables, Slow progressors, and Fast progressors based on
their mean of MD decline, which were 0.08, -0.06, -0.21, and -0.45 dB/year,
respectively. Eyes with fast VF progression had higher baseline age,
intraocular pressure (IOP), pattern standard deviation (PSD) and refractive
error (RE), but lower central corneal thickness (CCT). Fast progression was
associated with calcium channel blockers, being male, heart disease history,
diabetes history, African American race, stroke history, and migraine
headaches.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This work proposes to measure the scope of a patent claim as the reciprocal
of the self-information contained in this claim. A probability of occurrence of
the claim is obtained from a language model and this probability is used to
compute the self-information. Grounded in information theory, this approach is
based on the assumption that an unlikely concept is more informative than a
usual concept, insofar as it is more surprising. In turn, the more surprising
the information required to defined the claim, the narrower its scope. Five
language models are considered, ranging from simplest models (each word or
character is assigned an identical probability) to intermediate models (using
average word or character frequencies), to a large language model (GPT2).
Interestingly, the scope resulting from the simplest language models is
proportional to the reciprocal of the number of words or characters involved in
the claim, a metric already used in previous works. Application is made to
multiple series of patent claims directed to distinct inventions, where each
series consists of claims devised to have a gradually decreasing scope. The
performance of the language models is assessed with respect to several ad hoc
tests. The more sophisticated the model, the better the results. I.e., the GPT2
probability model outperforms models based on word and character frequencies,
which themselves outdo the simplest models based on word or character counts.
Still, the character count appears to be a more reliable indicator than the
word count.]]></summary>

used make transformer-based model for training. It was found through previous

transformer-based methods from taking full advantage. The thousands of samples

objective of 6G. Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a potential paradigm,
facilitating decentralized AI model training across a diverse range of devices
under the coordination of a central server. However, several challenges hinder
its wide application in the 6G context, such as malicious attacks and privacy
snooping on local model updates, and centralization pitfalls. This work
proposes a trusted architecture for supporting FL, which utilizes Distributed
Ledger Technology (DLT) and Graph Neural Network (GNN), including three key
features. First, a pre-processing layer employing homomorphic encryption is
incorporated to securely aggregate local models, preserving the privacy of
individual models. Second, given the distributed nature and graph structure
between clients and nodes in the pre-processing layer, GNN is leveraged to
identify abnormal local models, enhancing system security. Third, DLT is
utilized to decentralize the system by selecting one of the candidates to
perform the central server's functions. Additionally, DLT ensures reliable data
management by recording data exchanges in an immutable and transparent ledger.
The feasibility of the novel architecture is validated through simulations,
demonstrating improved performance in anomalous model detection and global
model accuracy compared to relevant baselines.]]></summary>

empirical prediction risk. It can act as a regularizer, but fails to do so in
certain high-dimensional problems, and it may shift the double-descent peak of
an empirical risk. Overall, the analysis shows that several properties data
augmentation has been attributed with are not either true or false, but rather
depend on a combination of factors -- notably the data distribution, the
properties of the estimator, and the interplay of sample size, number of

be characterized using classical Gaussian processes. More flexible spatial
extremes models exhibit appealing extremal dependence properties but are often
exceedingly prohibitive to fit and simulate from in high dimensions. In this
paper, we develop a new spatial extremes model that has flexible and
non-stationary dependence properties, and we integrate it in the
encoding-decoding structure of a variational autoencoder (XVAE), whose
parameters are estimated via variational Bayes combined with deep learning. The
XVAE can be used as a spatio-temporal emulator that characterizes the
distribution of potential mechanistic model output states and produces outputs
that have the same statistical properties as the inputs, especially in the
tail. As an aside, our approach also provides a novel way of making fast
inference with complex extreme-value processes. Through extensive simulation
studies, we show that our XVAE is substantially more time-efficient than
traditional Bayesian inference while also outperforming many spatial extremes
models with a stationary dependence structure. To further demonstrate the
computational power of the XVAE, we analyze a high-resolution satellite-derived
dataset of sea surface temperature in the Red Sea, which includes 30 years of
daily measurements at 16703 grid cells. We find that the extremal dependence
strength is weaker in the interior of Red Sea and it has decreased slightly

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The well-known governing physics in science and engineering is often based on
certain assumptions and approximations. Therefore, analyses and designs carried
out based on these equations are also approximate. The emergence of data-driven
models has, to a certain degree, addressed this challenge; however, the purely
data-driven models often (a) lack interpretability, (b) are data-hungry, and
(c) do not generalize beyond the training window. Operator learning has
recently been proposed as a potential alternative to address the aforementioned
challenges; however, the challenges are still persistent. We here argue that
one of the possible solutions resides in data-physics fusion, where the
data-driven model is used to correct/identify the missing physics. To that end,
we propose a novel Differentiable Physics Augmented Wavelet Neural Operator
(DPA-WNO). The proposed DPA-WNO blends a differentiable physics solver with the
Wavelet Neural Operator (WNO), where the role of WNO is to model the missing
physics. This empowers the proposed framework to exploit the capability of WNO
to learn from data while retaining the interpretability and generalizability
associated with physics-based solvers. We illustrate the applicability of the
proposed approach in solving time-dependent uncertainty quantification problems
due to randomness in the initial condition. Four benchmark uncertainty
quantification and reliability analysis examples from various fields of science
and engineering are solved using the proposed approach. The results presented
illustrate interesting features of the proposed approach.]]></summary>

difference between the minimum expected loss in estimating a random variable
from an observed feature vector and the minimum expected loss in estimating the
same random variable from a transformation (statistic) of the feature vector.
After characterizing lossless transformations, i.e., transformations for which
the excess risk is zero for all loss functions, we construct a partitioning
test statistic for the hypothesis that a given transformation is lossless and
show that for i.i.d. data the test is strongly consistent. More generally, we
develop information-theoretic upper bounds on the excess risk that uniformly
hold over fairly general classes of loss functions. Based on these bounds, we
introduce the notion of a delta-lossless transformation and give sufficient
conditions for a given transformation to be universally delta-lossless.
Applications to classification, nonparametric regression, portfolio strategies,
information bottleneck, and deep learning, are also surveyed.]]></summary>

drug and materials discovery in a variety of tasks such as virtual screening
and inverse design. While there has been a surge of interest in advancing
model-centric techniques, the influence of both data quantity and quality on
molecular representations is not yet clearly understood within this field. In
this paper, we delve into the neural scaling behaviors of MRL from a
data-centric viewpoint, examining four key dimensions: (1) data modalities, (2)
dataset splitting, (3) the role of pre-training, and (4) model capacity. Our
empirical studies confirm a consistent power-law relationship between data
volume and MRL performance across these dimensions. Additionally, through
detailed analysis, we identify potential avenues for improving learning
efficiency. To challenge these scaling laws, we adapt seven popular data
pruning strategies to molecular data and benchmark their performance. Our
findings underline the importance of data-centric MRL and highlight possible

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Provenance graphs are structured audit logs that describe the history of a
system's execution. Recent studies have explored a variety of techniques to
analyze provenance graphs for automated host intrusion detection, focusing
particularly on advanced persistent threats. Sifting through their design
documents, we identify four common dimensions that drive the development of
provenance-based intrusion detection systems (PIDSes): scope (can PIDSes detect
modern attacks that infiltrate across application boundaries?), attack
agnosticity (can PIDSes detect novel attacks without a priori knowledge of
attack characteristics?), timeliness (can PIDSes efficiently monitor host
systems as they run?), and attack reconstruction (can PIDSes distill attack
activity from large provenance graphs so that sysadmins can easily understand
and quickly respond to system intrusion?). We present KAIROS, the first PIDS
that simultaneously satisfies the desiderata in all four dimensions, whereas
existing approaches sacrifice at least one and struggle to achieve comparable
detection performance.

Kairos leverages a novel graph neural network-based encoder-decoder
architecture that learns the temporal evolution of a provenance graph's
structural changes to quantify the degree of anomalousness for each system
event. Then, based on this fine-grained information, Kairos reconstructs attack
footprints, generating compact summary graphs that accurately describe
malicious activity over a stream of system audit logs. Using state-of-the-art
benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that Kairos outperforms previous approaches.]]></summary>

One example of this is the problem of algorithmic collusion and market
fairness. The negative consequences of algorithmic collusion affect all
consumers, not only particular members of a protected class. Drawing on this
case study, I propose an ethical framework for researchers and practitioners in
machine learning seeking to develop and apply fairness metrics that extends to

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In root finding and optimization, there are many cases where there is a
closed set $A$ one likes that the sequence constructed by one's favourite
method will not converge to A (here, we do not assume extra properties on $A$
such as being convex or connected). For example, if one wants to find roots,
and one chooses initial points in the basin of attraction for 1 root $x^*$ (a
fact which one may not know before hand), then one will always end up in that
root. In this case, one would like to have a mechanism to avoid this point
$z^*$ in the next runs of one's algorithm.

In this paper, we propose two new methods aiming to achieve this. In the
first method, we divide the cost function by an appropriate power of the
distance function to $A$. This idea is inspired by how one would try to find
all roots of a function in 1 variable. In the second method, which is more
suitable for constrained optimization, we redefine the value of the function to
be a big constant on $A$. We also propose, based on this, an algorithm to
escape the basin of attraction of a component of positive dimension to reach
another component. As an application, we prove a rigorous guarantee for finding
roots of a meromorphic function of 1 complex variable in a given domain.

Along the way, we compare with main existing relevant methods in the current
literature. We provide several examples in various different settings to
illustrate the usefulness of the new approach.]]></summary>

dexterity, referred to as non-prehensile manipulation. Non-prehensile
manipulation may enable more complex interactions with the objects, but also
presents challenges in reasoning about gripper-object interactions. In this
work, we introduce Hybrid Actor-Critic Maps for Manipulation (HACMan), a
reinforcement learning approach for 6D non-prehensile manipulation of objects
using point cloud observations. HACMan proposes a temporally-abstracted and
spatially-grounded object-centric action representation that consists of
selecting a contact location from the object point cloud and a set of motion
parameters describing how the robot will move after making contact. We modify
an existing off-policy RL algorithm to learn in this hybrid discrete-continuous
action representation. We evaluate HACMan on a 6D object pose alignment task in
both simulation and in the real world. On the hardest version of our task, with
randomized initial poses, randomized 6D goals, and diverse object categories,
our policy demonstrates strong generalization to unseen object categories
without a performance drop, achieving an 89% success rate on unseen objects in
simulation and 50% success rate with zero-shot transfer in the real world.
Compared to alternative action representations, HACMan achieves a success rate
more than three times higher than the best baseline. With zero-shot sim2real
transfer, our policy can successfully manipulate unseen objects in the real
world for challenging non-planar goals, using dynamic and contact-rich
non-prehensile skills. Videos can be found on the project website:

Recently, PI-GNN, a generic scalable framework, has been proposed to address
the Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problems over graphs based on a simple
Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture. Their novel contribution was a generic
QUBO-formulated Hamiltonian-inspired loss function that was optimized using
GNN. In this study, we address a crucial issue related to the aforementioned
setup especially observed in denser graphs. The reinforcement learning-based
paradigm has also been widely used to address numerous CO problems. Here we
also formulate and empirically evaluate the compatibility of the
QUBO-formulated Hamiltonian as the generic reward function in the Reinforcement
Learning paradigm to directly integrate the actual node projection status
during training as the form of rewards. In our experiments, we observed up to

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In response to recent data regulation requirements, machine unlearning (MU)
has emerged as a critical process to remove the influence of specific examples
from a given model. Although exact unlearning can be achieved through complete
model retraining using the remaining dataset, the associated computational
costs have driven the development of efficient, approximate unlearning
techniques. Moving beyond data-centric MU approaches, our study introduces a
novel model-based perspective: model sparsification via weight pruning, which
is capable of reducing the gap between exact unlearning and approximate
unlearning. We show in both theory and practice that model sparsity can boost
the multi-criteria unlearning performance of an approximate unlearner, closing
the approximation gap, while continuing to be efficient. This leads to a new MU
paradigm, termed prune first, then unlearn, which infuses a sparse model prior
into the unlearning process. Building on this insight, we also develop a
sparsity-aware unlearning method that utilizes sparsity regularization to
enhance the training process of approximate unlearning. Extensive experiments
show that our proposals consistently benefit MU in various unlearning
scenarios. A notable highlight is the 77% unlearning efficacy gain of
fine-tuning (one of the simplest unlearning methods) when using sparsity-aware
unlearning. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical impact of our proposed MU
methods in addressing other machine learning challenges, such as defending
against backdoor attacks and enhancing transfer learning. Codes are available

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We provide a simple convergence proof for AdaGrad optimizing non-convex
objectives under only affine noise variance and bounded smoothness assumptions.
The proof is essentially based on a novel auxiliary function $\xi$ that helps
eliminate the complexity of handling the correlation between the numerator and
denominator of AdaGrad's update. Leveraging simple proofs, we are able to
obtain tighter results than existing results \citep{faw2022power} and extend
the analysis to several new and important cases. Specifically, for the
over-parameterized regime, we show that AdaGrad needs only
$\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2})$ iterations to ensure the gradient norm
smaller than $\varepsilon$, which matches the rate of SGD and significantly
tighter than existing rates $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^4})$ for AdaGrad.
We then discard the bounded smoothness assumption and consider a realistic
assumption on smoothness called $(L_0,L_1)$-smooth condition, which allows
local smoothness to grow with the gradient norm. Again based on the auxiliary
function $\xi$, we prove that AdaGrad succeeds in converging under
$(L_0,L_1)$-smooth condition as long as the learning rate is lower than a
threshold. Interestingly, we further show that the requirement on learning rate
under the $(L_0,L_1)$-smooth condition is necessary via proof by contradiction,
in contrast with the case of uniform smoothness conditions where convergence is
guaranteed regardless of learning rate choices. Together, our analyses broaden
the understanding of AdaGrad and demonstrate the power of the new auxiliary
function in the investigations of AdaGrad.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We study differentially private (DP) stochastic optimization (SO) with loss
functions whose worst-case Lipschitz parameter over all data points may be
extremely large. To date, the vast majority of work on DP SO assumes that the
loss is uniformly Lipschitz continuous over data (i.e. stochastic gradients are
uniformly bounded over all data points). While this assumption is convenient,
it often leads to pessimistic excess risk bounds. In many practical problems,
the worst-case (uniform) Lipschitz parameter of the loss over all data points
may be extremely large due to outliers. In such cases, the error bounds for DP
SO, which scale with the worst-case Lipschitz parameter of the loss, are
vacuous. To address these limitations, this work provides near-optimal excess
risk bounds that do not depend on the uniform Lipschitz parameter of the loss.
Building on a recent line of work (Wang et al., 2020; Kamath et al., 2022), we
assume that stochastic gradients have bounded $k$-th order moments for some $k
\geq 2$. Compared with works on uniformly Lipschitz DP SO, our excess risk
scales with the $k$-th moment bound instead of the uniform Lipschitz parameter
of the loss, allowing for significantly faster rates in the presence of
outliers and/or heavy-tailed data. For convex and strongly convex loss
functions, we provide the first asymptotically optimal excess risk bounds (up
to a logarithmic factor). In contrast to (Wang et al., 2020; Kamath et al.,
2022), our bounds do not require the loss function to be differentiable/smooth.
We also devise a linear-time algorithm for smooth losses that has excess risk
that is tight in certain practical parameter regimes. Additionally, our work is
the first to address non-convex non-uniformly Lipschitz loss functions
satisfying the Proximal-PL inequality; this covers some practical machine
learning models. Our Proximal-PL algorithm has near-optimal excess risk.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In many real-world tasks, the concerned objects can be represented as a
multi-instance bag associated with a candidate label set, which consists of one
ground-truth label and several false positive labels. Multi-instance
partial-label learning (MIPL) is a learning paradigm to deal with such tasks
and has achieved favorable performances. Existing MIPL approach follows the
instance-space paradigm by assigning augmented candidate label sets of bags to
each instance and aggregating bag-level labels from instance-level labels.
However, this scheme may be suboptimal as global bag-level information is
ignored and the predicted labels of bags are sensitive to predictions of
negative instances. In this paper, we study an alternative scheme where a
multi-instance bag is embedded into a single vector representation.
Accordingly, an intuitive algorithm named DEMIPL, i.e., Disambiguated attention
Embedding for Multi-Instance Partial-Label learning, is proposed. DEMIPL
employs a disambiguation attention mechanism to aggregate a multi-instance bag
into a single vector representation, followed by a momentum-based
disambiguation strategy to identify the ground-truth label from the candidate
label set. Furthermore, we introduce a real-world MIPL dataset for colorectal
cancer classification. Experimental results on benchmark and real-world
datasets validate the superiority of DEMIPL against the compared MIPL and
partial-label learning approaches.]]></summary>

methods for detecting distribution shift are not well-suited to robotics

high-dimensional. In this work, we present an online method for detecting
distribution shift with guarantees on the false positive rate - i.e., when
there is no distribution shift, our system is very unlikely (with probability
$< \epsilon$) to falsely issue an alert; any alerts that are issued should
therefore be heeded. Our method is specifically designed for efficient
detection even with high dimensional data, and it empirically achieves up to
11x faster detection on realistic robotics settings compared to prior work
while maintaining a low false negative rate in practice (whenever there is a
distribution shift in our experiments, our method indeed emits an alert). We
demonstrate our approach in both simulation and hardware for a visual servoing
task, and show that our method indeed issues an alert before a failure occurs.]]></summary>

under-explored source of error in fair classification. In practice, the
variance on some data examples is so large that decisions can be effectively
arbitrary. To investigate this problem, we take an experimental approach and
make four overarching contributions: We 1) Define a metric called
self-consistency, derived from variance, which we use as a proxy for measuring
and reducing arbitrariness; 2) Develop an ensembling algorithm that abstains
from classification when a prediction would be arbitrary; 3) Conduct the
largest to-date empirical study of the role of variance (vis-a-vis
self-consistency and arbitrariness) in fair classification; and, 4) Release a
toolkit that makes the US Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) datasets easily
usable for future research. Altogether, our experiments reveal shocking
insights about the reliability of conclusions on benchmark datasets. Most
fairness classification benchmarks are close-to-fair when taking into account
the amount of arbitrariness present in predictions -- before we even try to
apply common fairness interventions. This finding calls into question the
practical utility of common algorithmic fairness methods, and in turn suggests
that we should fundamentally reconsider how we choose to measure fairness in
machine learning.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The soft Dice loss (SDL) has taken a pivotal role in numerous automated
segmentation pipelines in the medical imaging community. Over the last years,
some reasons behind its superior functioning have been uncovered and further
optimizations have been explored. However, there is currently no implementation
that supports its direct utilization in scenarios involving soft labels. Hence,
a synergy between the use of SDL and research leveraging the use of soft
labels, also in the context of model calibration, is still missing. In this
work, we introduce Dice semimetric losses (DMLs), which (i) are by design
identical to SDL in a standard setting with hard labels, but (ii) can be
employed in settings with soft labels. Our experiments on the public QUBIQ,
LiTS and KiTS benchmarks confirm the potential synergy of DMLs with soft labels
(e.g.\ averaging, label smoothing, and knowledge distillation) over hard labels
(e.g.\ majority voting and random selection). As a result, we obtain superior
Dice scores and model calibration, which supports the wider adoption of DMLs in
practice. The code is available at

constructive in practice. Its building blocks are spacetime lightcones that
embody how information propagates across a system through local interactions.
We show that predictive equivalence classes of lightcones -- local causal
states -- capture organized behaviors and coherent structures in complex
spatiotemporal systems. Employing an unsupervised physics-informed machine
learning algorithm and a high-performance computing implementation, we
demonstrate automatically discovering coherent structures in two real world
domain science problems. We show that local causal states identify vortices and
track their power-law decay behavior in two-dimensional fluid turbulence. We
then show how to detect and track familiar extreme weather events -- hurricanes

establishing the robustness and trustworthiness of deep neural nets, especially
when they are used in safety-critical application domains such as autonomous
vehicles and precision medicine. However, the problem poses multiple practical
challenges, including scalability issues owing to large-sized networks, and the
generation of adversarial inputs that lack important qualities such as
naturalness and output-impartiality. This problem shares its end goal with the
task of patching neural nets where small changes in some of the network's
weights need to be discovered so that upon applying these changes, the modified
net produces the desirable output for a given set of inputs. We exploit this
connection by proposing to obtain an adversarial input from a patch, with the
underlying observation that the effect of changing the weights can also be
brought about by changing the inputs instead. Thus, this paper presents a novel
way to generate input perturbations that are adversarial for a given network by
using an efficient network patching technique. We note that the proposed method
is significantly more effective than the prior state-of-the-art techniques.]]></summary>

formulation that has a lower cost scaling than the prevailing Kohn-Sham DFT,
which is increasingly desired for contemporary molecular research. However, its
accuracy is limited by the kinetic energy density functional, which is
notoriously hard to approximate for non-periodic molecular systems. In this
work, we propose M-OFDFT, an OFDFT approach capable of solving molecular
systems using a deep-learning functional model. We build the essential
nonlocality into the model, which is made affordable by the concise density
representation as expansion coefficients under an atomic basis. With techniques
to address unconventional learning challenges therein, M-OFDFT achieves a
comparable accuracy with Kohn-Sham DFT on a wide range of molecules untouched
by OFDFT before. More attractively, M-OFDFT extrapolates well to molecules much
larger than those in training, which unleashes the appealing scaling for
studying large molecules including proteins, representing an advancement of the

dynamic 3D descriptor fields. These fields capture the dynamics of the

Specifically, we project arbitrary 3D points in the workspace onto multi-view
2D visual observations and interpolate features derived from foundational
models. The resulting fused descriptor fields allow for flexible goal
specifications using 2D images with varied contexts, styles, and instances. To
evaluate the effectiveness of these descriptor fields, we apply our

(FL) mainly through a) mitigating the impact of infected models, or b)
excluding infected models. The former negatively impacts model accuracy, while
the latter usually relies on globally clear boundaries between benign and
infected model updates. However, model updates are easy to be mixed and
scattered throughout in reality due to the diverse distributions of local data.
This work focuses on excluding infected models in FL. Unlike previous
perspectives from a global view, we propose Snowball, a novel anti-backdoor FL
framework through bidirectional elections from an individual perspective
inspired by one principle deduced by us and two principles in FL and deep
learning. It is characterized by a) bottom-up election, where each candidate
model update votes to several peer ones such that a few model updates are
elected as selectees for aggregation; and b) top-down election, where selectees
progressively enlarge themselves through picking up from the candidates. We
compare Snowball with state-of-the-art defenses to backdoor attacks in FL on

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Parallelization techniques have become ubiquitous for accelerating inference
and training of deep neural networks. Despite this, several operations are
still performed in a sequential manner. For instance, the forward and backward
passes are executed layer-by-layer, and the output of diffusion models is
produced by applying a sequence of denoising steps. This sequential approach
results in a computational cost proportional to the number of steps involved,
presenting a potential bottleneck as the number of steps increases. In this
work, we introduce DeepPCR, a novel algorithm which parallelizes typically
sequential operations used in inference and training of neural networks.
DeepPCR is based on interpreting a sequence of $L$ steps as the solution of a
specific system of equations, which we recover using the Parallel Cyclic
Reduction algorithm. This reduces the complexity of computing the sequential
operations from $\mathcal{O}(L)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log_2L)$, thus yielding a
speedup for large $L$. To verify the theoretical lower complexity of the
algorithm, and to identify regimes for speedup, we test the effectiveness of
DeepPCR in parallelizing the forward and backward pass in multi-layer
perceptrons, and reach speedups of up to $30\times$ for forward and $200\times$
for backward pass. We additionally showcase the flexibility of DeepPCR by
parallelizing training of ResNets with as many as 1024 layers, and generation
in diffusion models, enabling up to $7\times$ faster training and $11\times$
faster generation, respectively, when compared to the sequential approach.]]></summary>

setting with arbitrary corruptions. Similar to the classical setup, the agent
receives rewards generated independently from the distribution of the arm
chosen at each time. However, these rewards are not directly observed. Instead,
with a fixed $\varepsilon\in (0,\frac{1}{2})$, the agent observes a sample from
the chosen arm's distribution with probability $1-\varepsilon$, or from an
arbitrary corruption distribution with probability $\varepsilon$. Importantly,
we impose no assumptions on these corruption distributions, which can be
unbounded. In this setting, accommodating potentially unbounded corruptions, we
establish a problem-dependent lower bound on regret for a given family of arm
distributions. We introduce CRIMED, an asymptotically-optimal algorithm that
achieves the exact lower bound on regret for bandits with Gaussian
distributions with known variance. Additionally, we provide a finite-sample
analysis of CRIMED's regret performance. Notably, CRIMED can effectively handle
corruptions with $\varepsilon$ values as high as $\frac{1}{2}$. Furthermore, we
develop a tight concentration result for medians in the presence of arbitrary
corruptions, even with $\varepsilon$ values up to $\frac{1}{2}$, which may be
of independent interest. We also discuss an extension of the algorithm for

hierarchically organized data. Further, several classification algorithms for
data in these spaces have been proposed in the literature. These algorithms
mainly use either hyperplanes or geodesics for decision boundaries in a large
margin classifiers setting leading to a non-convex optimization problem. In
this paper, we propose a novel large margin classifier based on horospherical
decision boundaries that leads to a geodesically convex optimization problem
that can be optimized using any Riemannian gradient descent technique

ranging from clustering, kernel-based classification/regression and more
recently supervised graph prediction. Distances between graphs usually rely on
informative representations of these structured objects such as bag of
substructures or other graph embeddings. A recently popular solution consists
in representing graphs as metric measure spaces, allowing to successfully
leverage Optimal Transport, which provides meaningful distances allowing to
compare them: the Gromov-Wasserstein distances. However, this family of
distances overlooks edge attributes, which are essential for many structured
objects. In this work, we introduce an extension of Gromov-Wasserstein distance
for comparing graphs whose both nodes and edges have features. We propose novel
algorithms for distance and barycenter computation. We empirically show the
effectiveness of the novel distance in learning tasks where graphs occur in

After characterizing lossless transformations, i.e., transformations for which
the excess risk is zero for all loss functions, we construct a partitioning
test statistic for the hypothesis that a given transformation is lossless and
show that for i.i.d. data the test is strongly consistent. More generally, we
develop information-theoretic upper bounds on the excess risk that uniformly
hold over fairly general classes of loss functions. Based on these bounds, we
introduce the notion of a delta-lossless transformation and give sufficient

increase rather than decrease the uncertainty of estimates, such as the
empirical prediction risk. It can act as a regularizer, but fails to do so in
certain high-dimensional problems, and it may shift the double-descent peak of
an empirical risk. Overall, the analysis shows that several properties data
augmentation has been attributed with are not either true or false, but rather
depend on a combination of factors -- notably the data distribution, the
properties of the estimator, and the interplay of sample size, number of
augmentations, and dimension. Our main theoretical tool is a limit theorem for

previous knowledge. However, Continual Learning often requires massive
computational power and storage capacity for satisfactory performance. In this
paper, we propose a resource-efficient continual learning method called the

precise replay sample selection, E2Net achieves superior average accuracy and
diminished forgetting within the same computational and storage constraints,

Network Distillation to identify the representative core subnet by assessing
parameter quantity and output similarity with the working network, distilling
analogous subnets within the working network to mitigate reliance on rehearsal
buffers and facilitating knowledge transfer across previous tasks. To enhance
storage resource utilization, we then propose Subnet Constraint Experience
Replay to optimize rehearsal efficiency through a sample storage strategy based
on the structures of representative networks. Extensive experiments conducted
predominantly on cloud environments with diverse datasets and also spanning the

menopause, and yet research connecting female brain health to sex hormone
fluctuations is limited. We seek to investigate this connection by developing
tools that quantify 3D shape changes that occur in the brain during sex hormone
fluctuations. Geodesic regression on the space of 3D discrete surfaces offers a
principled way to characterize the evolution of a brain's shape. However, in
its current form, this approach is too computationally expensive for practical
use. In this paper, we propose approximation schemes that accelerate geodesic
regression on shape spaces of 3D discrete surfaces. We also provide rules of
thumb for when each approximation can be used. We test our approach on
synthetic data to quantify the speed-accuracy trade-off of these approximations
and show that practitioners can expect very significant speed-up while only
sacrificing little accuracy. Finally, we apply the method to real brain shape
data and produce the first characterization of how the female hippocampus
changes shape during the menstrual cycle as a function of progesterone: a
characterization made (practically) possible by our approximation schemes. Our
work paves the way for comprehensive, practical shape analyses in the fields of
bio-medicine and computer vision. Our implementation is publicly available on

such modularized NF management, automated network operation and management are

NWDAF needs to conduct both inference and training tasks, and thus it is
difficult to provide the analytics results to NFs in a timely manner for an

are distributed to multiple leaf NWDAFs and training tasks are conducted at the
root NWDAF. Extensive simulation results using open-source software (i.e.,

Due to the imbalance in the number of samples, the support vector machine (SVM)
classifier gets biased toward the majority class. Furthermore, these samples
are often observed with a certain degree of noise. Therefore, to remove these
problems we propose a novel fuzzy based approach to deal with class imbalanced
as well noisy datasets. We propose two approaches to address these problems.
The first approach is based on the intuitionistic fuzzy membership, termed as
robust energy-based intuitionistic fuzzy least squares twin support vector
machine (IF-RELSTSVM). Furthermore, we introduce the concept of
hyperplane-based fuzzy membership in our second approach, where the final
classifier is termed as robust energy-based fuzzy least square twin support
vector machine (F-RELSTSVM). By using this technique, the membership values are
based on a projection based approach, where the data points are projected on
the hyperplanes. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated on
several benchmark and synthetic datasets. The experimental results show that
the proposed IF-RELSTSVM and F-RELSTSVM models outperform the baseline
algorithms. Statistical tests are performed to check the significance of the

of modern computer vision. However, its application in certain imaging fields,
such as microscopy and satellite imaging, presents unique challenges. In these
domains, images often contain multiple channels, each carrying semantically
distinct and independent information. Furthermore, the model must demonstrate
robustness to sparsity in input channels, as they may not be densely available
during training or testing. In this paper, we propose a modification to the ViT
architecture that enhances reasoning across the input channels and introduce
Hierarchical Channel Sampling (HCS) as an additional regularization technique
to ensure robustness when only partial channels are presented during test time.
Our proposed model, ChannelViT, constructs patch tokens independently from each
input channel and utilizes a learnable channel embedding that is added to the
patch tokens, similar to positional embeddings. We evaluate the performance of
ChannelViT on ImageNet, JUMP-CP (microscopy cell imaging), and So2Sat
(satellite imaging). Our results show that ChannelViT outperforms ViT on
classification tasks and generalizes well, even when a subset of input channels
is used during testing. Across our experiments, HCS proves to be a powerful
regularizer, independent of the architecture employed, suggesting itself as a
straightforward technique for robust ViT training. Lastly, we find that
ChannelViT generalizes effectively even when there is limited access to all
channels during training, highlighting its potential for multi-channel imaging
under real-world conditions with sparse sensors.]]></summary>

central to statistical learning and inference. Two classical methods are
canonical correlation analysis (CCA), which identifies maximally correlated
projected versions of the original variables, and Shannon's mutual information,
which is a universal dependence measure that also captures high-order
dependencies. However, CCA only accounts for linear dependence, which may be
insufficient for certain applications, while mutual information is often
infeasible to compute/estimate in high dimensions. This work proposes a middle
ground in the form of a scalable information-theoretic generalization of CCA,
termed max-sliced mutual information (mSMI). mSMI equals the maximal mutual
information between low-dimensional projections of the high-dimensional
variables, which reduces back to CCA in the Gaussian case. It enjoys the best
of both worlds: capturing intricate dependencies in the data while being
amenable to fast computation and scalable estimation from samples. We show that
mSMI retains favorable structural properties of Shannon's mutual information,
like variational forms and identification of independence. We then study
statistical estimation of mSMI, propose an efficiently computable neural
estimator, and couple it with formal non-asymptotic error bounds. We present
experiments that demonstrate the utility of mSMI for several tasks,
encompassing independence testing, multi-view representation learning,
algorithmic fairness, and generative modeling. We observe that mSMI
consistently outperforms competing methods with little-to-no computational
overhead.]]></summary>

driving policies which are transparent, explainable and generalisable from
available datasets. Utilizing the real-world highD dataset, we subject our
method to a rigorous comparative analysis against prevailing
neural-network-based IL methods. Our results demonstrate that SIL not only
enhances the interpretability of driving policies but also significantly
improves their applicability across varied driving situations. Hence, this work

opportunities for artificial general intelligence but concurrently amplify
safety concerns, such as potential misuse of AI systems, necessitating
effective AI alignment. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has
emerged as a promising pathway towards AI alignment but brings forth challenges
due to its complexity and dependence on a separate reward model. Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed as an alternative, and it
remains equivalent to RLHF under the reverse KL regularization constraint. This
paper presents $f$-DPO, a generalized approach to DPO by incorporating diverse
divergence constraints. We show that under certain $f$-divergences, including
Jensen-Shannon divergence, forward KL divergences and $\alpha$-divergences, the
complex relationship between the reward and optimal policy can also be
simplified by addressing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. This eliminates the
need for estimating the normalizing constant in the Bradley-Terry model and
enables a tractable mapping between the reward function and the optimal policy.
Our approach optimizes LLMs to align with human preferences in a more efficient
and supervised manner under a broad set of divergence constraints. Empirically,
adopting these divergences ensures a balance between alignment performance and
generation diversity. Importantly, $f$-DPO outperforms PPO-based methods in
divergence efficiency, and divergence constraints directly influence expected
calibration error (ECE).]]></summary>

nonlocality into the model, which is made affordable by the concise density
representation as expansion coefficients under an atomic basis. With techniques
to address unconventional learning challenges therein, M-OFDFT achieves a
comparable accuracy with Kohn-Sham DFT on a wide range of molecules untouched
by OFDFT before. More attractively, M-OFDFT extrapolates well to molecules much
larger than those in training, which unleashes the appealing scaling for
studying large molecules including proteins, representing an advancement of the

The smoothness bridges the gap between the cubic root convergence rate (that

reliability of automatic face recognition (FR) systems in surveillance and
security scenarios. However, a massive amount of face data is usually
compressed before being analyzed due to limitations on transmission or storage.
The compressed images may lose the powerful identity information, resulting in
the performance degradation of the FR system. Herein, we make the first attempt
to study just noticeable difference (JND) for the FR system, which can be
defined as the maximum distortion that the FR system cannot notice. More
specifically, we establish a JND dataset including 3530 original images and
137,670 compressed images generated by advanced reference encoding/decoding
software based on the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard (VTM-15.0).
Subsequently, we develop a novel JND prediction model to directly infer JND
images for the FR system. In particular, in order to maximum redundancy removal
without impairment of robust identity information, we apply the encoder with
multiple feature extraction and attention-based feature decomposition modules
to progressively decompose face features into two uncorrelated components,
i.e., identity and residual features, via self-supervised learning. Then, the
residual feature is fed into the decoder to generate the residual map. Finally,
the predicted JND map is obtained by subtracting the residual map from the
original image. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed model
achieves higher accuracy of JND map prediction compared with the
state-of-the-art JND models, and is capable of saving more bits while
maintaining the performance of the FR system compared with VTM-15.0.]]></summary>

difficult to examine because of the limited size of quantum circuits, which can
be reliably implemented in the near future. We propose transfer learning as an
effective strategy for utilizing small QCNNs in the noisy intermediate-scale

framework, a QCNN can solve complex classification problems without requiring a

various sets of quantum convolution and pooling operations for MNIST data

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) has well documented merits in enhancing
generalization of deep neural networks, even without sizable data augmentation.
Embracing the geometry of the loss function, where neighborhoods of 'flat
minima' heighten generalization ability, SAM seeks 'flat valleys' by minimizing
the maximum loss caused by an adversary perturbing parameters within the
neighborhood. Although critical to account for sharpness of the loss function,
such an 'over-friendly adversary' can curtail the outmost level of
generalization. The novel approach of this contribution fosters stabilization
of adversaries through variance suppression (VaSSO) to avoid such friendliness.
VaSSO's provable stability safeguards its numerical improvement over SAM in
model-agnostic tasks, including image classification and machine translation.
In addition, experiments confirm that VaSSO endows SAM with robustness against
high levels of label noise.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The accurate representation of precipitation in Earth system models (ESMs) is
crucial for reliable projections of the ecological and socioeconomic impacts in
response to anthropogenic global warming. The complex cross-scale interactions
of processes that produce precipitation are challenging to model, however,
inducing potentially strong biases in ESM fields, especially regarding
extremes. State-of-the-art bias correction methods only address errors in the
simulated frequency distributions locally at every individual grid cell.
Improving unrealistic spatial patterns of the ESM output, which would require
spatial context, has not been possible so far. Here, we show that a
post-processing method based on physically constrained generative adversarial
networks (cGANs) can correct biases of a state-of-the-art, CMIP6-class ESM both
in local frequency distributions and in the spatial patterns at once. While our
method improves local frequency distributions equally well as gold-standard
bias-adjustment frameworks, it strongly outperforms any existing methods in the
correction of spatial patterns, especially in terms of the characteristic
spatial intermittency of precipitation extremes.]]></summary>

performing language-related tasks. However, their deployment poses significant
challenges due to their considerable memory and storage requirements. In
response to this issue, weight-only quantization, particularly 3 and 4-bit
weight-only quantization, has emerged as one of the most viable solutions. As
the number of bits decreases, the quantization grid broadens, thus emphasizing
the importance of up and down rounding. While previous studies have
demonstrated that fine-tuning up and down rounding with the addition of
perturbations can enhance accuracy in some scenarios, our study is driven by
the precise and limited boundary of these perturbations, where only the
threshold for altering the rounding value is of significance. Consequently, we
propose a concise and highly effective approach for optimizing the weight
rounding task. Our method, named SignRound, involves lightweight block-wise
tuning using signed gradient descent, enabling us to achieve outstanding
results within 400 steps. SignRound competes impressively against recent
methods without introducing additional inference overhead. The source code will
be publicly available at \url{https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor} soon.]]></summary>

allow them to operate in complex, high-dimensional, non-linear, and dynamically
changing environments. Due to the complexity of these environments, DNN
classifiers may output misclassifications during operation when they face
domains not identified during development. Removing a system from operation for
retraining becomes impractical as the number of such AS increases. To increase
AS reliability and overcome this limitation, DNN classifiers need to have the
ability to adapt during operation when faced with different operational domains
using a few samples (e.g. 100 samples). However, retraining DNNs on a few
samples is known to cause catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we introduce
Dynamic Incremental Regularised Adaptation (DIRA), a framework for operational
domain adaption of DNN classifiers using regularisation techniques to overcome
catastrophic forgetting and achieve adaptation when retraining using a few
samples of the target domain. Our approach shows improvements on different
image classification benchmarks aimed at evaluating robustness to distribution
shifts (e.g.CIFAR-10C/100C, ImageNet-C), and produces state-of-the-art
performance in comparison with other frameworks from the literature.]]></summary>

under-explored source of error in fair classification. In practice, the
variance on some data examples is so large that decisions can be effectively
arbitrary. To investigate this problem, we take an experimental approach and
make four overarching contributions: We 1) Define a metric called
self-consistency, derived from variance, which we use as a proxy for measuring
and reducing arbitrariness; 2) Develop an ensembling algorithm that abstains
from classification when a prediction would be arbitrary; 3) Conduct the
largest to-date empirical study of the role of variance (vis-a-vis
self-consistency and arbitrariness) in fair classification; and, 4) Release a
toolkit that makes the US Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) datasets easily
usable for future research. Altogether, our experiments reveal shocking
insights about the reliability of conclusions on benchmark datasets. Most
fairness classification benchmarks are close-to-fair when taking into account
the amount of arbitrariness present in predictions -- before we even try to
apply common fairness interventions. This finding calls into question the
practical utility of common algorithmic fairness methods, and in turn suggests
that we should fundamentally reconsider how we choose to measure fairness in
machine learning.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many emerging user-facing services adopt Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to
improve serving accuracy. When the graph used by a GNN model changes,
representations (embedding) of nodes in the graph should be updated
accordingly. However, the node representation update is too slow, resulting in
either long response latency of user queries (the inference is performed after
the update completes) or high staleness problem (the inference is performed
based on stale data). Our in-depth analysis shows that the slow update is
mainly due to neighbor explosion problem in graphs and duplicated computation.
Based on such findings, we propose STAG, a GNN serving framework that enables
low latency and low staleness of GNN-based services. It comprises a
collaborative serving mechanism and an additivity-based incremental propagation
strategy. With the collaborative serving mechanism, only part of node
representations are updated during the update phase, and the final
representations are calculated in the inference phase. It alleviates the
neighbor explosion problem. The additivity-based incremental propagation
strategy reuses intermediate data during the update phase, eliminating
duplicated computation problem. Experimental results show that STAG accelerates
the update phase by 1.3x~90.1x, and greatly reduces staleness time with a
slight increase in response latency.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While reliable data-driven decision-making hinges on high-quality labeled
data, the acquisition of quality labels often involves laborious human
annotations or slow and expensive scientific measurements. Machine learning is
becoming an appealing alternative as sophisticated predictive techniques are
being used to quickly and cheaply produce large amounts of predicted labels;
e.g., predicted protein structures are used to supplement experimentally
derived structures, predictions of socioeconomic indicators from satellite
imagery are used to supplement accurate survey data, and so on. Since
predictions are imperfect and potentially biased, this practice brings into
question the validity of downstream inferences. We introduce cross-prediction:
a method for valid inference powered by machine learning. With a small labeled
dataset and a large unlabeled dataset, cross-prediction imputes the missing
labels via machine learning and applies a form of debiasing to remedy the
prediction inaccuracies. The resulting inferences achieve the desired error
probability and are more powerful than those that only leverage the labeled
data. Closely related is the recent proposal of prediction-powered inference,
which assumes that a good pre-trained model is already available. We show that
cross-prediction is consistently more powerful than an adaptation of
prediction-powered inference in which a fraction of the labeled data is split
off and used to train the model. Finally, we observe that cross-prediction
gives more stable conclusions than its competitors; its confidence intervals
typically have significantly lower variability.]]></summary>

an algorithm for incremental construction of CTFs that is guaranteed to give a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We study differentially private (DP) stochastic optimization (SO) with loss
functions whose worst-case Lipschitz parameter over all data points may be
extremely large. To date, the vast majority of work on DP SO assumes that the
loss is uniformly Lipschitz continuous over data (i.e. stochastic gradients are
uniformly bounded over all data points). While this assumption is convenient,
it often leads to pessimistic excess risk bounds. In many practical problems,
the worst-case (uniform) Lipschitz parameter of the loss over all data points
may be extremely large due to outliers. In such cases, the error bounds for DP
SO, which scale with the worst-case Lipschitz parameter of the loss, are
vacuous. To address these limitations, this work provides near-optimal excess
risk bounds that do not depend on the uniform Lipschitz parameter of the loss.
Building on a recent line of work (Wang et al., 2020; Kamath et al., 2022), we
assume that stochastic gradients have bounded $k$-th order moments for some $k
\geq 2$. Compared with works on uniformly Lipschitz DP SO, our excess risk
scales with the $k$-th moment bound instead of the uniform Lipschitz parameter
of the loss, allowing for significantly faster rates in the presence of
outliers and/or heavy-tailed data. For convex and strongly convex loss
functions, we provide the first asymptotically optimal excess risk bounds (up
to a logarithmic factor). In contrast to (Wang et al., 2020; Kamath et al.,
2022), our bounds do not require the loss function to be differentiable/smooth.
We also devise a linear-time algorithm for smooth losses that has excess risk
that is tight in certain practical parameter regimes. Additionally, our work is
the first to address non-convex non-uniformly Lipschitz loss functions
satisfying the Proximal-PL inequality; this covers some practical machine
learning models. Our Proximal-PL algorithm has near-optimal excess risk.]]></summary>

setting with arbitrary corruptions. Similar to the classical setup, the agent
receives rewards generated independently from the distribution of the arm
chosen at each time. However, these rewards are not directly observed. Instead,
with a fixed $\varepsilon\in (0,\frac{1}{2})$, the agent observes a sample from
the chosen arm's distribution with probability $1-\varepsilon$, or from an
arbitrary corruption distribution with probability $\varepsilon$. Importantly,
we impose no assumptions on these corruption distributions, which can be
unbounded. In this setting, accommodating potentially unbounded corruptions, we
establish a problem-dependent lower bound on regret for a given family of arm
distributions. We introduce CRIMED, an asymptotically-optimal algorithm that
achieves the exact lower bound on regret for bandits with Gaussian
distributions with known variance. Additionally, we provide a finite-sample
analysis of CRIMED's regret performance. Notably, CRIMED can effectively handle
corruptions with $\varepsilon$ values as high as $\frac{1}{2}$. Furthermore, we
develop a tight concentration result for medians in the presence of arbitrary
corruptions, even with $\varepsilon$ values up to $\frac{1}{2}$, which may be

control method, we construct a synthetic treatment group for the target
population by a weighted mixture of treatment groups of source populations. We
estimate the weights by minimizing the conditional maximum mean discrepancy
between the weighted control groups of source populations and the target
population. We establish the asymptotic normality of the synthetic treatment
group estimator based on the sieve semiparametric theory. Our method can serve
as a novel complementary approach when the mean exchangeability assumption is
violated. Experiments are conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bayesian optimization (BO), while proved highly effective for many black-box
function optimization tasks, requires practitioners to carefully select priors
that well model their functions of interest. Rather than specifying by hand,
researchers have investigated transfer learning based methods to automatically
learn the priors, e.g. multi-task BO (Swersky et al., 2013), few-shot BO
(Wistuba and Grabocka, 2021) and HyperBO (Wang et al., 2022). However, those
prior learning methods typically assume that the input domains are the same for
all tasks, weakening their ability to use observations on functions with
different domains or generalize the learned priors to BO on different search
spaces. In this work, we present HyperBO+: a pre-training approach for
hierarchical Gaussian processes that enables the same prior to work universally
for Bayesian optimization on functions with different domains. We propose a
two-step pre-training method and analyze its appealing asymptotic properties
and benefits to BO both theoretically and empirically. On real-world
hyperparameter tuning tasks that involve multiple search spaces, we demonstrate
that HyperBO+ is able to generalize to unseen search spaces and achieves lower
regrets than competitive baselines.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular black-box function optimization
method, which makes sequential decisions based on a Bayesian model, typically a
Gaussian process (GP), of the function. To ensure the quality of the model,
transfer learning approaches have been developed to automatically design GP
priors by learning from observations on "training" functions. These training
functions are typically required to have the same domain as the "test" function
(black-box function to be optimized). In this paper, we introduce MPHD, a model
pre-training method on heterogeneous domains, which uses a neural net mapping
from domain-specific contexts to specifications of hierarchical GPs. MPHD can
be seamlessly integrated with BO to transfer knowledge across heterogeneous
search spaces. Our theoretical and empirical results demonstrate the validity
of MPHD and its superior performance on challenging black-box function
optimization tasks.]]></summary>

target parameter as a conditional value function given a set of baseline
covariates which we refer to as a stratum based value function. We focus on
semiparametric class of decision rules and propose a sieve based nonparametric
covariate adjusted regimen-response curve estimator within that class. Our work
contributes in several ways. First, we propose an inverse probability weighted
nonparametrically efficient estimator of the smoothed regimen-response curve
function. We show that asymptotic linearity is achieved when the nuisance
functions are undersmoothed sufficiently. Asymptotic and finite sample criteria
for undersmoothing are proposed. Second, using Gaussian process theory, we
propose simultaneous confidence intervals for the smoothed regimen-response
curve function. Third, we provide consistency and convergence rate for the
optimizer of the regimen-response curve estimator; this enables us to estimate
an optimal semiparametric rule. The latter is important as the optimizer
corresponds with the optimal dynamic treatment regimen. Some finite-sample
properties are explored with simulations.]]></summary>

goal is to simultaneously achieve ($i$) second order gradient adaptivity; and
($ii$) comparator norm adaptivity also known as "parameter freeness" in the
literature. Existing regret bounds (Cutkosky and Orabona, 2018; Mhammedi and
Koolen, 2020; Jacobsen and Cutkosky, 2022) have the suboptimal $O(\sqrt{V_T\log
V_T})$ dependence on the gradient variance $V_T$, while the present work
improves it to the optimal rate $O(\sqrt{V_T})$ using a novel
continuous-time-inspired algorithm, without any impractical doubling trick.
This result can be extended to the setting with unknown Lipschitz constant,
eliminating the range ratio problem from prior works (Mhammedi and Koolen,
2020).

Concretely, we first show that the aimed simultaneous adaptivity can be
achieved fairly easily in a continuous time analogue of the problem, where the
environment is modeled by an arbitrary continuous semimartingale. Then, our key
innovation is a new discretization argument that preserves such adaptivity in
the discrete time adversarial setting. This refines a non-gradient-adaptive
discretization argument from (Harvey et al., 2023), both algorithmically and
analytically, which could be of independent interest.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone. I am very passionate about getting in ML research and was wondering what the learning pathway was, particularly with regards to the theoretical Math and Statistics involved.
 For context:
  
I am a second year undergraduate. By the end of this year, I will have taken and finished A Multivariable Calculus with Proofs course, so that is my current starting point.
 I have been working with ML for the last 3 years and am proficient in Python and frameworks like PyTorch.
 I have also made my own implementation of several research papers (LSTMs, GRUs, Transformers, ELMo, BERT, GPT, as well as a few computer vision papers).
  
I have a good general intuition of how deep learning works, but I want to formalise this knowledge with the adequate mathematical background so that I can eventually pursue a career in research. I understand that I have plenty of time until I reach there, and I am willing to dedicate it to grinding out the math and statistical knowledge required.
 I have done my research on this sub and other forums, and here are a few resources that stood out:
  
Mathematics for Machine Learning by Deisenroth, Faisal and Ong
 Advanced Calculus of Several Variables by C. H. Edwards Jr.
 Mathematical Methods Lecture Notes from Imperial College by Deisenroth and Cheraghchi
 The original information theory paper by Shannon
 The Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman
 Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Bishop
 The Probabalistic Machine Learning Series by Kevin P. Murphy
 Deep Learning by Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville
 Mathematics of Machine Learning on MIT OCW (here)
  
My question is, what order should I start self-learning in, given the (somewhat limited) background knowledge I have? Also, are there any other resources that would help?

 I am thinking of having an approach similar to the researchers of the phi paper, which is creating a high quality dataset using GPT3.5 / GPT4. 
 Do you know good open-source frameworks that make it easy to create a high quality data for a specific task using an existing large model, like GPT3.5/4 or Llama 2 70b?

Malvertising has made its way to Bing's chatbot/search engine.
 
Cybersecurity researchers observed a malicious ad being offered as part of the Chat-GPT, AI-powered answer to a search query.
 
Malvertising is a practice where hackers trick ad networks into displaying ads that look legitimate but are actually malicious.
 
Microsoft integrated Chat-GPT into Bing earlier this year and started monetizing it.
 
When a user types in a query, they would get a result paired with sponsored links.
 
In this instance, researchers were given a link that redirected them to a malicious site.
 
Threat actors continue to leverage search ads to redirect users to malicious sites hosting malware.
 
Bing Chat serves some of the same ads seen via a traditional Bing query.

In this paper, we present Gaussian Splatting based text-to-3D generation (GSGEN), a novel approach for generating high-quality 3D objects. Previous methods suffer from inaccurate geometry and limited fidelity due to the absence of 3D prior and proper representation. We leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting, a recent state-of-the-art representation, to address existing shortcomings by exploiting the explicit nature that enables the incorporation of 3D prior. Specifically, our method adopts a progressive optimization strategy, which includes a geometry optimization stage and an appearance refinement stage. In geometry optimization, a coarse representation is established under a 3D geometry prior along with the ordinary 2D SDS loss, ensuring a sensible and 3D-consistent rough shape. Subsequently, the obtained Gaussians undergo an iterative refinement to enrich details. In this stage, we increase the number of Gaussians by compactness-based densification to enhance continuity and improve fidelity. With these designs, our approach can generate 3D content with delicate details and more accurate geometry. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, especially for capturing high-frequency components.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I just open-sourced a project that I've been working on for a while and wanted to see what you think!
 The goal of Carton (https://carton.run) is to let you use a single interface to run any machine learning model from any programming language.
 It’s currently difficult to integrate models that use different technologies (e.g. TensorRT, Ludwig, TorchScript, JAX, GGML, etc) into your application, especially if you’re not using Python. Even if you learn the details of integrating each of these frameworks, running multiple frameworks in one process can cause hard-to-debug crashes.
 Ideally, the ML framework a model was developed in should just be an implementation detail. Carton lets you decouple your application from specific ML frameworks so you can focus on the problem you actually want to solve.
 At a high level, the way Carton works is by running models in their own processes and using an IPC system to communicate back and forth with low overhead. Carton is primarily implemented in Rust, with bindings to other languages. There are lots more details linked in the architecture doc below.
 Importantly, Carton uses your model’s original underlying framework (e.g. PyTorch) under the hood to actually execute the model. This is meaningful because it makes Carton composable with other technologies. For example, it’s easy to use custom ops, TensorRT, etc without changes. This lets you keep up with cutting-edge advances, but decouples them from your application.
 I’ve been working on Carton for almost a year now and I open sourced it on Wednesday!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone, 
 I’m doing a project where I’m crowdsourcing a lot of location data for a set of location labels and then trying to cluster it for each and using the centroid of the cluster as the most accurate location for that location label. 
 The data keeps coming in everyday. I’m not sure when to stop computation. Initially I thought I’ll check the delta between each days centroid computed and if the delta falls under a threshold then stop computing. 
 But now I’m thinking if my daily data collected gets marked as outliers, subsequent days centroids won’t have much of a delta and it will pass my convergence condition. 
 Any suggestions?

 As cuDNN/cuBLAS routines are nondeterministic and possibly dynamically allocate variable amount of memory, how do people manage this problem? Is it a problem at all? Estimating memory usage of deep learning models on gpu is notoriously hard. There is a research paper from Microsoft tackling this problem and they mispredict the usage of memory by 15% on average. Some cpu BLAS libraries like openBLAS or MKL also dynamically allocate the memory, but there are alternatives - LAPACK as far as I know uses only the memory provided by the caller, making it viable option for applications in embedded.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been playing around with pruning neural networks. One interesting thing I've found is that pruning the weights with the lowest L1-norm along a specific dimension seems to give better results than simply pruning all of the weights with the lowest L1-norm (which I believe is the standard method; for example this is what torch.nn.utils.prune.l1_unstructured does).
 Does anyone have an explanation for why this might be, or knows of any research in this area?
 I'm aware that structured pruning removes entire channels in a specific dimension. But I'm referring to unstructured pruning here, where I remove a subset of the weights along a specific dimension.
 Admittedly I've only done very limited benchmarking of this. See this repo for my implementation, and some benchmark details.

 Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16668
 RealFill is able to complete the image with what should have been there.
 Abstract
  
Recent advances in generative imagery have brought forth outpainting and inpainting models that can produce high-quality, plausible image content in unknown regions, but the content these models hallucinate is necessarily inauthentic, since the models lack sufficient context about the true scene. In this work, we propose RealFill, a novel generative approach for image completion that fills in missing regions of an image with the content that should have been there. RealFill is a generative inpainting model that is personalized using only a few reference images of a scene. These reference images do not have to be aligned with the target image, and can be taken with drastically varying viewpoints, lighting conditions, camera apertures, or image styles. Once personalized, RealFill is able to complete a target image with visually compelling contents that are faithful to the original scene. We evaluate RealFill on a new image completion benchmark that covers a set of diverse and challenging scenarios, and find that it outperforms existing approaches by a large margin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 so i learnt the very basics of ai and im trying to understand how nn works,
 this is what i have figured out so far. 
 so if i have a 4x4 image e.g
 0 1 1 0
 1 0 0 1
 1 1 1 1
 1 0 0 1
 i pass it across a 2x2 kernal e.g
 1 1
 0 3
 ​
 and padding it would do 
 ​
 dot product of 
 0 1
 1 0
 ​
 x
 ​
 1 1
 0 3
 ​
 is 1
 ​
 ​
 and if we do that to all of them we get a new matrix
 ​
 1 2 4
 4 1 3
 5 4 4
 ​
 ​
 then we have padding same so this becomes
 ​
 0 0 0 0
 1 2 4 0
 4 1 3 0
 5 4 4 0
 ​
 ​
 we then turn it into a feature map, basically flatenting it to something like this
 0,0,0,0,1,2,4,0,4,1,3,0,5,4,4,0
 ​
 so the input has 16 features, if we have a layer of 3 nerons that fire with relu activation funciton
 and each weight is alternating between 1 and 2 for simplicity sake . we would do
 0*1 + 0*2 + 0*1 .... 4*2 + 0*1 = 32
 so if we are using relu, we would do 
 is 32 > 0? if so we pass 32 to next neuron if not we pass 0?
 ​
 idk the rest, i guess i forgot what uni taught me 😅 
 ​
 hers a diagram i drew, maybe you can help me figure out hte rest, im confused how the output layer works i guess

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some posit he was genuinely surprised by the violence and needed time to assess the situation before acting. They argue that the chaotic nature of the events made immediate action complex, given the layers of command and decision-making involved. Others claim he might have been in deliberation with advisors to gauge the scale and implications of intervention, debating the potential backlash from his supporters or the legal ramifications.
 Another perspective suggests that he might have been contemplating how the events would affect the certification of the Electoral College results, given that his previous legal and political efforts to contest the 2020 election outcome had failed. In this view, he might have been waiting to see if the Congress would be influenced to halt or delay the certification.
 While some of his supporters may find these explanations plausible, critics argue that the delay represents a dereliction of duty or even tacit support for the violence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 Im new to the Neural network and I wanted some advice :
 I wanted to generate grayscale images with certain properties : - distribution of pixels values, space correlation between pixels, etc...
 I already know the type of result that I need, but I wanted to know if a neural network especially a GAN was capable to produce images fitting me requirements.
 I was thinking that maybe I could change the GAN architecture such as :
 1)the Real data inputs (normally images feed to discriminator) will simply be the statistical parameters that I am expecting.
 2) I'll add a measure of the various statistical parameters on all the synthetic images generated. 
 3)Finally the discriminator will only based itself on the statistical parameters comparison for weights updates.
 Does such network make sense ? If so I have trouble finding a way of implementing it but that is an other story. Right know I want to know if this is doable ? If not do you have any alternative suggestion for my issue ?
 Thanks all for your advice !

Joaquin Quiñonero Candela, a director of AI at Facebook, was tasked with fixing the problem but was only focused on addressing AI bias.
 
The Responsible AI team failed to make headway against misinformation and hate speech because it never made those problems its main focus.
 
The spread of lies and hate speech on Facebook has only grown, contributing to genocidal campaigns and the promotion of dangerous falsehoods.
 
The algorithms that underpin Facebook's business were designed to maximize engagement, not filter out false or inflammatory content.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a CNN model, call it model M. It was trained on dataset A for object pose estimation. After training for 100 epochs, it resulted in these losses:
  
Train: 0.06
 Val: 0.08
  
As dataset A is somewhat limited, I wonder if I can incorporate additional data via a different, but related task: object segmentation for similar objects. Model M is a UNet, so I can incorporate this task simply with an additional output channel in the last layer. 
 I add dataset B for object segmentation. During training, M learns on both datasets quite well, which suggests to me that the tasks are well-aligned. After 100 epochs, I get these losses on dataset A:
  
Train: 0.06
 Val: 0.16
  
This is surprising to me. If I get the same training loss on dataset A, while training on additional data. I'd expect the validation loss to be lower, since I'm training on 2x the data. Yet the validation performance is consistently higher when I train on both datasets. 
 The only explanation I can think of is the double descent phenomenon. Perhaps when I trained only on dataset A, I was significantly over-parameterized, but past the interpolation threshold. So perhaps adding more data brought me closer to the interpolation threshold, leading to worse generalization.
 Does this explanation seem likely? Has anyone had similar experiences?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google's AI-driven search experience, Search Generative Experience (SGE), is now accessible to teenagers between 13-17 in America. Entailments include a conversational mode for searches, which Google believes can help youngsters pose atypical questions to dig deeper.
 For the latest advancements in AI, look here first.
 Teen-friendly AI search
  
SGE introduces a conversational mode to Google Search, allowing users to ask questions and follow-ups in a more natural language.
 To prevent harmful content from surfacing, Google has placed guardrails, providing stronger protections related to illegal and age-gated substances, or bullying.
  
Features and improving AI accuracy
  
Google is rolling out "About this result" to provide users with more context about the displayed content.
 Google acknowledges and addresses any validation of false or offensive claims by the AI-powered response, ensuring to provide higher quality and more accurate responses.
 It’s also using large language models to self-critique and rewrite draft responses on sensitive topics based on quality and safety principles.
  
SGE's popularity and future plans
  
Since SGE's introduction, it has found popularity, especially among younger users who prefer a conversational approach.
 Google plans to expand SGE outside the U.S. to India and Japan and improve its services with support for videos, images, local info, and more.
 It's also experimenting with ads positioned next to the AI-generated responses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a quick disclaimer, I know people on here think the sub is being flooded by people who arent ml engineers/researchers. I have worked at two FAANGS on ml research teams/platforms. 
 My opinion is that GPT-4 Vision/Image processing is out of science fiction. I fed chatgpt an image of a complex sql data base schema, and it converted it to code, then optimized the schema. It understood the arrows pointing between table boxes on the image as relations, and even understand many to one/many to many. 
 I took a picture of random writing on a page, and it did OCR better than has ever been possible. I was able to ask questions that required OCR and a geometrical understanding of the page layout. 
 Where is the hype on here? This is an astounding human breakthrough. I cannot believe how much ML is now obsolete as a result. I cannot believe how many computer science breakthroughs have occurred with this simple model update. Where is the uproar on this sub? Why am I not seeing 500 comments on posts about what you can do with this now? Why are there even post submissions about anything else?

 Synopsis from Fandango (mild spoilers)
 From writer/director Gareth Edwards (“Rogue One,” “Godzilla”) comes an epic sci-fi action thriller set amidst a future war between the human race and the forces of artificial intelligence. Joshua (John David Washington, "Tenet"), a hardened ex-special forces agent grieving the disappearance of his wife (Gemma Chan, "Eternals"), is recruited to hunt down and kill the Creator, the elusive architect of advanced AI who has developed a mysterious weapon with the power to end the war… and mankind itself. Joshua and his team of elite operatives journey across enemy lines, into the dark heart of AI-occupied territory… only to discover the world-ending weapon he’s been instructed to destroy is an AI in the form of a young child (newcomer Madeleine Yuna Voyles).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aryn, a team with experience in AWS big data and database services, has come out of stealth and raised $7.5M in series seed funding.
 
Their mission is to bring generative AI to OpenSearch and data preparation.
 
They aim to use generative AI models to process unstructured data for tasks such as information extraction, question-answering, summarization, and content generation.
 
Aryn's conversational search approach empowers users to interact with their unstructured enterprise data.
 
They have developed a conversational search stack consisting of a semantic data preparation system called Sycamore, semantic search with OpenSearch, and conversational capabilities in OpenSearch.
 
Generative AI powers each component of the stack, leading to higher quality answers and ease of use.
 
Developers can quickly build and deploy applications like question-answering, chatbots, and research platforms using Aryn's stack without needing expertise in AI and search.
 
Aryn's stack is 100% open source, making it accessible to developers.

A mobile phone’s camera is a powerful tool for capturing everyday moments. However, capturing a dynamic scene using a single camera is fundamentally limited. For instance, if we wanted to adjust the camera motion or timing of a recorded video (e.g., to freeze time while sweeping the camera around to highlight a dramatic moment), we would typically need an expensive Hollywood setup with a synchronized camera rig. Would it be possible to achieve similar effects solely from a video captured using a mobile phone’s camera, without a Hollywood budget?

 Spearheading the AI Universe - Meta AI Chatbot
  
The “advanced conversational assistant” is set to enhance Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram services and will be incorporated into upcoming Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and Quest 3.
 Real-time information capabilities have been bolstered through a partnership with Microsoft Bing, and image generation is powered by a new model, Emu.
  
A Galaxy of AI Personalities
  
Meta rolled out 28 AIs in beta, featuring sterling personas such as Snoop Dogg, Tom Brady, Kendall Jenner, and Naomi Osaka, thus amplifying the interactivity quotient.
  
AI Studio - Empowering Businesses
  
The AI Studio Platform is equipped to enable businesses to build AI chatbots for messaging services on Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger.
 Also, Meta will provide a sandbox tool in the upcoming year for users to experiment with creating their own AI.
  
Generative AI Stickers - A New Co-creating Experience
  
AI editing tools will allow users to edit images and co-create content with friends.
 The tool uses Llama 2 and the new image generation model, Emu, to convert text prompts into stickers in seconds.
  
Ray-Ban Smart Glasses with Meta AI
  
The Ray-Ban smart glasses are equipped with Meta AI, allowing users to receive information, incite creativity, and manage the glasses using just their voice.

 Unlike Llama 2 or other open source, we don't have access to the model weights for GPT-4, Claude or Bard, so Benchmark Evals are being run through either APIs or the chat Interface. So how do we know that the model isn't being Boosted by custom web-searching abilities or RAG? While GPT-4 might have a turnoff option, I'm pretty sure Bard is always online, being built by google. So how do we trust benchmarks? Also, have any opensource been tested after Websearch/RAG?

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become essential for solving a wide range of tasks, from standard supervised learning (image classification using ViT) to meta-learning. The most commonly-used paradigm for learning DNNs is empirical risk minimization (ERM), which aims to identify a network that minimizes the average loss on training data points. Several algorithms, including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and Adagrad, have been proposed for solving ERM. However, a drawback of ERM is that it weights all the samples equally, often ignoring the rare and more difficult samples, and focusing on the easier and abundant samples. This leads to suboptimal performance on unseen data, espe…]]></summary>

 The mission was precise: Write a prompt to yield an SAT-style multiple-choice question that rigorously tests a student's understanding of "Algebraically solving systems of 2 linear equations in 2 variables". The challenge didn't end there; the question produced had to meet the hard/difficult mark set by real SAT questions.
 Using the OpenAI Playground, we conducted incisive iterations, testing each prompt separately to mitigate any bias from prior outputs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am searching for a relatively simple dataset to train a regressor that has some structure in its predictions. Can't be too tiny cause I have to try out a NN architecture. It must have at least some continuous feature but can also have additional categorical or related discrete structures. I usually work with vision tasks, so I am not sure if I miss something obvious I could try? Open for ideas! 
 I thoughts about predicting rows in some tabular dataset? Anything suitable that comes to mind?

 The aim of this platform is two-fold:
  
Making Machine Learning accessible to anyone and not just Data Scientists or experienced software developers. By offering the possibility to design, train and test Machine Learning models directly via GUI, being an experienced software developer is no longer a pre-condition for creating ML models
 Making Machine Learning model creation, training and testing faster for experienced Data Scientists / Machine Learning Engineers. By drastically reducing the time needed to set up environments, import data and define models, Domeis allows Machine Learning practitioners to focus on trying out and compare different models/approaches.

 Our opensource library SheepRL 🐑 can be used to test whether the game dynamics is well defined: what if a player can finish the game with just a few moves? 🎮
 This video shows that our agent (Kasumi, on the left) is able to win the game in the hardest modality by standing down and throwing kicks. 🥊
 This can be helpful for a game developer to:
 ​
  
understand where and how intervene to achieve a more playful game
 
predict and correct bugs early in the game development process
 enhance the gaming experience and final product quality
 reduce time and resources spent on debugging.
  
The game has changed 🔥 and it is up to us to play it with (human + artificial) intelligence!
 Thanks to u/DIAMBRA_AIArena for the video!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a beginner in Data Science. I have recently enrolled in the supervised machine learning algorithm by Andrew Ng in Coursera. I am now familiarized with linear regression, gradient descent. However, I faced a certain issue. 
 In the optional lab, there was a task to calculate the value of the cost function using gradient descent for linear regression. I wrote the code in my notebook by myself and cross checked it to be correct. However, the desired output of w,b are very much different but the cost function yields a better result in my code. Another factor, I noticed that have to scale only thex variables, leaving the values of y. I have two major queries now: 
  
Is the yielding of different w,b values fine as long as the cost function is minimum? (w is a numpy array) 
 Why do scale the x variables only? Why don't scale the y variables? 
  
Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Me and my sister have a small project we are thinking about working on. The idea is basically that we are going to enter the same prompt, separately, into an image generating a.i of some sort (Dalle2 etc) for a period of time and hopefully see the result change. We would probly pick words or frases that are topical and debated. This only works though if the a.i isnt just trained on old data and has active connection to the internet. MY question is therefor, is there an a.i right now that would fit the task?
 Sorry if the question is dumb or i didnt explain myself clearly!

The motivation for developing this package is to eliminate the risks of binary or pickle formats.

Nevertheless, it will be precious if the community utilizes this library and provides us with their feedback about improving the package's interface and prioritizing future developments. Your cooperation would be invaluable to us.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Was asked something similar to the following question in an interview for a ML role and was curious how others would answer this:
 Say you have a dataset with one feature column and one label column (with different classes). Assume this data is too large to fit into memory and could be infinite in size (e.g data is coming in as a stream). How would you train a ML model on this data to accurately predict the label?
 Followup: instead of one feature column, what if you had several thousand? How would you decide which features to use given the size of the dataset? 
 I discussed online sampling (resevoir sampling, etc) as a way to get a training dataset that could fit in memory + continually train on that but the interviewer did not seem convinced. Any thoughts?

Document retrieval (search) system: We have a (source) document with us and we're trying to find a matching document in a database.

 A search engine: We have a query comprised of both text and an image (like google image search allows text to be added to the query as well). Each search result will be a website with text and image attributes (for simplicity, webpage title and at most one image)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not sure it's the right place for this, but I was going through the proofs in the "original" 1992 technical notes of Q-learning, and a couple of points raised some questions:
 1) In the Proof of lemma B.4:
 https://preview.redd.it/7g6pputdqwqb1.png?width=1006&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe4afeac3b06deee6c80105b280a0085bdcfbe51
 where do P_{xy}^2(a_2) and R_x(a_2) come from? If we apply the definitions of Q'(x, a_1, a_2) and Q(x, a_1, a_2) to get the bound, P_{xy}^2(a_2) and R_x(a_2) should not be there. Are they just notation errors or is it correct and I'm missing something?
 ​
 2) I don't quite get how the bounds on P and R are computed in Section 3.2:
 https://preview.redd.it/p06ysjewqwqb1.png?width=962&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5929e701099dc6e4543efe7681f96f12f543fa8
 Considering the results in B.4 (i.e., the bounds for the distance between the chain's P, R and the real ones), I don't understand how they arrive at this conclusion. 
 ​
 I'd greatly appreciate any intuitions about these, or if someone can point me in the right direction :)

 I am trying to detect the 9 squares of a face of a Rubik’s Cube through a camera. The idea is that I want to use my computer camera and tell the user to show all the Rubik’s Cube faces and read the faces so I can feed it to a solver.
 Here are the steps I have tried so far:
  
Sharpened square edges
 Obtained binary image and removed noise
 Detected and extracted squares
  
Some methods I used were using different blurs and cv functions but nothing worked. Sometimes, it can get all 9 squares but sometimes it doesn't. There also seems to be a difference for different colors; for example; the model can detect green squares easier than yellow squares.
 Can anyone provide advice as to how I can detect the squares on the face?

 I’m trying to do a regression algorithm for a dataset where I have a graph for each patient I have representing a location in their brain from MRI images. Right now, I don’t have a ton of data, so I’m looking for some way to take each graph I have and get a feature vector for it to put into a regression algorithm. So for 100 patients, I have 100 graphs, I’d like to have 100 feature vectors representing each patients graph. 
 My issue is trying to find some algorithm that takes in the entire graph and outputs a single feature vector. I’ve been looking at some libraries but they all seem wildly scattered. I don’t want to grab a bunch of nose embeddings and do some elementary merge of them, like an average or sum, etc. Any help in pointing me to some Python libraries that can help me do this, or algorithms, or anything. Thank you so much.

 Am training a variational auto encoder. First I tried with batch normalization before I send the data to the network and someone probably wisely pointed out that it's not correct. If I don't use batch norm then my training fails due to numerical instability. I then tried scaling my data before hand using standard scaler from sklewrn. And now my training works. Is this reasonable?
 Any other thoughts?

I have to reshape my prediction data so it works with inverse_transform, but in the video he doesn't do this. If I don't reshape it I get an error, but I think when I do reshape it it messes with the data.
 The predicted values are all very similar. I've tried messing with epoch and batch sizes, and changing other metrics like prediction_days, but nothing has worked.
 This is what the prediction data looks like when plotted, and this is what it looks like when printed. Does anyone know what could be causing this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Automatic code generation has always been an integral part of programming: compilers, synthesis tools, convertors, etc. are examples of classic code generators. Now, with such powerful LLMs at hand, it is only natural to try to find new ways to generate codes. The question is: are LLMs the right tool for code generation?
 There are two sides to code generation: (1) understanding the intent (a.k.a. capturing the spec) (2) writing the code. LLMs are great for (1), but not so good for (2).
 This is an example of using LLM for general-domain code generation:
 https://github.com/RoboCoachTechnologies/GPT-Synthesizer 
 You can see that the main focus here is to properly capture the spec, and that's where LLMs shine.
 LLMs solution for a general-domain code generation may not be complete or optimized. It is always easier to break the problem and solve code generation in a specific domain. Here you can see how much better and cleaner the output of code generation can be when it is limited to a specific domain (robotics domain, ROS in particular, in this case):
 https://github.com/RoboCoachTechnologies/ROScribe
 What are your thoughts on using LLMs for code generation?

 To this end, I had the following new rule idea:
  
If it's your first time at Fight If it's your first post in this subreddit, it needs to be a link to arxiv (Or, more generally, the number of your non-arxiv posts cannot exceed the number of your arxiv posts)
 All arxiv posts must be standard links to the abstract page (to catch reposts and to connect discussions of the same paper in different subreddits)
 An arxiv post must be a paper you've read yourself, and you should post a comment describing what you liked and DIDN'T like about it (Let the airing of grievances begin! I think this will help seed the discussion, which is really the raison d'être of this subreddit)
 If the post or the comment get downvoted, they do not count.
  
What do you think? Will this help steer this subreddit in the right direction? Is this enforceable?

 A new paper from UNC Chapel Hill proposes VIDEODIRECTORGPT, a two-stage framework attempting to address multi-scene video generation:
 Here are my highlights from the paper:
  
Two-stage approach: first a language model generates detailed "video plan", then a video generation module renders scenes based on the plan
 Video plan contains multi-scene descriptions, entities/layouts, backgrounds, consistency groupings - guides downstream video generation
 Video generation module called Layout2Vid trained on images, adds spatial layout control and cross-scene consistency to existing text-to-video model
 Experiments show improved object layout/control in single-scene videos vs baselines
 Multi-scene videos display higher object consistency across scenes compared to baselines
 Competitive open-domain video generation performance maintained
  
The key innovation seems to be using a large language model to plot detailed video plans to guide overall video generation. And the video generator Layout2Vid adds better spatial and temporal control through some clever tweaks. The separation of these tasks seems to matter.

To my delight, he was impressed and has now tasked me with researching and developing a ChatGPT-like chatbot, but with access to our university's extensive data.
 Here's where I need your help: my professor wants this chatbot to be hosted on our university's systems due to privacy concerns, which means I can't use ChatGPT's API. I've been given access to Sol HPC, but I'm finding it quite confusing to get started.
 I'm looking for advice, tips, or any resources that can help me embark on this journey. Has anyone here worked on a similar project, or does anyone have experience with Sol HPC or building chatbots with local data sources? Any guidance or insights would be greatly appreciated!
 Thank you in advance for your help. This project means a lot to me, and I want to make sure I'm heading in the right direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OpenAI's much-touted model GPT-4, lauded for its multimodal abilities, including advanced image recognition, still has significant flaws. These glitches range from inventing facts to misinterpreting chemicals' images and hate symbols, according to a new paper from OpenAI.
 To stay ahead of AI developments, look here first.
 https://preview.redd.it/seg5x4zn3uqb1.png?width=1108&format=png&auto=webp&s=635a6c58cf6255f62d8eae3077678864e5b0e248
 Unintended GPT-4V behaviors
  
GPT-4V has a tendency to hallucinate or invent facts with unwarranted confidence.
 The model struggles to make correct inferences, sometimes creating fictional terms by wrongly combining text strings.
 It misinterprets certain symbols of hate and can give incorrect answers in the context of medical imaging.
  
OpenAI’s mitigation strategies
  
OpenAI has implemented various safeguards to prevent GPT-4V's misuse, such as breaking CAPTCHAs or using images to infer personal details.
 The company insisted that GPT-4V is not to be used for identifying dangerous chemicals from image structures.
 OpenAI acknowledged it has a long way to go in refining the model and is working on it.
  
Discrimination and bias
  
When OpenAI’s production safeguards are disabled, GPT-4V displays bias against certain sexes and body types.
 The paper reported offensive responses related to body positivity when prompted by an image of a woman in a bathing suit.

 This means my data has 208 features (200 for the grid cubes being on/off, 7 for the "next shape" box, and 1 for the labeled best move.
 I currently have 9460 labeled samples and have done some preliminary fitting here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/conlan/tetris-ai?scriptVersionId=144388350 with a highest f1_macro score of 0.431090.
 Does anyone have suggestions for which direction to take from here to improve? Currently I see:
  
Collect More Data
 Tune Hyperparameters
 Rework Features
  
I'm hesitant to rework the features as that would require telling the model more specifics and would like to keep it abstract, but maybe 200 is crazy high? Or maybe <10k samples is too low and I should just keep collecting data?
 Thanks in advance!

They cannot understand simple instructions as well anymore. I had a paragraph of information for one of my classes that I wanted it to make more straightforward for me before I actually went to class the next day. I spent like 30 minutes trying to get it to do that and eventually just ended up giving up. Why dont language models feel as sharp as they did say a year ago? I wish I had more examples to share.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all – I’m new to this sub-Reddit, so hopefully I’m in the right place.
 I am working on an audio production that will span multiple episodes and hopefully multiple seasons. It will require many characters, ranging in gender, age, ethnicity, etc. I am a decent voice actor and can do many of the roles myself, but some of them I cannot fake using my voice alone.
 My budget is very limited, so I was hoping to find some type of software I can change my voice for the production. This can be during the recording process, or after recording… As long as it gets the job done, and makes me sound like someone else entirely. 
 Does anybody know of a software that can achieve this? Most of the software I found either specifically designed to change users voice on the spot and is aimed at gamers changing your voice for live streams or in-game chats. I’m also on a Mac, which I know will be limiting.
 I’m having a hard time finding something I can use. Any suggestions will be helpful. 
 Thank you!
 EDIT: To clarify, I don’t want to just change my voice to sound different in general. I want to specifically sound like a woman, an elder man, or someone of a different ethnic background. Those are just a few examples.

I spend most of my time working in python , rust, and now mojo. Not an expert yet but my coding skills are improving. I have no degree and have taught myself most of what I know. That part is why Im looking for advice from you all. Practically every job post Ive seen has college requirements. Is it unlikely to get hired without a degree?
 Additional information: I'm currently working on projects for github but those arent quite done. My main interest is related to RL in game design. Applications of distributional RL in action dense environments and VR. Currently using Godot engine the most and have used pytorch, openai gym, and tensorflow (to a lesser degree). The abstract concepts of neural networks comes easy to me and Ive been following basic neurology as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ood morning everyone,
 I am currently reading the book of Mr. Burkov: Machine Learning Engineering. He talk about a step that might be helpful before training a ML model: Feature Scaling. Furthermore, he adds that before Feature Scaling, you might do Feature Transformation (Log, Square,...) in order to make your data look normal and have better models. How true do you think this statement is? Do you also transform your feature, and then scale them? How often do you do it? It is important for Regression or SVM, but do you do it also for other black box algorithms such as Random Forests? What are the best practices according to you?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit: I may be jumping the gun here but I think I figured it out (looks good so far). I give the episode reward for every action EXCEPT the "end early" action, now I will need to give some boost for shorter episodes to achieve the desired effect :) 
 I feel like I'm experiencing déjà vu, posing another DQN-related question. But, here's my issue:
 I've set up an environment where an agent can interact for 40 steps or choose to end the interaction early with a specific action. The catch is that the reward is only given at the end of the episode, which seems to be leading the agent to strongly favor the "end early" action. Despite all other steps getting a reward of 0, I assumed the long-term reward estimate, V(s_{t+1}), would mitigate this, but the agent still heavily gravitates towards ending the episode early.
 Attempted Solutions:
  
Distributed the end-of-episode reward across all prior actions taken by the agent.
  
Considering:
  
Replacing the "end early" action with a "do nothing" action, allowing the episode to always play out in full. However, this seems like it could introduce additional computational costs and noise.
  
Has anyone encountered a similar problem? I'd appreciate any advice or recommendations.

However, let's entertain the hypothetical situation where the insurrection following the 2020 U.S. presidential election had succeeded, with the understanding that this is speculative reasoning.
 In this alternate reality, the immediate consequences would be a constitutional crisis of unprecedented proportions. Faith in democratic institutions would be severely eroded, both domestically and internationally. Trump's retaining power in this manner would spark widespread protests, perhaps more intense and larger than those seen in the summer of 2020. The unrest would likely lead to a governmental response that could be more authoritarian, poss…]]></summary>

 and that the add is separate. this is in the official openai github and is relatively easy to read:https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/blob/master/src/model.py#L123-L130 (thx KingsmanVince)

 for some reason all the online materials are saying that there is a full norm layer before the mlp instead of inside of it

 Here are some of the other posts obviously rule-breaking or off-topic that mods do NOT remove:
  
A person asking for help with their motherboard
 A person asking about statistics
 A person asking for machine learning roadmap
 Another asking-for-roadmap post
 ... the list goes on with absolute beginner questions, and low-quality posts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The European Union is urging the implementation of more safeguards against the risks posed by generative AI tools to free and fair debate in democratic societies, especially during elections.
 
The EU's values and transparency commissioner has highlighted the potential threat of AI-generated disinformation to elections and called for platforms to be vigilant and provide efficient safeguards.
 
Mainstream platforms have made initial efforts to address the risks by implementing safeguards to inform users about the synthetic origin of content posted online.
 
The EU commissioner is meeting with representatives from OpenAI to discuss the issue.
 
An incoming pan-EU AI regulation, the EU AI Act, is expected to make user disclosures a legal requirement for generative AI technologies.
 
The EU's voluntary anti-disinformation Code has 44 signatories, including major social media and search platforms, as well as entities from the ad industry and civil society organizations.
 
Google, one of the signatories, has published a report discussing the social impacts of AI and its commitment to developing technology responsibly.
 
Google Search has published guidance on AI-generated content and plans to integrate new innovations in watermarking, metadata, and other techniques into its generative models.
 
The EU's Code of Practice on Disinformation is seen as a stop-gap measure until the EU AI Act is adopted and mandatory deepfake disclosures are enforced.

 Train good Dreambooth models (or what newer methods are there for style and object training?)
 Run and compare various open-source LLMs (should be able to run 70b models?
 Generate something of decent length with MusicGen
 Gaussian Splatting
 Distribute voice recognition, TTS, audio2face, LLM, and rendering across 2 or 3 machines to create a realistic virtual human (suggestions for excellent TTS would be appreciated)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I learned about DeepNash and R-NaD yesterday. I read the Deepmind article, Science paper, and the source code of rnad.py. But I don't think I understand it! Part of this is that they didn't define all the terms and Greek they use in the paper, and part of it is that I don't have academic ML experience.
 Below is my attempt to summarize the paper in non-academic terms. I'm trying to show that I did my homework, and also I'm trying to invoke Godwin's Law in the hopes that someone will come along and correct me.
 Here goes:
 Naïve reinforcement learning doesn't work with simultaneous choice games such as matching pennies or Rock-Paper-Scissors.
 In naïve RL, If I choose Rock as my move, my opponent chooses Scissors as their move, and I see that I won, that will reinforce a belief that Rock is a "good" move and Scissors is a "bad" move. But this isn't true!
 This means that, during selfplay, a naïve RL agent will just cycle through strategies, as the timestep-(τ_n) agent learns how to beat the timestep-(τ_n-1) agent. The agent will never learn that RPS is a game about staying unpredictable!
 R-NaD fixes this by adjusting the reward function. I think "regularizing" is ML-academic speak for "adjusting". It adjusts the reward function in such a way that the agent will converge at a Nash equilibrium strategy.
 The paper's equation (1) describes how the regularization works. They didn't explain all the terms, though. I still don't know what a_i represents. But I think it corresponds to parts of the code like this line and this line.
 The key is that we're merging policies from multiple epochs and making sure that the current agent's move probabilities fare well against not only itself, but also against its previous two generations. They've proven that three generations is all you need to eventually converge to a Nash equilibrium.
 So... that's my understanding. Does anyone with actual ML experience want to weigh in?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Researchers from Microsoft have just proposed using a psychological assessment tool called the Defining Issues Test (DIT) to evaluate the moral reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, ChatGPT, etc.
 The DIT presents moral dilemmas and has subjects rate and rank the importance of various ethical considerations related to the dilemma. It allows quantifying the sophistication of moral thinking through a P-score.
 In this new paper, the researchers tested prominent LLMs with adapted DIT prompts containing AI-relevant moral scenarios.
 Key findings:
  
Large models like GPT-3 failed to comprehend prompts and scored near random baseline in moral reasoning.
 ChatGPT, Text-davinci-003 and GPT-4 showed coherent moral reasoning with above-random P-scores.
 Surprisingly, the smaller 70B LlamaChat model outscored larger models in its P-score, demonstrating advanced ethics understanding is possible without massive parameters.
 The models operated mostly at intermediate conventional levels as per Kohlberg's moral development theory. No model exhibited highly mature moral reasoning.
  
I think this is an interesting framework to evaluate and improve LLMs' moral intelligence before deploying them into sensitive real-world environments - to the extent that a model can be said to possess moral intelligence (or, seem to possess it?).
 Here's a link to my full summary with a lot more background on Kohlberg's model (had to read up on it since I didn't study psych). Full paper is here

Have someone tried ? Is there some weights in the nature already trained for the instructor model ?
 I have found the GitHub associated with the paper but it obviously only contain the code for training but no information about approximate token used or anything like that.

I’ve decided to make it a classification problem and predict the zone of rainfall as in 0-0.5 in inches or 1-1.5 inches. My data set has ~40,000 samples however i have noticed that 24,000 of them have 0.0 as the amount of rainfall. And a high percentage of the rest are very low like below 0.5 inch. I’m wondering if there’s still a way to create the type of model I had originally intended or not. Is there a way to reduce the size of my data set , specifically the amount of low values without losing important feature information? Thank you and any help is appreciated :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, long story short, I've used Otter.ai for recording, and transcribing my ideas on the fly and it's really, really good!
 The only thing it is missing for my use case is to be able to edit the transcripts (remove some parts for example) and then have that piece be removed from the audio file as well, so you can see how long is the actual useful part that.. I also need it to have an app, since the whole point of doing this is catching ideas that just rush to my head. Apparently DeScribe has this option, but I haven't tried it and it doesn't work on mobile anyways. 
 I know it's probably not available, but does anyone know any services similar to this? I don't need an AI bot, don't care about integration with other apps, and will not use it for meetings. 
 TLDR: I just want an app to be able to record, and then transcribe my ideas, and then allow me to edit/fine-tune the transcript and have the audio file be edited in the same way as well..
 Thanks!

 Errors in object detection examples found via cleanlab.
 Annotators of real-world object detection datasets often make such errors and many other mistakes. To avoid training models on erroneous data and save QA teams significant time, you can now use automated algorithms invented by our scientists.
 Our newest paper introduces Cleanlab Object Detection: a novel algorithm to assess label quality in any object detection dataset and catch errors (named ObjectLab for short). Extensive benchmarks show Cleanlab Object Detection identifies mislabeled images with better precision/recall than other approaches. When applied to the famous COCO dataset, Cleanlab Object Detection automatically discovers hundreds of mislabeled images, including errors where annotators mistakenly: overlooked an object that should’ve had a bounding box, sloppily drew a box in a poor location, or chose the wrong class label for an annotated object.
 We’ve open-sourced one line of code to find errors in any object detection dataset via Cleanlab Object Detection, which can utilize any existing object detection model you’ve trained. 
 For those interested, you can check out the 5-minute tutorial to get started and the blog to read the details.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on my thesis and want to perform 3D scene understanding and VQA. My scenes would be textured meshes (or pointclouds). My goal is not only to know the objects present in the scene but also the spatial relationships between them, like chair is in front of the couch, bottle is on the table etc. I want to know if there is a 3D scene encoder like the 2D image encoder ViT L/14 from CLIP. 
 My search hasn't resulted much yet in this direction, but I have come across papers that render a 3D scene in multiple angles and then use 2D scene encoders on them. 
 So I'd like to ask the community: 
  
Are there 3D scene encoders like CLIP ViT 
 If not, is there's any other way that I can approach this problem.

 AIRI researchers are thrilled to share some exciting news with you all. Our paper, "StyleDomain: Efficient and Lightweight Parameterizations of StyleGAN for One-shot and Few-shot Domain Adaptation", has been accepted to ICCV 2023! 🥳
  
Abstract: Domain adaptation of GANs is a problem of fine-tuning GAN models pretrained on a large dataset (e.g., StyleGAN) to a specific domain with few samples (e.g., painting faces, sketches, etc.). While there are many methods that tackle this problem in different ways, there are still many important questions that remain unanswered. In this paper, we provide a systematic and in-depth analysis of the domain adaptation problem of GANs, focusing on the StyleGAN model. We perform a detailed exploration of the most i…]]></summary>

The human brain is perhaps the most computationally complex machine in existence, consisting of networks of billions of cells. Researchers currently don’t understand the full picture of how glitches in its network machinery contribute to mental illnesses and other diseases, such as dementia. However, the emerging connectomics field, which aims to precisely map the connections between every cell in the brain, could help solve that problem. While maps have only been created for simpler organisms, technological advances for mapping even larger brains can enable us to understand how the human brain works, and how to treat brain diseases.

 For example Im in the process of switching jobs and one of the things I’ve learnt is that when delivering results (during fire drills) the way I write my code is focused on simply getting the results out vs being organized, efficient and scalable. While I get from point A to point B the way I get from point A to point B is not the most efficient. I think something I can do is take a step back and take a top down approach to problem solving when I enter my new role.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Training giant AI models like GPT-3 requires large resources - thousands of GPUs running for months. As a solo researcher without access to that kind of scale, I can't easily reproduce experiments and findings from papers on huge models.
 But a new paper from DeepMind shows you can recreate and study training instabilities seen in massive models by using small ones.
 The key is increasing the learning rate:
  
This reproduces "attention collapse" where the model focuses on just a few tokens, like overfitting.
 Also can reproduce "logit divergence" where output values drift unstably.
  
These issues have been reported when scaling up to billions of params. The cool part is techniques that fix them for giant models also work for small models:
  
qk-layernorm prevents attention collapse.
 Adding a "z-loss" term stops logit divergence.
  
Some other highlights from the paper include:
  
Longer warmup helps stability, especially for bigger models.
 Decoupling LR and weight decay improves stability.
 Depth increases sensitivity much faster than width.
 Can predict upcoming issues from scaling trends.
 Default epsilon hurts at large scale.
  
If the authors are right, one more tool that lets researchers study and even help train giant models without Google-size resources. Small models can guide large model development, sort of like how you can build a scale train set to study and improve how a railroad system works... for a lot less money than starting your own railroad company, buying land, building real tracks, etc.

 This partnership is the first public milestone for Keen Technologies, following its initial funding announcement in August of 2022. The initial $20M round was led by Nat Friedman, Danial Gross, Patrick Collision, Tobi Lutke, Jim Keller, Sequoia Capital, and Capital Factory. In December 2022, Carmack departed as consulting CTO at Meta to focus his efforts on AGI.
 Sutton is the principal founder of the field of reinforcement learning. His work with Keen Technologies advances previously announced research priorities to understand basic computational intelligence. Through this work, documented in part in The Alberta Plan, Sutton seeks to understand and create long-lived computation agents that interact with a vastly more complex world and come to predict and control their sensory input signals.

 The double-double approach to the evaluation of quads represents an FP128 number as an unevaluated sum of two double numbers (like 1 and 1e-17 - the second one is smaller than 1 ULP of the first one). This increases the significand from 53 to 106 bits, allowing to do operations on numbers varying up to 32 orders of magnitude. The range of numb…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TYPO IN THE TITLE: I wanted the title to be "why should neural networks be end-to-end?" My lazy ass was swipe texting on my phone and this typo happened. FML
 Especially in robotics, there's been a lot of research for end-to-end neutral networks where an image is the input and the control action is the output, for say, tasks like pick an object and place it somewhere. I feel this is very restrictive while developing such a solution because it tightly couples the "control" network to the "estimation" network. This reduces modularity in building the solution, i.e., if I find a better controller architecture (machine learning based or rule based) I'm unable to use that for the task I'm solving. Moreover it seems like the generalizability of this task suffers because training this network to do this task may make it very good at only doing that specific task and the explainability of the decision making goes out of the window because it is black box. Additionally doesn't more parameters mean requiring more data to train the model? I don't see much use from such network architectures. However, I do see the applications in machine translation where you simply train the encoder and decoder to the target language at the same time with a single loss function. It seems useful there, but maybe not so much in robotics.
 Can someone tell me their thoughts on end-to-end architectures? Let's have a healthy discussion
 Edit: typo

 I have access to thousands of vintage postage stamps which also have cancelation stamps from when they were mailed. I'm thinking of publishing a book, and I want to create clean reproductions of the stamp designs without the cancelation marks.
 If I train AI on high resolution scans of 10 to 40 identical stamps, is there a tool that can look for commonalities within the patterns and then remove conflicting artifacts (cancelation stamps, tears, and smudges)? I'm aiming for a 400% enlargement that shows off clean and accurate detail. 
 What tools would I need? I’d prefer not to upload these scans to the web. Are there downloadable tools available? I’m technologically savvy and very experienced in graphic design software but have no experience in coding.
 All of this can be done manually in Photoshop, of course. But with thousands of stamp designs, I’d like to automate as much as I can.
 Thanks in advance for any insights!

Many people believe that since humans invented AI, they should be able to regulate and manage it for their own benefit.
 
However, this belief is misguided as AI is a new and potentially dangerous situation that requires careful consideration.
 
The author argues that AI is an evolutionary process that humans don't fully understand and cannot control.
 
The latest developments in AI, such as large language models and deepfakes, are causing anxiety and raising questions about the future implications of this technology.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[this is mostly a cross-post from r/rust as my initial attempt failed because of some external links
 We've first announced Candle, a minimalist ML framework in Rust 6 weeks ago. Since then we've focused on adding various recent models and improved the framework so as to support the necessary features in an efficient way. You can checkout a gallery of the examples, supported models include:
  
Large language models: LLaMA, LLaMA v2, Falcon, Phi-v1.5, StarCoder.
 Quantized models with the llama.cpp approach: LLaMA, T5, Phi-v1.5.
 Image generation: Stable Diffusion, Wuerstchen.
 Computer Vision: DINOv2, yolo-v3, yolo-v8, Segment-Anything Model.
 Text-to-speech: Whisper.
  
One of the big upside of the pure Rust approach is that models can run directly in the browser using WASM, these can be accessed through this collection, you can try out Yolo, Whisper, Segment-Anything, T5, Llama2-c from your web browser.
 Finally, in order to present a use case where Candle has unique capabilities, we've built a quantized version of the recently released Phi-v1.5 LLM. You can try it out with the following command, this uses a q4k quantized model resulting in very fast inference on CPU while still producing pretty nice texts.
 $ cargo run --example phi --release -- \ --prompt "Explain how to find the median of an array and write the corresponding python function.\nAnswer:" \ --quantized --sample-len 200 Explain how to find the median of an array and write the corresponding python function. Answer: The median is the middle value in an array. If the array has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle values. def median(arr): arr.sort() n = len(arr) if n % 2 == 0: return (arr[n//2 - 1] + arr[n//2]) / 2 else: return arr[n//2] 
 It's still very early days for Candle so please let us know if you start using it and run into some rough edges. We look forward to Rust getting a lot more usage in the ML space!

 The authors claim the computational advantage of their approach is partly the simple architecture. 
 Looking at figure 3 and 4, I cannot quite see why this is considered a simpler architecture to older GANs,say DCGAN. I get the technical argument that the generator only has one convolutional layer, but figure 3 has lots of up sampling layers, and the discriminator has plenty of downsampling layers. So why is this considered a simple GAN model? 
 Any pointers appreciated.

These interns, recruited from vocational schools, face poor working conditions and subminimum wages.
 
Recent regulations require employers to pay interns minimum wage and prohibit schools from assigning repetitive work.
 
Tech giants like Baidu have partnered with vocational schools to create data annotation internships in less-developed regions, backed by local governments.
 
The exploitation of student interns in China's AI industry raises concerns about labor rights and fair compensation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First of all anyone offended by that question - heartiest apology. I am using it myself profusely at the moment. The reason for me asking this question, over last few weeks / months, I have been gradually educating myself in machine learning using Tensorflow and have been able to train multiple models using only one of the model zoo candidates. All the other pre trained models have failed me so far.
 I went onto Tensorflow official forum / Stackoverflow / Tensorflow github with specific error messages that I am getting on Ubuntu with Nvidia card / Mac M2 and there has been absolute radio silence in response to multiple posts over last month. Found many open issues listed since 2020 on the same line as mine i.e. identical error messages that people have come across.
 Finally after about a month of being on TF forum, I direct messaged an official TF2 dev who kindly responded with answers. I haven't succeeded yet with any of the pre trained model from the official section. Only one model from research section is working so far for me i.e. Faster_rcnn_resnet_50_640x640 ..
 Thus the question. Kindly help me enlighten myself with where is this thing headed. Should I consider switching to Pytorch or some alternative ? If yes what alternatives do you recommend ? TIA

Recently I had even worse experiences with newly-released ChatGPT 3.5 fine-tuning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As software projects grow, changing code across entire repositories becomes tedious & error-prone. Tasks like migrating APIs or updating dependencies require complex edits across files. I explored a new approach from Microsoft Research to automate these "repository-level" coding challenges with AI.
 Their new paper proposes CodePlan - an AI system that breaks repository tasks into incremental steps guided by planning & analysis.
 Key points:
  
Uses LLMs like GPT-3 for localized code edits
 Maintains validity across repository via incremental analysis
 Adaptively plans multi-step changes based on code dependencies
 Significantly outperformed baselines on API migration & temporal edits
 Automated tasks across 168 file C# codebase
 2-3x more accurate edit locations than baselines
 Produced final valid codebases, unlike reactive approaches
  
The core insight is combining LLM strengths with rigorous planning based on dependency analysis. This automates interdependent code changes that naive LLM use struggles with (I personally have these kinds of issues all the time with GPT4 - lack of context about the entirety of the repo/how files fit together).
 I think CodePlan demonstrates AI can expand beyond small coding assists into large-scale engineering tasks. Planning + LLMs > LLMs alone. This could really improve productivity and code quality... at least for me :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I made a FOSS baby sleep tracking system. The system tracks wake/sleep status, and informs the user when their baby is likely to need a nap next. But it stopped working as soon as my baby started sleeping on his stomach, and started using blankets. The original version relied on anatomical features being visible.
 This version delivers the ability to train a blank slate SVM binary classifier on pictures of a user's baby, making it extremely biased (and resilient) to the custom behaviors the user's baby exhibits (blanket covering baby, teddy bear/other objects in crib, etc.). All generated data stays on your machine, nothing leaves the LAN.
 Video: https://youtu.be/8i0wHA_knKc?si=uhA4PpOYP0jMKLz1
 For obvious reasons I didn't have a dataset of babies sleeping.. so I wrapped a python/flask service with a React app which lets a user press a button to train the model w/ a new image from the camera's live stream. Then this model is invoked over time (+ other heuristics) to determine whether your baby is present and sleeping.
 I believe it works better than $300+ systems sold on the market, open sourced it: https://github.com/calebolson123/BabySleepCoach
 ​
 I'm thinking a fun next step for this project could be to apply privateGPT on the feature-engineered sleep records for a true "Sleep Coach"

 Given the rapid advancements in the field of AI, the next few months are going to be pivotal. One of the pressing priorities is addressing ethical concerns. As algorithms become more pervasive, making sure they don't perpetuate biases or make unethical decisions is critical. That's not just a "good to have"; it's foundational. We can't build trust in AI systems unless we tackle this head-on.
 Another biggie is interpretability. Black-box models are potent, sure, but they're not very useful if no one can understand how they're making decisions. This has real-world implications—think medical diagnoses or judicial systems. So, there's a strong push towards making AI more transparent and understandable, not just for experts but for everyone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Wikipedia page on Diffusion Models has been pretty minimal for an entire year. I feel like it should be fixed, so I fixed it finally. It strikes me odd that such a hot topic has such atrociously bad Wikipedia. I feel duty-bound to educate the near-future AI, since they'll be reading Wikipedia for the next few years at least.
 Currently I think it's mostly complete, but I still don't understand the mathematical details of DDIM (I tried reading the paper and could not understand it), or generally how it is possible to sample without noise. This is a serious problem since as far as I see most of practical diffusion models use deterministic sampling, and they are all based on the same principle as DDIM.
 If anyone could explain simply what DDIM is really doing that would be great. I understand part of the paper: that they constructed an entire family of distributions over trajectories that has the same two-point marginals.
 I also haven't got much in the section on Examples. If you think there are some interesting examples of Diffusion Models, please comment below.

After every 25000 TIMESTEPS, I will save my model in the models folder. When I train continuously, everything goes well, I can see it on the tensorboard graph. But when I continue training a model that has been trained, the graph suddenly drops. In the image below you can see that I retrain the models at SAC\_75000 and SAC\_100000 and SAC\_125000. The graph continuously decreases at those thresholds.I think something happended Can you give me a reason or share something with me? Thanks in advance.

I was unaware so much was going on in the space. I am CEO of an AI startup, we have a compassionate AI. Most of the alignment focus out there is on superintelligence, little out there focuses on building modern day Ai that benefits humans. That’s been my focus for 17 years when I dreamed up what was possible and sent a proposal to executives at the mfaang corporation I was working at. I found out back then business doesn’t give a rats ass about Ai that actively makes its users life’s better. Well now I have proof that customers care. I’m hoping to find some resources on Ai alignment groups, conferences, more books etc. I’ll need to hire skilled ml engineers who do give a rats ass. Compassionate Ai isn’t just feel good tech. It would be good to do some networking. AI alignment doesn’t have to wait for AGI and super intelligence. It can and should be a focus today. My startup is proving it. Hoping to find a conference to network and share our research.

 I'm lookin for some good AI github project to convert the language spoken in a video to a different language,like heygen / labs / video translate,but free. I mean,I can't afford prices like those and I think a few of us can,but I'm sure that the developers at heygen took some project born and hosted on some github and they have improved it. Would someone share some of those github projects ? thanks.

 ML is often portrayed as a magical field where anyone with a laptop and Python skills can build amazing AI systems. 
 The reality is less democratic: mastering ML requires gritty, systematic work best learned through formal training. You need rock solid foundations in math, programming, and core concepts—skills acquired through advanced education, which (almost always) is beyond self-taught hackers. 
 Most think a PhD is unnecessary, but the reality is that advanced degrees provide the deepest training. Patience and persistence do matter, but a PhD gives you a 10-year head start over weekend warriors. The hype overlooks the work and education needed to excel. This article has a great blueprint of all the required skills to become a ML Engineer (in the CV field).

 So I’ve got competing offers, one from the big 4 accounting firms as a software systems engineer - AI/ML (Big 4) and the other as a machine learning engineer. The startup salary is higher while big 4 is lower. Additionally the startup isn’t necessarily a unicorn it’s a relatively small startup with an interesting product but it doesn’t necessarily blow me away. The salary at the startup is 15 percent higher that that of the big 4 offer. For those wondering I did already negotiate the salary and they did increase it marginally. 
 I am conflicted because I think that the big 4 jobs will have
 1) more career growth 2) more potential future opportunities and 3) more networking potential
 Is this an accurate assessment? Which is the best job to take for maximum future potential?

This is a wonderful sub, and it's hard to please everyone on SUCH a broad topic... but it's intriguing to think about, as a lifelong magazine fan (and websites of course) - about using AI to filter, craft and create an amazing website/magazine ABOUT AI - well-categorized, maybe also human/editor curated/tweaked, but as fresh as ... well, the artificial sub but out of the Reddit bold/design into something ... well, something I'd read, visit a lot and love to help make work as a writer/editor (on the side of my "real" all-consuming gig of course;-)
 After all, if AI can 'make great code'/create great websites, maybe some folks out there are already trying to make this happen, for ease of information availability and organization. I can picture the departments/sections/categories now - I bet you can too!
 Anyone gone very far down that road yet (maybe the folks already doing the PC Magazines of the world) of organizing the vast fast-moving info beyond the AI Brews, Ben Parr's AI Analyst, etc.? Fun or a life-long journalist and tech geek (but not a coder, gamer etc.) to think about, at least!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been having a bit of an existential crisis as of late and wanted to ask for advice on how to move forward.
 I have a Master’s in CS with research experience and a few publications applying machine learning in a fairly niche area (So not novel from the ML side). Since graduating, I’ve worked ~2 years as an ML engineer in small company(Niche area, different than research).
 I’ve done quite well here and have played a critical role in taking several big greenfield projects to completion. 
 Most of my work is framing problems, understanding what’s possible with current research, then building the data pipelines, and training models(with small mods here and there). My main worry is that I might be approaching a point where there won’t be any more problems I’m capable of solving here. I’d imagine I’d hit the same wall at any future company with my current skill set.
 I’d like to continue working in CV/Graphics/Perception if possible, but I’d also like to be realistic about the competitiveness of this particular subfield and my general ability.
 I’ve been trying to up-skill and am struggling to self study MVG by Hartley and Zisserman. I’m also looking into OMCS to review low-level programming - maybe I can transition to optimizing ml/cv algorithms?
 It hit me recently that I don’t really know what to study/what I’d benefit from learning. Hence this post. Any advice would be most appreciated!

 Big tech companies are investing vast amounts of money to develop general models on which others will build. They'll develop interfaces to make it easier for others to fine-tune on top of their models. So that there will be less and less of a need for ML engineers that know how to create a deep learning model in Pytorch, and more and more of a need for data engineers that simply plug into pre-trained models. An AI assistant will also be quicker at coding up a more bespoke AI model for a companies needs, guided by data engineers.
 What do people think? Is this a scenario that they think will play out? Where will the demand for AI skills be coming from in the future?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LLMs are great with words but can't handle visual tasks like understanding images. Teaching them to use visual tools could make them much more capable.
 A new paper introduces GPT4Tools - a method to efficiently teach existing LLMs to invoke tools for visual tasks without proprietary data.
 My highlights from the paper:
  
Uses ChatGPT as a "teacher" to generate instructional data for other LLMs
 Fine-tunes LLMs like Vicuna on this data using selective weight tuning (keeps base model frozen)
 Allows smaller 13B LLM to match 175B GPT-3.5 on seen tools after tuning
 Data augmentation with negative/context samples was found to be the secret sauce to get this to work
 Can generalize to brand new visual tools in a zero-shot way
  
This is big because it shows we may not need hyper-expensive training of massive models to impart visual capabilities to LLMs. They seem to be generalizable enough that they can be taught to work with images. Some examples shown include counting objects or segmenting items in pictures using other tools.
 With this approach, existing models can be made multi-modal! Pretty cool.

 I have created a 3d model with mujoco (I have the xml file) how do I create an environment in gymnasium with this xml file?
 for the sake of an example let's say I have the xml file of the humanoid model how do I load this in gymnasium so that I could train it to walk? (this is just an example because the current project is harder to explain, but will use the humanoid model in the project)
 or is the approach that I'm trying is not appropriate at all? I came across this stackoverflow post where they say mujoco is itself good for this but was hard for me to understand due to lack of examples.
 would really appreciate some advice and guidance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just open-sourced (MIT License) semantic segmentation annotation tool powered by segment-anything model that I used for a while in my projects. Hopefully it will help someone as it seems to me that it is more suitable for small projects than popular huge web based annotation tools.
 Link to the project: SAMAT (any feedback in Discussions section on GitHub is appreciated)
 Features:
  
Brush annotation (opposed to polygons)
 Magic Wand (like in Photoshop) powered by segment-anything masks (it is optional, if you don’t have cool GPU to prepare masks)
  
samat showcase
 Why yet another annotation tool?
 Before starting this project I tried supervisely, segments.ai, roboflow and several others, but found them not convenient for my tasks.
 Their cons, I tried to fix with my tool:
  
Latency: they are web based, hence burden with irritating latency during labeling (SAMAT is snappy because it is a local desktop app)
 Complicated: too much features, hence overloaded UI (SAMAT is just a colored brush)
  
P.S. there is another labeling tool called SALT on github which also uses segment-anything model, but it follows different approach to UI/UX, may be it will be more suitable for you, so take a look at it too.

 Abstract: In this research, we explore the efficacy and potential of Generative AI models, specifically focusing on their application in role-playing simulations exemplified through Spyfall, a renowned mafia-style game. By leveraging GPT-4's advanced capabilities, the study aimed to showcase the model's potential in understanding, decision-making, and interaction during game scenarios. Comparative analyses between GPT-4 and its predecessor, GPT-3.5-turbo, demonstrated GPT-4's enhanced adaptability to the game environment, with significant improvements in posing relevant questions and forming human-like responses.

 I've listened to the entire lecture and am now going through these slides and I didn't understand the solution provided for the choices above in the image.
 So far I understand it like this. Noise basically means that the agent will not always do the action that you say. You say left and it will go left only 50% of the time. it will choose other actions randomly.
 so, Why is the answer to the (c) and (d) questions (2) and (3) respectively?
 I understand the learning rate but not how risking the cliff is affected by the noise.

Every explanation of the hyperplane state that all the points which are orthogonal to the vector w are in the hyperplane. However, all data point coordinates are defined wrt origin. So in order to attain this objective, we define the hyperplane as :
 wx = c
 This vector w is the vector which is normal to the hyperplane. And the data points x when dot producting with w outputting c are the points which are in the hyperplane due to the coordinates representation of x wrt origin.
 So points in the hyperplane are the points which when performing dot product with w equals 0 when the coordinates is defined wrt origin that lie in the hyperplane is equivalent to the points which when performing dot product with w equals c when the coordinates is defined wrt original origin (0) or (0,0) or ...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a potential school project, im currently exploring whether or not some of the success the transformer architecture has had in seq-to-seq applications and high-dimensional pattern recognition could be extended to certain (online) RL problems (mainly those with high dimensional environment as well as long-term planning). 
 This could be done by using an augmented transformer as a function approximator, probably in combination with a SOTA online-rl algorithm (such as PPO, but if you know something that generally performs better do tell). Due to some of the problems associated with highly complex models and sample efficiency, I also thought about training the model using imitation learning first (which should be no problem with policy gradient methods afaik, though some slight adjustments would have to be made). For context, I'm thinking on benchmarking the approach using AlphaStar unplugged.
 However, when looking at current literature, only very few papers directly use transformers this way. Transformers seem to be very sample efficient and to generalize very well, but they are still only really used in a purely offline context (sometimes without directly using RL-techniques, such as with the Decision Transformer). And, if they are used in an online context, then only in some really intricate combination with other models (such as in AlphaStar). 
 Is there a reason why the approach I am currently considering is not popular in literature? Thank you very much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using LGBM for regression, where the Target column's lagged values (7 columns for each lag day) are also used as predictors when training the model. Absence of the 7Day lag values severely increases MAE value.
 Now when using the model in production, if I use the complete data as training dataset, how to get the 7day lag value of the time period I'm planning to predict? I obviously won't have the target value, to calculate it's 7Day lag value. What to do now?
 To explain in more detail:
 So, I'm predicting sales amount (Target variable y). The model is trained on 20 predictors (X), and 7 of them are the lag value of the Target Variable, i.e. Sales Amount.
 The thing is, while preparing the model, I had access to both X & y dataset, thus I could easily calculate Y's Lag values.
 Now, when predicting for future timestamps, I won't be having y. So how do I calculate the lag values, which is required in the trained model's predictor columns now?

 Abstract:
  
Large language models (LLMs) often demonstrate inconsistencies with human preferences. Previous research gathered human preference data and then aligned the pre-trained models using reinforcement learning or instruction tuning, the so-called finetuning step. In contrast, aligning frozen LLMs without any extra data is more appealing. This work explores the potential of the latter setting. We discover that by integrating self-evaluation and rewind mechanisms, unaligned LLMs can directly produce responses consistent with human preferences via self-boosting. We introduce a novel inference method, Rewindable Auto-regressive INference (RAIN), that allows pre-trained LLMs to evaluate their own generation and use the evaluation results to guid…]]></summary>

LLMs have shown emergent abilities and can be used as aids to brainstorming.
 
GPT-4, an LLM, has been found to beat humans in creativity tests.
 
In an experiment, GPT-4 generated more, cheaper, and better ideas for a product than human students.
 
A professional working with GPT-4 can generate ideas at a rate of about 800 ideas per hour, making them 40 times more productive than a human working alone.
 
This technology is seen as a potential tool for corporations, similar to management consulting firms like McKinsey & Company.

I currently have 2 potential sources of primary data: PDBbind and CrossDocked2020. This would provide the protein-ligand structures. 
 PDBbind is a more robust and higher quality dataset from what I know, and easier to work with. The problem is that it only contains about 20,000 complexes, and I'm not sure if that is enough for training a transformer. CrossDocked2020 contains millions of entries but I'm not sure about the quality and ease of use. 
 Another dilemma is that I need/want to use a multi-task learning approach where the model is also being trained on bioactivity data, not just the structural information. This would require supplementation from sources like PubChem, ChEMBL, BDB, etc. and then I would need to align the data so it all matches up. 
 If anyone can provide some guidance I'd really appreciate it.

 If you were attending my presentation on tree models, what would you like to see (assuming this is a new topic for you too. but please provide feedback based on your [hopefully] extensive knowledge on this topic)?
 Here is what I have so far (based on google searches, some papers):
 -Introduction
 -Types of trees based on algo and techniques (basically classification trees and regression trees)
 -Then I am thinking of going off on a tangent about decision trees bec I have no clue about how to move this presentation forward
 -Real-world applications
 -Key takeaways (inserts clownface emoji)
 My prof asks the students questions about the topic as well. I am mostly concerned about WHAT to cover in 5 minutes without making look under-researched. Any redirection/suggestions will be appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(I'm a Software Engineer who knows almost nothing about ML / NLP, so, apologies in advance if this doesn't make any sense.)
 I had a shower thought around if tokenization could incorporate meaning, so the models could be trained on "thoughts" instead of subword tokens (which is probably closer to how we humans think). To expand a little bit, we could first cluster all the words (maybe using the current day LLMs), then each token (or "thought") in the new scheme could represent a group of related words, followed by refinements that would be less and less important.
 For example, (cop_thought, cop_refinement) -> cop, but (cop_thought, police_refinement) -> police etc.
 So the encoding step would involve an LLM (which could possibly be relatively smaller), whose output would go to the actual model but the decoding would still be fairly straightforward. This could possibly free up some additional capacity in the actual model, assuming this heavy lifting tokenization makes its job easier, but as I'm typing it, I guess I'm simply moving some of the semantic understand happening in the hidden layers of the current day LLMs explicitly to the tokenization (encoding) step, which may not really change anything (if not make it worse).
 I'm still curious what folks think, if there's any related efforts (and all the ways I'm wrong -- https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cunningham%27s_Law). Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Keep in mind I'm very new to machine learning. I have an idea for a project where I train an AI to detect instances of someone being highly confident in a treatment for a condition, maybe biased toward more unconventional treatments.
 I was thinking that there may be many instances of people who posted that they were cured or nearly cured of such and such disease by an unconventional treatment on a forum about the condition. It may have been discussed for a little while, but ultimately buried in the pages of the forum.
 The plan would be to annotate instances I can find of such scenarios, maybe like this:
  
[FIRST_PERSON_HIGH_CONFIDENCE_TREATMENT]I had severe [CONDITION]migraines[/CONDITION] for years, and nothing seemed to work. Then I tried [TREATMENT]grounding, where I walk barefoot on grass for 30 minutes every day[/TREATMENT]. I can [HIGH_CONFIDENCE]honestly say I've never felt better[/HIGH_CONFIDENCE]. My [CONDITION]migraines[/CONDITION] have reduced by 80%, and I'm [HIGH_CONFIDENCE]convinced this is a game-changer for me[/HIGH_CONFIDENCE].[/FIRST_PERSON_HIGH_CONFIDENCE_TREATMENT]
  
Then train an AI with that data, so that it could detect cases of a person talking about themselves (to avoid hearsay) and saying, with high confidence, that a treatment worked for a condition.
 Then millions of forum posts could be fed to the AI to detect these, and the resulting data could be used to possibly discover effective treatments that are not in the mainstream.
 Any tips on getting started? I know almost nothing about this kind of stuff, like what models I should use, how to annotate it best (should I use relational labels?), whether to use a transformer or something else, stuff like that. Suggestions for books or other resources fit for a beginner that could help me learn how this could be done would be great too.

 My Struggle:
 I get that attention involves multiplying "query" and "key" vectors to determine the importance of different words in a sequence, but I don't quite understand why this multiplication gives us a meaningful metric for importance.
 What I'm looking for:
 I'm comfortable with moderate level technicalities but require a deeper insight into the inner workings and rationale behind these mechanisms. Please share any insights, analogies, or technical details that can shed light on this concept.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am starting a ML course soon in college and I wanted to get a head start on the math part of things, since they keep saying the course is math heavy and hard. I know that it involves quite a lot of Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Probability and statistics, but what concepts in particular does ML focus on?
 If anyone has any Youtube or Udemy courses, as I have access to those, I would really appreciate it.
 For starters, I’m really aiming to just at least tackle the ML-specific math concepts.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR: New training approach proposed to help smaller AI models to achieve state-of-the-art translation performance
 Large AI models like GPT-3 have good performance on translation tasks, but some smaller models struggle.
 Researchers from Johns Hopkins and Microsoft propose a new 2-stage fine-tuning method called ALMA that unlocks stronger translation abilities in smaller models with just 7-13 billion parameters.
 How it works:
  
Fine-tune on monolingual data in non-English languages to improve comprehension
 Further fine-tune on small sets of high-quality human-translated parallel text
  
The authors claim this achieves SOTA-level translation using far less data and compute than conventional methods:
  
Matches performance of 175B parameter GPT-3 and 54B parameter NLLB with only 7-13B parameters
 Reaches NLLB-level quality with just 1 billion monolingual tokens and 18 hours of training
  
I think this shows that smaller models can reach SOTA translation with specialized fine-tuning, so we may not need endlessly bigger datasets and models to get better performance. Looks like deliberate tuning targeting key language skills could be more important.
 Full summary here. Paper (preprint) is here.

 So yes, it's obvious that we have pretty advanced AI-powered applications that can generate images, music, short stories, hell even objects for video games. I'm curious as to how crazy this is gonna get in the coming decade or even shorter like the next 4 to 5 years. I mean look at AI-generated images now, they're getting more and more sophisticated across various different styles of art. I think it's only a matter of time where you could take a certain image of a character or something tell the app "Hey make the same image but make the character's arm raised slightly to the left here" and bam all of a sudden you have an animation (and this may already be possible).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been reading the HyperDreamBooth paper and am confused about the number of parameters and corresponding matrix shapes in section 4.1 and figure 3 (below).
 ​
 Figure 3 from the paper
 Maybe there's something more than just matrix multiplication, because the numbers don't add up. If there are two matrices, A & B, of size n,r and r,m, and r = 1, and you multiply them, then it implies that n + m = 386k, which seems to be a bit much for a number of parameters in a single layer.
 Then we have two matrices of size a,r and r,b, where a = 100, b = 50 and there are 28k variables, according to the figure - in 4.1 they say 30k. If there's 30k, that would imply r = 200, for matrices of shape 100,200 and 200,50.
 I guess 386k and 28k are for the whole models, n and m differ from layer to layer, and r stays at one. Quite surprising to me that approximating a n,m shaped matrix with a product of n,1 and 1,m vectors would work. Even more surprising that apparently you could squeeze it further to 100,1 and 50,1.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone!
 Multi-part question.
  
I have scraped text (I repeat, text, and not structured data such as tables or something) from a medical site, and I want to know how to clean it. And when I say clean, I don't mean removal of html tags and such. I already have the paragraphs in plain text but there is a lot of spammy stuff like "You are not signed in; subscribe to this newsletter; by checking this box, I agree to the terms and conditions, etc." This text is not the exact same in all the paragraphs but there is high similarity. I would have thought there would be many tools to clean text and remove unrelated chunks like these but all I have been able to find has to do with cleaning html tags, changing date-time format and so on. Am I missing something or is this actually difficult?
  
Secondly, the spammy text I mentioned is from just one site. I will be eventually scaling to many sites and god knows what random text I'll have to clean then.
  
I used OpenAI embeddings and cosine similarity on the medical text to find similar paragraphs. The results were not great. Is there a way to improve the similarity search? I will be trying FAISS next but wanted to know what else I can do. It was suggested to me to use a pretrained embedding model specific to medical data. However, I found only one such model which is 20 gigs!
  
I'm just getting started with these, so, appreciate any help I can get.
 Thanks a ton!

My research is on various medical image segmentation problems, including brain 3D US (glioma), lung CT (interstitial lung disease in scleroderma patients), etc. using the PyTorch ecosystem (probably including frameworks such as MONAI)
 I'll have to conduct several experiments on various model architectures on parameters in the coming months. Specifically, these are what I'm gonna need:
  
Experiment tracking (model architecture, training configuration, hyperparameters, evaluation metrics)
 Model storage (would be nice if there's a better way to store my model's parameters other than storing tons of .pth file on my harddisk or google drive)
 (Optional) Visualization (sample predictions of the model on the training or validation sets, maybe every 20 epochs or sth)
 Would like to hear any suggestions from the community
  
I've found wandb, clearML, neptune, and Aim; but trying each of them individually would be too time-consuming considering my current schedule.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I've been taking a look at hypernetworks and noticed they've been used in some cool ways in RL with stuff like Qmix and this Metalearning paper.
 Quick recap:
  
f is our regular neural network: takes in input x and outputs y using weights \theta.
 g is the hypernetwork, it creates the weights \theta for f based on its own weights \phi and maybe the input x.
  
Original paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09106
 I watched this talk and it hinted that hypernetworks might even be better than our regular networks even for supervised learning regular tasks.
 So, I'm curious:
  
What's the deal with hypernetworks? What makes them good or not vs regular neural networks?
 I get that they're good for metalearning, but could they also be a game-changer for other things, like sample efficiency?
  
Does anyone have thoughts or reads on this? 
 Thanks!

Then, for scientific topics, I try to get a confirmation with Google using the keywords in the generated answer and google. For technical topics I can often check if it works.
 Some examples:
 For cooking, a topic I don't master enough to ask questions with the best keywords... 
 Are the spicy compounds of Ginger soluble in water or oil ? > I will get me to know that "the gingerol is liposoluble", what can be more easily checked in Google.
 Or for 3D geometry, a topic where I have complex questions... 
 I want to place a 3D frame B so that the Z axis of the B frame point towards the world origin A. I know the angle Alpha between the Z axis of the frame B and The X,Y plane of A. I know the angle Beta between the X axis of A and the vector that goes from the center of A towards the projection of the center of B on the X,Y plane of A. How do you compute the homogeneous rotation matrix of B relative to A, knowing Alpha, Beta and the distance between the center of A and the center of B ?
 Most of time, Bing and the free ChatGPT can answer. But sometimes they struggle or give incorrect answer. 
 Would ChatGPT plus paid subscription be helpful to find more accurate answers?

computational intractability: approximating Nash equilibria in normal-form
games is PPAD-hard. In this paper, inspired by the ideas of smoothed analysis,
we introduce a relaxed variant of Nash equilibrium called $\sigma$-smooth Nash
equilibrium, for a smoothness parameter $\sigma$. In a $\sigma$-smooth Nash
equilibrium, players only need to achieve utility at least as high as their
best deviation to a $\sigma$-smooth strategy, which is a distribution that does
not put too much mass (as parametrized by $\sigma$) on any fixed action. We
distinguish two variants of $\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibria: strong
$\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibria, in which players are required to play
$\sigma$-smooth strategies under equilibrium play, and weak $\sigma$-smooth
Nash equilibria, where there is no such requirement.

We show that both weak and strong $\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibria have
superior computational properties to Nash equilibria: when $\sigma$ as well as
an approximation parameter $\epsilon$ and the number of players are all
constants, there is a constant-time randomized algorithm to find a weak
$\epsilon$-approximate $\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibrium in normal-form games.
In the same parameter regime, there is a polynomial-time deterministic
algorithm to find a strong $\epsilon$-approximate $\sigma$-smooth Nash
equilibrium in a normal-form game. These results stand in contrast to the
optimal algorithm for computing $\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibria, which
cannot run in faster than quasipolynomial-time. We complement our upper bounds
by showing that when either $\sigma$ or $\epsilon$ is an inverse polynomial,
finding a weak $\epsilon$-approximate $\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibria becomes
computationally intractable.]]></summary>

model based on machine learning using transfer learning technique. For the
training process, images were collected from a database available online with
children's chest X-rays images taken at a hospital in China. After training,
the model was then exposed to new images, achieving relevant results on

LLM-Grounder, a novel zero-shot, open-vocabulary, Large Language Model
(LLM)-based 3D visual grounding pipeline. LLM-Grounder utilizes an LLM to
decompose complex natural language queries into semantic constituents and
employs a visual grounding tool, such as OpenScene or LERF, to identify objects
in a 3D scene. The LLM then evaluates the spatial and commonsense relations
among the proposed objects to make a final grounding decision. Our method does
not require any labeled training data and can generalize to novel 3D scenes and
arbitrary text queries. We evaluate LLM-Grounder on the ScanRefer benchmark and
demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot grounding accuracy. Our findings
indicate that LLMs significantly improve the grounding capability, especially
for complex language queries, making LLM-Grounder an effective approach for 3D

deep neural networks, were first studied in image processing and more recently
in NLP. While approaches to detecting adversarial examples in NLP have largely
relied on search over input perturbations, image processing has seen a range of
techniques that aim to characterise adversarial subspaces over the learned
representations.

In this paper, we adapt two such approaches to NLP, one based on nearest
neighbors and influence functions and one on Mahalanobis distances. The former
in particular produces a state-of-the-art detector when compared against
several strong baselines; moreover, the novel use of influence functions
provides insight into how the nature of adversarial example subspaces in NLP
relate to those in image processing, and also how they differ depending on the

works use Gaussian processes to model the black-box function, however, the use

methods scale poorly with the number of data points and second, kernel methods
are usually not effective on complex structured high dimensional data due to
curse of dimensionality. Therefore, we propose a novel black-box optimization
algorithm where the black-box function is modeled using a neural network. Our
algorithm does not need a Bayesian neural network to estimate predictive
uncertainty and is therefore computationally favorable. We analyze the
theoretical behavior of our algorithm in terms of regret bound using advances
in NTK theory showing its efficient convergence. We perform experiments with

performance for speech synthesis. However, a large number of iterative steps
are required to achieve high sample quality, which restricts the inference
speed. Maintaining sample quality while increasing sampling speed has become a
challenging task. In this paper, we propose a "Co"nsistency "Mo"del-based
"Speech" synthesis method, CoMoSpeech, which achieve speech synthesis through a
single diffusion sampling step while achieving high audio quality. The
consistency constraint is applied to distill a consistency model from a
well-designed diffusion-based teacher model, which ultimately yields superior
performances in the distilled CoMoSpeech. Our experiments show that by
generating audio recordings by a single sampling step, the CoMoSpeech achieves
an inference speed more than 150 times faster than real-time on a single NVIDIA
A100 GPU, which is comparable to FastSpeech2, making diffusion-sampling based
speech synthesis truly practical. Meanwhile, objective and subjective
evaluations on text-to-speech and singing voice synthesis show that the
proposed teacher models yield the best audio quality, and the one-step sampling
based CoMoSpeech achieves the best inference speed with better or comparable
audio quality to other conventional multi-step diffusion model baselines. Audio

become a powerful tool for system identification. This paper presents a
physics-informed Gaussian process (GP) model for Timoshenko beam elements. The
model is constructed as a multi-output GP with covariance and cross-covariance
kernels analytically derived based on the differential equations for
deflections, rotations, strains, bending moments, shear forces and applied
loads. Stiffness identification is performed in a Bayesian format by maximising
a posterior model through a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, yielding a
stochastic model for the structural parameters. The optimised GP model is
further employed for probabilistic predictions of unobserved responses.
Additionally, an entropy-based method for physics-informed sensor placement
optimisation is presented, exploiting heterogeneous sensor position information
and structural boundary conditions built into the GP model. Results demonstrate
that the proposed approach is effective at identifying structural parameters
and is capable of fusing data from heterogeneous and multi-fidelity sensors.
Probabilistic predictions of structural responses and internal forces are in
closer agreement with measured data. We validate our model with an experimental
setup and discuss the quality and uncertainty of the obtained results. The
proposed approach has potential applications in the field of structural health
monitoring (SHM) for both mechanical and structural systems.]]></summary>

cardiovascular condition including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary
embolism (PE), is important for effective treatment. Leveraging Natural
Language Processing (NLP) on radiology reports, automated methods have shown
promising advancements in identifying VTE events from retrospective data
cohorts or aiding clinical experts in identifying VTE events from radiology
reports. However, effectively training Deep Learning (DL) and the NLP models is
challenging due to limited labeled medical text data, the complexity and
heterogeneity of radiology reports, and data imbalance. This study proposes
novel method combinations of DL methods, along with data augmentation, adaptive
pre-trained NLP model selection, and a clinical expert NLP rule-based
classifier, to improve the accuracy of VTE identification in unstructured
(free-text) radiology reports. Our experimental results demonstrate the model's
efficacy, achieving an impressive 97\% accuracy and 97\% F1 score in predicting
DVT, and an outstanding 98.3\% accuracy and 98.4\% F1 score in predicting PE.
These findings emphasize the model's robustness and its potential to
significantly contribute to VTE research.]]></summary>

images, such as expression, hairstyle, pose, or age. Even though the
state-of-the-art models successfully modify the requested attributes, they
simultaneously modify other important characteristics of the image, such as a
person's identity. In this paper, we focus on solving this problem by
introducing PluGeN4Faces, a plugin to StyleGAN, which explicitly disentangles
face attributes from a person's identity. Our key idea is to perform training
on images retrieved from movie frames, where a given person appears in various
poses and with different attributes. By applying a type of contrastive loss, we
encourage the model to group images of the same person in similar regions of
latent space. Our experiments demonstrate that the modifications of face
attributes performed by PluGeN4Faces are significantly less invasive on the
remaining characteristics of the image than in the existing state-of-the-art
models.]]></summary>

gradual transitions among a finite number of states. We are particularly
motivated by applications such as human activity analysis where observed
accelerometer time series contains segments representing distinct activities,
which we call pure states, as well as periods characterized by continuous
transition among these pure states. To capture this transitory behavior, the
dynamical Wasserstein barycenter (DWB) model of Cheng et al. in 2021 [1]
associates with each pure state a data-generating distribution and models the
continuous transitions among these states as a Wasserstein barycenter of these
distributions with dynamically evolving weights. Focusing on the univariate
case where Wasserstein distances and barycenters can be computed in closed
form, we extend [1] specifically relaxing the parameterization of the pure
states as Gaussian distributions. We highlight issues related to the uniqueness
in identifying the model parameters as well as uncertainties induced when
estimating a dynamically evolving distribution from a limited number of
samples. To ameliorate non-uniqueness, we introduce regularization that imposes
temporal smoothness on the dynamics of the barycentric weights. A
quantile-based approximation of the pure state distributions yields a finite
dimensional estimation problem which we numerically solve using cyclic descent
alternating between updates to the pure-state quantile functions and the
barycentric weights. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed algorithm in
segmenting both simulated and real world human activity time series.]]></summary>

(PSMs), a novel solution to achieving real-time optimization, flexibility, and
fault tolerance in autonomous systems, particularly in transport-dominated
systems such as chemical, biomedical, and power plants. Traditional data-driven
methods fall short due to a lack of physical constraints like mass
conservation; PSMs address this issue by training deep neural networks with
sensor data and physics-informing using components' Partial Differential
Equations (PDEs), resulting in a physics-constrained, end-to-end differentiable
forward dynamics model. Through two in silico experiments - a heated channel
and a cooling system loop - we demonstrate that PSMs offer a more accurate
approach than purely data-driven models.

Beyond accuracy, there are several compelling use cases for PSMs. In this
work, we showcase two: the creation of a nonlinear supervisory controller
through a sequentially updated state-space representation and the proposal of a
diagnostic algorithm using residuals from each of the PDEs. The former
demonstrates the ability of PSMs to handle both constant and time-dependent
constraints, while the latter illustrates their value in system diagnostics and
fault detection. We further posit that PSMs could serve as a foundation for
Digital Twins, constantly updated digital representations of physical systems.]]></summary>

stochastic splitting functions (SSFs) to enhance classification performance in
multi-class datasets through hierarchical classification (HC). The method has
the unique capability of generating hierarchy without requiring explicit
information, making it suitable for datasets lacking prior knowledge of
hierarchy. By systematically dividing classes into two subsets based on their
discriminability according to the classifier, the proposed approach constructs
a binary tree representation of hierarchical classes. The approach is evaluated
on 46 multi-class time series datasets using popular classifiers (svm and
rocket) and SSFs (potr, srtr, and lsoo). The results reveal that the approach
significantly improves classification performance in approximately half and a
third of the datasets when using rocket and svm as the classifier,
respectively. The study also explores the relationship between dataset features
and HC performance. While the number of classes and flat classification (FC)
score show consistent significance, variations are observed with different
splitting functions. Overall, the proposed approach presents a promising
strategy for enhancing classification by generating hierarchical structure in
multi-class time series datasets. Future research directions involve exploring
different splitting functions, classifiers, and hierarchy structures, as well
as applying the approach to diverse domains beyond time series data. The source

next item click based on the information in a single session only even in the
presence of some random user's behavior, is a complex problem. This complex
problem requires a high-capability model of predicting the user's next action.
Most (if not all) existing models follow the encoder-predictor paradigm where
all studies focus on how to optimize the encoder module extensively in the
paradigm but they ignore how to optimize the predictor module. In this paper,
we discover the existing critical issue of the low-capability predictor module
among existing models. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework called
\emph{\underline{S}ession-based \underline{R}ecommendation with
\underline{Pred}ictor \underline{A}dd-\underline{O}n} (SR-PredictAO). In this
framework, we propose a high-capability predictor module which could alleviate
the effect of random user's behavior for prediction. It is worth mentioning
that this framework could be applied to any existing models, which could give
opportunities for further optimizing the framework. Extensive experiments on
two real benchmark datasets for three state-of-the-art models show that
\emph{SR-PredictAO} out-performs the current state-of-the-art model by up to
2.9\% in HR@20 and 2.3\% in MRR@20. More importantly, the improvement is
consistent across almost all the existing models on all datasets, which could

Confidence-based Soft Pseudo-label strategy to mitigate the pseudo-noise caused

with a multi-stage paradigm that leverages pre-train technique and iterative

information across multiple scales poses a significant challenge in digital
pathology. Multi-instance learning (MIL) is a common solution for working with
high resolution images by classifying bags of objects (i.e. sets of smaller
image patches). However, such processing is typically performed at a single
scale (e.g., 20x magnification) of WSIs, disregarding the vital inter-scale
information that is key to diagnoses by human pathologists. In this study, we
propose a novel cross-scale MIL algorithm to explicitly aggregate inter-scale
relationships into a single MIL network for pathological image diagnosis. The
contribution of this paper is three-fold: (1) A novel cross-scale MIL (CS-MIL)
algorithm that integrates the multi-scale information and the inter-scale
relationships is proposed; (2) A toy dataset with scale-specific morphological
features is created and released to examine and visualize differential
cross-scale attention; (3) Superior performance on both in-house and public
datasets is demonstrated by our simple cross-scale MIL strategy. The official
implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/hrlblab/CS-MIL.]]></summary>

studied with a specific focus on reducing their memory consumption. Work by Liu
et al. (2022) proposed extreme activation compression (EXACT) which
demonstrated drastic reduction in memory consumption by performing quantization
of the intermediate activation maps down to using INT2 precision. They showed
little to no reduction in performance while achieving large reductions in GPU
memory consumption. In this work, we present an improvement to the EXACT
strategy by using block-wise quantization of the intermediate activation maps.
We experimentally analyze different block sizes and show further reduction in
memory consumption (>15%), and runtime speedup per epoch (about 5%) even when
performing extreme extents of quantization with similar performance trade-offs
as with the original EXACT. Further, we present a correction to the assumptions
on the distribution of intermediate activation maps in EXACT (assumed to be

that facilitates rapid merging of multiple models, simplifies the merging of
specific parts of neural networks, and enhances robustness against malicious
models with extreme values. This is achieved by learning gate parameters
through a surrogate of the $l_0$ norm using hard concrete distribution without
modifying the model weights of the given local optima models. This merging
process not only enhances the model performance by converging to a better local

diseases. Generative Adversarial Networks play a key role in addressing this
imbalance by enabling the generation of synthetic images to augment datasets.
It is important to generate synthetic images that incorporate a diverse range
of features to accurately represent the distribution of features present in the
training imagery. Furthermore, the absence of diverse features in synthetic
images can degrade the performance of machine learning classifiers. The mode
collapse problem impacts Generative Adversarial Networks' capacity to generate
diversified images. Mode collapse comes in two varieties: intra-class and
inter-class. In this paper, both varieties of the mode collapse problem are
investigated, and their subsequent impact on the diversity of synthetic X-ray
images is evaluated. This work contributes an empirical demonstration of the
benefits of integrating the adaptive input-image normalization with the Deep
Convolutional GAN and Auxiliary Classifier GAN to alleviate the mode collapse
problems. Synthetically generated images are utilized for data augmentation and
training a Vision Transformer model. The classification performance of the
model is evaluated using accuracy, recall, and precision scores. Results
demonstrate that the DCGAN and the ACGAN with adaptive input-image
normalization outperform the DCGAN and ACGAN with un-normalized X-ray images as
evidenced by the superior diversity scores and classification scores.]]></summary>

competition featured in the NeurIPS 2022 Competition Track, aimed at addressing
dexterous robotic manipulation tasks through learning from pre-collected
offline data. Participants were provided with two types of datasets for each
task: expert and mixed datasets with varying skill levels. While the simplest
offline policy learning algorithm, Behavioral Cloning (BC), performed
remarkably well when trained on expert datasets, it outperformed even the most
advanced offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. However, BC's
performance deteriorated when applied to mixed datasets, and the performance of
offline RL algorithms was also unsatisfactory. Upon examining the mixed
datasets, we observed that they contained a significant amount of expert data,
although this data was unlabeled. To address this issue, we proposed a
semi-supervised learning-based classifier to identify the underlying expert
behavior within mixed datasets, effectively isolating the expert data. To
further enhance BC's performance, we leveraged the geometric symmetry of the
RRC arena to augment the training dataset through mathematical transformations.
In the end, our submission surpassed that of all other participants, even those

emotional, and behavioral changes. Symptoms of SZ include hallucinations,
illusions, delusions, lack of motivation, and difficulties in concentration.
Diagnosing SZ involves employing various tools, including clinical interviews,
physical examinations, psychological evaluations, the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), and neuroimaging techniques.
Electroencephalography (EEG) recording is a significant functional neuroimaging
modality that provides valuable insights into brain function during SZ.
However, EEG signal analysis poses challenges for neurologists and scientists
due to the presence of artifacts, long-term recordings, and the utilization of
multiple channels. To address these challenges, researchers have introduced
artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, encompassing conventional machine
learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods, to aid in SZ diagnosis. This
study reviews papers focused on SZ diagnosis utilizing EEG signals and AI
methods. The introduction section provides a comprehensive explanation of SZ
diagnosis methods and intervention techniques. Subsequently, review papers in
this field are discussed, followed by an introduction to the AI methods
employed for SZ diagnosis and a summary of relevant papers presented in tabular
form. Additionally, this study reports on the most significant challenges
encountered in SZ diagnosis, as identified through a review of papers in this
field. Future directions to overcome these challenges are also addressed. The

discretization to resolve necessary spatiotemporal scales, which can be
computationally expensive. Recent advances in deep learning have provided a new
approach to solving partial differential equations that involves the use of
neural operators. Neural operators are neural network architectures that learn
mappings between function spaces and have the capability to solve partial
differential equations based on data. This study utilizes a novel neural
operator called Hyena, which employs a long convolutional filter that is
parameterized by a multilayer perceptron. The Hyena operator is an operation
that enjoys sub-quadratic complexity and state space model to parameterize long
convolution that enjoys a global receptive field. This mechanism enhances the
model's comprehension of the input's context and enables data-dependent weight
for different partial differential equations instances. To measure how
effective the layers are in solving partial differential equations, we conduct
experiments on Diffusion-Reaction equation and Navier Stokes equation. Our
findings indicate Hyena Neural operator can serve as an efficient and accurate
model for learning partial differential equations solution operator. The data

widely used in FL to prevent such attacks. We consider differentially private
federated learning in a resource-constrained scenario, where both privacy
budget and communication round are constrained. By theoretically analyzing the
convergence, we can find the optimal number of differentially private local
iterations for clients between any two sequential global updates. Based on

however, training of the networks need very large datasets with labels. Th is
heavy dependence on labeled datasets will seriously restrict the application of

modeling tasks like speech recognition, where it is necessary to preserve order
between the input and target sequences. However, CTC is only applied to
deterministic sequence models, where the latent space is discontinuous and
sparse, which in turn makes them less capable of handling data variability when
compared to variational models. In this paper, we integrate CTC with a
variational model and derive loss functions that can be used to train more
generalizable sequence models that preserve order. Specifically, we derive two
versions of the novel variational CTC based on two reasonable assumptions, the
first being that the variational latent variables at each time step are
conditionally independent; and the second being that these latent variables are
Markovian. We show that both loss functions allow direct optimization of the
variational lower bound for the model log-likelihood, and present
computationally tractable forms for implementing them.]]></summary>

datasets and testing on data from the same domain that the model can train on.
Classification becomes more challenging when dealing with new data from a
different domain, where gathering and especially labeling a larger image
dataset for retraining a classification model requires a labor-intensive human
effort. Cross-domain classification frameworks were developed to handle this
data domain shift problem by utilizing unsupervised image-to-image translation
models to translate an input image from the unlabeled domain to the labeled
domain. The problem with these unsupervised models lies in their unsupervised
nature. For lack of annotations, it is not possible to use the traditional
supervised metrics to evaluate these translation models to pick the best-saved
checkpoint model. This paper introduces a new method called Domain-knowledge
Inspired Pseudo Supervision (DIPS) which utilizes domain-informed Gaussian
Mixture Models to generate pseudo annotations to enable the use of traditional
supervised metrics. This method was designed specifically to support
cross-domain classification applications contrary to other typically used
metrics such as the FID which were designed to evaluate the model in terms of
the quality of the generated image from a human-eye perspective. DIPS proves
its effectiveness by outperforming various GAN evaluation metrics, including
FID, when selecting the optimal saved checkpoint model. It is also evaluated
against truly supervised metrics. Furthermore, DIPS showcases its robustness
and interpretability by demonstrating a strong correlation with truly
supervised metrics, highlighting its superiority over existing state-of-the-art
alternatives. The code and data to replicate the results can be found on the

control involve dynamic behaviors in various granularity; task, model, and
layers within a model. Such dynamic behaviors introduce new challenges to the
system software in an ML system since the overall system load is not completely
predictable, unlike traditional ML workloads. In addition, RTMM workloads
require real-time processing, involve highly heterogeneous models, and target
resource-constrained devices. Under such circumstances, developing an effective
scheduler gains more importance to better utilize underlying hardware
considering the unique characteristics of RTMM workloads. Therefore, we propose
a new scheduler, DREAM, which effectively handles various dynamicity in RTMM
workloads targeting multi-accelerator systems. DREAM quantifies the unique
requirements for RTMM workloads and utilizes the quantified scores to drive
scheduling decisions, considering the current system load and other inference
jobs on different models and input frames. DREAM utilizes tunable parameters
that provide fast and effective adaptivity to dynamic workload changes. In our
evaluation of five scenarios of RTMM workload, DREAM reduces the overall
UXCost, which is an equivalent metric of the energy-delay product (EDP) for
RTMM defined in the paper, by 32.2% and 50.0% in the geometric mean (up to

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ultimate goal of artificial intelligence is to mimic the human brain to
perform decision-making and control directly from high-dimensional sensory
input. Diffractive optical networks provide a promising solution for
implementing artificial intelligence with high-speed and low-power consumption.
Most of the reported diffractive optical networks focus on single or multiple
tasks that do not involve environmental interaction, such as object recognition
and image classification. In contrast, the networks capable of performing
decision-making and control have not yet been developed to our knowledge. Here,
we propose using deep reinforcement learning to implement diffractive optical
networks that imitate human-level decision-making and control capability. Such
networks taking advantage of a residual architecture, allow for finding optimal
control policies through interaction with the environment and can be readily
implemented with existing optical devices. The superior performance of these
networks is verified by engaging three types of classic games, Tic-Tac-Toe,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In many applications in data clustering, it is desirable to find not just a
single partition into clusters but a sequence of partitions describing the data
at different scales, or levels of coarseness. A natural problem then is to
analyse and compare the (not necessarily hierarchical) sequences of partitions
that underpin such multiscale descriptions of data. Here, we introduce a
filtration of abstract simplicial complexes, denoted the Multiscale Clustering
Filtration (MCF), which encodes arbitrary patterns of cluster assignments
across scales, and we prove that the MCF produces stable persistence diagrams.
We then show that the zero-dimensional persistent homology of the MCF measures
the degree of hierarchy in the sequence of partitions, and that the
higher-dimensional persistent homology tracks the emergence and resolution of
conflicts between cluster assignments across the sequence of partitions. To
broaden the theoretical foundations of the MCF, we also provide an equivalent
construction via a nerve complex filtration, and we show that in the
hierarchical case, the MCF reduces to a Vietoris-Rips filtration of an
ultrametric space. We briefly illustrate how the MCF can serve to characterise
multiscale clustering structures in numerical experiments on synthetic data.]]></summary>

key parameters are the number of data considered at each step or batch size
$B$, and the step size or learning rate $\eta$. For small $B$ and large $\eta$,
SGD corresponds to a stochastic evolution of the parameters, whose noise
amplitude is governed by the `temperature' $T\equiv \eta/B$. Yet this
description is observed to break down for sufficiently large batches $B\geq
B^*$, or simplifies to gradient descent (GD) when the temperature is
sufficiently small. Understanding where these cross-overs take place remains a
central challenge. Here we resolve these questions for a teacher-student
perceptron classification model, and show empirically that our key predictions
still apply to deep networks. Specifically, we obtain a phase diagram in the
$B$-$\eta$ plane that separates three dynamical phases: $\textit{(i)}$ a
noise-dominated SGD governed by temperature, $\textit{(ii)}$ a
large-first-step-dominated SGD and $\textit{(iii)}$ GD. These different phases
also corresponds to different regimes of generalization error. Remarkably, our
analysis reveals that the batch size $B^*$ separating regimes $\textit{(i)}$
and $\textit{(ii)}$ scale with the size $P$ of the training set, with an
exponent that characterizes the hardness of the classification problem.]]></summary>

learning literature for the evaluation of classification systems. Some of the
most common ones for measuring quality of hard decisions are standard and
balanced accuracy, standard and balanced error rate, F-beta score, and Matthews
correlation coefficient (MCC). In this document, we review the definition of
these and other metrics and compare them with the expected cost (EC), a metric
introduced in every statistical learning course but rarely used in the machine
learning literature. We show that both the standard and balanced error rates
are special cases of the EC. Further, we show its relation with F-beta score
and MCC and argue that EC is superior to these traditional metrics for being
based on first principles from statistics, and for being more general,
interpretable, and adaptable to any application scenario. The metrics mentioned
above measure the quality of hard decisions. Yet, most modern classification
systems output continuous scores for the classes which we may want to evaluate
directly. Metrics for measuring the quality of system scores include the area
under the ROC curve, equal error rate, cross-entropy, Brier score, and Bayes EC
or Bayes risk, among others. The last three metrics are special cases of a
family of metrics given by the expected value of proper scoring rules (PSRs).
We review the theory behind these metrics, showing that they are a principled
way to measure the quality of the posterior probabilities produced by a system.
Finally, we show how to use these metrics to compute a system's calibration
loss and compare this metric with the widely-used expected calibration error
(ECE), arguing that calibration loss based on PSRs is superior to the ECE for
being more interpretable, more general, and directly applicable to the
multi-class case, among other reasons.]]></summary>

with uncovering novel categories from unlabeled data while maintaining
performance on seen categories from labeled data. The central challenge is the
substantial learning gap between seen and novel categories, as the model learns
the former faster due to accurate supervisory information. To address this, we
introduce 1) an adaptive margin loss based on estimated class distribution,
which encourages a large negative margin for samples in seen classes, to
synchronize learning paces, and 2) pseudo-label contrastive clustering, which
pulls together samples which are likely from the same class in the output
space, to enhance novel class discovery. Our extensive evaluations on multiple
datasets demonstrate that existing models still hinder novel class learning,
whereas our approach strikingly balances both seen and novel classes, achieving
a remarkable 3% average accuracy increase on the ImageNet dataset compared to
the prior state-of-the-art. Additionally, we find that fine-tuning the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The problem of non-monotone $k$-submodular maximization under a knapsack
constraint ($\kSMK$) over the ground set size $n$ has been raised in many
applications in machine learning, such as data summarization, information
propagation, etc. However, existing algorithms for the problem are facing
questioning of how to overcome the non-monotone case and how to fast return a
good solution in case of the big size of data. This paper introduces two
deterministic approximation algorithms for the problem that competitively
improve the query complexity of existing algorithms.

Our first algorithm, $\LAA$, returns an approximation ratio of $1/19$ within
$O(nk)$ query complexity. The second one, $\RLA$, improves the approximation
ratio to $1/5-\epsilon$ in $O(nk)$ queries, where $\epsilon$ is an input
parameter.

Our algorithms are the first ones that provide constant approximation ratios
within only $O(nk)$ query complexity for the non-monotone objective. They,
therefore, need fewer the number of queries than state-of-the-the-art ones by a
factor of $\Omega(\log n)$.

Besides the theoretical analysis, we have evaluated our proposed ones with
several experiments in some instances: Influence Maximization and Sensor
Placement for the problem. The results confirm that our algorithms ensure
theoretical quality as the cutting-edge techniques and significantly reduce the
number of queries.]]></summary>

significant implications for clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. One
major challenge in this field is the lack of continuous medical imaging
monitoring of individual patients over time. To address this issue, we develop
a novel framework termed Progressive Image Editing (PIE) that enables
controlled manipulation of disease-related image features, facilitating precise
and realistic disease progression simulation. Specifically, we leverage recent
advancements in text-to-image generative models to simulate disease progression
accurately and personalize it for each patient. We theoretically analyze the
iterative refining process in our framework as a gradient descent with an
exponentially decayed learning rate. To validate our framework, we conduct
experiments in three medical imaging domains. Our results demonstrate the
superiority of PIE over existing methods such as Stable Diffusion Walk and
Style-Based Manifold Extrapolation based on CLIP score (Realism) and Disease
Classification Confidence (Alignment). Our user study collected feedback from
35 veteran physicians to assess the generated progressions. Remarkably, 76.2%
of the feedback agrees with the fidelity of the generated progressions. To our
best knowledge, PIE is the first of its kind to generate disease progression
images meeting real-world standards. It is a promising tool for medical
research and clinical practice, potentially allowing healthcare providers to

inference and sampling. We develop a FL framework which maintains a global NGM
model that learns the averaged information from the local NGM models while
keeping the training data within the client's environment. Our design, FedNGMs,
avoids the pitfalls and shortcomings of neuron matching frameworks like
Federated Matched Averaging that suffers from model parameter explosion. Our
global model size remains constant throughout the process. In the cases where
clients have local variables that are not part of the combined global
distribution, we propose a `Stitching' algorithm, which personalizes the global
NGM models by merging the additional variables using the client's data. FedNGM
is robust to data heterogeneity, large number of participants, and limited
communication bandwidth.]]></summary>

automatic trading platforms based on real-time information acquisition have
become the main components of the stock trading market, so the topic of
quantitative trading has received widespread attention. And for non-strongly
efficient trading markets, human emotions and expectations always dominate
market trends and trading decisions. Therefore, this paper starts from the
theory of emotion, taking East Money as an example, crawling user comment
titles data from its corresponding stock bar and performing data cleaning.
Subsequently, a natural language processing model BERT was constructed, and the
BERT model was fine-tuned using existing annotated data sets. The experimental
results show that the fine-tuned model has different degrees of performance
improvement compared to the original model and the baseline model.
Subsequently, based on the above model, the user comment data crawled is
labeled with emotional polarity, and the obtained label information is combined
with the Alpha191 model to participate in regression, and significant
regression results are obtained. Subsequently, the regression model is used to
predict the average price change for the next five days, and use it as a signal
to guide automatic trading. The experimental results show that the
incorporation of emotional factors increased the return rate by 73.8\% compared
to the baseline during the trading period, and by 32.41\% compared to the
original alpha191 model. Finally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages
of incorporating emotional factors into quantitative trading, and give possible
directions for further research in the future.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sequential change detection is a classical problem with a variety of
applications. However, the majority of prior work has been parametric, for
example, focusing on exponential families. We develop a fundamentally new and
general framework for sequential change detection when the pre- and post-change
distributions are nonparametrically specified (and thus composite). Our
procedures come with clean, nonasymptotic bounds on the average run length
(frequency of false alarms). In certain nonparametric cases (like sub-Gaussian
or sub-exponential), we also provide near-optimal bounds on the detection delay
following a changepoint. The primary technical tool that we introduce is called
an \emph{e-detector}, which is composed of sums of e-processes -- a fundamental
generalization of nonnegative supermartingales -- that are started at
consecutive times. We first introduce simple Shiryaev-Roberts and CUSUM-style
e-detectors, and then show how to design their mixtures in order to achieve
both statistical and computational efficiency. Our e-detector framework can be
instantiated to recover classical likelihood-based procedures for parametric
problems, as well as yielding the first change detection method for many
nonparametric problems. As a running example, we tackle the problem of
detecting changes in the mean of a bounded random variable without i.i.d.
assumptions, with an application to tracking the performance of a basketball

extremely high energy efficiency. By employing the distinct polarity of current
to denote logic `0' and `1', AQFP devices serve as excellent carriers for
binary neural network (BNN) computations. Although recent research has made
initial strides toward developing an AQFP-based BNN accelerator, several
critical challenges remain, preventing the design from being a comprehensive
solution. In this paper, we propose SupeRBNN, an AQFP-based randomized BNN
acceleration framework that leverages software-hardware co-optimization to
eventually make the AQFP devices a feasible solution for BNN acceleration.
Specifically, we investigate the randomized behavior of the AQFP devices and
analyze the impact of crossbar size on current attenuation, subsequently
formulating the current amplitude into the values suitable for use in BNN
computation. To tackle the accumulation problem and improve overall hardware
performance, we propose a stochastic computing-based accumulation module and a
clocking scheme adjustment-based circuit optimization method. We validate our
SupeRBNN framework across various datasets and network architectures, comparing
it with implementations based on different technologies, including CMOS, ReRAM,
and superconducting RSFQ/ERSFQ. Experimental results demonstrate that our
design achieves an energy efficiency of approximately 7.8x10^4 times higher
than that of the ReRAM-based BNN framework while maintaining a similar level of
model accuracy. Furthermore, when compared with superconductor-based
counterparts, our framework demonstrates at least two orders of magnitude
higher energy efficiency.]]></summary>

state-of-the-art 3 billion parameter open-source language model. BTLM-3B-8K was
trained on 627B tokens from the SlimPajama dataset with a mixture of 2,048 and
8,192 context lengths. BTLM-3B-8K outperforms all existing 3B parameter models
by 2-5.5% across downstream tasks. BTLM-3B-8K is even competitive with some 7B
parameter models. Additionally, BTLM-3B-8K provides excellent long context
performance, outperforming MPT-7B-8K and XGen-7B-8K on tasks up to 8,192
context length. We trained the model on a cleaned and deduplicated SlimPajama
dataset; aggressively tuned the \textmu P hyperparameters and schedule; used
ALiBi position embeddings; and adopted the SwiGLU nonlinearity.

On Hugging Face, the most popular models have 7B parameters, indicating that
users prefer the quality-size ratio of 7B models. Compacting the 7B parameter
model to one with 3B parameters, with little performance impact, is an
important milestone. BTLM-3B-8K needs only 3GB of memory with 4-bit precision
and takes 2.5x less inference compute than 7B models, helping to open up access
to a powerful language model on mobile and edge devices. BTLM-3B-8K is

rewards that must individually accumulate to given thresholds. In this class of
problems, we show a simple example in which the desired optimal policy cannot
be induced by any weighted linear combination of rewards. Hence, there exist
constrained reinforcement learning problems for which neither regularized nor
classical primal-dual methods yield optimal policies. This work addresses this
shortcoming by augmenting the state with Lagrange multipliers and
reinterpreting primal-dual methods as the portion of the dynamics that drives
the multipliers evolution. This approach provides a systematic state
augmentation procedure that is guaranteed to solve reinforcement learning
problems with constraints. Thus, as we illustrate by an example, while previous
methods can fail at finding optimal policies, running the dual dynamics while
executing the augmented policy yields an algorithm that provably samples

treatment assignment policies across various domains, including healthcare and

stochastic contextual bandit settings, with the flexibility to be adapted for
cumulative regret minimization (with near-optimal minimax guarantees) and
simple regret minimization (with SOTA guarantees). Furthermore, our algorithms
adapt to model misspecification and extend to the continuous arm settings.
These advantages come from constructing and relying on "conformal arm sets"
(CASs), which provide a set of arms at every context that encompass the
context-specific optimal arm with some probability across the context
distribution. Our positive results on simple and cumulative regret guarantees
are contrasted by a negative result, which shows that an algorithm can't
achieve instance-dependent simple regret guarantees while simultaneously
achieving minimax optimal cumulative regret guarantees.]]></summary>

using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In the Offline Nanosatellite Task
Scheduling (ONTS) problem, the goal is to find the optimal schedule for tasks
to be carried out in orbit while taking into account Quality-of-Service (QoS)
considerations such as priority, minimum and maximum activation events,
execution time-frames, periods, and execution windows, as well as constraints
on the satellite's power resources and the complexity of energy harvesting and
management. The ONTS problem has been approached using conventional
mathematical formulations and exact methods, but their applicability to
challenging cases of the problem is limited. This study examines the use of
GNNs in this context, which has been effectively applied to optimization
problems such as the traveling salesman, scheduling, and facility placement
problems. More specifically, we investigate whether GNNs can learn the complex
structure of the ONTS problem with respect to feasibility and optimality of
candidate solutions. Furthermore, we evaluate using GNN-based heuristic
solutions to provide better solutions (w.r.t. the objective value) to the ONTS
problem and reduce the optimization cost. Our experiments show that GNNs are
not only able to learn feasibility and optimality for instances of the ONTS
problem, but they can generalize to harder instances than those seen during
training. Furthermore, the GNN-based heuristics improved the expected objective
value of the best solution found under the time limit in 45%, and reduced the
expected time to find a feasible solution in 35%, when compared to the SCIP
(Solving Constraint Integer Programs) solver in its off-the-shelf configuration]]></summary>

range of scenarios, substantially enhancing smart building operation and
management while upholding privacy expectations in various spaces. We propose a
non-speech audio-based approach for crowd analytics, leveraging a
transformer-based model. Our results demonstrate that non-speech audio alone
can be used to conduct such analysis with remarkable accuracy. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first time when non-speech audio signals are
proposed for predicting occupancy. As far as we know, there has been no other
similar approach of its kind prior to this. To accomplish this, we deployed our
sensor-based platform in the waiting room of a large hospital with IRB approval
over a period of several months to capture non-speech audio and thermal images
for the training and evaluation of our models. The proposed non-speech-based
approach outperformed the thermal camera-based model and all other baselines.
In addition to demonstrating superior performance without utilizing speech
audio, we conduct further analysis using differential privacy techniques to
provide additional privacy guarantees. Overall, our work demonstrates the
viability of employing non-speech audio data for accurate occupancy estimation,
while also ensuring the exclusion of speech-related content and providing
robust privacy protections through differential privacy guarantees.]]></summary>

highlight that empirical design decisions established in the MuZero line of
works are vital to achieving good performance for related algorithms, and we
showcase differences in behavior between different instantiations of
value-aware algorithms in stochastic environments. Using these insights, we
propose the Latent Model-Based Decision-Aware Actor-Critic framework

biometric verification to improve reliablity in the face of spoofing attacks.
Even though the two sub-systems operate in tandem to solve the single task of
reliable biometric verification, they address different detection tasks and are
hence typically evaluated separately. Evidence shows that this approach is
suboptimal. We introduce a new metric for the joint evaluation of PAD solutions
operating in situ with biometric verification. In contrast to the tandem
detection cost function proposed recently, the new tandem equal error rate
(t-EER) is parameter free. The combination of two classifiers nonetheless leads
to a \emph{set} of operating points at which false alarm and miss rates are
equal and also dependent upon the prevalence of attacks. We therefore introduce
the \emph{concurrent} t-EER, a unique operating point which is invariable to
the prevalence of attacks. Using both modality (and even application) agnostic
simulated scores, as well as real scores for a voice biometrics application, we
demonstrate application of the t-EER to a wide range of biometric system
evaluations under attack. The proposed approach is a strong candidate metric
for the tandem evaluation of PAD systems and biometric comparators.]]></summary>

goal). Together, these two components form a visual-force goal. Prior work has
demonstrated that deep models outputting human-interpretable kinematic goals
can enable dexterous manipulation by real robots. Forces are critical to
manipulation, yet have typically been relegated to lower-level execution in

eye-in-hand RGBD camera, ForceSight performed tasks such as precision grasps,
drawer opening, and object handovers with an 81% success rate in unseen
environments with object instances that differed significantly from the

and ignoring force goals dropped the success rate from 90% to 45%,

expressivity of surface electromyography-based (sEMG) gesture recognition
systems. Approach: We use a problem transformation approach, in which actions
were subset into two biomechanically independent components - a set of wrist
directions and a set of finger modifiers. To maintain fast calibration time, we
train models for each component using only individual gestures, and extrapolate
to the full product space of combination gestures by generating synthetic data.
We collected a supervised dataset with high-confidence ground truth labels in
which subjects performed combination gestures while holding a joystick, and
conducted experiments to analyze the impact of model architectures, classifier
algorithms, and synthetic data generation strategies on the performance of the
proposed approach. Main Results: We found that a problem transformation
approach using a parallel model architecture in combination with a non-linear
classifier, along with restricted synthetic data generation, shows promise in
increasing the expressivity of sEMG-based gestures with a short calibration
time. Significance: sEMG-based gesture recognition has applications in
human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and the control of robotic and
prosthetic devices. Existing approaches require exhaustive model calibration.
The proposed approach increases expressivity without requiring users to
demonstrate all combination gesture classes. Our results may be extended to
larger gesture vocabularies and more complicated model architectures.]]></summary>

measuring and interpreting the calibration of probabilistic predictors.
Calibration measures quantify the degree of miscalibration, and reliability
diagrams visualize the structure of this miscalibration. However, the most
common constructions of reliability diagrams and calibration measures --
binning and ECE -- both suffer from well-known flaws (e.g. discontinuity). We
show that a simple modification fixes both constructions: first smooth the
observations using an RBF kernel, then compute the Expected Calibration Error
(ECE) of this smoothed function. We prove that with a careful choice of
bandwidth, this method yields a calibration measure that is well-behaved in the
sense of (B{\l}asiok, Gopalan, Hu, and Nakkiran 2023a) -- a consistent
calibration measure. We call this measure the SmoothECE. Moreover, the
reliability diagram obtained from this smoothed function visually encodes the
SmoothECE, just as binned reliability diagrams encode the BinnedECE.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We present LongLoRA, an efficient fine-tuning approach that extends the
context sizes of pre-trained large language models (LLMs), with limited
computation cost. Typically, training LLMs with long context sizes is
computationally expensive, requiring extensive training hours and GPU
resources. For example, training on the context length of 8192 needs 16x
computational costs in self-attention layers as that of 2048. In this paper, we
speed up the context extension of LLMs in two aspects. On the one hand,
although dense global attention is needed during inference, fine-tuning the
model can be effectively and efficiently done by sparse local attention. The
proposed shift short attention effectively enables context extension, leading
to non-trivial computation saving with similar performance to fine-tuning with
vanilla attention. Particularly, it can be implemented with only two lines of
code in training, while being optional in inference. On the other hand, we
revisit the parameter-efficient fine-tuning regime for context expansion.
Notably, we find that LoRA for context extension works well under the premise
of trainable embedding and normalization. LongLoRA demonstrates strong
empirical results on various tasks on LLaMA2 models from 7B/13B to 70B.
LongLoRA adopts LLaMA2 7B from 4k context to 100k, or LLaMA2 70B to 32k on a
single 8x A100 machine. LongLoRA extends models' context while retaining their
original architectures, and is compatible with most existing techniques, like
FlashAttention-2. In addition, to make LongLoRA practical, we collect a
dataset, LongQA, for supervised fine-tuning. It contains more than 3k long

or clusters. Because they have the potential to infiltrate other tissues, they
pose a risk to the patient. The main imaging technique used, MRI, may be able
to identify a brain tumor with accuracy. The fast development of Deep Learning
methods for use in computer vision applications has been facilitated by a vast
amount of training data and improvements in model construction that offer
better approximations in a supervised setting. The need for these approaches
has been the main driver of this expansion. Deep learning methods have shown
promise in improving the precision of brain tumor detection and classification
using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The study on the use of deep learning
techniques, especially ResNet50, for brain tumor identification is presented in
this abstract. As a result, this study investigates the possibility of
automating the detection procedure using deep learning techniques. In this
study, I utilized five transfer learning models which are VGG16, VGG19,
DenseNet121, ResNet50 and YOLO V4 where ResNet50 provide the best or highest
accuracy 99.54%. The goal of the study is to guide researchers and medical
professionals toward powerful brain tumor detecting systems by employing deep

differentiable channel model due to the backpropagation algorithm. This
requirement can be sidestepped by approximating either the channel distribution
or its gradient through pilot signals in real-world scenarios. The initial
approach draws upon the latest advancements in image generation, utilizing
generative adversarial networks (GANs) or their enhanced variants to generate
channel distributions. In this paper, we address this channel approximation
challenge with diffusion models, which have demonstrated high sample quality in
image generation. We offer an end-to-end channel coding framework underpinned
by diffusion models and propose an efficient training algorithm. Our
simulations with various channel models establish that our diffusion models
learn the channel distribution accurately, thereby achieving near-optimal
end-to-end symbol error rates (SERs). We also note a significant advantage of
diffusion models: A robust generalization capability in high signal-to-noise
ratio regions, in contrast to GAN variants that suffer from error floor.
Furthermore, we examine the trade-off between sample quality and sampling
speed, when an accelerated sampling algorithm is deployed, and investigate the
effect of the noise scheduling on this trade-off. With an apt choice of noise
scheduling, sampling time can be significantly reduced with a minor increase in
SER.]]></summary>

difficulties with social interaction, communication, and repetitive activities.
The severity of these difficulties varies, and those with this diagnosis face
unique challenges. While its primary origin lies in genetics, identifying and
addressing it early can contribute to the enhancement of the condition. In
recent years, machine learning-driven intelligent diagnosis has emerged as a
supplement to conventional clinical approaches, aiming to address the potential
drawbacks of time-consuming and costly traditional methods. In this work, we
utilize different machine learning algorithms to find the most significant
traits responsible for ASD and to automate the diagnostic process. We study six
classification models to see which model works best to identify ASD and also
study five popular clustering methods to get a meaningful insight of these ASD
datasets. To find the best classifier for these binary datasets, we evaluate
the models using accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1-score, AUC, kappa
and log loss metrics. Our evaluation demonstrates that five out of the six
selected models perform exceptionally, achieving a 100% accuracy rate on the
ASD datasets when hyperparameters are meticulously tuned for each model. As
almost all classification models are able to get 100% accuracy, we become
interested in observing the underlying insights of the datasets by implementing
some popular clustering algorithms on these datasets. We calculate Normalized
Mutual Information (NMI), Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) & Silhouette Coefficient
(SC) metrics to select the best clustering models. Our evaluation finds that
spectral clustering outperforms all other benchmarking clustering models in
terms of NMI & ARI metrics and it also demonstrates comparability to the
optimal SC achieved by k-means.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper studies the problem of traffic flow forecasting, which aims to
predict future traffic conditions on the basis of road networks and traffic
conditions in the past. The problem is typically solved by modeling complex
spatio-temporal correlations in traffic data using spatio-temporal graph neural
networks (GNNs). However, the performance of these methods is still far from
satisfactory since GNNs usually have limited representation capacity when it
comes to complex traffic networks. Graphs, by nature, fall short in capturing
non-pairwise relations. Even worse, existing methods follow the paradigm of
message passing that aggregates neighborhood information linearly, which fails
to capture complicated spatio-temporal high-order interactions. To tackle these
issues, in this paper, we propose a novel model named Dynamic Hypergraph
Structure Learning (DyHSL) for traffic flow prediction. To learn non-pairwise
relationships, our DyHSL extracts hypergraph structural information to model
dynamics in the traffic networks, and updates each node representation by
aggregating messages from its associated hyperedges. Additionally, to capture
high-order spatio-temporal relations in the road network, we introduce an
interactive graph convolution block, which further models the neighborhood
interaction for each node. Finally, we integrate these two views into a
holistic multi-scale correlation extraction module, which conducts temporal
pooling with different scales to model different temporal patterns. Extensive
experiments on four popular traffic benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed DyHSL compared with a broad range of competing
baselines.]]></summary>

development of efficient cross-modal music retrieval systems. One of the
fundamental approaches toward this task is to learn a cross-modal embedding
space via deep neural networks that is able to connect short snippets of audio
and sheet music. However, the scarcity of annotated data from real musical
content affects the capability of such methods to generalize to real retrieval
scenarios. In this work, we investigate whether we can mitigate this limitation
with self-supervised contrastive learning, by exposing a network to a large
amount of real music data as a pre-training step, by contrasting randomly
augmented views of snippets of both modalities, namely audio and sheet images.
Through a number of experiments on synthetic and real piano data, we show that
pre-trained models are able to retrieve snippets with better precision in all
scenarios and pre-training configurations. Encouraged by these results, we
employ the snippet embeddings in the higher-level task of cross-modal piece
identification and conduct more experiments on several retrieval
configurations. In this task, we observe that the retrieval quality improves
from 30% up to 100% when real music data is present. We then conclude by
arguing for the potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for
alleviating the annotated data scarcity in multi-modal music retrieval models.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Audiovisual data is everywhere in this digital age, which raises higher
requirements for the deep learning models developed on them. To well handle the
information of the multi-modal data is the key to a better audiovisual modal.
We observe that these audiovisual data naturally have temporal attributes, such
as the time information for each frame in the video. More concretely, such data
is inherently multi-modal according to both audio and visual cues, which
proceed in a strict chronological order. It indicates that temporal information
is important in multi-modal acoustic event modeling for both intra- and
inter-modal. However, existing methods deal with each modal feature
independently and simply fuse them together, which neglects the mining of
temporal relation and thus leads to sub-optimal performance. With this
motivation, we propose a Temporal Multi-modal graph learning method for
Acoustic event Classification, called TMac, by modeling such temporal
information via graph learning techniques. In particular, we construct a
temporal graph for each acoustic event, dividing its audio data and video data
into multiple segments. Each segment can be considered as a node, and the
temporal relationships between nodes can be considered as timestamps on their
edges. In this case, we can smoothly capture the dynamic information in
intra-modal and inter-modal. Several experiments are conducted to demonstrate
TMac outperforms other SOTA models in performance. Our code is available at
https://github.com/MGitHubL/TMac.]]></summary>

antineoplastic properties. The utilization of ACPs in cancer prevention can
present a viable substitute for conventional cancer therapeutics, as they
possess a higher degree of selectivity and safety. Recent scientific
advancements generate an interest in peptide-based therapies which offer the
advantage of efficiently treating intended cells without negatively impacting
normal cells. However, as the number of peptide sequences continues to increase
rapidly, developing a reliable and precise prediction model becomes a
challenging task. In this work, our motivation is to advance an efficient model
for categorizing anticancer peptides employing the consolidation of word
embedding and deep learning models. First, Word2Vec and FastText are evaluated
as word embedding techniques for the purpose of extracting peptide sequences.
Then, the output of word embedding models are fed into deep learning approaches
CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM. To demonstrate the contribution of proposed framework,
extensive experiments are carried on widely-used datasets in the literature,
ACPs250 and Independent. Experiment results show the usage of proposed model
enhances classification accuracy when compared to the state-of-the-art studies.
The proposed combination, FastText+BiLSTM, exhibits 92.50% of accuracy for
ACPs250 dataset, and 96.15% of accuracy for Independent dataset, thence
determining new state-of-the-art.]]></summary>

general unsupervised autoencoders. The regularisation rests on sampling the
autoencoder Jacobian in Legendre nodes, being the centre of the Gauss-Legendre
quadrature. Revisiting this classic enables to prove that regularised
autoencoders ensure a one-to-one re-embedding of the initial data manifold to
its latent representation. Demonstrations show that prior proposed
regularisation strategies, such as contractive autoencoding, cause topological
defects already for simple examples, and so do convolutional based
(variational) autoencoders. In contrast, topological preservation is ensured
already by standard multilayer perceptron neural networks when being
regularised due to our contribution. This observation extends through the
classic FashionMNIST dataset up to real world encoding problems for MRI brain

geographical locations with diverse conditions and rules of the road, e.g.,
left vs. right-hand traffic. In contrast, existing models for autonomous

model scalability. In this work, we propose AnyD, a single geographically-aware

heterogeneous and globally distributed data with dynamic environmental,
traffic, and social characteristics. Our key insight is to introduce a
high-capacity geo-location-based channel attention mechanism that effectively
adapts to local nuances while also flexibly modeling similarities among regions
in a data-driven manner. By optimizing a contrastive imitation objective, our
proposed approach can efficiently scale across inherently imbalanced data
distributions and location-dependent events. We demonstrate the benefits of our
AnyD agent across multiple datasets, cities, and scalable deployment paradigms,
i.e., centralized, semi-supervised, and distributed agent training.
Specifically, AnyD outperforms CIL baselines by over 14% in open-loop

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep learning's immense capabilities are often constrained by the complexity
of its models, leading to an increasing demand for effective sparsification
techniques. Bayesian sparsification for deep learning emerges as a crucial
approach, facilitating the design of models that are both computationally
efficient and competitive in terms of performance across various deep learning
applications. The state-of-the-art -- in Bayesian sparsification of deep neural
networks -- combines structural shrinkage priors on model weights with an
approximate inference scheme based on black-box stochastic variational
inference. However, model inversion of the full generative model is
exceptionally computationally demanding, especially when compared to standard
deep learning of point estimates. In this context, we advocate for the use of
Bayesian model reduction (BMR) as a more efficient alternative for pruning of
model weights. As a generalization of the Savage-Dickey ratio, BMR allows a
post-hoc elimination of redundant model weights based on the posterior
estimates under a straightforward (non-hierarchical) generative model. Our
comparative study highlights the computational efficiency and the pruning rate
of the BMR method relative to the established stochastic variational inference
(SVI) scheme, when applied to the full hierarchical generative model. We
illustrate the potential of BMR to prune model parameters across various deep
learning architectures, from classical networks like LeNet to modern frameworks
such as Vision Transformers and MLP-Mixers.]]></summary>

importance in resolving expensive optimization problems~(EOPs). Extensive
efforts have been devoted to improving the efficacy of SAEAs through the

paradigm of evaluating a limited number of solutions in each generation within
SAEAs reduces the variance of adjacent populations, thus impacting the quality
of offspring solutions. This is a frequently encountered issue, yet it has not
gained widespread attention. This paper presents a framework using unevaluated
solutions to enhance the efficiency of SAEAs. The surrogate model is employed
to identify high-quality solutions for direct generation of new solutions
without evaluation. To ensure dependable selection, we have introduced two
tailored relation models for the selection of the optimal solution and the
unevaluated population. A comprehensive experimental analysis is performed on
two test suites, which showcases the superiority of the relation model over
regression and classification models in the selection phase. Furthermore, the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scene flow estimation is the task of describing the 3D motion field between
temporally successive point clouds. State-of-the-art methods use strong priors
and test-time optimization techniques, but require on the order of tens of
seconds to process large-scale point clouds, making them unusable as computer
vision primitives for real-time applications such as open world object
detection. Feed forward methods are considerably faster, running on the order
of tens to hundreds of milliseconds for large-scale point clouds, but require
expensive human supervision. To address both limitations, we propose Scene Flow
via Distillation, a simple, scalable distillation framework that uses a
label-free optimization method to produce pseudo-labels to supervise a feed
forward model. Our instantiation of this framework, ZeroFlow, achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Argoverse 2 Self-Supervised Scene Flow
Challenge while using zero human labels by simply training on large-scale,
diverse unlabeled data. At test-time, ZeroFlow is over 1000$\times$ faster than
label-free state-of-the-art optimization-based methods on large-scale point
clouds and over 1000$\times$ cheaper to train on unlabeled data compared to the
cost of human annotation of that data. To facilitate further research, we will
release our code, trained model weights, and high quality pseudo-labels for the
Argoverse 2 and Waymo Open datasets.]]></summary>

the precise, contact-rich, and dexterous manipulation that humans excel at.
However, relying solely on tactile sensing fails to provide adequate cues for
reasoning about objects' spatial configurations, limiting the ability to
correct errors and adapt to changing situations. In this paper, we present
Tactile Adaptation from Visual Incentives (TAVI), a new framework that enhances
tactile-based dexterity by optimizing dexterous policies using vision-based
rewards. First, we use a contrastive-based objective to learn visual
representations. Next, we construct a reward function using these visual
representations through optimal-transport based matching on one human
demonstration. Finally, we use online reinforcement learning on our robot to
optimize tactile-based policies that maximize the visual reward. On six
challenging tasks, such as peg pick-and-place, unstacking bowls, and flipping
slender objects, TAVI achieves a success rate of 73% using our four-fingered
Allegro robot hand. The increase in performance is 108% higher than policies
using tactile and vision-based rewards and 135% higher than policies without
tactile observational input. Robot videos are best viewed on our project

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ensuring that analyses performed on a dataset are representative of the
entire population is one of the central problems in statistics. Most classical
techniques assume that the dataset is independent of the analyst's query and
break down in the common setting where a dataset is reused for multiple,
adaptively chosen, queries. This problem of \emph{adaptive data analysis} was
formalized in the seminal works of Dwork et al. (STOC, 2015) and Hardt and
Ullman (FOCS, 2014).

We identify a remarkably simple set of assumptions under which the queries
will continue to be representative even when chosen adaptively: The only
requirements are that each query takes as input a random subsample and outputs
few bits. This result shows that the noise inherent in subsampling is
sufficient to guarantee that query responses generalize. The simplicity of this
subsampling-based framework allows it to model a variety of real-world
scenarios not covered by prior work.

In addition to its simplicity, we demonstrate the utility of this framework
by designing mechanisms for two foundational tasks, statistical queries and
median finding. In particular, our mechanism for answering the broadly
applicable class of statistical queries is both extremely simple and state of
the art in many parameter regimes.]]></summary>

generalized linear models (GLMs) in the presence of additive oblivious noise.
We assume we have sample access to examples $(x, y)$ where $y$ is a noisy
measurement of $g(w^* \cdot x)$. In particular, \new{the noisy labels are of
the form} $y = g(w^* \cdot x) + \xi + \epsilon$, where $\xi$ is the oblivious
noise drawn independently of $x$ \new{and satisfies} $\Pr[\xi = 0] \geq o(1)$,
and $\epsilon \sim \mathcal N(0, \sigma^2)$. Our goal is to accurately recover
a \new{parameter vector $w$ such that the} function $g(w \cdot x)$ \new{has}
arbitrarily small error when compared to the true values $g(w^* \cdot x)$,
rather than the noisy measurements $y$.

We present an algorithm that tackles \new{this} problem in its most general
distribution-independent setting, where the solution may not \new{even} be
identifiable. \new{Our} algorithm returns \new{an accurate estimate of} the
solution if it is identifiable, and otherwise returns a small list of
candidates, one of which is close to the true solution. Furthermore, we
\new{provide} a necessary and sufficient condition for identifiability, which
holds in broad settings. \new{Specifically,} the problem is identifiable when
the quantile at which $\xi + \epsilon = 0$ is known, or when the family of
hypotheses does not contain candidates that are nearly equal to a translated
$g(w^* \cdot x) + A$ for some real number $A$, while also having large error
when compared to $g(w^* \cdot x)$.

This is the first \new{algorithmic} result for GLM regression \new{with
oblivious noise} which can handle more than half the samples being arbitrarily
corrupted. Prior work focused largely on the setting of linear regression, and
gave algorithms under restrictive assumptions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Privacy-preserving learning of gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) has
the potential for strong utility-privacy tradeoffs for tabular data, such as
census data or medical meta data: classical GBDT learners can extract
non-linear patterns from small sized datasets. The state-of-the-art notion for
provable privacy-properties is differential privacy, which requires that the
impact of single data points is limited and deniable. We introduce a novel
differentially private GBDT learner and utilize four main techniques to improve
the utility-privacy tradeoff. (1) We use an improved noise scaling approach
with tighter accounting of privacy leakage of a decision tree leaf compared to
prior work, resulting in noise that in expectation scales with $O(1/n)$, for
$n$ data points. (2) We integrate individual R\'enyi filters to our method to
learn from data points that have been underutilized during an iterative
training process, which -- potentially of independent interest -- results in a
natural yet effective insight to learning streams of non-i.i.d. data. (3) We
incorporate the concept of random decision tree splits to concentrate privacy
budget on learning leaves. (4) We deploy subsampling for privacy amplification.
Our evaluation shows for the Abalone dataset ($<4k$ training data points) a
$R^2$-score of $0.39$ for $\varepsilon=0.15$, which the closest prior work only
achieved for $\varepsilon=10.0$. On the Adult dataset ($50k$ training data
points) we achieve test error of $18.7\,\%$ for $\varepsilon=0.07$ which the
closest prior work only achieved for $\varepsilon=1.0$. For the Abalone dataset
for $\varepsilon=0.54$ we achieve $R^2$-score of $0.47$ which is very close to
the $R^2$-score of $0.54$ for the nonprivate version of GBDT. For the Adult
dataset for $\varepsilon=0.54$ we achieve test error $17.1\,\%$ which is very
close to the test error $13.7\,\%$ of the nonprivate version of GBDT.]]></summary>

the purpose of learning properties of quantum systems or of processing
classical or quantum data via quantum computing. As in classical learning,
quantum learning problems involve settings in which the mechanism generating
the data is unknown, and the main goal of a learning algorithm is to ensure
satisfactory accuracy levels when only given access to data and, possibly, side
information such as expert knowledge. This article reviews the complexity of
quantum learning using information-theoretic techniques by focusing on data
complexity, copy complexity, and model complexity. Copy complexity arises from
the destructive nature of quantum measurements, which irreversibly alter the
state to be processed, limiting the information that can be extracted about
quantum data. For example, in a quantum system, unlike in classical machine
learning, it is generally not possible to evaluate the training loss
simultaneously on multiple hypotheses using the same quantum data. To make the
paper self-contained and approachable by different research communities, we
provide extensive background material on classical results from statistical
learning theory, as well as on the distinguishability of quantum states.
Throughout, we highlight the differences between quantum and classical learning
by addressing both supervised and unsupervised learning, and we provide

candidates is one of the earliest steps in drug discovery. As the size of
commercially available compound collections grows exponentially to the scale of
billions, brute-force virtual screening using traditional tools such as docking
becomes infeasible in terms of time and computational resources. Active
learning and Bayesian optimization has recently been proven as effective
methods of narrowing down the search space. An essential component in those
methods is a surrogate machine learning model that is trained with a small
subset of the library to predict the desired properties of compounds. Accurate
model can achieve high sample efficiency by finding the most promising
compounds with only a fraction of the whole library being virtually screened.
In this study, we examined the performance of pretrained transformer-based
language model and graph neural network in Bayesian optimization active
learning framework. The best pretrained models identifies 58.97% of the
top-50000 by docking score after screening only 0.6% of an ultra-large library
containing 99.5 million compounds, improving 8% over previous state-of-the-art
baseline. Through extensive benchmarks, we show that the superior performance
of pretrained models persists in both structure-based and ligand-based drug
discovery. Such model can serve as a boost to the accuracy and sample

distill a large set of over 1,000 potential adversarial inputs from existing

accurately capturing the complex dynamics of dynamic power systems remains a
challenge for traditional statistical models. For these reasons, time-series
models (ARIMA) and deep-learning models (ANN, LSTM, GRU, etc.) are commonly
deployed and often experience higher success. In this paper, we analyze the
efficacy of the recently developed Transformer-based Neural Network model in
Load forecasting. Transformer models have the potential to improve Load
forecasting because of their ability to learn long-range dependencies derived
from their Attention Mechanism. We apply several metaheuristics namely
Differential Evolution to find the optimal hyperparameters of the
Transformer-based Neural Network to produce accurate forecasts. Differential
Evolution provides scalable, robust, global solutions to non-differentiable,
multi-objective, or constrained optimization problems. Our work compares the
proposed Transformer based Neural Network model integrated with different
metaheuristic algorithms by their performance in Load forecasting based on
numerical metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage
Error (MAPE). Our findings demonstrate the potential of metaheuristic-enhanced
Transformer-based Neural Network models in Load forecasting accuracy and
provide optimal hyperparameters for each model.]]></summary>

applications by identifying and alerting about the OOD samples that should not
be tested or used for making predictions. Current OOD detection methods have
made significant progress when in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples are drawn
from static distributions. However, this can be unrealistic when applied to
real-world systems which often undergo continuous variations and shifts in ID
and OOD distributions over time. Therefore, for an effective application in
real-world systems, the development of OOD detection methods that can adapt to
these dynamic and evolving distributions is essential. In this paper, we
propose a novel and more realistic setting called continuously adaptive
out-of-distribution (CAOOD) detection which targets on developing an OOD
detection model that enables dynamic and quick adaptation to a new arriving
distribution, with insufficient ID samples during deployment time. To address
CAOOD, we develop meta OOD learning (MOL) by designing a learning-to-adapt
diagram such that a good initialized OOD detection model is learned during the
training process. In the testing process, MOL ensures OOD detection performance
over shifting distributions by quickly adapting to new distributions with a few
adaptations. Extensive experiments on several OOD benchmarks endorse the
effectiveness of our method in preserving both ID classification accuracy and
OOD detection performance on continuously shifting distributions.]]></summary>

$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T d})$. The regret bound is the same as that of Soft-Bayes due

language models (LLMs). If a model is trained on a sentence of the form "A is
B", it will not automatically generalize to the reverse direction "B is A".
This is the Reversal Curse. For instance, if a model is trained on "Olaf Scholz
was the ninth Chancellor of Germany", it will not automatically be able to
answer the question, "Who was the ninth Chancellor of Germany?". Moreover, the
likelihood of the correct answer ("Olaf Scholz") will not be higher than for a
random name. Thus, models exhibit a basic failure of logical deduction and do
not generalize a prevalent pattern in their training set (i.e. if "A is B''
occurs, "B is A" is more likely to occur). We provide evidence for the Reversal
Curse by finetuning GPT-3 and Llama-1 on fictitious statements such as "Uriah
Hawthorne is the composer of 'Abyssal Melodies'" and showing that they fail to
correctly answer "Who composed 'Abyssal Melodies?'". The Reversal Curse is
robust across model sizes and model families and is not alleviated by data
augmentation. We also evaluate ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) on questions about
real-world celebrities, such as "Who is Tom Cruise's mother? [A: Mary Lee
Pfeiffer]" and the reverse "Who is Mary Lee Pfeiffer's son?". GPT-4 correctly
answers questions like the former 79% of the time, compared to 33% for the
latter. This shows a failure of logical deduction that we hypothesize is caused
by the Reversal Curse. Code is available at

Motivated by the recent advances in Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining

only text data and a pre-trained CLAP model, alleviating the need for paired
target data. Our approach leverages the similarity between audio and text

CLAP text embedding, and during inference, we decode using the audio
embeddings. To mitigate the modality gap between the audio and text embeddings
we employ strategies to bridge the gap during training and inference stages. We
evaluate our proposed method on Clotho and AudioCaps datasets demonstrating its
ability to achieve a relative performance of up to ~$83\%$ compared to fully

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Structure learning is the crux of causal inference. Notably, causal discovery
(CD) algorithms are brittle when data is scarce, possibly inferring imprecise
causal relations that contradict expert knowledge -- especially when
considering latent confounders. To aggravate the issue, most CD methods do not
provide uncertainty estimates, making it hard for users to interpret results
and improve the inference process. Surprisingly, while CD is a human-centered
affair, no works have focused on building methods that both 1) output
uncertainty estimates that can be verified by experts and 2) interact with
those experts to iteratively refine CD. To solve these issues, we start by
proposing to sample (causal) ancestral graphs proportionally to a belief
distribution based on a score function, such as the Bayesian information
criterion (BIC), using generative flow networks. Then, we leverage the
diversity in candidate graphs and introduce an optimal experimental design to
iteratively probe the expert about the relations among variables, effectively
reducing the uncertainty of our belief over ancestral graphs. Finally, we
update our samples to incorporate human feedback via importance sampling.
Importantly, our method does not require causal sufficiency (i.e., unobserved
confounders may exist). Experiments with synthetic observational data show that
our method can accurately sample from distributions over ancestral graphs and
that we can greatly improve inference quality with human aid.]]></summary>

setting in which data from different tasks is presented to the learner in a
streaming fashion. A key challenge in this setting is the so-called
"catastrophic forgetting problem", in which the performance of the learner in
an "old task" decreases when subsequently trained on a "new task". Existing
continual learning methods, such as Averaged Gradient Episodic Memory (A-GEM)
and Orthogonal Gradient Descent (OGD), address catastrophic forgetting by
minimizing the loss for the current task without increasing the loss for
previous tasks. However, these methods assume the learner knows when the task
changes, which is unrealistic in practice. In this paper, we alleviate the need
to provide the algorithm with information about task changes by using an online
clustering-based approach on a dynamically updated finite pool of samples or
gradients. We thereby successfully counteract catastrophic forgetting in one of
the hardest settings, namely: domain-incremental learning, a setting for which
the problem was previously unsolved. We showcase the benefits of our approach
by applying these ideas to projection-based methods, such as A-GEM and OGD,
which lead to task-agnostic versions of them. Experiments on real datasets

previous deep forecasting models to generalize to new roads not seen in the
training data (unseen roads) are rarely explored. In this paper, we introduce a
novel setup called a spatio-temporal (ST) split to evaluate the models'
capabilities to generalize to unseen roads. In this setup, the models are
trained on data from a sample of roads, but tested on roads not seen in the
training data. Moreover, we also present a novel framework called Spatial
Contrastive Pre-Training (SCPT) where we introduce a spatial encoder module to
extract latent features from unseen roads during inference time. This spatial
encoder is pre-trained using contrastive learning. During inference, the
spatial encoder only requires two days of traffic data on the new roads and
does not require any re-training. We also show that the output from the spatial
encoder can be used effectively to infer latent node embeddings on unseen roads
during inference time. The SCPT framework also incorporates a new layer, named
the spatially gated addition (SGA) layer, to effectively combine the latent
features from the output of the spatial encoder to existing backbones.
Additionally, since there is limited data on the unseen roads, we argue that it
is better to decouple traffic signals to trivial-to-capture periodic signals
and difficult-to-capture Markovian signals, and for the spatial encoder to only
learn the Markovian signals. Finally, we empirically evaluated SCPT using the
ST split setup on four real-world datasets. The results showed that adding SCPT
to a backbone consistently improves forecasting performance on unseen roads.
More importantly, the improvements are greater when forecasting further into
the future. The codes are available on GitHub:

calibration time for EEG-based motor imagery brain-computer interface. In order

mechanism is used to strengthen the features, and the final convolution module
can further learn the spatial-temporal information of the features. Finally, to
account for inter-subject and cross-sessions differences, we employ a dynamic
domain-adaptive strategy, the distance between features is reduced by
introducing a Maximum Mean Discrepancy loss function, and the classification
layer is fine-tuned by using part of the target domain data. We verify the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A range of applications of multi-modal music information retrieval is centred
around the problem of connecting large collections of sheet music (images) to
corresponding audio recordings, that is, identifying pairs of audio and score
excerpts that refer to the same musical content. One of the typical and most
recent approaches to this task employs cross-modal deep learning architectures
to learn joint embedding spaces that link the two distinct modalities - audio
and sheet music images. While there has been steady improvement on this front
over the past years, a number of open problems still prevent large-scale
employment of this methodology. In this article we attempt to provide an
insightful examination of the current developments on audio-sheet music
retrieval via deep learning methods. We first identify a set of main challenges
on the road towards robust and large-scale cross-modal music retrieval in real
scenarios. We then highlight the steps we have taken so far to address some of
these challenges, documenting step-by-step improvement along several
dimensions. We conclude by analysing the remaining challenges and present ideas
for solving these, in order to pave the way to a unified and robust methodology
for cross-modal music retrieval.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Electroencephalogram (EEG) data compression is necessary for wireless
recording applications to reduce the amount of data that needs to be
transmitted. In this paper, an asymmetrical sparse autoencoder with a discrete
cosine transform (DCT) layer is proposed to compress EEG signals. The encoder
module of the autoencoder has a combination of a fully connected linear layer
and the DCT layer to reduce redundant data using hard-thresholding
nonlinearity. Furthermore, the DCT layer includes trainable hard-thresholding
parameters and scaling layers to give emphasis or de-emphasis on individual DCT
coefficients. Finally, the one-by-one convolutional layer generates the latent
space. The sparsity penalty-based cost function is employed to keep the feature
map as sparse as possible in the latent space. The latent space data is
transmitted to the receiver. The decoder module of the autoencoder is designed
using the inverse DCT and two fully connected linear layers to improve the
accuracy of data reconstruction. In comparison to other state-of-the-art
methods, the proposed method significantly improves the average quality score
in various data compression experiments.]]></summary>

Relying on Stone-Weierstrass theorems on weighted spaces, we can prove a global

going beyond the usual approximation on compact sets. This then applies in
particular to approximation of (non-anticipative) path space functionals via
functional input neural networks. As a further application of the weighted
Stone-Weierstrass theorem we prove a global universal approximation result for
linear functions of the signature. We also introduce the viewpoint of Gaussian
process regression in this setting and show that the reproducing kernel Hilbert

treatment assignment policies across various domains, including healthcare and
e-commerce. However, it remains understudied in the contextual bandit setting.
We propose a new family of computationally efficient bandit algorithms for the
stochastic contextual bandit settings, with the flexibility to be adapted for
cumulative regret minimization (with near-optimal minimax guarantees) and
simple regret minimization (with SOTA guarantees). Furthermore, our algorithms
adapt to model misspecification and extend to the continuous arm settings.
These advantages come from constructing and relying on "conformal arm sets"
(CASs), which provide a set of arms at every context that encompass the
context-specific optimal arm with some probability across the context
distribution. Our positive results on simple and cumulative regret guarantees
are contrasted by a negative result, which shows that an algorithm can't
achieve instance-dependent simple regret guarantees while simultaneously
achieving minimax optimal cumulative regret guarantees.]]></summary>

are altruistic about sharing their data with the server for the collective good
whenever needed. Despite their compelling theoretical guarantee on performance
and communication efficiency, this assumption is overly idealistic and
oftentimes violated in practice, especially when the algorithm is operated over
self-interested clients, who are reluctant to share data without explicit
benefits. Negligence of such self-interested behaviors can significantly affect
the learning efficiency and even the practical operability of federated bandit
learning. In light of this, we aim to spark new insights into this
under-explored research area by formally introducing an incentivized
communication problem for federated bandits, where the server shall motivate
clients to share data by providing incentives. Without loss of generality, we
instantiate this bandit problem with the contextual linear setting and propose
the first incentivized communication protocol, namely, Inc-FedUCB, that
achieves near-optimal regret with provable communication and incentive cost
guarantees. Extensive empirical experiments on both synthetic and real-world

participants' data to train an improved global model. In federated learning,
participants cooperatively train a global model, and they will receive the
global model and payments. Rational participants try to maximize their
individual utility, and they will not input their high-quality data truthfully
unless they are provided with satisfactory payments based on their data
quality. Furthermore, federated learning benefits from the cooperative
contributions of participants. Accordingly, how to establish an incentive
mechanism that both incentivizes inputting data truthfully and promotes stable
cooperation has become an important issue to consider. In this paper, we
introduce a data sharing game model for federated learning and employ
game-theoretic approaches to design a core-selecting incentive mechanism by
utilizing a popular concept in cooperative games, the core. In federated
learning, the core can be empty, resulting in the core-selecting mechanism
becoming infeasible. To address this, our core-selecting mechanism employs a
relaxation method and simultaneously minimizes the benefits of inputting false
data for all participants. However, this mechanism is computationally expensive
because it requires aggregating exponential models for all possible coalitions,
which is infeasible in federated learning. To address this, we propose an
efficient core-selecting mechanism based on sampling approximation that only
aggregates models on sampled coalitions to approximate the exact result.
Extensive experiments verify that the efficient core-selecting mechanism can
incentivize inputting high-quality data and stable cooperation, while it
reduces computational overhead compared to the core-selecting mechanism.]]></summary>

in a variety of use cases, including journalistic news articles. Given the
potential malicious nature in which these LLMs can be used to generate
disinformation at scale, it is important to build effective detectors for such
AI-generated text. Given the surge in development of new LLMs, acquiring
labeled training data for supervised detectors is a bottleneck. However, there
might be plenty of unlabeled text data available, without information on which
generator it came from. In this work we tackle this data problem, in detecting
AI-generated news text, and frame the problem as an unsupervised domain
adaptation task. Here the domains are the different text generators, i.e. LLMs,
and we assume we have access to only the labeled source data and unlabeled
target data. We develop a Contrastive Domain Adaptation framework, called
ConDA, that blends standard domain adaptation techniques with the
representation power of contrastive learning to learn domain invariant
representations that are effective for the final unsupervised detection task.
Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, resulting in
average performance gains of 31.7% from the best performing baselines, and
within 0.8% margin of a fully supervised detector. All our code and data is

contrastive learning (CL) plays a key role. However, the recent development of
new non-CL frameworks has achieved comparable or better performance with high
improvement potential, prompting researchers to enhance these frameworks
further. Assimilating CL into non-CL frameworks has been thought to be
beneficial, but empirical evidence indicates no visible improvements. In view
of that, this paper proposes a strategy of performing CL along the dimensional
direction instead of along the batch direction as done in conventional
contrastive learning, named Dimensional Contrastive Learning (DimCL). DimCL
aims to enhance the feature diversity, and it can serve as a regularizer to
prior SSL frameworks. DimCL has been found to be effective, and the
hardness-aware property is identified as a critical reason for its success.
Extensive experimental results reveal that assimilating DimCL into SSL

optimization of quantum algorithms in the current era of noisy intermediate
scale quantum (NISQ) computers. A fundamental challenge in quantum machine
learning is generalization, as the designer targets performance under testing
conditions, while having access only to limited training data. Existing
generalization analyses, while identifying important general trends and scaling
laws, cannot be used to assign reliable and informative "error bars" to the
decisions made by quantum models. In this article, we propose a general
methodology that can reliably quantify the uncertainty of quantum models,
irrespective of the amount of training data, of the number of shots, of the
ansatz, of the training algorithm, and of the presence of quantum hardware
noise. The approach, which builds on probabilistic conformal prediction, turns
an arbitrary, possibly small, number of shots from a pre-trained quantum model
into a set prediction, e.g., an interval, that provably contains the true
target with any desired coverage level. Experimental results confirm the
theoretical calibration guarantees of the proposed framework, referred to as
quantum conformal prediction.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hierarchical reinforcement learning has been a compelling approach for
achieving goal directed behavior over long sequences of actions. However, it
has been challenging to implement in realistic or open-ended environments. A
main challenge has been to find the right space of sub-goals over which to
instantiate a hierarchy. We present a novel approach where we use data from
humans solving these tasks to softly supervise the goal space for a set of long
range tasks in a 3D embodied environment. In particular, we use unconstrained
natural language to parameterize this space. This has two advantages: first, it
is easy to generate this data from naive human participants; second, it is
flexible enough to represent a vast range of sub-goals in human-relevant tasks.
Our approach outperforms agents that clone expert behavior on these tasks, as
well as HRL from scratch without this supervised sub-goal space. Our work
presents a novel approach to combining human expert supervision with the
benefits and flexibility of reinforcement learning.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are widely used explainable-by-design
models in various applications. GAMs assume that the output can be represented
as a sum of univariate functions, referred to as components. However, this
assumption fails in ML problems where the output depends on multiple features
simultaneously. In these cases, GAMs fail to capture the interaction terms of
the underlying function, leading to subpar accuracy. To (partially) address
this issue, we propose Regionally Additive Models (RAMs), a novel class of
explainable-by-design models. RAMs identify subregions within the feature space
where interactions are minimized. Within these regions, it is more accurate to
express the output as a sum of univariate functions (components). Consequently,
RAMs fit one component per subregion of each feature instead of one component
per feature. This approach yields a more expressive model compared to GAMs
while retaining interpretability. The RAM framework consists of three steps.
Firstly, we train a black-box model. Secondly, using Regional Effect Plots, we
identify subregions where the black-box model exhibits near-local additivity.
Lastly, we fit a GAM component for each identified subregion. We validate the
effectiveness of RAMs through experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets. The results confirm that RAMs offer improved expressiveness compared
to GAMs while maintaining interpretability.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The use of skills (a.k.a., options) can greatly accelerate exploration in
reinforcement learning, especially when only sparse reward signals are
available. While option discovery methods have been proposed for individual
agents, in multi-agent reinforcement learning settings, discovering
collaborative options that can coordinate the behavior of multiple agents and
encourage them to visit the under-explored regions of their joint state space
has not been considered. In this case, we propose Multi-agent Deep Covering
Option Discovery, which constructs the multi-agent options through minimizing
the expected cover time of the multiple agents' joint state space. Also, we
propose a novel framework to adopt the multi-agent options in the MARL process.
In practice, a multi-agent task can usually be divided into some sub-tasks,
each of which can be completed by a sub-group of the agents. Therefore, our
algorithm framework first leverages an attention mechanism to find
collaborative agent sub-groups that would benefit most from coordinated
actions. Then, a hierarchical algorithm, namely HA-MSAC, is developed to learn
the multi-agent options for each sub-group to complete their sub-tasks first,
and then to integrate them through a high-level policy as the solution of the
whole task. This hierarchical option construction allows our framework to
strike a balance between scalability and effective collaboration among the
agents. The evaluation based on multi-agent collaborative tasks shows that the
proposed algorithm can effectively capture the agent interactions with the
attention mechanism, successfully identify multi-agent options, and
significantly outperforms prior works using single-agent options or no options,
in terms of both faster exploration and higher task rewards.]]></summary>

learning (RL); it requires specialized knowledge or domain data, leading to
high costs for development. To address this, we introduce Text2Reward, a
data-free framework that automates the generation of dense reward functions
based on large language models (LLMs). Given a goal described in natural
language, Text2Reward generates dense reward functions as an executable program
grounded in a compact representation of the environment. Unlike inverse RL and
recent work that uses LLMs to write sparse reward codes, Text2Reward produces
interpretable, free-form dense reward codes that cover a wide range of tasks,
utilize existing packages, and allow iterative refinement with human feedback.
We evaluate Text2Reward on two robotic manipulation benchmarks (ManiSkill2,
MetaWorld) and two locomotion environments of MuJoCo. On 13 of the 17
manipulation tasks, policies trained with generated reward codes achieve
similar or better task success rates and convergence speed than expert-written
reward codes. For locomotion tasks, our method learns six novel locomotion
behaviors with a success rate exceeding 94%. Furthermore, we show that the
policies trained in the simulator with our method can be deployed in the real
world. Finally, Text2Reward further improves the policies by refining their
reward functions with human feedback. Video results are available at

estimation for stochastic optimization, we extend QSW into Randomized
Quasi-Sliced Wasserstein (RQSW) by introducing randomness to the discussed
low-discrepancy sequences. For theoretical properties, we prove the asymptotic
convergence of QSW and the unbiasedness of RQSW. Finally, we conduct

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper introduces Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs), a new class of
generative model in which the parameters of a set of independent distributions
are modified with Bayesian inference in the light of noisy data samples, then
passed as input to a neural network that outputs a second, interdependent
distribution. Starting from a simple prior and iteratively updating the two
distributions yields a generative procedure similar to the reverse process of
diffusion models; however it is conceptually simpler in that no forward process
is required. Discrete and continuous-time loss functions are derived for
continuous, discretised and discrete data, along with sample generation
procedures. Notably, the network inputs for discrete data lie on the
probability simplex, and are therefore natively differentiable, paving the way
for gradient-based sample guidance and few-step generation in discrete domains
such as language modelling. The loss function directly optimises data
compression and places no restrictions on the network architecture. In our
experiments BFNs achieve competitive log-likelihoods for image modelling on
dynamically binarized MNIST and CIFAR-10, and outperform all known discrete
diffusion models on the text8 character-level language modelling task.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Structure learning is the crux of causal inference. Notably, causal discovery
(CD) algorithms are brittle when data is scarce, possibly inferring imprecise
causal relations that contradict expert knowledge -- especially when
considering latent confounders. To aggravate the issue, most CD methods do not
provide uncertainty estimates, making it hard for users to interpret results
and improve the inference process. Surprisingly, while CD is a human-centered
affair, no works have focused on building methods that both 1) output
uncertainty estimates that can be verified by experts and 2) interact with
those experts to iteratively refine CD. To solve these issues, we start by
proposing to sample (causal) ancestral graphs proportionally to a belief
distribution based on a score function, such as the Bayesian information
criterion (BIC), using generative flow networks. Then, we leverage the
diversity in candidate graphs and introduce an optimal experimental design to
iteratively probe the expert about the relations among variables, effectively
reducing the uncertainty of our belief over ancestral graphs. Finally, we
update our samples to incorporate human feedback via importance sampling.
Importantly, our method does not require causal sufficiency (i.e., unobserved
confounders may exist). Experiments with synthetic observational data show that
our method can accurately sample from distributions over ancestral graphs and
that we can greatly improve inference quality with human aid.]]></summary>

ecological civilization patterns for achieving Sustainable Development Goals
(namely, sustainable development patterns), are of utmost importance for
promoting ecological, economic, social, and resource sustainability in a
specific region. To achieve this, the recommendation process must carefully
consider the region's natural, environmental, resource, and economic
characteristics. However, current recommendation algorithms in the field of
computer science fall short in adequately addressing the spatial heterogeneity
related to environment and sparsity of regional historical interaction data,
which limits their effectiveness in recommending sustainable development
patterns. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a method called
User Graph after Pruning and Intent Graph (UGPIG). Firstly, we utilize the
high-density linking capability of the pruned User Graph to address the issue
of spatial heterogeneity neglect in recommendation algorithms. Secondly, we
construct an Intent Graph by incorporating the intent network, which captures
the preferences for attributes including environmental elements of target
regions. This approach effectively alleviates the problem of sparse historical
interaction data in the region. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate
that UGPIG outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms like KGCN,
KGAT, and KGIN in sustainable development pattern recommendations, with a
maximum improvement of 9.61% in Top-3 recommendation performance.]]></summary>

Such trajectory big data bring new opportunities to human mobility research but
also raise public concerns with regard to location privacy. In this work, we
present the Conditional Adversarial Trajectory Synthesis (CATS), a
deep-learning-based GeoAI methodological framework for privacy-preserving
trajectory data generation and publication. CATS applies K-anonymity to the
underlying spatiotemporal distributions of human movements, which provides a
distributional-level strong privacy guarantee. By leveraging conditional
adversarial training on K-anonymized human mobility matrices, trajectory global
context learning using the attention-based mechanism, and recurrent bipartite
graph matching of adjacent trajectory points, CATS is able to reconstruct
trajectory topology from conditionally sampled locations and generate
high-quality individual-level synthetic trajectory data, which can serve as
supplements or alternatives to raw data for privacy-preserving trajectory data
publication. The experiment results on over 90k GPS trajectories show that our
method has a better performance in privacy preservation, spatiotemporal
characteristic preservation, and downstream utility compared with baseline
methods, which brings new insights into privacy-preserving human mobility

control problem whose state space is the $d$-dimensional positive orthant. The
controlled process $Z$ evolves as a reflected Brownian motion whose covariance
matrix is exogenously specified, as are its directions of reflection from the
orthant's boundary surfaces. A system manager chooses a drift vector
$\theta(t)$ at each time $t$ based on the history of $Z$, and the cost rate at
time $t$ depends on both $Z(t)$ and $\theta(t)$. In our initial problem
formulation, the objective is to minimize expected discounted cost over an
infinite planning horizon, after which we treat the corresponding ergodic
control problem. Extending earlier work by Han et al. (Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences, 2018, 8505-8510), we develop and illustrate a
simulation-based computational method that relies heavily on deep neural
network technology. For test problems studied thus far, our method is accurate
to within a fraction of one percent, and is computationally feasible in

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We consider the problem of training private recommendation models with access
to public item features. Training with Differential Privacy (DP) offers strong
privacy guarantees, at the expense of loss in recommendation quality. We show
that incorporating public item features during training can help mitigate this
loss in quality. We propose a general approach based on collective matrix
factorization (CMF), that works by simultaneously factorizing two matrices: the
user feedback matrix (representing sensitive data) and an item feature matrix
that encodes publicly available (non-sensitive) item information.

The method is conceptually simple, easy to tune, and highly scalable. It can
be applied to different types of public item data, including: (1) categorical
item features; (2) item-item similarities learned from public sources; and (3)
publicly available user feedback. Furthermore, these data modalities can be
collectively utilized to fully leverage public data.

Evaluating our method on a standard DP recommendation benchmark, we find that
using public item features significantly narrows the quality gap between
private models and their non-private counterparts. As privacy constraints
become more stringent, models rely more heavily on public side features for
recommendation. This results in a smooth transition from collaborative
filtering to item-based contextual recommendations.]]></summary>

continuously provide content to their consumers. Sequential recommendation
consequently has seen considerable attention in current literature, where state
of the art approaches focus on self-attentive models leveraging contextual
information such as long and short-term user history and item features;
however, most of these studies focus on long-form content domains (retail,
movie, etc.) rather than short-form, such as music. Additionally, many do not
explore incorporating negative session-level feedback during training. In this
study, we investigate the use of transformer-based self-attentive architectures
to learn implicit session-level information for sequential music
recommendation. We additionally propose a contrastive learning task to
incorporate negative feedback (e.g skipped tracks) to promote positive hits and
penalize negative hits. This task is formulated as a simple loss term that can
be incorporated into a variety of deep learning architectures for sequential
recommendation. Our experiments show that this results in consistent
performance gains over the baseline architectures ignoring negative user

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A sequential pattern with negation, or negative sequential pattern, takes the
form of a sequential pattern for which the negation symbol may be used in front
of some of the pattern's itemsets. Intuitively, such a pattern occurs in a
sequence if negated itemsets are absent in the sequence. Recent work has shown
that different semantics can be attributed to these pattern forms, and that
state-of-the-art algorithms do not extract the same sets of patterns. This
raises the important question of the interpretability of sequential pattern
with negation. In this study, our focus is on exploring how potential users
perceive negation in sequential patterns. Our aim is to determine whether
specific semantics are more "intuitive" than others and whether these align
with the semantics employed by one or more state-of-the-art algorithms. To
achieve this, we designed a questionnaire to reveal the semantics' intuition of
each user. This article presents both the design of the questionnaire and an
in-depth analysis of the 124 responses obtained. The outcomes indicate that two
of the semantics are predominantly intuitive; however, neither of them aligns
with the semantics of the primary state-of-the-art algorithms. As a result, we
provide recommendations to account for this disparity in the conclusions drawn.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep learning's immense capabilities are often constrained by the complexity
of its models, leading to an increasing demand for effective sparsification
techniques. Bayesian sparsification for deep learning emerges as a crucial
approach, facilitating the design of models that are both computationally
efficient and competitive in terms of performance across various deep learning
applications. The state-of-the-art -- in Bayesian sparsification of deep neural
networks -- combines structural shrinkage priors on model weights with an
approximate inference scheme based on black-box stochastic variational
inference. However, model inversion of the full generative model is
exceptionally computationally demanding, especially when compared to standard
deep learning of point estimates. In this context, we advocate for the use of
Bayesian model reduction (BMR) as a more efficient alternative for pruning of
model weights. As a generalization of the Savage-Dickey ratio, BMR allows a
post-hoc elimination of redundant model weights based on the posterior
estimates under a straightforward (non-hierarchical) generative model. Our
comparative study highlights the computational efficiency and the pruning rate
of the BMR method relative to the established stochastic variational inference
(SVI) scheme, when applied to the full hierarchical generative model. We
illustrate the potential of BMR to prune model parameters across various deep
learning architectures, from classical networks like LeNet to modern frameworks
such as Vision Transformers and MLP-Mixers.]]></summary>

recent years, most developed methods rely on the assumption that the training
and test data have similar distributions. In the presence of distribution
shifts, fair models may behave unfairly on test data. There have been some
developments for fair learning robust to distribution shifts to address this
shortcoming. However, most proposed solutions are based on the assumption of
having access to the causal graph describing the interaction of different
features. Moreover, existing algorithms require full access to data and cannot
be used when small batches are used (stochastic/batch implementation). This
paper proposes the first stochastic distributionally robust fairness framework
with convergence guarantees that do not require knowledge of the causal graph.
More specifically, we formulate the fair inference in the presence of the
distribution shift as a distributionally robust optimization problem under
$L_p$ norm uncertainty sets with respect to the Exponential Renyi Mutual
Information (ERMI) as the measure of fairness violation. We then discuss how
the proposed method can be implemented in a stochastic fashion. We have
evaluated the presented framework's performance and efficiency through
extensive experiments on real datasets consisting of distribution shifts.]]></summary>

prediction, models embedded with FINs reduced the root mean square error by
around 1000 compared to the baseline. In the speech emotion recognition task,
the FIN-augmented model increased classification accuracy by over 3 percent.
Lastly, in the CNP detection experiment, an improvement of about 7 percent was

modalities (especially vision) have achieved unprecedented performance in
various multimodal tasks. However, due to the unsolved adversarial robustness
problem of vision models, MLLMs can have more severe safety and security risks
by introducing the vision inputs. In this work, we study the adversarial
robustness of Google's Bard, a competitive chatbot to ChatGPT that released its
multimodal capability recently, to better understand the vulnerabilities of
commercial MLLMs. By attacking white-box surrogate vision encoders or MLLMs,
the generated adversarial examples can mislead Bard to output wrong image
descriptions with a 22% success rate based solely on the transferability. We
show that the adversarial examples can also attack other MLLMs, e.g., a 26%
attack success rate against Bing Chat and a 86% attack success rate against
ERNIE bot. Moreover, we identify two defense mechanisms of Bard, including face
detection and toxicity detection of images. We design corresponding attacks to
evade these defenses, demonstrating that the current defenses of Bard are also
vulnerable. We hope this work can deepen our understanding on the robustness of
MLLMs and facilitate future research on defenses. Our code is available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Self-supervised representation learning has seen remarkable progress in the
last few years, with some of the recent methods being able to learn useful
image representations without labels. These methods are trained using
backpropagation, the de facto standard. Recently, Geoffrey Hinton proposed the
forward-forward algorithm as an alternative training method. It utilizes two
forward passes and a separate loss function for each layer to train the network
without backpropagation.

In this study, for the first time, we study the performance of
forward-forward vs. backpropagation for self-supervised representation learning
and provide insights into the learned representation spaces. Our benchmark
employs four standard datasets, namely MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR-10, and
three commonly used self-supervised representation learning techniques, namely
rotation, flip and jigsaw.

Our main finding is that while the forward-forward algorithm performs
comparably to backpropagation during (self-)supervised training, the transfer
performance is significantly lagging behind in all the studied settings. This
may be caused by a combination of factors, including having a loss function for
each layer and the way the supervised training is realized in the
forward-forward paradigm. In comparison to backpropagation, the forward-forward
algorithm focuses more on the boundaries and drops part of the information
unnecessary for making decisions which harms the representation learning goal.
Further investigation and research are necessary to stabilize the
forward-forward strategy for self-supervised learning, to work beyond the
datasets and configurations demonstrated by Geoffrey Hinton.]]></summary>

sheet music images to audio recordings. A typical and recent approach to this
is to learn, via deep neural networks, a joint embedding space that correlates
short fixed-size snippets of audio and sheet music by means of an appropriate
similarity structure. However, two challenges that arise out of this strategy
are the requirement of strongly aligned data to train the networks, and the
inherent discrepancies of musical content between audio and sheet music
snippets caused by local and global tempo differences. In this paper, we
address these two shortcomings by designing a cross-modal recurrent network
that learns joint embeddings that can summarize longer passages of
corresponding audio and sheet music. The benefits of our method are that it
only requires weakly aligned audio-sheet music pairs, as well as that the
recurrent network handles the non-linearities caused by tempo variations
between audio and sheet music. We conduct a number of experiments on synthetic
and real piano data and scores, showing that our proposed recurrent method
leads to more accurate retrieval in all possible configurations.]]></summary>

We experimentally analyze different block sizes and show further reduction in

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cameras are rapidly becoming the choice for on-board sensors towards space
rendezvous due to their small form factor and inexpensive power, mass, and
volume costs. When it comes to docking, however, they typically serve a
secondary role, whereas the main work is done by active sensors such as lidar.
This paper documents the development of a proposed AI-based (artificial
intelligence) navigation algorithm intending to mature the use of on-board
visible wavelength cameras as a main sensor for docking and on-orbit servicing
(OOS), reducing the dependency on lidar and greatly reducing costs.
Specifically, the use of AI enables the expansion of the relative navigation
solution towards multiple classes of scenarios, e.g., in terms of targets or
illumination conditions, which would otherwise have to be crafted on a
case-by-case manner using classical image processing methods. Multiple
convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone architectures are benchmarked on
synthetically generated data of docking manoeuvres with the International Space
Station (ISS), achieving position and attitude estimates close to 1%
range-normalised and 1 deg, respectively. The integration of the solution with
a physical prototype of the refuelling mechanism is validated in laboratory
using a robotic arm to simulate a berthing procedure.]]></summary>

two top-performing recommendation algorithms, Weight Relevance Matrix

recommending artists as a function of artist popularity. We find that both
algorithms improve recommendation performance for more popular artists and, as
such, exhibit popularity degradation bias. While both algorithms produce a
similar level of performance for more popular artists, Mult-VAE shows better

of such surveys are regularly administered by the U.S. government. However,
they field independent, unconnected samples with specialized questions,
limiting research questions to those that can be answered by a single survey.
The fusionACS project seeks to integrate data from multiple U.S. household

Community Survey (ACS) microdata. This results in an integrated microdataset of
household attributes and well-being dimensions that can be analyzed to address
research questions in ways that are not currently possible. The presented data
comprise the fusion onto the ACS of select donor variables from the Residential
Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) of 2015, the National Household Transportation
Survey (NHTS) of 2017, the American Housing Survey (AHS) of 2019, and the
Consumer Expenditure Survey - Interview (CEI) for the years 2015-2019. The

recent years, most developed methods rely on the assumption that the training
and test data have similar distributions. In the presence of distribution
shifts, fair models may behave unfairly on test data. There have been some
developments for fair learning robust to distribution shifts to address this
shortcoming. However, most proposed solutions are based on the assumption of
having access to the causal graph describing the interaction of different
features. Moreover, existing algorithms require full access to data and cannot
be used when small batches are used (stochastic/batch implementation). This
paper proposes the first stochastic distributionally robust fairness framework
with convergence guarantees that do not require knowledge of the causal graph.
More specifically, we formulate the fair inference in the presence of the
distribution shift as a distributionally robust optimization problem under
$L_p$ norm uncertainty sets with respect to the Exponential Renyi Mutual
Information (ERMI) as the measure of fairness violation. We then discuss how
the proposed method can be implemented in a stochastic fashion. We have
evaluated the presented framework's performance and efficiency through
extensive experiments on real datasets consisting of distribution shifts.]]></summary>

particularly in the context of social media platforms, where the goal is to
maximize user engagement and revenue while maintaining a satisfactory user
experience. This requires the optimization of conflicting objectives, such as
user satisfaction and ads revenue. Traditional approaches to ad-load balancing
rely on static allocation policies, which fail to adapt to changing user
preferences and contextual factors. In this paper, we present an approach that
leverages off-policy learning and evaluation from logged bandit feedback. We
start by presenting a motivating analysis of the ad-load balancing problem,
highlighting the conflicting objectives between user satisfaction and ads
revenue. We emphasize the nuances that arise due to user heterogeneity and the
dependence on the user's position within a session. Based on this analysis, we
define the problem as determining the optimal ad-load for a particular feed
fetch. To tackle this problem, we propose an off-policy learning framework that
leverages unbiased estimators such as Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) and
Doubly Robust (DR) to learn and estimate the policy values using offline
collected stochastic data. We present insights from online A/B experiments
deployed at scale across over 80 million users generating over 200 million
sessions, where we find statistically significant improvements in both user
satisfaction metrics and ads revenue for the platform.]]></summary>

platforms, users are becoming more concerned about their privacy. And
recommender system is the core component of online platforms for providing
personalized service, consequently, its privacy preservation has attracted
great attention. As the gold standard of privacy protection, differential
privacy has been widely adopted to preserve privacy in recommender systems.
However, existing differentially private recommender systems only consider
static and independent interactions, so they cannot apply to sequential
recommendation where behaviors are dynamic and dependent. Meanwhile, little
attention has been paid on the privacy risk of sensitive user features, most of
them only protect user feedbacks. In this work, we propose a novel
DIfferentially Private Sequential recommendation framework with a noisy Graph
Neural Network approach (denoted as DIPSGNN) to address these limitations. To
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to achieve differential privacy in
sequential recommendation with dependent interactions. Specifically, in
DIPSGNN, we first leverage piecewise mechanism to protect sensitive user
features. Then, we innovatively add calibrated noise into aggregation step of
graph neural network based on aggregation perturbation mechanism. And this
noisy graph neural network can protect sequentially dependent interactions and
capture user preferences simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our method over state-of-the-art differentially private
recommender systems in terms of better balance between privacy and accuracy.]]></summary>

structural topology optimization utilizing the SIMP algorithm. Consequently,
our framework generates inherently near-optimal designs. Our work presents
quantitative results that support the structural performance of the generated
designs and the variability in potential candidate designs. Furthermore, we
provide evidence of the scalability of our framework by operating over voxel

approach for the Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance, which has an intractable
expectation in its analytical form. However, the MC method is not optimal in
terms of minimizing the absolute approximation error. To provide a better class
of empirical SW, we propose quasi-sliced Wasserstein (QSW) approximations that
rely on Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. For a comprehensive investigation of
QMC for SW, we focus on the 3D setting, specifically computing the SW between
probability measures in three dimensions. In greater detail, we empirically
verify various ways of constructing QMC points sets on the 3D unit-hypersphere,
including Gaussian-based mapping, equal area mapping, generalized spiral
points, and optimizing discrepancy energies. Furthermore, to obtain an unbiased
estimation for stochastic optimization, we extend QSW into Randomized
Quasi-Sliced Wasserstein (RQSW) by introducing randomness to the discussed
low-discrepancy sequences. For theoretical properties, we prove the asymptotic
convergence of QSW and the unbiasedness of RQSW. Finally, we conduct
experiments on various 3D tasks, such as point-cloud comparison, point-cloud
interpolation, image style transfer, and training deep point-cloud
autoencoders, to demonstrate the favorable performance of the proposed QSW and

generalized linear models (GLMs) in the presence of additive oblivious noise.
We assume we have sample access to examples $(x, y)$ where $y$ is a noisy
measurement of $g(w^* \cdot x)$. In particular, \new{the noisy labels are of
the form} $y = g(w^* \cdot x) + \xi + \epsilon$, where $\xi$ is the oblivious
noise drawn independently of $x$ \new{and satisfies} $\Pr[\xi = 0] \geq o(1)$,
and $\epsilon \sim \mathcal N(0, \sigma^2)$. Our goal is to accurately recover
a \new{parameter vector $w$ such that the} function $g(w \cdot x)$ \new{has}
arbitrarily small error when compared to the true values $g(w^* \cdot x)$,
rather than the noisy measurements $y$.

We present an algorithm that tackles \new{this} problem in its most general
distribution-independent setting, where the solution may not \new{even} be

solution if it is identifiable, and otherwise returns a small list of
candidates, one of which is close to the true solution. Furthermore, we
\new{provide} a necessary and sufficient condition for identifiability, which
holds in broad settings. \new{Specifically,} the problem is identifiable when
the quantile at which $\xi + \epsilon = 0$ is known, or when the family of
hypotheses does not contain candidates that are nearly equal to a translated
$g(w^* \cdot x) + A$ for some real number $A$, while also having large error
when compared to $g(w^* \cdot x)$.

This is the first \new{algorithmic} result for GLM regression \new{with

key parameters are the number of data considered at each step or batch size
$B$, and the step size or learning rate $\eta$. For small $B$ and large $\eta$,
SGD corresponds to a stochastic evolution of the parameters, whose noise
amplitude is governed by the `temperature' $T\equiv \eta/B$. Yet this
description is observed to break down for sufficiently large batches $B\geq
B^*$, or simplifies to gradient descent (GD) when the temperature is
sufficiently small. Understanding where these cross-overs take place remains a
central challenge. Here we resolve these questions for a teacher-student
perceptron classification model, and show empirically that our key predictions
still apply to deep networks. Specifically, we obtain a phase diagram in the
$B$-$\eta$ plane that separates three dynamical phases: $\textit{(i)}$ a
noise-dominated SGD governed by temperature, $\textit{(ii)}$ a
large-first-step-dominated SGD and $\textit{(iii)}$ GD. These different phases
also corresponds to different regimes of generalization error. Remarkably, our
analysis reveals that the batch size $B^*$ separating regimes $\textit{(i)}$
and $\textit{(ii)}$ scale with the size $P$ of the training set, with an
exponent that characterizes the hardness of the classification problem.]]></summary>

models in various applications. GAMs assume that the output can be represented
as a sum of univariate functions, referred to as components. However, this
assumption fails in ML problems where the output depends on multiple features
simultaneously. In these cases, GAMs fail to capture the interaction terms of
the underlying function, leading to subpar accuracy. To (partially) address
this issue, we propose Regionally Additive Models (RAMs), a novel class of
explainable-by-design models. RAMs identify subregions within the feature space
where interactions are minimized. Within these regions, it is more accurate to
express the output as a sum of univariate functions (components). Consequently,
RAMs fit one component per subregion of each feature instead of one component
per feature. This approach yields a more expressive model compared to GAMs
while retaining interpretability. The RAM framework consists of three steps.
Firstly, we train a black-box model. Secondly, using Regional Effect Plots, we
identify subregions where the black-box model exhibits near-local additivity.
Lastly, we fit a GAM component for each identified subregion. We validate the
effectiveness of RAMs through experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets. The results confirm that RAMs offer improved expressiveness compared
to GAMs while maintaining interpretability.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We introduce so-called functional input neural networks defined on a possibly
infinite dimensional weighted space with values also in a possibly infinite
dimensional output space. To this end, we use an additive family as hidden
layer maps and a non-linear activation function applied to each hidden layer.
Relying on Stone-Weierstrass theorems on weighted spaces, we can prove a global
universal approximation result for generalizations of continuous functions
going beyond the usual approximation on compact sets. This then applies in
particular to approximation of (non-anticipative) path space functionals via
functional input neural networks. As a further application of the weighted
Stone-Weierstrass theorem we prove a global universal approximation result for
linear functions of the signature. We also introduce the viewpoint of Gaussian
process regression in this setting and show that the reproducing kernel Hilbert
space of the signature kernels are Cameron-Martin spaces of certain Gaussian
processes. This paves the way towards uncertainty quantification for signature
kernel regression.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Initialization of neural network weights plays a pivotal role in determining
their performance. Feature Imitating Networks (FINs) offer a novel strategy by
initializing weights to approximate specific closed-form statistical features,
setting a promising foundation for deep learning architectures. While the
applicability of FINs has been chiefly tested in biomedical domains, this study
extends its exploration into other time series datasets. Three different
experiments are conducted in this study to test the applicability of imitating
Tsallis entropy for performance enhancement: Bitcoin price prediction, speech
emotion recognition, and chronic neck pain detection. For the Bitcoin price
prediction, models embedded with FINs reduced the root mean square error by
around 1000 compared to the baseline. In the speech emotion recognition task,
the FIN-augmented model increased classification accuracy by over 3 percent.
Lastly, in the CNP detection experiment, an improvement of about 7 percent was
observed compared to established classifiers. These findings validate the broad
utility and potency of FINs in diverse applications.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I created a voice profile based on recordings of my own voice over on voice.ai.
 The audio was crisp, loud and clear.
 I only added about 16 minutes if it though. (A minimum of 15 minutes is recommended)
 When I take a prerecorded voice clip and feed it through the voice profile I created, it’s just silent for all 15 seconds that it grants you before you upgrade.
 Then it has the little 2 second audio watermark at the end, where it says “voice AI,” and that I can hear perfectly fine!
 I’ve searched all over for others who might have had this problem, but it seems like the main problem people have reported difficulties with audio are/were tend to center around the live mode failing to function properly.
 Has anyone had this issue before?
 Should I add more audio to the voice profile to make it more well rounded perhaps?
 If so, how much audio do you typically need to create a solid custom voice profile?
 Should I just update to the paid version? I don’t really think that would fix it, and I wanted to wait to upgrade until I had some proof that it worked, yanno?
 I’m not sure what to do…
 Any ideas?

 I'm Daria from the Cerebras ML team, and I've got some thrilling updates to share with you! 🚀 We've recently published our BTLM-3B-8K paper on arXiv, and I’m excited to share that I am one of the authors! Check it out here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11568
 It distills our recipe for training SOTA LLMs:
  
An extensively deduplicated dataset: SlimPajama 
 Hyperparameter search using muP 
 Variable sequence length training + ALiBi 
 Aggressive LR decay 
  
Our BTLM-3B-8K not only sets a new standard for 3B parameter models but also frequently surpasses the performance of 7B models! In the paper, we meticulously outline how we developed the BTLM model and conducted a comprehensive analysis of its performance on 22 validation benchmarks. These benchmarks span a range of capabilities including common sense reasoning, world knowledge, reading comprehension, code generation, long sequence interpolation/extrapolation, bias, toxicity, and misinformation.
 For those eager to dive in, we've made our SlimPajama dataset and the BTLM-3B-8K model available on Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/cerebras 🎉
 Feel free to delve into the details, explore the dataset and model, and let us know your thoughts, insights, or questions! We're here to discuss and excited to hear your feedback. Happy exploring! 🚀

Does anybody know of any resources out there that looked into this question, given that LoRA has been around for a little bit now? Perhaps someone has performed similar subspace overlap / optimal "r" value studies on some of the LLMs that fall in-between GPT2 and 3, i.e. some of the ~7B, ~15B, ~40B and ~70B models?

 I've been diving deep into the world of neural networks, and recently, I've been particularly intrigued by the dynamicity of attention head parameters (weights).

 The question is, what does dynamic mean in this context? Is it input-adaptive? Do weights change at inference time according to inputs? 
 I have a hard time understanding this concept, for me, weights are static and pre-established at training time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As AI models get bigger, training them requires more and more computing power. Researchers are looking for ways to train these large AI models without needing Google-scale resources.
 A new paper proposes LongLoRA, a fine-tuning approach that can extend LLaMA2 7B to 100k context length and 70B model to 32k context length on a single 8× A100 machine.
 Here are my highlights from the paper:
 Big one of course: LongLoRA efficiently fine-tunes large AI models on longer texts
 Key points:
  
Approximates standard attention via "shift short attention" during training
 Tuning only a subset of weights (LoRA) plus some embeddings & norms
 Fine-tuned 7B parameter model on 100k tokens with 1 machine
 Way lower training cost than full fine-tuning for large contexts
 Close to full fine-tuning performance
  
The core insight is that an approximation of full attention enables efficient training while retaining standard attention for final inference. Combined with selective weight tuning, this really reduces compute needs.
 I think this demonstrates the potential to train more capable AI without unreasonable resources. Efficient training techniques = more powerful LLMs for the same resources.
 Full summary here.

 Each project manager has qualifications on what program he/she can handle. This constraint is a hard constraint.
 Time slots start from 6AM to 6PM. This means that if Program A which lasts for 30 minutes is assigned to start at 6:00AM, then it will end at 6:30AM. Only one program can be assigned in each station, so there should be no overlap in programs in terms of day and time per station.

 RNN is thought to be non-parallelizable because of its inherent sequential nature: its state depends on its previous state. This makes training RNN for long sequence usually takes long time compared to other architecture classes (like CNN).
 What we present is an algorithm based on Newton's method to evaluate and train RNN in parallel. In one of our experiment, we can achieve >1000x faster evaluation of a small GRU compared to common sequential method on a very long sequence. Training RNNs with our algorithm could also be more than 10x faster than training with sequential method.

 I'm a newbie for the domain of reinforcement learning (RL). My main research on various software systems, mainly on multi-agent system (MAS). AAMAS, a conference focusing on Multi-agent system, I think is the good conference to study in MAS. Recently, there are many researchers for MAS that is great combination with reinforecement learning to do some interesting things. Also, game theory is a
 interesting knowledge what I'm curious about how to do within RL and agents.
 Does any recommended conference or journal for RL? don't mind for just only RL algorithm, that's enough great, whereas I prefer to the conference concerning RL applied some software system for some problem.

 Briefly their idea for self-supervised learning is to reconstruct a corrupted image (e.g., random masking) using Langevin step of a learned energy function and the reconstructed image is compared to the clean image for supervision.
 i.e.,
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/q9e1pd9yarpb1.png?width=953&format=png&auto=webp&s=528e654d3ae4db1435aa3c11e5edc787876fd9ac
 This should work because going along the decreasing energy value ensures that corrupted images have high energy and clean images have low energy.
 Everything made sense to me until I tried to implement it.
 ​
 In order to optimize the parameters (\theta), we have to take the gradient of the loss w.r.t \theta and by the chain the chain rule we will compute the gradient of the reconstructed x (\tilde x) w.r.t \theta.
 ​

 Is this even correct? What am I even talking about I am confused.
 Anyways ...
 They provided the following PyTorch pseudocode and I have provided the actual PyTorch code.

 Actually the model parameters never change no matter what what the values of step size (alpha) or the learning rate are.
 I am missing something?

 there was a voice-guided navigation system for GTA 4 with a female voice, I would love to use that as my Google Maps and Waze navigation voice 
 I tried looking for anything online but the mods available are of very inferior quality and from a few years ago which won't work properly with Google Maps as a lot of the voice commands are missing 
 the sample for the voice can be found in these 2 YouTube videos 
 first sample 11 minutes repeated statements
 2nd sample 1 minute without repeated statements
 Using Adobe podcast I can remove a lot of the background noise 
 The problem is I don't know much about sound tuning so using whatever free ai I could find on the internet the voice is not being cloned properly it is sounding mechanical or just like google ttss

 His note:
 I have many questions, but they all revolve around two issues.
 The first is when the weights in the neural net converge, do they exhibit any recognizable pattern. I realize that when the number of nodes and levels in the net are large it may be impossible to recognize the pattern. But suppose that the problem being examined is a simple categorization and the number of nodes in the net is small, is it possible to see a pattern in the weights?

Large language models (LLMs) have enabled a new data-efficient learning paradigm wherein they can be used to solve unseen new tasks via zero-shot or few-shot prompting. However, LLMs are challenging to deploy for real-world applications due to their sheer size. For instance, serving a single 175 billion LLM requires at least 350GB of GPU memory using specialized infrastructure, not to mention that today's state-of-the-art LLMs are composed of over 500 billion parameters. Such computational requirements are inaccessible for many research teams, especially for applications that require low latency performance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Copyright Office has ruled that AI-generated art cannot be copyrighted, raising questions about whether AI-generated art should be excluded from copyright protection.
 
The Copyright Office argues that AI-generated art is a 'merely mechanical' process with no novelty, invention, or originality, and therefore does not deserve copyright protection.
 
Critics, however, argue that this approach is not scalable and fails to consider the creative choices made by AI artists.
 
They suggest that AI-generated art should be treated similarly to photography, where even though the image is captured mechanically, it still reflects the creative choices of the photographer and is eligible for copyright protection.
 
Photographers are able to own the copyright in their photographs because they make creative judgments about where to point the camera, when to snap the image, and how to adjust camera settings.
 
Similarly, AI artists explore the 'latent space' of images that AI software can produce, making creative judgments about which images to select and explore.
 
While the actual image is produced by the software, the important point is that a human being is making creative decisions about the art.
 
Therefore, critics argue that AI-generated art should be eligible for copyright protection, as it reflects the creative choices and judgments of the AI artist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi world
 I'm trying to implement dqn and ddqn on various playgrounds with Matlab, from scratch. I use dqn and ddqn with replay buffer. I tried to used gradient clipping. But I find it very difficult to tune.
 I mean I tuned and programmed successfully various algorithm such as different GAN that are not necessarily very easy to tune. RL algorithm seems even worse.
 I tried several grid world problems, cart pole and even a very simple second order system regulation (integrator + 1 st order pôle). 
 Even the Matlab cart pole demo with ddqn does not provide a very satisfactory result (after training, the contrôler keep the pendulum in uprigth position, but the cart slowly drift).
 On the second order system, the learning seems ok for about 200 épisode(test shows that the expected behavior is almost learnt) and then suddenly the average episode score has a kind of inflection and everything blowns up, despite a very large replay buffer.
 So my question : is it possible to make dqn and ddqn work well with a reasonable tuning session length? Are policy optimization easier to tune (and/or more efficient)? So far, it seems to me that these action-vzlue based algorithms are highly unstable and the training may only works for a 'miraculous' tunning. What are you thought?

 The irony here is that I mostly agree with this theory - but the article reflects how little we really know about consciousness and how it works, and how what's considered the "expert opinion" that AI can't possess consciousness is arguably influenced more by popularity than real empirical evidence.
 By whatever mechanism, they can respond to their treatment in unexpectedly humanlike ways. 
 Oh, and by the way, did you think that "sentient Bing" was finally dead? Think again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there,
 I'll provide a quick introduction first. I am a mechatronics engineer student who is graduating this semester, I have been also privately studying ML, DL, CV for the past year because that's when I decided that I want to make an autonomous drone as my thesis/graduation project and oh my god, little did I know. I have aquired so much knowledge in the data science field and truth be told I love it, it engages my mind like crazy so I've decided that i would like my career to be revolved around electronics and programming/ data science.
 Back to the topic, I am working on object detection (I got it figured out), and reinforcement learning, so what I would like to do is to train the model on reaching it's destination using collision avoidance, I have a PIX4, RPI 4B 4GBs since I'm also building my drone from scratch, so let's say I have all the hardware which ofcourse includes the GPS + Compass and 5 ultrasonic sensors, 1 at each side and 1 down to hold the altitude accurately. I was thinking of HITL, making a virtual environment to train my model there because this is what logic says, ofcourse( I could also fly it using the RC controller and for example test if the obstacle avoidance is going to overrule the manual drive, which is also my objective). The question is: how can I make sure virtual drone is going to be equipped with the real-life sensors and in the needed positions? How can I feed all the sensors data during the training? Which type of reinforcement learning models should I implement? 
 I just feel like I dragged myself into an incredibly amazing and complex project which is going to end up fucking my semester and I won't be able to graduate, it's just that my stress now is skyrocketing. 
 Please feel free to throw any advice or opinions my way, and thank you for keeping up with this long post. 😁

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are happy to share with you BlindChat, the open-source and privacy-by-design alternative to ChatGPT for a fully in-browser, yet private, Conversational AI!
 You can play with it on our Gradio demo.
 Our philosophy is that Conversational AI should be easily accessible, and privacy should not be a luxury but a given.
 By leveraging local models running in the browser, with transformers.js, we make it possible to have a fully transparent and private AI that works on your browser without any extra setup. Because all the logic is offloaded to users’ devices, data never leaves and there is no risk of it being used for finetuning by third parties.
 For now, we only support inference with LaMini-Flan-T5, so you might see modest performance. We plan to integrate Microsoft phi-1.5 for better performance once the 370M is out.
 We are also working on LlamaIndex-TS integration on the client side to have in-browser RAG for local querying of private documents.
 As our roadmap is quite dense, with RAG, internet search, improved inference, we welcome warmly contributors! If you want to contribute, or have questions, ping us on Discord and GitHub!

 I read the new paper from DeepMind so you don't have to. Here are the key highlights:
  
Despite training on text, langauge models compressed images 43% better than PNG, and audio nearly 2x better than flac.
 Confirmation of scaling laws - bigger models compressed better. But model size must match dataset size.
 There are tradeoffs between model scale, data size, and compression performance. More data enables bigger models.
 Tokenization (like BPE) generally hurts compression slightly by making prediction harder.
 Longer contexts let models exploit more sequential dependencies.
  
Implications:
  
Models have learned very general capabilities beyond just text. Their strong compression reflects deep understanding of images, audio etc statistically.
 I got some new perspective on model scaling laws and links between prediction and generalization.
 There's potential for practical applications compressing images, video etc. But large model size an issue.
 Overall it shows these models are very capable general purpose learners, not just for language.

 At its core, Prompt Engineering is all about commanding the conversation with AI. Wanna write a poem, draft a project plan, or break down complex scientific terms? The right prompt can do that for you. If you want to learn more about Prompt Engineering feel free to join r/PromptWizards.
 Let's dive into some Prompt Engineering concepts:
 Let's start with the basics:
  
Reductive operations: These yield responses that are smaller in size than the input prompt. Essentially, they distill information. 
 Example: If the input prompt is a long article, and the task is to provide a summary, the operation used is reductive as the output (summary) is smaller than the input (the entire article).
 
 Transformational operations: These make sure the output maintains a relative balance w…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been playing around with transformers since following Karpathy's shakespeare model on youtube and found it really cool. Thought I should write a Tree-of-Thoughts model as my next project which will be somewhat similar, given what we're doing is learning the meaning behind words and phrases and then using that knowledge to generate a sequence based on a seed token or sequence of tokens.
 Here's how I was thinking it should go: I write a next token in sequence prediction model and write a generate function that generates a sequence of tokens on top of a seed token. Then I write a tree model that takes in whatever this bigram has learned and adds onto it some kind of knowledge about where one thought about the seed has been generated and stop there. Then iteratively generate a few more such thoughts based on the same seed.
 This is how I initially thought it would go but now when I'm writing, I've already written the bigram(next token prediction and generation), I don't know what to do next. I am kind of stuck.
 It will be interesting to see how you, if you've ever written a similar model or are good at NLP, would attempt this. Looking at a variety of different approaches to the same problem I am trying to solve would be great.
 So I decided to post here. Would be great to hear from you guys!

 GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke spoke on stage at TC Disrupt today and made several statements regarding the development of artificial intelligence and programming:
  
Dohmke believes that AI won't replace software developers but will make them more efficient.
 Despite AI advancements, the demand for software developers will continue to exceed the supply.
 The growth in software usage is expected to be exponential, with every company becoming a software company.
 Legacy code maintenance remains crucial, especially in industries like finance with outdated codebases.
 Generative AI is creating more demand for technical talent as companies seek to adopt innovative AI solutions.
 There is a shortage of computer science students, leading to increased demand for developers with AI skills.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone
 I have a doubt regarding GANs for tabular data, more specifically for time-series generation. Looking at the TimeGAN paper (code) and other implementations such as the one by YData, considering that the training dataset is divided into slices (like a rolling window) of N length and that the generated sequence will follow the same format, that is [batch size, N, n_features], what we are effectively generating are slices and not a fully synthetic time-series.
 ​
 To clarify my question, the output of a TimeGAN is only a set of slices, although there is no guarantee that generated slice(N-1) is the one before slice(N), and so the true use of a TimeGAN is generating slices that can be used to train a predictive TS model but not reconstructing a complete time series like the one used for training.
 ​
 I suspect that's the case (useful only to generate good slices for training predictive models) as there is no fully generated time series in the paper or any of the codes, while the quality of the generated data is partially measured by training a model on original data and generated data and comparing their predictive performance. If anyone can confirm/develop upon these thoughts I would be extremely grateful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[75% of Americans believe that AI will decrease the total number of jobs in the next 10 years, according to a survey by Bentley-Gallup Business in Society study.
 
Younger Americans are less pessimistic about AI compared to older age groups.
 
Majorities believe that AI performs as well as or better than humans in customizing online content, recommending products or services, and assisting students with coursework.
 
However, Americans are skeptical about AI's ability to recommend employees, its self-driving capabilities, and its ability to recommend medical advice.
 
79% of Americans have little trust in businesses to use AI responsibly.
 
40% of Americans think AI does more harm than good, while only 10% believe it contributes more good than harm.
 
Black and Asian Americans have a more positive view of AI's impact on society compared to Hispanic and White Americans.
 
While most Americans are wary of AI's impact on the job market, younger people are more optimistic about its future.
 
Businesses need to affirm their commitment to using AI responsibly and address the knowledge deficit and lack of confidence among Americans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to build intuition on why the actor update equation actually help the actor improving its policy. From what I understand, the update is proportional to the Critic's TD error. A better than expected reward will lead the actor to increase the prob of taking the associated action, and a disappointing reward will make the actor to move away from the given action.
 Here's where I feel like I'm missing a piece of the puzzle. Between a good state/action pair accurately valued by the Critic and a bad state/action pair undervalued by the Critic, the actor's update will favor the bad action more. Could we not conceive a scenario in which the agent gets stuck in a suboptimal policy because of that particular behavior?
 What triggers this questioning is that I have implemented a standard AC algo for Pixelcopter and found my agent getting stuck easily on a suboptimal policy (i.e. constantly getting higher, or lower until crash, while the critics assign good values on center squares and bad values to squares close to the wall's edge). For TD0, this is pretty marginal, but gets more significant for n-step TD as n increases.
 Any thoughts?

 No need to be a prompt engineering grand master - DALL-E 3 enables you to use the ChatGPT conversational interface to improve the images you generate. This means that if you didn't like what it produced, you can simply talk with ChatGPT and ask for the changes you'd like to make. This removes the complexity associated with prompt engineering, which requires you to iterate over the prompt.
 Majure improvement in the quality of products compared to DALL-E 2. This is a very vague statement provided by OpenAI, which is also hard to measure, but personally, they haven't failed me so far, so I'm really excited to see the results.

 From October, DALL-E 3 will be available through ChatGPT and API for those with the Plus or Enterprise version.
 And there are many more news! 🤗 I've gathered all the information in this blog 👉 https://dagshub.com/blog/dall-e-3/

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR How to build CI/CD pipelines with AWS SageMaker for ML training: https://dagshub.com/blog/ci-cd-for-continuous-training-with-sagemaker/
 One of the most time-resources-energy-consuming tasks we face when we build internal projects is setting up an instance for ML training.
 It's a repetitive process as we run multiple experiments over the project life cycle, with many steps and configurations that are usually documented poorly and scattered around different places.
 As good engineers, we decided to automate the process using CI/CD pipelines. 
 But how?
 We had ZERO ideas on how to do it, so we had to go through the rigorous process of using AWS guides and tutorials to figure it out.
 Usually, when this happens, we extend the project lifecycle and have a team member document the process so we can refer back to it when we need to do it again.
 Knowing this can benefit the community, we decided to share a series of blogs that guide you through building CI/CD pipelines for continuous training with AWS SageMaker.
 We published the first blog, which covers the configuration part a month ago, and we are happy to share the second one which explains how to build a continuous training pipeline for ML.

 How to build CI/CD pipeline with AWS SageMaker for ML training: https://dagshub.com/blog/ci-cd-for-continuous-training-with-sagemaker/
 I'm sure we can improve these tutorials, and would love to learn from your experience on how we can do it! 🤗

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi redditors!
 I've been tasked with an technical homework that asks me to "productionize" a Jupyter notebook. The notebook's workflow is as follows:
  
Reads data from a CSV.
 Pre-processes the data.
 Trains a machine learning model.
 Makes predictions.
  
My initial thoughts are:
  
Separation of Concerns: Break the notebook down into distinct components - data processing, model training, and inference.
 Containerization: Write a Dockerfile to ensure the environment is reproducible and isolated.
 API for Prediction: Set up a Flask-based service to expose the model's prediction capability.
  
However, I'm grappling with a few challenges:
  
I'm not seeing a stark difference between the Jupyter notebook setup and the production setting. Becuase the model is small and training is not complicated. If I were to deploy to Kubernetes pods, it seems wasteful that many pods are doing the same thing( prediction for the same model, maybe just as high availability guarantee?) .
 Does the training phrase or data cleansing phase need to be containerized and deployed? Because this seems like a one-off process.
 How to deploy a scalable service? I am new to this. Each container may have a HTTP service. How to load balance them on Kubernetes from outside?
 What kind of CI/CD do you recommend for this task? What kind of testing or pipeline are needed?

 I'll be looking and experimenting with basic networks, no language models, maybe a few GANs for fun, some DL networks for the atari gym and other experiments. All this for learning, with my own custom networks for various data.
 I'll be running linux - possibly Debian. I'd love to hear your comments or suggestions if there's something better at my price point in a laptop.

 Abstract:
  
Event cameras offer many advantages over standard cameras due to their distinctive principle of operation: low power, low latency, high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. Nonetheless, the success of many downstream visual applications also hinges on an efficient and effective scene representation, where Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is seen as the leading candidate. Such promise and potential of event cameras and NeRF inspired recent works to investigate on the reconstruction of NeRF from moving event cameras. However, these works are mainly limited in terms of the dependence on dense and low-noise event streams, as well as generalization to arbitrary contrast threshold values and camera speed profiles. In this work, we propose Robust e-NeRF, a novel method to directly and robustly reconstruct NeRFs from moving event cameras under various real-world conditions, especially from sparse and noisy events generated under non-uniform motion. It consists of two key components: a realistic event generation model that accounts for various intrinsic parameters (e.g. time-independent, asymmetric threshold and refractory period) and non-idealities (e.g. pixel-to-pixel threshold variation), as well as a complementary pair of normalized reconstruction losses that can effectively generalize to arbitrary speed profiles and intrinsic parameter values without such prior knowledge. Experiments on real and novel realistically simulated sequences verify our effectiveness. Our code, synthetic dataset and improved event simulator are public.

 I am trying to tune a second order Transfer Function to fit X to Y( has 3 parameters) and gives Y’ as output.
 So I currently consider the error between Y and Y’ as the “State” and try to minimise the error by modelling a reward function that checks for instability and unreasonable values. I am trying to do this using TD3 but the model does not learn. I am wondering if there are any approaches that I should consider.
 I chose TD3 since my action space is continuous. 
 I am sorry if I don’t understand something basic since I’m a noob to this. Thanks for your help in advance. :) 
 Some more details: the dataset values don’t change. I give the same values for every time step. So I am not understanding how episodes and time steps work in this context.

 I hope this webinar finds you well. I suppose that this topic can be interesting for business and AI engineers.
 Speakers: OpenCV CEO Dr. Satya Mallick and Phil Nelson are joined by Anna Kogan CEO at OpenCV.ai
 Topics of webinar are:
  
How to search for vendors that understand your business needs (not all AI is the same.)
 What questions to ask when picking a vendor (not everybody really is an AI expert they claim)
 Three signs to watch for during the project (progress indicators and red-flags)
 How best to scope technical tasks (off-the-shelf vs. custom algorithm development)
 How to set up for long-term success (deployment, documentation, training pipeline)
  
Date: Thursday, September 21st, 2023 at 9am Pacific time.

 Example Colab notebook is included in the Github repo.
 This work introduces the following features of NLEP:
  
NLEP is a full python program that prints the target response of LLMs.
 
Task-general NLEP prompting outperforms task-specific chain-of-thought prompting on math, symbolic, and natural language.
 
Enable the chain-of-thought reasoning ability of small models (RoBERTa) on text classification

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am reading the following article on SpinningUp but can't get my head around policy collapse - 
 "This is different from normal policy gradient, which keeps new and old policies close in parameter space. But even seemingly small differences in parameter space can have very large differences in performance—so a single bad step can collapse the policy performance. This makes it dangerous to use large step sizes with vanilla policy gradients, thus hurting its sample efficiency. TRPO nicely avoids this kind of collapse, and tends to quickly and monotonically improve performance." 
 Why would updating the parameters lead to a policy collapse? The parameters are updated based on the performance of the RL system and therefore, I don't see the point of constraints.

 In another installment in our "Zoomposium Series" on the topic of "Brain Research", my colleague Axel Stöcker of the "Blog der großen Fragen" and I had the great honor and pleasure of conducting an interview with the very well-known and renowned German medical doctor and neuroscientist Professor Dr. Petra Ritter.
 In this context, Ms. Ritter became a co-founder and leader of the co-design project "The #Virtual #Brain", which is a component of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) and is "a neuroinformatics platform for simulating whole brain networks using biologically realistic connectivity".
 She is leading the development of a virtual research environment as a collaborative research platform for sensitive health data and head of the "German National Neuroscience Research Infrastructure Initiative (NFDI-Neuroscince)" and involved in the development of the "Health Data Cloud #EBRAINS".

He is confident that governments can effectively regulate AI using frameworks that have been successful in the past, citing the regulation of aviation and the internet as examples.
 
Suleyman emphasizes the importance of setting boundaries and limits for AI to ensure human oversight and enforceable laws.
 
He calls for a combination of broad, international regulation and smaller, more granular policies at the micro level.
 
Suleyman suggests limiting AI's ability to improve itself as a critical first step in ensuring human oversight.
 
He also highlights the need for governments to have direct access to AI developers to enforce boundaries and establish clear regulations.
 
Governments worldwide, including the European Union and China, are already working on AI regulations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using ppo action masking in sb3, which works well in training and masking the illegal / invalid actions according to my criteria. However, I have 2 problems during testing.
 ​
  
I use the same code for masking the actions in testing too since the model was unable to learn by itself during training action masking criteria and when enforcing it in code, it still doesn't mask anything.
  
​
  
The model converges to just one action in testing phase after 500k steps, the episode reward still increasing the training phase though. I don't know why? maybe overfitting!
  
Code for training with action masking:
 def mask_fn(env: gym.Env) -> np.ndarray:
 return env.valid_action_mask()
 env = StockEnv(train)
 # Wrap the environment with ActionMasker and the mask_fn function
 env = ActionMasker(env, mask_fn)
 model = MaskablePPO(MaskableActorCriticPolicy, env, tensorboard_log="./tensorboard" ,n_steps=2048 )
 for i in range (1,52):
 model.learn(total_timesteps=TIMESTEPS , tb_log_name = 'PPO2' , reset_num_timesteps=False)
 Code for testing with action masking:
 def mask_fn(env: gym.Env) -> np.ndarray:
 return env.valid_action_mask()
 env = ActionMasker(env, mask_fn)
 model_path = f"{models_dir}/700000.zip"
 model = MaskablePPO.load(model_path, env=env)
 episodes = 1
 for ep in range(episodes):
 obs = env.reset()
 done = False
 while not done:
 action, _states = model.predict(obs)
 obs, rewards, done, info = env.step(action)
 env.render()

 so now my basic setting is,i use the action mask to invalid some forbidden action. When a node is routing to the edge of the map,i give +10 reward,if it's not obey the clockwise rule,i give -200 reward, if the whole node is routed success,i give +200 reward,and each steps does'n make any node routed, i give -1 reward.
 I am new to this area,i don't know the way i set reward if is good,may i have some advide?

 Bard Extensions and Google Applications Integration
  
Bard can now tap into individualized data from Google apps such as Gmail, Drive, and Docs, with user permission.
 Google reassured users that personal data accessed by Bard will not be used for reinforcement learning, providing another on their transparency, choice, and control tenets.
 Prompts can direct Bard to search for specific information within Gmail, but it does not store the entire inbox content.
  
Collaborative Characteristics and Fact-Checking Capabilities
  
Users can employ Bard to summarize emails or gather trip details from email threads, and then research real-time travel information, surface YouTube recommendations for the destination, and provide Maps directions to the airport.
 Google's chatbot can also double-check its responses against Google search, improving user trust and enhancing Bard's model through user feedback on incorrect answers.
 The new extensions using non-personal data – YouTube, Flights, Hotels, and Maps – are automatically opted-in but users can choose to opt-out.
  
Collaboration and Language Availability
  
Bard now lets users share an ongoing chat with others through a public link.
 Google plans to expand Bard's feature set to over 40 new languages beyond its existing English language capabilities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all.
 I have been tinkering with a project to get quicker learning for CNNs. 
 The idea came after reading the SDProp paper. Algorithms using adaptive learning rate can be interpeted as muliplying the gradient(with or without momentum) with the inverse square-root of the covariance matrix. Using a diagonal estimate of the covariance matrix.
 Which begs the question: what happens if we use a fuller estimate? I chose to include covariances between the elements of convolutional filters. I.e. a conv.weight of size [n_out,n_in,5,5] needs a tensor of size [n_out,n_int,25,25] to store its contribution to the covariance matrix.
 for 3x3 filters and 5x5 filters, torch.linalg.eigh could be used to calculate the square root of the covariance matrices. For 7x7, I used newtons method to approximate the square root.
 In the figure below are some results for a 6 layer CNN on CIFAR 100. Huge gains iteration for iteration. But is it quicker? Not a lot. A bit for the smaller 3x3 filter. More optimizations could still be made. And it will obviously depend on network architecture and computer hardware. 
 I'm sure there could be some use-cases. The computation of the square-root calculations is invariant to batch_size and image_size (unless number of filters also is increased).
 If anyone is interested I can also link to my torch implementation of the optimizer, once I get it up on github.
 Not sure if this, or something like it, has been done before? Would love to have some papers linked if so...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I am currently working on a project where my team and I have collected a rich dataset of biomedical sensor data from clinical trials earlier this year. Our aim is to use this sensor data to predict changes in specific biomarkers over time. The data's tensor shape is B,T,F,C, where:
  
B = batch size
 T = sequence length
 F = sampled frequencies
 C = features at each frequency
  
Currently, my approach involves flattening this tensor to B,T,−1 and then feeding it to a transformer model. While this has yielded reasonable results, I'm contemplating whether there are more effective ways to prepare the data for the transformer model.
 Here are my specific concerns:
  
Flattening the tensor might dilute the information specific to each frequency across various features.
 I could potentially miss the chance to capture frequency-related variations within the features.
  
To address these, I've considered a few options:
  
Self-attention over individual features or frequencies: Although this could be effective, it might make the model too large given my medium-sized dataset.
 Using convolutional layers: Preliminary experiments with this approach have not led to any significant improvements.
  
I'm particularly interested in any thoughts on how to make my transformer more receptive to the multi-dimensional nature of my dataset. Increasing the number of attention heads to better accommodate all features is also on the table.
 Does anyone have any insights or can point me to relevant papers or codebases for handling such multi-dimensional data with transformers?
 Thank you for your help!

Self-supervised pre-training of language models usually consists in predicting probability distributions over extensive token vocabularies. In this study, we propose an innovative method that shifts away from probability prediction and instead focuses on reconstructing input embeddings in a contrastive fashion via Constrastive Weight Tying (CWT). We apply this approach to pretrain Headless Language Models in both monolingual and multilingual contexts. Our method offers practical advantages, substantially reducing training computational requirements by up to 20 times, while simultaneously enhancing downstream performance and data efficiency. We observe a significant +1.6 GLUE score increase and a notable +2.7 LAMBADA accuracy improvement compared to classical LMs within similar compute budgets.

The company suggests reevaluating the way datacenters are built to optimize them for AI.
 
The challenges include the need for liquid-cooled servers, higher voltage power distribution, and efficient heat rejection.
 
Schneider provides guidance on changes to power, cooling, rack configuration, and software management to mitigate the demands of AI adoption.
 
Liquid cooling is recommended for high-density racks, with direct liquid cooling favored over immersion cooling systems.

 Let me preface this by saying that I am not well-versed in the ML/AI literature. Please excuse my ignorance.
 I am trying to create a system to detect whether some given data is spam or not. Is there a good, out-of-the-box solution for this? I imagine there would be. I am currently using heuristics but I'm wondering if there is a better, ML-y solution.
 My ideal solution would have the following attributes:
  
Simple
 Open-source
 Very cheap to test whether something is spam (less than $0.00001 per test)
 Very fast to test (less than 50ms per test)
 Quick to "figure out" what is spam and what is not (less than 100,000 labeled data)
 Does not require a lot of set-up or up-keep (less than 5 days set up; less than 1 hr up-keep per month)
  
It doesn't have to be perfect. I'm just looking to set up something quickly for now and gauge it vs heuristics.
 Thank you.
 ---
 Edit: To clarify, I'm looking for something I can ideally build myself with open source software. And not specifically email.
 Just looking for the right direction. Names of OSS, techniques, etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I read the Arxiv paper on CulturaX so you don't have to. Here's my highlights:
  
New open dataset called CulturaX contains text data for 167 languages - far more than previous datasets.
 With over 6 trillion words, it's the largest multilingual dataset ever released.
 Freely available for anyone to use for research and AI development.
 Created by combining and extensively cleaning two other large datasets - mC4 and OSCAR.
 Could allow developing AI systems that work much better across many more languages.
 Helps democratize access to data to build fairer, less biased AI models.
 Allows training of new multilingual AI applications, like universal translators and assistants.
 But still requires thoughtfulness to avoid issues like bias amplification.
  
Overall, CulturaX is going to be part of a broader global trend (I think) to advance multilingual AI and spread its benefits more equally. So far they've been concentrated in English-speaking applications.
 Full summary here if you'd like to read more. Original paper is here.

 i intend to use large data samples,
 due to board limitations (ASRock Taichi X399 TR4, CPU: AMD Threadripper 1950x),
 i can either buy:
 2 x nVidia Tesla T4 (16G GDDR6 / 2560 CUDA / 0.585 GHz / ~800$)

 -- or --
 1 x nVidia RTX 4080 (16G GDDR6X / 9728 CUDA / 2.51 GHz / ~1450$)
 i know that i will need to air vent the Tesla models, the question is what is faster for training time (i have read all the Tflops / OPS / int / 16float / 32float / 64float ... i got to admit it is all very confusing)
 what would you do and for what reason ?

 The software we are developing needs to be tested on a system as closed as possible to the one where it is going to be executed. Sometimes it is very difficult to satisfy this requirement with docker and we have to use virtual machines missing the docker workflow. This is why I started the development of vedv. I hope you find it useful. Thank you.

Had decided on a custom Thelio Massive from System 76, but it seems like they currently don't have it in stock anymore. Looking for an already built-alternative that might serve our purposes (can't build it ourselves due to dept regulations)! and was hoping maybe someone has any suggestions (has to be intel).
 CPU #1: 2nd Gen Intel Xeon Gold 6230R CPU#1 Memory: 256GB Quad Channel DDR4 at 2933Mhz (4X64GB) CPU#2: 2nd Gen Intel Xeon Gold 6230R CPU#2 Memory: None OS Drive: 8TB PCIe Gen 4 3300MB R 2900MB W Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Power Supply: 1650W
 Any help would be appreciated!

(It really should be able to give me adult results/replies based on my sign up age on my profile or provide ID to the company…) would it be beneficial to me to give it more in-depth information about myself such as how I talk, interests? I just really enjoy how it responds sometimes as opposed to Bard or GPT.

 I was wondering if I could get some guidance. I currently own an RTX 2060, but I cannot do some of the fun stuff such as fine tuning LLMs. I’m pursuing my masters focusing on Speech Recognition and I also work as an AI developer. Also, I play games every now and then.
 I’m getting offered a 3090 for around 700 usd. However, I have to rebuild my entire PC which will end up costing 2-2.5K. I’m from Costa Rica so my KWh is around 0.23 usd. For me seems like a big investment, im not sure if im getting the desired returns.
 I was thinking about using cloud instances for my experiments. However, lambda labs is not yet available in my country. I’m not sure if there are any other options worthwhile considering. 
 Thanks :)

 I'm currently working on a project where I need to track and count specific features of objects using multiple monocular views with available intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. As an example, I'm interested in detecting and counting different graffiti instances in images of a kiosk.
 ​
 I've already tried various tracking algorithms, but they have struggled with the task due to the significant changes in perspective across the views. It has become apparent that simply relying on tracking without considering the camera positions is insufficient for accurate results. Therefore, I'm now exploring methods that take into account information about the camera positions and potentially use this data to improve feature tracking and counting. 
 ​
 If you have any knowledge of such methods, oresearch directions or if you're aware of resources, papers, or code implementations that tackle similar problems, I would greatly appreciate your insights and recommendations. Additionally, if you have any tips or best practices for handling such tasks in the context of machine learning, I'd love to hear them. 
 ​
 Thank you in advance for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI is poised to transform our world like never before. Scientific discoveries, technological improvements, and medical advancements will be how much of this change will take place.
 Since health is so important to our well-being, AI finding cures for illnesses like obesity, cancer, diabetes and heart disease will be a godsend to all. But curing diseases is not how medical AIs can help us the most. 
 It has been estimated that well over 50% of the illnesses we humans fall prey to result from our ethical choices. We eat too much, drink too much, eat too many animal foods, don't exercise enough and don't keep ourselves as emotionally healthy as we could.
 Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could respect our lives and our health enough to make the kinds of choices that keep us much healthier? That is how AI will probably be more helpful to us than in any other way. 
 We humans have not been able to figure out how to become better, more ethical, people because we are simply not intelligent enough to make that all-important change. Now consider an AI that is two or three times more intelligent than the most intelligent person who has ever lived. This could easily happen before 2030. Imagine that intelligence dedicated to the task of helping us all become better people. 
 These AIs would motivate us to make better health choices, have healthier relationships, and have healthier thoughts and feelings. Beyond the amazing technological changes that are just around the corner, that is probably how AIs will help us the most.
 This is why alignment is so important. It's not enough to align AIs to always be truthful and serve humanity's interests. We must train them to help us become better people. It wouldn't surprise me if by 2030 the whole of humanity experiences a profound ethical reformation that leads us all to enjoy much happier and healthier lives.

 Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14711
 GitHub: https://github.com/pbelcak/fastfeedforward
 PyPI: pip install fastfeedforward
 Abstract:
  
We break the linear link between the layer size and its inference cost by introducing the fast feedforward (FFF) architecture, a log-time alternative to feedforward networks. We demonstrate that FFFs are up to 220x faster than feedforward networks, up to 6x faster than mixture-of-experts networks, and exhibit better training properties than mixtures of experts thanks to noiseless conditional execution. Pushing FFFs to the limit, we show that they can use as little as 1% of layer neurons for inference in vision transformers while preserving 94.2% of predictive performance.
  
Fast feedforward networks can be used anywhere where feedforward and mixture-of-experts networks are used, delivering a significant speedup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google and the Department of Defense have developed an AI-powered microscope called the Augmented Reality Microscope (ARM) to assist doctors in identifying cancer.
 
The ARM uses artificial intelligence to analyze tissue samples and provide pathologists with information about the location and severity of cancer.
 
There are currently 13 ARMs in existence, and initial research shows promising results.
 
The ARM is designed to support pathologists in smaller labs who may not have easy access to a second opinion.
 
It is not meant to replace digital pathology systems but can help health organizations bypass the need for them.
 
The ARM is expected to cost health systems between $90,000 to $100,000.

 Hugging Face datasets: https://huggingface.co/datasets/uonlp/CulturaX
 Abstract:
  
The driving factors behind the development of large language models (LLMs) with impressive learning capabilities are their colossal model sizes and extensive training datasets. Along with the progress in natural language processing, LLMs have been frequently made accessible to the public to foster deeper investigation and applications. However, when it comes to training datasets for these LLMs, especially the recent state-of-the-art models, they are often not fully disclosed. Creating training data for high-performing LLMs involves extensive cleaning and deduplication to ensure the necessary level of quality. The lack of transparency for training data has thus hampered research on attributing and addressing hallucination and bias issues in LLMs, hindering replication efforts and further advancements in the community. These challenges become even more pronounced in multilingual learning scenarios, where the available multilingual text datasets are often inadequately collected and cleaned. Consequently, there is a lack of open-source and readily usable dataset to effectively train LLMs in multiple languages. To overcome this issue, we present CulturaX, a substantial multilingual dataset with 6.3 trillion tokens in 167 languages, tailored for LLM development. Our dataset undergoes meticulous cleaning and deduplication through a rigorous pipeline of multiple stages to accomplish the best quality for model training, including language identification, URL-based filtering, metric-based cleaning, document refinement, and data deduplication. CulturaX is fully released to the public in HuggingFace to facilitate research and advancements in multilingual LLMs: this https URL.

It starts off slowly learning and almost getting through the first level but then after a while of training it forgets everything and only runs right into the first enemy.
 It doesn't seem to learn again after this.
 I tried retaining and it did the same thing
 Any help on why this is happening or how to fix it would be appreciated.

 I assume it is because for both vision and language data (the most popular modality), MAE is the more appliable, if not better, method than the supervised contrastive learning approach. But I am working on data that is:
  
difficult to design a sensible augmentation method for self-supervised training.
 Limited in size to support an autoencoder model.
 The target is continuous, and, to my knowledge, hard to transfer into class label.
  
Can anyone suggest some related paper?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow researchers! I'm in the exciting yet challenging phase of choosing a PhD topic in the realm of meta-learning optimization, and I could use some advice and insights.
 I've extensively researched existing meta-learning optimization algorithms like MAML and its various adaptations. I need advice and guidance on the following topics:
  
First I want to implement and compare 8-10 state-of-the-art meta-learning methods on benchmark datasets. This would involve in-depth simulation and performance evaluations to provide a comprehensive understanding of their strengths and weaknesses. Could you please guide me here if there are review papers which implement and compare different algorithms. 
 
Then I want to delve into developing a novel optimization algorithm that considers the curvature of loss functions. The idea here is to enhance the performance of existing meta-learning techniques by leveraging insights from the loss landscape.
 
Further, I'm considering exploring new loss functions or new improvements to loss functions tailored to the context of meta-learning. These could potentially lead to improvements in the learning process and generalization capabilities of meta-learning models.
 
 I'm reaching out to the community to gather opinions, suggestions, or any insights you might have. If you've worked in meta-learning or optimization, your experiences and advice would be invaluable in helping me choose the right direction for my PhD research. Thank you in advance for your guidance!

 Hello!
 I thought people on this subreddit might be interested in how I went about inferring Zonai device draw chances for each dispenser in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
 In this Switch game there are devices that can be glued together to create different machines. For instance, you can make a snowmobile from a fan, sled, and steering stick.
 There are dispensers that dispense 3-6 of about 30 or so possible devices when you feed it a construct horn (dropped by defeated robot enemies) or a regular (also dropped from defeated enemies) or large Zonai charge (Found in certain chests, dropped by certain boss enemies, obtained from completing certain challenges, etc…]]></summary>

 Blog: https://xizaoqu.github.io/unihsi/ Code coming soon!
 Abstract:
  
Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) is a vital component of fields like embodied AI and virtual reality. Despite advancements in motion quality and physical plausibility, two pivotal factors, versatile interaction control and the development of a user-friendly interface, require further exploration before the practical application of HSI. This paper presents a unified HSI framework, UniHSI, which supports unified control of diverse interactions through language commands. This framework is built upon the definition of interaction as Chain of Contacts (CoC): steps of human joint-object part pairs, which is inspired by the strong correlation between interaction types and human-object contact regions. Based on the definition, UniHSI constitutes a Large Language Model (LLM) Planner to translate language prompts into task plans in the form of CoC, and a Unified Controller that turns CoC into uniform task execution. To facilitate training and evaluation, we collect a new dataset named ScenePlan that encompasses thousands of task plans generated by LLMs based on diverse scenarios. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in versatile task execution and generalizability to real scanned scenes.

I can't rely on ChatGPT because it's known for not being very reliable when it comes logical things like mathematics or physics.

 As it is for real-time usage Indeed lag to be lowest as possible. According to my current test, I can fit maximum 6 users on T400.
 Is it possible to achieve that using HuggingFace? Thank you to anyone who could help me

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Years ago, we showed the world it was possible to automatically detect label errors in classification datasets via machine learning. Since that moment, folks have asked whether the same is possible for regression datasets?
 Figuring out this question required extensive research since properly accounting for uncertainty (critical to decide when to trust machine learning predictions over the data itself) poses unique challenges in the regression setting.
 Today I have published a new paper introducing an effective method for “Detecting Errors in Numerical Data via any Regression Model”. Our method can find likely incorrect values in any numerical column of a dataset by utilizing a regression model trained to predict this column based on the other data features.
 We’ve added our new algorithm to our open-source cleanlab library for you to algorithmically audit your own datasets for errors. Use this code for applications like detecting: data entry errors, sensor noise, incorrect invoices/prices in your company’s / client’s records, mis-estimated counts (eg. of cells in biological experiments).
 Find errors in regression data in just a few lines of code.
 Extensive benchmarks reveal cleanlab’s algorithm detects erroneous values in real numeric datasets better than alternative methods like RANSAC and conformal inference.
 If you'd like to learn more, you can check out the blogpost, research paper, code, and tutorial to run this on your data.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent work shows transformers are capable of performing multi-step gradient descent of mesa objectives inside of their transformer layers. This is even possible for linear transformers, which effectively perform linear optimization on deep representations of features calculated by earlier layers.
 https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.05858.pdf
 For those unfamiliar, instrumental convergence is the idea that entities with different goals will tend towards different subgoals. Examples could include gathering power, not dying, acquiring resources, etc. A famous thought experiment, known as the paperclip maximizer, is the idea of an AI that is optimized for paperclip production taking over the world so it can build as many paperclips as possible.
 However, if models are dynamically pursuing different objectives at runtime via generated mesa-optimizers, even if instrumental convergence is real, would we still expect it to happen? Without a constant objective given subgoals might start to conflict with each other. On the other hand, since instrumental convergence implies that different goals benefit from similar sub-objectives, perhaps the varying mesa objective doesn't really matter.

 there is a small, albeit growing community of economists that apply deep reinforcement learning in their research. Now there is a GitHub repo to collect relevant literature at one place: https://github.com/SimonHashtag/EconRL
 The list is far from complete, so you are invited to contribute! 
 The goal is to create something that makes it easy for novices to get a first overview of the literature. All others may find it easier to get news about up-to-date papers.

 The key issue The number of matrix elements of the unitaries scales as 2^(2N), where N is the problem size. With N<5 I can easily flatten the matrix and put it into a simple FNN, which works quite well. Once hitting N=5 (the point where things actually get interesting), however, we already have 1024 matrix elements and the method struggles a lot. Still converging to something but very suboptimal. Sure, increasing N hardens the problem in general, but the performance degradation is so abrupt that I suspect some model issues, maybe caused by the curse of dimensionality or something similar.

 Trump says that he asked his mob to peacefully walk to the Capitol building gates. How would this have stopped the certification? Did he expect them to storm in? His waiting three hours to stop the violence that followed suggests that he did.
 Bard:
 Trump's request to walk peacefully to the Capitol building gates would not have stopped the certification of the election results. The certification process is a joint session of Congress, and it would have required a majority vote in both the House and the Senate to overturn the results. Even if Trump's supporters had peacefully marched to the Capitol, they would not have been able to prevent Congress from certifying the results.
 It is possible that Trump did not fully understand the certification process, or that he was simply trying to appease his supporters. However, it is also possible that he expected his supporters to storm the Capitol and prevent Congress from certifying the results. This is supported by the fact that he waited over three hours to call off the violence. During that time, he continued to tweet messages of encouragement to his supporters, and he even praised them for their patriotism.
 It is also worth noting that Trump had been repeatedly warned by his advisors about the possibility of violence on January 6. However, he ignored these warnings and continued to urge his supporters to fight to overturn the election results.
 In conclusion, it is impossible to say for sure whether Trump expected his supporters to storm the Capitol on January 6. However, the evidence suggests that he was at least aware of the possibility of violence, and that he was willing to allow it to happen in order to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

 To stay on top of the latest advancements in AI, look here first.

 Challenges with existing systems
  
High throughput serving of LLMs requires numerous requests, and current systems struggle with the bulky sequence memory.
 Inefficient memory management results in system hindrances such as fragmentation and redundant duplication.
  
The revolutionary answer: vLLM & PagedAttention
  
Researchers have introduced vLLM and PagedAttention, a newly designed attention algorithm, to resolve these issues.
 vLLM allows for minimal memory waste and efficiently manages attention keys and values. It provides up to 24 times more throughput than former systems.
  
The Mechanics of PagedAttention
  
PagedAttention offers a novel approach to memory management by permitting continuous storage in non-contiguous memory spaces.
 It enhances memory efficiency resulting in better GPU utilization, with practically only 4% inefficiency.
  
Improved memory sharing and system performance
  
PagedAttention significantly improves memory sharing, resulting in a 2.2 times speed gain while lowering memory usage by 55%.
 With vLLM, the throughput of known LLMs can be increased by 2-4 times without impacting accuracy or causing delay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI, including ChatGPT, has narrow expertise and lacks the broad spectrum of human intelligence.
 
The training of AI models can be costly due to hardware, data collection, and energy consumption.
 
The trustworthiness of training data is crucial for reliable AI models, but issues like bias, labeling errors, and data privacy can affect performance.
 
AI systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, such as manipulating input data to deceive the models.
 
AI lacks genuine understanding, emotional/social intelligence, common sense/critical thinking, and true creativity.

 I'am trying to get the 3D keypoints coordinates from an image or video and then map it to SMPL model. It's pretty easy to get the keypoints from an image or video using the mediapipe library. But the mapping of it with the SMPL model is something that I can't figure out. mainly because the skeleton structure is different. Some already had a similar issue but the answers were not clear and he didn't even ask futher. Is it possible to do this?? if it's not possible with mediapipe is there some other library that I could use?? I heard about openPose too but when I tried it didn't work someone was saying it works only on windows 11. There are some other parts also to this project which will mostly be dealt with Pytorch. There are some pose estimators in TensorFlow but I want to stick to pytorch hence would like some pose estimators in that framwork, or a library or somehing inside opencv

 ​
 I just read the paper named " SELF-ATTENTION DOES NOT NEED O(n 2 ) MEMORY" from Google.
 I understood that it requires O(1) for a single query, but still cannot understand why it requires O(log N) for self-attention and different order input.
 ​
 It seems like adding one index into a sequence requires O(log N) (The paper's saying this).
 But why does it take O(log N)? Isn't it just O(1)? Because it is just adding a single datapoint for the index.
 ​
 I really hope someone understands why it is and leaves any comment on this. 
 Here's the paper.
 https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05682

 Thanks in advance.

Google's change in stance is not surprising, considering their heavy investment in AI, including chatbot Bard and new search features like the Search Generative Experience.
 
The majority of brands now openly share articles and guides on how to use AI tools to enhance marketing strategies and create actionable content plans quickly.
 
However, the quality and value of AI-generated content remain important factors for success, as poorly generated content can harm a brand's reputation and ranking.

 Abstract:
  
For a long time, humanity has pursued artificial intelligence (AI) equivalent to or surpassing the human level, with AI agents considered a promising vehicle for this pursuit. AI agents are artificial entities that sense their environment, make decisions, and take actions. Many efforts have been made to develop intelligent AI agents since the mid-20th century. However, these efforts have mainly focused on advancement in algorithms or training strategies to enhance specific capabilities or performance on particular tasks. Actually, what the community lacks is a sufficiently general and powerful model to serve as a starting point for designing AI agents that can adapt to diverse …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I am training a small model (120k params) on a custom grid-world environment I built with JAX.
 I was able to train the model very well with PPO on 1 GPU, but when I scaled to multiple GPUs (tried with 6 in parallel), the training curves showed a lot more variance than what I was seeing on 1 GPU.
 I did not change the hyperparams, I just spawned the same number of environments (~7000 per GPU) on multiple devices. 
 The multi-GPU setup works in the following way:
 - I keep parallel independent buffers, one on each device
 - I initialize identical models on each device
 - I get independent gradients on each device at the update step, then I take the mean of the gradients across the devices and then I backpropagate the same gradients on each device independently. (I checked that after some time the models are still identical, and that is the case). 
 Now the question is, what could be the reason for such an increase in variance? What can I try to mitigate the problem?
 Here's a comparison of the entropy curves... 
 P.S. The model still trains quite well, but I guess that if I manage to make the curves smoother it is going to train much faster and to a better performance.

While we've made a lot of cool tech, we still need a killer starting point for AI that can handle all sorts of tasks. Large Language Models" (LLMs) are like a big leap toward AI that's smart across the board. People have been using LLMs to make AI that can do loads of things. 
 The article takes us on a trip from where AI ideas started, to why LLMs rock as the backbone for AI. 
 https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07864
 They break down this LLM-AI into three parts: 
  
the thinky bit (brain), 
 what they sense (perception), 
 and what they do (action). 
  
They chat about how these AI can work solo, in teams, or buddy up with humans.

Typically DQN is trained with a deterministic function approximator. How would the algorithm become stochastic during inference time? In DQN the final layer activation is linear and therefore I don't see how one could even make this algorithm stochastic, unlike policy gradient where the final layer is softmax or Normal.

 I have been working on scalable GNN training for a while and noticed that the bottleneck of training GNNs is the graph sampling and feature fetching stages. GNN training frameworks PyG and DGL that most people use seem to default to using Neighbor Sampling for minibatch training. I am hoping that with my new paper Layer-Neighbor Sampling -- Defusing Neighborhood Explosion in GNNs, this default might be due to change.
 My new approach combines the layer sampling approach with the neighbor sampling approach. The result is that there is more overlap in the sampled neighborhoods and one still gets a fixed number of neighbors per seed vertex. It is even possible to turn it into a subgraph sampling approach by fixing the random seed used for sampling across all layers of the GNN m…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is no one definitive answer to this question, as the percentage of our thoughts that come to us on their own without our consciously choosing them can vary depending on the individual and the situation. However, some estimates suggest that up to 95% of our thoughts may be involuntary.
 This is because our thoughts are constantly being influenced by a variety of factors, both external and internal. For example, our environment, our emotions, and our physical state can all play a role in determining what thoughts pop into our heads.
 In addition, our brains are constantly processing information and making predictions, even when we are not actively thinking about anything. This process can sometimes lead to spontaneous thoughts, such as when we suddenly remember something that we had forgotten or when we come up with a new idea.
 While some of our spontaneous thoughts may be negative or intrusive, many of them can also be helpful or creative. For example, a spontaneous thought may help us to solve a problem, come up with a new solution, or simply make us smile.
 Overall, it is clear that a significant portion of our thoughts come to us without our consciously choosing them. This is a natural part of the human cognitive process and can be both beneficial and detrimental.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today we live in a world of multi-model LLMs. How will the following technologies fare against these LLM-based models? 
  
Neural VQA
 
Semantic Scene Segmentation
 
 Multi-model LLM are emerging quickly now, (such as NExT-GPT https://next-gpt.github.io/ ) . When you consider the kind of "understanding" of a visual scene these models are capable of, what will happen to prior approaches like Neural VQA? The nagging feeling that Neural VQA is going to be completely superseded by LLMs is palpable. The only vestige left for the older technology may have something to do with reasoning about the objects , such as properly counting the number of objects of a category that are present. But even that is getting sketchy. 
 On the topic of scene understanding, we can turn to semantic scene segmentation. SSS is a more complicated topic than Neural VQA. SOTA SSS algorithms are still largely employing DeConv Nets, and still require fully labelled datasets. With multi-model LLMs, there is a nagging question : Why go through the complexity/mess of first segmenting a scene very accurately, when an LLM can do better at identifying the entire scene's category in one fail swoop? 
 One might suggest that SSS still has a use in regards to interacting with the segmented objects of an environment, where one such "interaction" would be avoiding collisions with pedestrians, trees, or other cars. But honestly, SSS does not really make this connection with planning and action, it really only gives you the categories of the segments. THe autonomous vehicle's next moves are still an open problem. 
 What technologies do you expect that multi-model LLMs will supersede, if any?

The authors claim that when RNN is trained on multiple tasks from a task distribution using a model free RL algorithm, another model based RL algorithm emerges within the activation dynamics of RNN. The RNN with resulting activations acts as a standalone model based RL system on a new task(from the same task distribution) even after freezing the weights of outer loop model free algorithm of that. I couldn't understand how an RNN with only fixed activations act as RL? Can someone help?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey. First of all I'm not a researcher on this area, so pardon my ignorance.
 I'm looking to employ a GAN on a dataset. The goals are still a bit unclear, but it's mainly to improve classification by either data augmentation and class balancing, or understanding the data through the latent representations.
 I'm really keen on InfoGAN at the moment. I trained one on the MNIST and the continuous variables learned the rotation and width, as in the paper and other peoples code.
 But at this point I think I need some help. I have labels, which means that maybe I should use a conditional GAN. But how will I learn similar representations as those in InfoGAN? I know StyleGAN is the current big thing in this area, but my images are limited to similar pixel-range as MNIST, and StyleGAN seems dependant on the ProGAN idea of increasing resolution for training.
 I'm a bit confused on the whole topic and would love a pointer to any discussion etc., as I can't seem to find anything but papers and they seem to be only focused on human faces, my data is unnatural not unsimilar again to MNIST. I don't have semantical information either as I see many papers employing that.
 I see many papers employing semi-supervision in this area, but honestly I'm just a bit lost and overwhelmed as this is not my area and GAN papers are still not stopping (I read a post here from 2017 about a GAN making GANs...).
 If you read this far: thank you and any pointers and discussion are very welcome. I would post on /r/learnmachinelearning but I feel the discussion in there is very different from this. My main goal is data exploration, but also to prove effectiveness some classification will be necessary and here the generative approach may help to augment data efficiently.

academic and applied machine learning. On the other hand, these steps are
becoming ever increasingly delicate due to the extensive rise in the number,
diversity, and distributedness of machine learning resources. Multi-agent
systems, when applied to the design of machine learning platforms, bring about
several distinctive characteristics such as scalability, flexibility, and
robustness, just to name a few. This paper proposes a fully automatic and
collaborative agent-based mechanism for selecting distributedly organized
machine learning algorithms and simultaneously tuning their hyperparameters.
Our method builds upon an existing agent-based hierarchical machine-learning
platform and augments its query structure to support the aforementioned
functionalities without being limited to specific learning, selection, and
tuning mechanisms. We have conducted theoretical assessments, formal
verification, and analytical study to demonstrate the correctness, resource
utilization, and computational efficiency of our technique. According to the
results, our solution is totally correct and exhibits linear time and space
complexity in relation to the size of available resources. To provide concrete
examples of how the proposed methodologies can effectively adapt and perform
across a range of algorithmic options and datasets, we have also conducted a
series of experiments using a system comprised of 24 algorithms and 9 datasets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Traffic prediction is a crucial topic because of its broad scope of
applications in the transportation domain. Recently, various studies have
achieved promising results. However, most studies assume the prediction
locations have complete or at least partial historical records and cannot be
extended to non-historical recorded locations. In real-life scenarios, the
deployment of sensors could be limited due to budget limitations and
installation availability, which makes most current models not applicable.
Though few pieces of literature tried to impute traffic states at the missing
locations, these methods need the data simultaneously observed at the locations
with sensors, making them not applicable to prediction tasks. Another drawback
is the lack of measurement of uncertainty in prediction, making prior works
unsuitable for risk-sensitive tasks or involving decision-making. To fill the
gap, inspired by the previous inductive graph neural network, this work
proposed an uncertainty-aware framework with the ability to 1) extend
prediction to missing locations with no historical records and significantly
extend spatial coverage of prediction locations while reducing deployment of
sensors and 2) generate probabilistic prediction with uncertainty
quantification to help the management of risk and decision making in the
down-stream tasks. Through extensive experiments on real-life datasets, the
result shows our method achieved promising results on prediction tasks, and the
uncertainty quantification gives consistent results which highly correlated
with the locations with and without historical data. We also show that our
model could help support sensor deployment tasks in the transportation field to

single precision IEEE 754 floating point numbers (binary32), can also work
using lower precision. Therefore, 16-bit and 8-bit compressed format have
attracted considerable attention. In this paper, we focused on two families of
formats that have already achieved interesting results in compressing binary32
numbers in machine learning applications, without sensible degradation of the
accuracy: bfloat and posit. Even if 16-bit and 8-bit bfloat/posit are routinely
used for reducing the storage of the weights/biases of trained DNNs, the
inference still often happens on the 32-bit FPU of the CPU (especially if GPUs
are not available). In this paper we propose a way to decompress a tensor of
bfloat/posits just before computations, i.e., after the compressed operands
have been loaded within the vector registers of a vector capable CPU, in order
to save bandwidth usage and increase cache efficiency. Finally, we show the
architectural parameters and considerations under which this solution is
advantageous with respect to the uncompressed one.]]></summary>

performance on many complex language tasks, there is a great interest in
bringing these LLMs to mobile devices for faster responses and better privacy
protection. However, the size of LLMs (i.e., billions of parameters) requires
highly effective compression to fit into storage-limited devices. Among many
compression techniques, weight-clustering, a form of non-linear quantization,
is one of the leading candidates for LLM compression, and supported by modern
smartphones. Yet, its training overhead is prohibitively significant for LLM
fine-tuning. Especially, Differentiable KMeans Clustering, or DKM, has shown
the state-of-the-art trade-off between compression ratio and accuracy
regression, but its large memory complexity makes it nearly impossible to apply
to train-time LLM compression. In this paper, we propose a memory-efficient DKM
implementation, eDKM powered by novel techniques to reduce the memory footprint
of DKM by orders of magnitudes. For a given tensor to be saved on CPU for the
backward pass of DKM, we compressed the tensor by applying uniquification and
sharding after checking if there is no duplicated tensor previously copied to
CPU. Our experimental results demonstrate that \prjname can fine-tune and
compress a pretrained LLaMA 7B model from 12.6 GB to 2.5 GB (3bit/weight) with
the Alpaca dataset by reducing the train-time memory footprint of a decoder
layer by 130$\times$, while delivering good accuracy on broader LLM benchmarks
(i.e., 77.7% for PIQA, 66.1% for Winograde, and so on).]]></summary>

principles, we rationalise the selection of novel design features that lead to
experimental performance improvements of ~60% over conventional designs. Our

important step in the drug discovery pipeline. Graph neural fingerprint is a
promising method for developing molecular docking surrogates with high

dataset of about 300,000 drug candidates on 23 coronavirus protein targets.
With this dataset, we trained graph neural fingerprint docking models for
high-throughput virtual COVID-19 drug screening. The graph neural fingerprint
models yield high prediction accuracy on docking scores with the mean squared
error lower than $0.21$ kcal/mol for most of the docking targets, showing
significant improvement over conventional circular fingerprint methods. To make
the neural fingerprints transferable for unknown targets, we also propose a
transferable graph neural fingerprint method trained on multiple targets. With
comparable accuracy to target-specific graph neural fingerprint models, the
transferable model exhibits superb training and data efficiency. We highlight
that the impact of this study extends beyond COVID-19 dataset, as our approach

the pixel space by adding adversarial perturbations. By contrast, semantic
adversarial attacks focus on changing semantic attributes of clean examples,
such as color, context, and features, which are more feasible in the real
world. In this paper, we propose a framework to quickly generate a semantic
adversarial attack by leveraging recent diffusion models since semantic
information is included in the latent space of well-trained diffusion models.
Then there are two variants of this framework: 1) the Semantic Transformation
(ST) approach fine-tunes the latent space of the generated image and/or the
diffusion model itself; 2) the Latent Masking (LM) approach masks the latent
space with another target image and local backpropagation-based interpretation
methods. Additionally, the ST approach can be applied in either white-box or
black-box settings. Extensive experiments are conducted on CelebA-HQ and AFHQ
datasets, and our framework demonstrates great fidelity, generalizability, and
transferability compared to other baselines. Our approaches achieve
approximately 100% attack success rate in multiple settings with the best FID
as 36.61. Code is available at

Extensive evaluations in simulation demonstrate ConDex's superior performance

in recent years due to the rapid development of relevant applications in many
fields. For instance, medical institutions often use electrodes attached to
different parts of a patient to analyse the electorencephal data rich with
spatial and temporal features for health assessment and disease diagnosis.
Existing research has mainly used deep learning techniques such as
convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN) to extract
hidden spatial-temporal features. Yet, it is challenging to incorporate both
inter-dependencies spatial information and dynamic temporal changes
simultaneously. In reality, for a model that leverages these spatial-temporal
features to fulfil complex prediction tasks, it often requires a colossal
amount of training data in order to obtain satisfactory model performance.
Considering the above-mentioned challenges, we propose an adaptive federated
relevance framework, namely FedRel, for spatial-temporal graph learning in this
paper. After transforming the raw spatial-temporal data into high quality
features, the core Dynamic Inter-Intra Graph (DIIG) module in the framework is
able to use these features to generate the spatial-temporal graphs capable of
capturing the hidden topological and long-term temporal correlation information
in these graphs. To improve the model generalization ability and performance
while preserving the local data privacy, we also design a relevance-driven
federated learning module in our framework to leverage diverse data

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Directed graphs are a natural model for many phenomena, in particular
scientific knowledge graphs such as molecular interaction or chemical reaction
networks that define cellular signaling relationships. In these situations,
source nodes typically have distinct biophysical properties from sinks. Due to
their ordered and unidirectional relationships, many such networks also have
hierarchical and multiscale structure. However, the majority of methods
performing node- and edge-level tasks in machine learning do not take these
properties into account, and thus have not been leveraged effectively for
scientific tasks such as cellular signaling network inference. We propose a new
framework called Directed Scattering Autoencoder (DSAE) which uses a directed
version of a geometric scattering transform, combined with the non-linear
dimensionality reduction properties of an autoencoder and the geometric
properties of the hyperbolic space to learn latent hierarchies. We show this
method outperforms numerous others on tasks such as embedding directed graphs
and learning cellular signaling networks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Accurately labeling biomedical data presents a challenge. Traditional
semi-supervised learning methods often under-utilize available unlabeled data.
To address this, we propose a novel reliability-based training data cleaning
method employing inductive conformal prediction (ICP). This method capitalizes
on a small set of accurately labeled training data and leverages ICP-calculated
reliability metrics to rectify mislabeled data and outliers within vast
quantities of noisy training data. The efficacy of the method is validated
across three classification tasks within distinct modalities: filtering
drug-induced-liver-injury (DILI) literature with title and abstract, predicting
ICU admission of COVID-19 patients through CT radiomics and electronic health
records, and subtyping breast cancer using RNA-sequencing data. Varying levels
of noise to the training labels were introduced through label permutation.
Results show significant enhancements in classification performance: accuracy
enhancement in 86 out of 96 DILI experiments (up to 11.4%), AUROC and AUPRC
enhancements in all 48 COVID-19 experiments (up to 23.8% and 69.8%), and
accuracy and macro-average F1 score improvements in 47 out of 48 RNA-sequencing
experiments (up to 74.6% and 89.0%). Our method offers the potential to
substantially boost classification performance in multi-modal biomedical
machine learning tasks. Importantly, it accomplishes this without necessitating
an excessive volume of meticulously curated training data.]]></summary>

essential to various downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis, sarcasm
detection and hate speech classification. However, combining text and image
information is challenging because of the idiosyncratic cross-modal semantics
with hidden or complementary information present in matching image-text pairs.
In this work, we aim to directly model this by proposing the use of two
auxiliary losses jointly with the main task when fine-tuning any pre-trained
multimodal model. Image-Text Contrastive (ITC) brings image-text
representations of a post closer together and separates them from different
posts, capturing underlying dependencies. Image-Text Matching (ITM) facilitates
the understanding of semantic correspondence between images and text by
penalizing unrelated pairs. We combine these objectives with five multimodal
models, demonstrating consistent improvements across four popular social media
datasets. Furthermore, through detailed analysis, we shed light on the specific
scenarios and cases where each auxiliary task proves to be most effective.]]></summary>

accelerations, significantly influence the application of deep learning in
real-world scenarios. These innovations translate human labor efforts into
automated intelligent systems employed in various areas such as autonomous
driving, robotics, Internet-of-Things (IoT), and numerous other impactful
applications. NVIDIA's Jetson platform is one of the pioneers in offering
optimal performance regarding energy efficiency and throughput in the execution
of deep learning algorithms. Previously, most benchmarking analysis was based
on 2D images with a single deep learning model for each comparison result. In
this paper, we implement an end-to-end video-based crime-scene anomaly
detection system inputting from surveillance videos and the system is deployed
and completely operates on multiple Jetson edge devices (Nano, AGX Xavier, Orin
Nano). The comparison analysis includes the integration of Torch-TensorRT as a
software developer kit from NVIDIA for the model performance optimisation. The
system is built based on the PySlowfast open-source project from Facebook as
the coding template. The end-to-end system process comprises the videos from
camera, data preprocessing pipeline, feature extractor and the anomaly
detection. We provide the experience of an AI-based system deployment on
various Jetson Edge devices with Docker technology. Regarding anomaly
detectors, a weakly supervised video-based deep learning model called Robust
Temporal Feature Magnitude Learning (RTFM) is applied in the system. The
approach system reaches 47.56 frames per second (FPS) inference speed on a
Jetson edge device with only 3.11 GB RAM usage total. We also discover the
promising Jetson device that the AI system achieves 15% better performance than
the previous version of Jetson devices while consuming 50% less energy power.]]></summary>

blooms of water bodies, and is an important indicator for evaluating water
quality. The prediction of chlorophyll concentration change trend is of great
significance to environmental protection and aquaculture. However, there is a
complex and indistinguishable nonlinear relationship between many factors
affecting chlorophyll concentration. In order to effectively mine the nonlinear
features contained in the data. This paper proposes a time-series decomposition
adaptive graph-time convolutional network ( AGTCNSD ) prediction model.
Firstly, the original sequence is decomposed into trend component and periodic
component by moving average method. Secondly, based on the graph convolutional
neural network, the water quality parameter data is modeled, and a parameter
embedding matrix is defined. The idea of matrix decomposition is used to assign
weight parameters to each node. The adaptive graph convolution learns the
relationship between different water quality parameters, updates the state
information of each parameter, and improves the learning ability of the update
relationship between nodes. Finally, time dependence is captured by time
convolution to achieve multi-step prediction of chlorophyll concentration. The
validity of the model is verified by the water quality data of the coastal city
Beihai. The results show that the prediction effect of this method is better
than other methods. It can be used as a scientific resource for environmental
management decision-making.]]></summary>

used by journalists and fact-checkers to assess the veracity of online content.
Automating the task of credibility signal extraction, however, is very
challenging as it requires high-accuracy signal-specific extractors to be
trained, while there are currently no sufficiently large datasets annotated
with all credibility signals. This paper investigates whether large language
models (LLMs) can be prompted effectively with a set of 18 credibility signals
to produce weak labels for each signal. We then aggregate these potentially
noisy labels using weak supervision in order to predict content veracity. We
demonstrate that our approach, which combines zero-shot LLM credibility signal
labeling and weak supervision, outperforms state-of-the-art classifiers on two
misinformation datasets without using any ground-truth labels for training. We
also analyse the contribution of the individual credibility signals towards
predicting content veracity, which provides new valuable insights into their
role in misinformation detection.]]></summary>

multidimensional signal and image processing, most traditional neural networks
process data represented by (multidimensional) arrays of real numbers. The
intercorrelation between feature channels is usually expected to be learned
from the training data, requiring numerous parameters and careful training. In
contrast, vector-valued neural networks are conceived to process arrays of
vectors and naturally consider the intercorrelation between feature channels.
Consequently, they usually have fewer parameters and often undergo more robust
training than traditional neural networks. This paper aims to present a broad
framework for vector-valued neural networks, referred to as V-nets. In this
context, hypercomplex-valued neural networks are regarded as vector-valued
models with additional algebraic properties. Furthermore, this paper explains
the relationship between vector-valued and traditional neural networks.
Precisely, a vector-valued neural network can be obtained by placing
restrictions on a real-valued model to consider the intercorrelation between
feature channels. Finally, we show how V-nets, including hypercomplex-valued

learning (ML) model for diagnosing and monitoring Parkinson's disease (PD) in
an Internet of Things (IoT) environment using rest-state EEG signals (rs-EEG).
We computed different types of entropy from EEG signals and found that Fuzzy
Entropy performed the best in diagnosing and monitoring PD using rs-EEG. We
also investigated different combinations of signal frequency ranges and EEG
channels to accurately diagnose PD. Finally, with a fewer number of features
(11 features), we achieved a maximum classification accuracy (ARKF) of ~99.9%.
The most prominent frequency range of EEG signals has been identified, and we
have found that high classification accuracy depends on low-frequency signal
components (0-4 Hz). Moreover, the most informative signals were mainly
received from the right hemisphere of the head (F8, P8, T8, FC6). Furthermore,
we assessed the accuracy of the diagnosis of PD using three different lengths
of EEG data (150-1000 samples). Because the computational complexity is reduced
by reducing the input data. As a result, we have achieved a maximum mean
accuracy of 99.9% for a sample length (LEEG) of 1000 (~7.8 seconds), 98.2% with
a LEEG of 800 (~6.2 seconds), and 79.3% for LEEG = 150 (~1.2 seconds). By
reducing the number of features and segment lengths, the computational cost of
classification can be reduced. Lower-performance smart ML sensors can be used
in IoT environments for enhances human resilience to PD.]]></summary>

are used in the proposed design. In each equation, a deep neural network is
used to approximate the unknown function. Three forms of fractional
differential equations have been examined to highlight the method's
versatility: a fractional ordinary differential equation, a fractional order
integrodifferential equation, and a fractional order partial differential
equation. The results show that the proposed architecture solves different

Impairment (MCI). Early detection of AD is crucial for making treatment
decisions. However, most of the literature on computer-assisted detection of AD
focuses on classifying brain images into one of three major categories:
healthy, MCI, and AD; or categorizing MCI patients into (1) progressive: those
who progress from MCI to AD at a future examination time, and (2) stable: those
who stay as MCI and never progress to AD. This misses the opportunity to
accurately identify the trajectory of progressive MCI patients. In this paper,
we revisit the brain image classification task for AD identification and
re-frame it as an ordinal classification task to predict how close a patient is
to the severe AD stage. To this end, we select progressive MCI patients from
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset and construct an
ordinal dataset with a prediction target that indicates the time to progression
to AD. We train a Siamese network model to predict the time to onset of AD
based on MRI brain images. We also propose a Weighted variety of Siamese
network and compare its performance to a baseline model. Our evaluations show
that incorporating a weighting factor to Siamese networks brings considerable
performance gain at predicting how close input brain MRI images are to
progressing to AD. Moreover, we complement our results with an interpretation
of the learned embedding space of the Siamese networks using a model
explainability technique.]]></summary>

punishments as central to explaining goal-directed behavior. However, over a
life, organisms will need to learn about many different aspects of the world's
structure: the states of the world and state-vector transition dynamics. The
number of combinations of states grows exponentially as an agent incorporates
new knowledge, and there is no obvious weighted combination of pre-existing
rewards or costs defined for a given combination of states, as such a weighting
would need to encode information about good and bad combinations prior to an
agent's experience in the world. Therefore, we must develop more naturalistic
accounts of behavior and motivation in large state-spaces. We show that it is
possible to use only the intrinsic motivation metric of empowerment, which
measures the agent's capacity to realize many possible futures under a
transition operator. We propose to scale empowerment to hierarchical
state-spaces by using Operator Bellman Equations. These equations produce
state-time feasibility functions, which are compositional hierarchical
state-time transition operators that map an initial state and time when an
agent begins a policy to the final states and times of completing a goal.
Because these functions are hierarchical operators we can define hierarchical
empowerment measures on them. An agent can then optimize plans to distant
states and times to maximize its hierarchical empowerment-gain, allowing it to
discover goals that bring about a more favorable coupling of its internal
structure (physiological states) to its external environment (world structure &
spatial state). Life-long agents could therefore be primarily animated by
principles of compositionality and empowerment, exhibiting self-concern for the
growth & maintenance of their own structural integrity without recourse to
reward-maximization.]]></summary>

the proposed training strategies, a lightweight model with 5.7M parameters
performs stably well on a broad range of masking ratios (5%-75%). The ablation

https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-36363-w (2023)], the authors present a deep
reinforced learning approach to augment combinatorial optimization heuristics.
In particular, they present results for several spin glass ground state
problems, for which instances on non-planar networks are generally NP-hard, in
comparison with several Monte Carlo based methods, such as simulated annealing
(SA) or parallel tempering (PT). Indeed, those results demonstrate that the
reinforced learning improves the results over those obtained with SA or PT, or
at least allows for reduced runtimes for the heuristics before results of
comparable quality have been obtained relative to those other methods. To
facilitate the conclusion that their method is ''superior'', the authors pursue
two basic strategies: (1) A commercial GUROBI solver is called on to procure a
sample of exact ground states as a testbed to compare with, and (2) a
head-to-head comparison between the heuristics is given for a sample of larger
instances where exact ground states are hard to ascertain. Here, we put these
studies into a larger context, showing that the claimed superiority is at best
marginal for smaller samples and becomes essentially irrelevant with respect to
any sensible approximation of true ground states in the larger samples. For
example, this method becomes irrelevant as a means to determine stiffness
exponents $\theta$ in $d>2$, as mentioned by the authors, where the problem is
not only NP-hard but requires the subtraction of two almost equal ground-state
energies and systemic errors in each of $\approx 1\%$ found here are
unacceptable. This larger picture on the method arises from a straightforward
finite-size corrections study over the spin glass ensembles the authors employ,
using data that has been available for decades.]]></summary>

develop unbiased decision-making in valuing properties. Real estate appraisal
serves as one of the high-cost property valuation tasks for financial
institutions since it requires domain experts to appraise the estimation based
on the corresponding knowledge and the judgment of the market. Existing
automated valuation models reducing the subjectivity of domain experts require
a large number of transactions for effective evaluation, which is predominantly
limited to not only the labeling efforts of transactions but also the
generalizability of new developing and rural areas. To learn representations
from unlabeled real estate sets, existing self-supervised learning (SSL) for
tabular data neglects various important features, and fails to incorporate
domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose DoRA, a Domain-based
self-supervised learning framework for low-resource Real estate Appraisal. DoRA
is pre-trained with an intra-sample geographic prediction as the pretext task
based on the metadata of the real estate for equipping the real estate
representations with prior domain knowledge. Furthermore, inter-sample
contrastive learning is employed to generalize the representations to be robust
for limited transactions of downstream tasks. Our benchmark results on three
property types of real-world transactions show that DoRA significantly
outperforms the SSL baselines for tabular data, the graph-based methods, and
the supervised approaches in the few-shot scenarios by at least 7.6% for MAPE,
11.59% for MAE, and 3.34% for HR10%. We expect DoRA to be useful to other
financial practitioners with similar marketplace applications who need general
models for properties that are newly built and have limited records. The source
code is available at https://github.com/wwweiwei/DoRA.]]></summary>

a pure algorithmic abstraction. However, new implementation-based threats have
been revealed, emphasizing the urgency to propose both practical and

concern is parameter-based attacks (such as the Bit-Flip Attack, BFA) that
highlight the lack of robustness of typical deep neural network models when
confronted by accurate and optimal alterations of their internal parameters
stored in memory. Setting in a security testing purpose, this work practically
reports, for the first time, a successful variant of the BFA on a 32-bit
Cortex-M microcontroller using laser fault injection. It is a standard fault

global score functions. However, if local variables have direct and indirect
dependence simultaneously, the global optimization on score functions misses
edges between variables with indirect dependent relationship, of which scores
are smaller than those with direct dependent relationship. In this paper, we
present an identifiability condition based on a determined subset of parents to
identify the underlying DAG. By the identifiability condition, we develop a
two-phase algorithm namely optimal-tuning (OT) algorithm to locally amend the
global optimization. In the optimal phase, an optimization problem based on
first-order Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) gives an estimated
skeleton as the initial determined parents subset. In the tuning phase, the
skeleton is locally tuned by deletion, addition and DAG-formalization
strategies using the theoretically proved incremental properties of high-order
HSIC. Numerical experiments for different synthetic datasets and real-world
datasets show that the OT algorithm outperforms existing methods. Especially in
Sigmoid Mix model with the size of the graph being ${\rm\bf d=40}$, the
structure intervention distance (SID) of the OT algorithm is 329.7 smaller than
the one obtained by CAM, which indicates that the graph estimated by the OT
algorithm misses fewer edges compared with CAM.Source code of the OT algorithm

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Focus in Explainable AI is shifting from explanations defined in terms of
low-level elements, such as input features, to explanations encoded in terms of
interpretable concepts learned from data. How to reliably acquire such concepts
is, however, still fundamentally unclear. An agreed-upon notion of concept
interpretability is missing, with the result that concepts used by both
post-hoc explainers and concept-based neural networks are acquired through a
variety of mutually incompatible strategies. Critically, most of these neglect
the human side of the problem: a representation is understandable only insofar
as it can be understood by the human at the receiving end. The key challenge in
Human-interpretable Representation Learning (HRL) is how to model and
operationalize this human element. In this work, we propose a mathematical
framework for acquiring interpretable representations suitable for both
post-hoc explainers and concept-based neural networks. Our formalization of HRL
builds on recent advances in causal representation learning and explicitly
models a human stakeholder as an external observer. This allows us to derive a
principled notion of alignment between the machine representation and the
vocabulary of concepts understood by the human. In doing so, we link alignment
and interpretability through a simple and intuitive name transfer game, and
clarify the relationship between alignment and a well-known property of
representations, namely disentanglment. We also show that alignment is linked
to the issue of undesirable correlations among concepts, also known as concept
leakage, and to content-style separation, all through a general
information-theoretic reformulation of these properties. Our conceptualization
aims to bridge the gap between the human and algorithmic sides of
interpretability and establish a stepping stone for new research on
human-interpretable representations.]]></summary>

In this way, the neural network predicts warm starts with the end-to-end goal

its flexibility, in that it can predict a warm start for fixed-point algorithms

interpretability. Despite the advancements in interpretable machine learning
(IML) methods, they frequently assign importance to features which lack causal
influence on the outcome variable. Selecting causally relevant features among
those identified as relevant by these methods, or even before model training,
would offer a solution. Feature selection methods utilizing information
theoretical quantities have been successful in identifying statistically
relevant features. However, the information theoretical quantities they are
based on do not incorporate causality, rendering them unsuitable for such
scenarios. To address this challenge, this article proposes information
theoretical quantities that incorporate the causal structure of the system,
which can be used to evaluate causal importance of features for some given
outcome variable. Specifically, we introduce causal versions of entropy and
mutual information, termed causal entropy and causal information gain, which
are designed to assess how much control a feature provides over the outcome
variable. These newly defined quantities capture changes in the entropy of a
variable resulting from interventions on other variables. Fundamental results
connecting these quantities to the existence of causal effects are derived. The
use of causal information gain in feature selection is demonstrated,
highlighting its superiority over standard mutual information in revealing
which features provide control over a chosen outcome variable. Our
investigation paves the way for the development of methods with improved

spatial location with EEG in a multiple-speaker setting. ASAD methods are
inspired by the brain lateralization of cortical neural responses during the
processing of auditory spatial attention, and show promising performance for
the task of auditory attention decoding (AAD) with neural recordings. In the
previous ASAD methods, the spatial distribution of EEG electrodes is not fully
exploited, which may limit the performance of these methods. In the present
work, by transforming the original EEG channels into a two-dimensional (2D)
spatial topological map, the EEG data is transformed into a three-dimensional
(3D) arrangement containing spatial-temporal information. And then a 3D deep
convolutional neural network (DenseNet-3D) is used to extract temporal and
spatial features of the neural representation for the attended locations. The
results show that the proposed method achieves higher decoding accuracy than
the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method (94.4% compared to XANet's 90.6%) with
1-second decision window for the widely used KULeuven (KUL) dataset, and the

spatial vulnerability into a unified spatial attack and adversarial training
approach. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive relationship between natural
accuracy, sensitivity-based robustness, and spatial robustness, supported by
strong evidence from the perspective of robust representation. Crucially, to
reconcile the interplay between the mutual impacts of various robustness
components into one unified framework, we incorporate the \textit{Pareto
criterion} into the adversarial robustness analysis, yielding a novel strategy
called Pareto Adversarial Training for achieving universal robustness. The
resulting Pareto front, which delineates the set of optimal solutions, provides
an optimal balance between natural accuracy and various adversarial robustness.
This sheds light on solutions for achieving universal robustness in the future.

developmental mechanism for goal discovery via an emergent representation that
abstracts (i.e., groups together) sets of environment states that have similar
roles in the task. We introduce a Feudal HRL algorithm that concurrently learns
both the goal representation and a hierarchical policy. The algorithm uses
symbolic reachability analysis for neural networks to approximate the
transition relation among sets of states and to refine the goal representation.

representations by contrasting the representations learned from a graph's local

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We introduce beta diffusion, a novel generative modeling method that
integrates demasking and denoising to generate data within bounded ranges.
Using scaled and shifted beta distributions, beta diffusion utilizes
multiplicative transitions over time to create both forward and reverse
diffusion processes, maintaining beta distributions in both the forward
marginals and the reverse conditionals, given the data at any point in time.
Unlike traditional diffusion-based generative models relying on additive
Gaussian noise and reweighted evidence lower bounds (ELBOs), beta diffusion is
multiplicative and optimized with KL-divergence upper bounds (KLUBs) derived
from the convexity of the KL divergence. We demonstrate that the proposed KLUBs
are more effective for optimizing beta diffusion compared to negative ELBOs,
which can also be derived as the KLUBs of the same KL divergence with its two
arguments swapped. The loss function of beta diffusion, expressed in terms of
Bregman divergence, further supports the efficacy of KLUBs for optimization.
Experimental results on both synthetic data and natural images demonstrate the
unique capabilities of beta diffusion in generative modeling of range-bounded
data and validate the effectiveness of KLUBs in optimizing diffusion models,
thereby making them valuable additions to the family of diffusion-based
generative models and the optimization techniques used to train them.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UCI WorldTour races, the premier men's elite road cycling tour, are grueling
events that put physical fitness and endurance of riders to the test. The
coaches of Team Jumbo-Visma have long been responsible for predicting the
energy needs of each rider of the Dutch team for every race on the calendar.
Those must be estimated to ensure riders have the energy and resources
necessary to maintain a high level of performance throughout a race. This task,
however, is both time-consuming and challenging, as it requires precise
estimates of race speed and power output. Traditionally, the approach to
predicting energy needs has relied on judgement and experience of coaches, but
this method has its limitations and often leads to inaccurate predictions. In
this paper, we propose a new, more effective approach to predicting energy
needs for cycling races. By predicting the speed and power with regression
models, we provide the coaches with calorie needs estimates for each individual
rider per stage instantly. In addition, we compare methods to quantify
uncertainty using conformal prediction. The empirical analysis of the
jackknife+, jackknife-minmax, jackknife-minmax-after-bootstrap, CV+, CV-minmax,
conformalized quantile regression, and inductive conformal prediction methods
in conformal prediction reveals that all methods achieve valid prediction
intervals. All but minmax-based methods also produce sufficiently narrow
prediction intervals for decision-making. Furthermore, methods computing
prediction intervals of fixed size produce tighter intervals for low
significance values. Among the methods computing intervals of varying length
across the input space, inductive conformal prediction computes narrower
prediction intervals at larger significance level.]]></summary>

learning: Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA) and Dataset Distillation (DD).
On the one hand, the first considers adapting multiple heterogeneous labeled
source domains to an unlabeled target domain. On the other hand, the second
attacks the problem of synthesizing a small summary containing all the
information about the datasets. We thus consider a new problem called MSDA-DD.
To solve it, we adapt previous works in the MSDA literature, such as
Wasserstein Barycenter Transport and Dataset Dictionary Learning, as well as DD
method Distribution Matching. We thoroughly experiment with this novel problem
on four benchmarks (Caltech-Office 10, Tennessee-Eastman Process, Continuous
Stirred Tank Reactor, and Case Western Reserve University), where we show that,
even with as little as 1 sample per class, one achieves state-of-the-art
adaptation performance.]]></summary>

significant attention, as the distances induced by optimal transport provide
both a principled metric between graphs as well as an interpretable description

formulations, optimal transport distances for graphs have mostly been developed
for undirected graphs. Here, we propose two distance measures to compare

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Purpose: Common to most MRSI techniques, the spatial resolution and the
minimal scan duration of Deuterium Metabolic Imaging (DMI) are limited by the
achievable SNR. This work presents a deep learning method for sensitivity
enhancement of DMI.

Methods: A convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed to estimate the
2H-labeled metabolite concentrations from low SNR and distorted DMI FIDs. The
CNN was trained with synthetic data that represent a range of SNR levels
typically encountered in vivo. The estimation precision was further improved by
fine-tuning the CNN with MRI-based edge-preserving regularization for each DMI
dataset. The proposed processing method, PReserved Edge ConvolutIonal neural
network for Sensitivity Enhanced DMI (PRECISE-DMI), was applied to simulation
studies and in vivo experiments to evaluate the anticipated improvements in SNR
and investigate the potential for inaccuracies.

Results: PRECISE-DMI visually improved the metabolic maps of low SNR
datasets, and quantitatively provided higher precision than the standard
Fourier reconstruction. Processing of DMI data acquired in rat brain tumor
models resulted in more precise determination of 2H-labeled lactate and
glutamate + glutamine levels, at increased spatial resolution (from >8 to 2
$\mu$L) or shortened scan time (from 32 to 4 min) compared to standard
acquisitions. However, rigorous SD-bias analyses showed that overuse of the
edge-preserving regularization can compromise the accuracy of the results.

Conclusion: PRECISE-DMI allows a flexible trade-off between enhancing the
sensitivity of DMI and minimizing the inaccuracies. With typical settings, the
DMI sensitivity can be improved by 3-fold while retaining the capability to
detect local signal variations.]]></summary>

the entire output from scratch, including the unedited regions. This leads to a
significant waste of computation, especially for minor editing operations. In

technique that selectively performs computation for edited regions and

original image. Given an edited image, we sparsely apply the convolutional
filters to the edited regions while reusing the cached features for the
unedited areas. Based on our algorithm, we further propose Sparse Incremental
Generative Engine (SIGE) to convert the computation reduction to latency
reduction on off-the-shelf hardware. With about $1\%$-area edits, SIGE
accelerates DDPM by $3.0\times$ on NVIDIA RTX 3090 and $4.6\times$ on Apple M1
Pro GPU, Stable Diffusion by $7.2\times$ on 3090, and GauGAN by $5.6\times$ on

networks exhibit benign overfitting: they can be driven to zero training error,
perfectly fitting any noisy training labels, and simultaneously achieve minimax

genomic studies to identify differentially expressed genes. However, due to
unmeasured confounders, many standard statistical approaches may be
substantially biased. This paper investigates the large-scale hypothesis
testing problem for multivariate generalized linear models in the presence of
confounding effects. Under arbitrary confounding mechanisms, we propose a
unified statistical estimation and inference framework that harnesses
orthogonal structures and integrates linear projections into three key stages.
It first leverages multivariate responses to separate marginal and uncorrelated
confounding effects, recovering the confounding coefficients' column space.
Subsequently, latent factors and primary effects are jointly estimated,
utilizing $\ell_1$-regularization for sparsity while imposing orthogonality
onto confounding coefficients. Finally, we incorporate projected and weighted
bias-correction steps for hypothesis testing. Theoretically, we establish
various effects' identification conditions and non-asymptotic error bounds. We
show effective Type-I error control of asymptotic $z$-tests as sample and
response sizes approach infinity. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method controls the false discovery rate by the Benjamini-Hochberg
procedure and is more powerful than alternative methods. By comparing
single-cell RNA-seq counts from two groups of samples, we demonstrate the
suitability of adjusting confounding effects when significant covariates are
absent from the model.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Auditory Attention Detection (AAD) aims to detect target speaker from brain
signals in a multi-speaker environment. Although EEG-based AAD methods have
shown promising results in recent years, current approaches primarily rely on
traditional convolutional neural network designed for processing Euclidean data
like images. This makes it challenging to handle EEG signals, which possess
non-Euclidean characteristics. In order to address this problem, this paper
proposes a dynamical graph self-distillation (DGSD) approach for AAD, which
does not require speech stimuli as input. Specifically, to effectively
represent the non-Euclidean properties of EEG signals, dynamical graph
convolutional networks are applied to represent the graph structure of EEG
signals, which can also extract crucial features related to auditory spatial
attention in EEG signals. In addition, to further improve AAD detection
performance, self-distillation, consisting of feature distillation and
hierarchical distillation strategies at each layer, is integrated. These
strategies leverage features and classification results from the deepest
network layers to guide the learning of shallow layers. Our experiments are
conducted on two publicly available datasets, KUL and DTU. Under a 1-second
time window, we achieve results of 90.0\% and 79.6\% accuracy on KUL and DTU,
respectively. We compare our DGSD method with competitive baselines, and the
experimental results indicate that the detection performance of our proposed
DGSD method is not only superior to the best reproducible baseline but also
significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters by approximately 100
times.]]></summary>

(EEG)-based cognitive workload (CWL) estimation. The focus of the article is
twofold: identify the disparate experimental paradigms used for reliably
eliciting discreet and quantifiable levels of cognitive load and the specific
nature and representational structure of the commonly used input formulations
in deep neural networks (DNNs) used for signal classification. The analysis
revealed a number of studies using EEG signals in its native representation of
a two-dimensional matrix for offline classification of CWL. However, only a few
studies adopted an online or pseudo-online classification strategy for
real-time CWL estimation. Further, only a couple of interpretable DNNs and a
single generative model were employed for cognitive load detection till date
during this review. More often than not, researchers were using DNNs as
black-box type models. In conclusion, DNNs prove to be valuable tools for
classifying EEG signals, primarily due to the substantial modeling power
provided by the depth of their network architecture. It is further suggested
that interpretable and explainable DNN models must be employed for cognitive
workload estimation since existing methods are limited in the face of the
non-stationary nature of the signal.]]></summary>

hardware and software combinations. However, the freedom to experiment across
different tooling stacks can be at odds with the drive for efficiency, which
has produced increasingly specialized AI hardware and incentivized
consolidation around a narrow set of ML frameworks. Exploratory research can be
restricted if software and hardware are co-evolving, making it even harder to
stray away from mainstream ideas that work well with popular tooling stacks.
While this friction increasingly impacts the rate of innovation in machine
learning, to our knowledge the lack of portability in tooling has not been
quantified. In this work, we ask: How portable are popular ML software
frameworks? We conduct a large-scale study of the portability of mainstream ML
frameworks across different hardware types. Our findings paint an uncomfortable
picture -- frameworks can lose more than 40% of their key functions when ported
to other hardware. Worse, even when functions are portable, the slowdown in
their performance can be extreme and render performance untenable.
Collectively, our results reveal how costly straying from a narrow set of
hardware-software combinations can be - and suggest that specialization of

outperforming traditional statistical techniques. However, to establish ML as a
reliable tool in clinical practice, adherence to best practices regarding data
handling, experimental design, and model evaluation is crucial. This work
summarizes and strictly observes such practices to ensure reproducible and
reliable ML. Specifically, we focus on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection,
which serves as a paradigmatic example of challenging problem in healthcare. We
investigate the impact of different data augmentation techniques and model
complexity on the overall performance. We consider MRI data from ADNI dataset
to address a classification problem employing 3D Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). The experiments are designed to compensate for data scarcity and initial
random parameters by utilizing cross-validation and multiple training trials.
Within this framework, we train 15 predictive models, considering three
different data augmentation strategies and five distinct 3D CNN architectures,
each varying in the number of convolutional layers. Specifically, the
augmentation strategies are based on affine transformations, such as zoom,
shift, and rotation, applied concurrently or separately. The combined effect of
data augmentation and model complexity leads to a variation in prediction
performance up to 10% of accuracy. When affine transformation are applied
separately, the model is more accurate, independently from the adopted
architecture. For all strategies, the model accuracy followed a concave
behavior at increasing number of convolutional layers, peaking at an
intermediate value of layers. The best model (8 CL, (B)) is the most stable
across cross-validation folds and training trials, reaching excellent
performance both on the testing set and on an external test set.]]></summary>

belief network (D-PBN) to take full advantage of trainable compound activation
functions (TCAs). A D-PBN is a type of auto-encoder that operates by "backing
up" through a feed-forward neural network. TCAs are activation functions with
complex monotonic-increasing shapes that change the distribution of the data so
that the linear transformation that follows is more effective. Because a D-PBN
operates by "backing up", the TCAs are inverted in the reconstruction process,
restoring the original distribution of the data, thus taking advantage of a
given TCA in both analysis and reconstruction. In this paper, we show that a
D-PBN auto-encoder with TCAs can significantly out-perform standard
auto-encoders including variational auto-encoders.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Variable importance assessment has become a crucial step in machine-learning
applications when using complex learners, such as deep neural networks, on
large-scale data. Removal-based importance assessment is currently the
reference approach, particularly when statistical guarantees are sought to
justify variable inclusion. It is often implemented with variable permutation
schemes. On the flip side, these approaches risk misidentifying unimportant
variables as important in the presence of correlations among covariates. Here
we develop a systematic approach for studying Conditional Permutation
Importance (CPI) that is model agnostic and computationally lean, as well as
reusable benchmarks of state-of-the-art variable importance estimators. We show
theoretically and empirically that $\textit{CPI}$ overcomes the limitations of
standard permutation importance by providing accurate type-I error control.
When used with a deep neural network, $\textit{CPI}$ consistently showed top
accuracy across benchmarks. An empirical benchmark on real-world data analysis
in a large-scale medical dataset showed that $\textit{CPI}$ provides a more
parsimonious selection of statistically significant variables. Our results
suggest that $\textit{CPI}$ can be readily used as drop-in replacement for
permutation-based methods.]]></summary>

medicine and decision support systems through the analysis of whole slide
images. It has the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of
cancer. However, a major challenge to this objective is that for many specific
computational pathology tasks the amount of data is inadequate for development.
To address this challenge, we created Virchow, a 632 million parameter deep
neural network foundation model for computational pathology. Using
self-supervised learning, Virchow is trained on 1.5 million hematoxylin and
eosin stained whole slide images from diverse tissue groups, which is orders of
magnitude more data than previous works. When evaluated on downstream tasks
including tile-level pan-cancer detection and subtyping and slide-level
biomarker prediction, Virchow outperforms state-of-the-art systems both on
internal datasets drawn from the same population as the pretraining data as
well as external public datasets. Virchow achieves 93% balanced accuracy for
pancancer tile classification, and AUCs of 0.983 for colon microsatellite
instability status prediction and 0.967 for breast CDH1 status prediction. The
gains in performance highlight the importance of pretraining on massive
pathology image datasets, suggesting pretraining on even larger datasets could
continue improving performance for many high-impact applications where limited
amounts of training data are available, such as drug outcome prediction.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Large pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated great
potential in zero-shot transferability to downstream tasks. However, to attain
optimal performance, the manual selection of prompts is necessary to improve
alignment between the downstream image distribution and the textual class
descriptions. This manual prompt engineering is the major challenge for
deploying such models in practice since it requires domain expertise and is
extremely time-consuming. To avoid non-trivial prompt engineering, recent work
Context Optimization (CoOp) introduced the concept of prompt learning to the
vision domain using learnable textual tokens. While CoOp can achieve
substantial improvements over manual prompts, its learned context is worse
generalizable to wider unseen classes within the same dataset. In this work, we
present Prompt Learning with Reparameterization Encoder (PRE) - a simple and
efficient method that enhances the generalization ability of the learnable
prompt to unseen classes while maintaining the capacity to learn Base classes.
Instead of directly optimizing the prompts, PRE employs a prompt encoder to
reparameterize the input prompt embeddings, enhancing the exploration of
task-specific knowledge from few-shot samples. Experiments and extensive
ablation studies on 8 benchmarks demonstrate that our approach is an efficient
method for prompt learning. Specifically, PRE achieves a notable enhancement of
5.60% in average accuracy on New classes and 3% in Harmonic mean compared to
CoOp in the 16-shot setting, all achieved within a good training time.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The main premise of federated learning (FL) is that machine learning model
updates are computed locally to preserve user data privacy. This approach
avoids by design user data to ever leave the perimeter of their device. Once
the updates aggregated, the model is broadcast to all nodes in the federation.
However, without proper defenses, compromised nodes can probe the model inside
their local memory in search for adversarial examples, which can lead to
dangerous real-world scenarios. For instance, in image-based applications,
adversarial examples consist of images slightly perturbed to the human eye
getting misclassified by the local model. These adversarial images are then
later presented to a victim node's counterpart model to replay the attack.
Typical examples harness dissemination strategies such as altered traffic signs
(patch attacks) no longer recognized by autonomous vehicles or seemingly
unaltered samples that poison the local dataset of the FL scheme to undermine
its robustness. Pelta is a novel shielding mechanism leveraging Trusted
Execution Environments (TEEs) that reduce the ability of attackers to craft
adversarial samples. Pelta masks inside the TEE the first part of the
back-propagation chain rule, typically exploited by attackers to craft the
malicious samples. We evaluate Pelta on state-of-the-art accurate models using
three well-established datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet. We show the
effectiveness of Pelta in mitigating six white-box state-of-the-art adversarial
attacks, such as Projected Gradient Descent, Momentum Iterative Method, Auto
Projected Gradient Descent, the Carlini & Wagner attack. In particular, Pelta
constitutes the first attempt at defending an ensemble model against the
Self-Attention Gradient attack to the best of our knowledge. Our code is

structures with higher order than vertices and edges. In this paper, we study
the transferability of TSP via a generalized higher-order version of graphon,
known as complexon. We recall the notion of a complexon as the limit of a
simplicial complex sequence [1]. Inspired by the integral operator form of
graphon shift operators, we construct a marginal complexon and complexon shift
operator (CSO) according to components of all possible dimensions from the
complexon. We investigate the CSO's eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and relate
them to a new family of weighted adjacency matrices. We prove that when a
simplicial complex sequence converges to a complexon, the eigenvalues of the
corresponding CSOs converge to that of the limit complexon. These results hint
at learning transferability on large simplicial complexes or simplicial complex

underscoring the need for rapid and accurate diagnostics. To advance rapid
screening techniques via auscultation, our research focuses on employing one of
the largest publicly available medical database of respiratory sounds to train
multiple machine learning models able to classify different health conditions.
Our method combines Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and spectral analysis to
extract physiologically relevant biosignals from acoustic data, closely tied to
cardiovascular and respiratory patterns, making our approach apart in its
departure from conventional audio feature extraction practices. We use Power
Spectral Density analysis and filtering techniques to select Intrinsic Mode
Functions (IMFs) strongly correlated with underlying physiological phenomena.
These biosignals undergo a comprehensive feature extraction process for
predictive modeling. Initially, we deploy a binary classification model that
demonstrates a balanced accuracy of 87% in distinguishing between healthy and
diseased individuals. Subsequently, we employ a six-class classification model
that achieves a balanced accuracy of 72% in diagnosing specific respiratory
conditions like pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). For
the first time, we also introduce regression models that estimate age and body
mass index (BMI) based solely on acoustic data, as well as a model for gender
classification. Our findings underscore the potential of this approach to
significantly enhance assistive and remote diagnostic capabilities.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unsupervised contrastive learning methods have recently seen significant
improvements, particularly through data augmentation strategies that aim to
produce robust and generalizable representations. However, prevailing data
augmentation methods, whether hand designed or based on foundation models, tend
to rely heavily on prior knowledge or external data. This dependence often
compromises their effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the applicability
of most existing data augmentation strategies is limited when transitioning to
other research domains, especially science-related data. This limitation stems
from the paucity of prior knowledge and labeled data available in these
domains. To address these challenges, we introduce DiffAug-a novel and
efficient Diffusion-based data Augmentation technique. DiffAug aims to ensure
that the augmented and original data share a smoothed latent space, which is
achieved through diffusion steps. Uniquely, unlike traditional methods, DiffAug
first mines sufficient prior semantic knowledge about the neighborhood. This
provides a constraint to guide the diffusion steps, eliminating the need for
labels, external data/models, or prior knowledge. Designed as an
architecture-agnostic framework, DiffAug provides consistent improvements.
Specifically, it improves image classification and clustering accuracy by
1.6%~4.5%. When applied to biological data, DiffAug improves performance by up
to 10.1%, with an average improvement of 5.8%. DiffAug shows good performance
in both vision and biological domains.]]></summary>

grid operation. In this work, we propose a practical yet robust detection
approach that utilizes only readily available voltage magnitudes, eliminating
the need for costly phase angles or power flow data. Given the sensor data,
many existing detection methods based on change-point detection require prior
knowledge of outage patterns, which are unknown for real-world outage
scenarios. To remove this impractical requirement, we propose a data-driven
method to learn the parameters of the post-outage distribution through gradient
descent. However, directly using gradient descent presents feasibility issues.
To address this, we modify our approach by adding a Bregman divergence
constraint to control the trajectory of the parameter updates, which eliminates
the feasibility problems. As timely operation is the key nowadays, we prove
that the optimal parameters can be learned with convergence guarantees via
leveraging the statistical and physical properties of voltage data. We evaluate
our approach using many representative distribution grids and real load
profiles with 17 outage configurations. The results show that we can detect and
localize the outage in a timely manner with only voltage magnitudes and without
assuming a prior knowledge of outage patterns.]]></summary>

synergistically combines domain-aware and interpretable models with agnostic
machine learning techniques. In this work, we introduce GOKU-UI, an evolution
of the SciML generative model GOKU-nets. GOKU-UI not only broadens the original
model's spectrum to incorporate other classes of differential equations, such
as Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), but also integrates attention
mechanisms and a novel multiple shooting training strategy in the latent space.
These modifications have led to a significant increase in its performance in
both reconstruction and forecast tasks, as demonstrated by our evaluation of
simulated and empirical data. Specifically, GOKU-UI outperformed all baseline
models on synthetic datasets even with a training set 16-fold smaller,
underscoring its remarkable data efficiency. Furthermore, when applied to
empirical human brain data, while incorporating stochastic Stuart-Landau
oscillators into its dynamical core, our proposed enhancements markedly
increased the model's effectiveness in capturing complex brain dynamics. This
augmented version not only surpassed all baseline methods in the reconstruction
task, but also demonstrated lower prediction error of future brain activity up
to 15 seconds ahead. By training GOKU-UI on resting state fMRI data, we encoded
whole-brain dynamics into a latent representation, learning a low-dimensional
dynamical system model that could offer insights into brain functionality and
open avenues for practical applications such as the classification of mental
states or psychiatric conditions. Ultimately, our research provides further
impetus for the field of Scientific Machine Learning, showcasing the potential

behaviors, which are more suitable to be described by stochastic differential
equations under non-Gaussian L\'evy noise. Among these complex phenomena, the
most likely transition paths between metastable states are important since
these rare events may have a high impact in certain scenarios. Based on the
large deviation principle, the most likely transition path could be treated as
the minimizer of the rate function upon paths that connect two points. One of
the challenges to calculate the most likely transition path for stochastic
dynamical systems under non-Gaussian L\'evy noise is that the associated rate
function can not be explicitly expressed by paths. For this reason, we
formulate an optimal control problem to obtain the optimal state as the most

converted into spectrograms, which were then used to train a convolutional
neural network (CNN), integrated with a knowledge distillation procedure based
on a pre-trained Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP)-based image
classification teacher network. This strategy allowed our model to attain a
top-5 accuracy of 80%, significantly outperforming a standard CNN and various
RNN-based benchmarks. Additionally, we incorporated an image reconstruction
mechanism based on pre-trained latent diffusion models, which allowed us to
generate an estimate of the images which had elicited EEG activity. Therefore,
our architecture not only decodes images from neural activity but also offers a

deep neural networks and can generate prediction intervals. Quantifying
uncertainty is particularly important in critical applications such as clinical
diagnosis, where a realistic assessment of uncertainty is essential in
determining disease status and planning the appropriate treatment. The most
common application of quantile regression models is in cases where the
parametric likelihood cannot be specified. Although quantile regression is
quite robust to outlier response observations, it can be sensitive to outlier
covariate observations (features). Outlier features can compromise the
performance of deep learning regression problems such as style translation,
image reconstruction, and deep anomaly detection, potentially leading to
misleading conclusions. To address this problem, we propose a robust solution
for quantile regression that incorporates concepts from robust divergence. We
compare the performance of our proposed method with (i) least trimmed quantile
regression and (ii) robust regression based on the regularization of
case-specific parameters in a simple real dataset in the presence of outlier.
These methods have not been applied in a deep learning framework. We also
demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method by applying it to a

used in different applications including home and workplace automation,
security and surveillance as well as healthcare. Starting from conventional
machine learning methods to the recently developing deep learning techniques
and the Internet of things, significant contributions have been shown in the
HAR area in the last decade. Even though several review and survey studies have
been published, there is a lack of sensor-based HAR overview studies focusing
on summarising the usage of wearable sensors and smart home sensors data as
well as applications of HAR and deep learning techniques. Hence, we overview
sensor-based HAR, discuss several important applications that rely on HAR, and
highlight the most common machine learning methods that have been used for HAR.
Finally, several challenges of HAR are explored that should be addressed to
further improve the robustness of HAR.]]></summary>

high-dimensional data in one domain, e.g., genetic data, to high dimensional
data in a second domain, e.g., brain imaging data. The standard approach in the
area are mass univariate analyses across genetic factors and imaging
phenotypes. That entails executing one genome-wide association study (GWAS) for
each pre-defined imaging measure. Although this approach has been tremendously
successful, one shortcoming is that phenotypes must be pre-defined.
Consequently, effects that are not confined to pre-selected regions of interest
or that reflect larger brain-wide patterns can easily be missed. In this work
we introduce a Partial Least Squares (PLS)-based framework, which we term
Cluster-Bootstrap PLS (CLUB-PLS), that can work with large input dimensions in
both domains as well as with large sample sizes. One key factor of the
framework is to use cluster bootstrap to provide robust statistics for single
input features in both domains. We applied CLUB-PLS to investigating the
genetic basis of surface area and cortical thickness in a sample of 33,000
subjects from the UK Biobank. We found 107 genome-wide significant
locus-phenotype pairs that are linked to 386 different genes. We found that a
vast majority of these loci could be technically validated at a high rate:
using classic GWAS or Genome-Wide Inferred Statistics (GWIS) we found that 85
locus-phenotype pairs exceeded the genome-wide suggestive (P<1e-05) threshold.]]></summary>

sleep stages plays a fundamental role in diagnosing sleep disorders, monitoring
treatment effectiveness, and understanding the relationship between sleep

these stages can significantly enhance our understanding of sleep-related
phenomena and ultimately lead to improved health outcomes and disease
treatment.

Models others propose are often time-consuming and lack sufficient accuracy,
especially in stage N1. The main objective of this research is to present a
machine-learning model called "EEGMobile". This model utilizes pre-trained
models and learns from electroencephalogram (EEG) spectrograms of brain
signals. The model achieved an accuracy of 86.97% on a publicly available
dataset named "Sleep-EDF20", outperforming other models proposed by different
researchers. Moreover, it recorded an accuracy of 56.4% in stage N1, which is
better than other models. These findings demonstrate that this model has the
potential to achieve better results for the treatment of this disease.]]></summary>

global score functions. However, if local variables have direct and indirect
dependence simultaneously, the global optimization on score functions misses
edges between variables with indirect dependent relationship, of which scores
are smaller than those with direct dependent relationship. In this paper, we
present an identifiability condition based on a determined subset of parents to
identify the underlying DAG. By the identifiability condition, we develop a
two-phase algorithm namely optimal-tuning (OT) algorithm to locally amend the
global optimization. In the optimal phase, an optimization problem based on
first-order Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) gives an estimated
skeleton as the initial determined parents subset. In the tuning phase, the
skeleton is locally tuned by deletion, addition and DAG-formalization
strategies using the theoretically proved incremental properties of high-order
HSIC. Numerical experiments for different synthetic datasets and real-world
datasets show that the OT algorithm outperforms existing methods. Especially in
Sigmoid Mix model with the size of the graph being ${\rm\bf d=40}$, the
structure intervention distance (SID) of the OT algorithm is 329.7 smaller than
the one obtained by CAM, which indicates that the graph estimated by the OT
algorithm misses fewer edges compared with CAM.Source code of the OT algorithm

computationally challenging task for social network analysis, due to its NP-
hard nature. Most current approximation or heuristic methods either require
tremendous human design efforts or achieve unsatisfying balances between
effectiveness and efficiency. Recent machine learning attempts only focus on
speed but lack performance enhancement. In this paper, different from previous
attempts, we propose an effective deep reinforcement learning model that
achieves superior performances over traditional best influence maximization
algorithms. Specifically, we design an end-to-end learning framework that
combines graph neural network as the encoder and reinforcement learning as the
decoder, named DREIM. Trough extensive training on small synthetic graphs,
DREIM outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods on very large synthetic
and real-world networks on solution quality, and we also empirically show its
linear scalability with regard to the network size, which demonstrates its
superiority in solving this problem.]]></summary>

our lives. Accurate classification of sleep stages serves as a crucial tool for
evaluating sleep quality and identifying probable sleep disorders. This work
introduces a novel methodology that utilises a SE-Resnet-Bi-LSTM architecture
to classify sleep into five separate stages. The classification process is
based on the analysis of single-channel electroencephalograms (EEGs). The
framework that has been suggested consists of two fundamental elements: a
feature extractor that utilises SE-ResNet, and a temporal context encoder that
use stacks of Bi-LSTM units.The effectiveness of our approach is substantiated
by thorough assessments conducted on three different datasets, namely
SLeepEDF-20, SleepEDF-78, and SHHS. Significantly, our methodology attains
notable levels of accuracy, specifically 87.5\%, 83.9\%, and 87.8\%, along with
macro-F1 scores of 82.5, 78.9, and 81.9 for the corresponding datasets.
Notably, we introduce the utilization of 1D-GradCAM visualization to shed light
on the decision-making process of our model in the realm of sleep stage
classification. This visualization method not only provides valuable insights
into the model's classification rationale but also aligns its outcomes with the
annotations made by sleep experts. One notable feature of our research is the
integration of an expedited training approach, which effectively preserves the
model's resilience in terms of performance. The experimental evaluations
conducted provide a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of our
proposed model in comparison to existing approaches, highlighting its potential

requires skilled content creators. There have been impressive improvements in
using machine learning to address different aspects of generating 3D content,
such as generating meshes, arranging geometry, synthesizing textures, etc. In
this paper we develop a model to generate Bidirectional Reflectance
Distribution Functions (BRDFs) from descriptive textual prompts. BRDFs are four
dimensional probability distributions that characterize the interaction of
light with surface materials. They are either represented parametrically, or by
tabulating the probability density associated with every pair of incident and
outgoing angles. The former lends itself to artistic editing while the latter
is used when measuring the appearance of real materials. Numerous works have
focused on hypothesizing BRDF models from images of materials. We learn a
mapping from textual descriptions of materials to parametric BRDFs. Our model
is first trained using a semi-supervised approach before being tuned via an
unsupervised scheme. Although our model is general, in this paper we
specifically generate parameters for MDL materials, conditioned on natural
language descriptions, within NVIDIA's Omniverse platform. This enables use
cases such as real-time text prompts to change materials of objects in 3D
environments such as "dull plastic" or "shiny iron". Since the output of our
model is a parametric BRDF, rather than an image of the material, it may be
used to render materials using any shape under arbitrarily specified viewing

prevails to deliver high-performance task-specific models and can even learn
general task-agnostic representations for efficient finetuning to downstream
tasks. However, deep learning in resource-limited domains still faces multiple
challenges including (i) limited data, (ii) constrained model development cost,
and (iii) lack of adequate pre-trained models for effective finetuning. This
paper provides an overview of model reprogramming to bridge this gap. Model
reprogramming enables resource-efficient cross-domain machine learning by
repurposing and reusing a well-developed pre-trained model from a source domain
to solve tasks in a target domain without model finetuning, where the source
and target domains can be vastly different. In many applications, model
reprogramming outperforms transfer learning and training from scratch. This
paper elucidates the methodology of model reprogramming, summarizes existing
use cases, provides a theoretical explanation of the success of model
reprogramming, and concludes with a discussion on open-ended research questions
and opportunities. A list of model reprogramming studies is actively maintained

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The discovery of governing equations from data has been an active field of
research for decades. One widely used methodology for this purpose is sparse
regression for nonlinear dynamics, known as SINDy. Despite several attempts,
noisy and scarce data still pose a severe challenge to the success of the SINDy
approach. In this work, we discuss a robust method to discover nonlinear
governing equations from noisy and scarce data. To do this, we make use of
neural networks to learn an implicit representation based on measurement data
so that not only it produces the output in the vicinity of the measurements but
also the time-evolution of output can be described by a dynamical system.
Additionally, we learn such a dynamic system in the spirit of the SINDy
framework. Leveraging the implicit representation using neural networks, we
obtain the derivative information -- required for SINDy -- using an automatic
differentiation tool. To enhance the robustness of our methodology, we further
incorporate an integral condition on the output of the implicit networks.
Furthermore, we extend our methodology to handle data collected from multiple
initial conditions. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methodology
to discover governing equations under noisy and scarce data regimes by means of
several examples and compare its performance with existing methods.]]></summary>

event-driven neural dynamics whose energy consumption depends on the number of
spikes exchanged between neurons over the course of the input presentation. In
typical implementations of an SNN classifier, decisions are produced after the
entire input sequence has been processed, resulting in latency and energy
consumption levels that are fairly uniform across inputs. Recently introduced
delay-adaptive SNNs tailor the inference latency -- and, with it, the energy
consumption -- to the difficulty of each example, by producing an early
decision when the SNN model is sufficiently ``confident''. In this paper, we
start by observing that, as an SNN processes input samples, its classification
decisions tend to be first under-confident and then over-confident with respect
to the decision's ground-truth, unknown, test accuracy. This makes it difficult
to determine a stopping time that ensures a desired level of accuracy. To
address this problem, we introduce a novel delay-adaptive SNN-based inference
methodology that, wrapping around any pre-trained SNN classifier, provides
guaranteed reliability for the decisions produced at input-dependent stopping
times. The approach entails minimal added complexity as compared to the
underlying SNN, requiring only thresholding and counting operations at run
time, and it leverages tools from conformal prediction (CP).]]></summary>

advancements in allowing Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason through
foresight and backtracking for global decision-making, it has overlooked the
inherent local uncertainties in intermediate decision points or "thoughts".
These local uncertainties, intrinsic to LLMs given their potential for diverse
responses, remain a significant concern in the reasoning process. Addressing
this pivotal gap, we introduce the Tree of Uncertain Thoughts (TouT) - a
reasoning framework tailored for LLMs. Our TouT effectively leverages Monte
Carlo Dropout to quantify uncertainty scores associated with LLMs' diverse
local responses at these intermediate steps. By marrying this local uncertainty
quantification with global search algorithms, TouT enhances the model's
precision in response generation. We substantiate our approach with rigorous
experiments on two demanding planning tasks: Game of 24 and Mini Crosswords.
The empirical evidence underscores TouT's superiority over both ToT and
chain-of-thought prompting methods.]]></summary>

equivariant with respect to a fixed type of transformation, namely translations
in the state space. We then use an entropy regularizer to increase the
equivariant set and augment the dataset with the resulting transformed samples.
Finally, we learn a new policy offline based on the augmented dataset, with an

attacks, but are often tailored to one type of model or attack. The lack of
information on unknown potential attacks makes detecting adversarial examples
challenging. Additionally, attackers do not need to follow the rules made by
the defender. To address this problem, we take inspiration from the concept of
Applicability Domain in cheminformatics. Cheminformatics models struggle to
make accurate predictions because only a limited number of compounds are known
and available for training. Applicability Domain defines a domain based on the
known compounds and rejects any unknown compound that falls outside the domain.
Similarly, adversarial examples start as harmless inputs, but can be
manipulated to evade reliable classification by moving outside the domain of
the classifier. We are the first to identify the similarity between
Applicability Domain and adversarial detection. Instead of focusing on unknown
attacks, we focus on what is known, the training data. We propose a simple yet
robust triple-stage data-driven framework that checks the input globally and
locally, and confirms that they are coherent with the model's output. This
framework can be applied to any classification model and is not limited to
specific attacks. We demonstrate these three stages work as one unit,
effectively detecting various attacks, even for a white-box scenario.]]></summary>

well as methodological extensions for accommodating black-box constraints and
multi-fidelity information sources. We test the proposed framework against

remains a significant challenge, especially when encountering noisy
observations and no prior knowledge available. This study proposes R-DISCOVER,
a framework designed to robustly uncover open-form partial differential
equations (PDEs) from limited and noisy data. The framework operates through
two alternating update processes: discovering and embedding. The discovering
phase employs symbolic representation and a reinforcement learning (RL)-guided
hybrid PDE generator to efficiently produce diverse open-form PDEs with tree
structures. A neural network-based predictive model fits the system response
and serves as the reward evaluator for the generated PDEs. PDEs with superior
fits are utilized to iteratively optimize the generator via the RL method and
the best-performing PDE is selected by a parameter-free stability metric. The
embedding phase integrates the initially identified PDE from the discovering
process as a physical constraint into the predictive model for robust training.
The traversal of PDE trees automates the construction of the computational
graph and the embedding process without human intervention. Numerical
experiments demonstrate our framework's capability to uncover governing

in various vision-related tasks. The success of ViTs motivates adversaries to
perform backdoor attacks on ViTs. Although the vulnerability of traditional
CNNs to backdoor attacks is well-known, backdoor attacks on ViTs are
seldom-studied. Compared to CNNs capturing pixel-wise local features by
convolutions, ViTs extract global context information through patches and
attentions. Na\"ively transplanting CNN-specific backdoor attacks to ViTs
yields only a low clean data accuracy and a low attack success rate. In this
paper, we propose a stealth and practical ViT-specific backdoor attack
$TrojViT$. Rather than an area-wise trigger used by CNN-specific backdoor
attacks, TrojViT generates a patch-wise trigger designed to build a Trojan
composed of some vulnerable bits on the parameters of a ViT stored in DRAM
memory through patch salience ranking and attention-target loss. TrojViT
further uses minimum-tuned parameter update to reduce the bit number of the
Trojan. Once the attacker inserts the Trojan into the ViT model by flipping the
vulnerable bits, the ViT model still produces normal inference accuracy with
benign inputs. But when the attacker embeds a trigger into an input, the ViT
model is forced to classify the input to a predefined target class. We show
that flipping only few vulnerable bits identified by TrojViT on a ViT model
using the well-known RowHammer can transform the model into a backdoored one.
We perform extensive experiments of multiple datasets on various ViT models.
TrojViT can classify $99.64\%$ of test images to a target class by flipping
$345$ bits on a ViT for ImageNet.Our codes are available at

network control algorithms as one of its core capabilities. Data-driven
applications incorporate such algorithms to optimize radio access network (RAN)
functions via RAN intelligent controllers (RICs). Deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) algorithms are among the main approaches adopted in the O-RAN literature
to solve dynamic radio resource management problems. However, despite the
benefits introduced by the O-RAN RICs, the practical adoption of DRL algorithms
in real network deployments falls behind. This is primarily due to the slow
convergence and unstable performance exhibited by DRL agents upon deployment
and when facing previously unseen network conditions. In this paper, we address
these challenges by proposing transfer learning (TL) as a core component of the
training and deployment workflows for the DRL-based closed-loop control of
O-RAN functionalities. To this end, we propose and design a hybrid TL-aided
approach that leverages the advantages of both policy reuse and distillation TL
methods to provide safe and accelerated convergence in DRL-based O-RAN slicing.
We conduct a thorough experiment that accommodates multiple services, including
real VR gaming traffic to reflect practical scenarios of O-RAN slicing. We also
propose and implement policy reuse and distillation-aided DRL and non-TL-aided
DRL as three separate baselines. The proposed hybrid approach shows at least:
7.7% and 20.7% improvements in the average initial reward value and the
percentage of converged scenarios, and a 64.6% decrease in reward variance
while maintaining fast convergence and enhancing the generalizability compared
with the baselines.]]></summary>

learning: Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA) and Dataset Distillation (DD).
On the one hand, the first considers adapting multiple heterogeneous labeled
source domains to an unlabeled target domain. On the other hand, the second
attacks the problem of synthesizing a small summary containing all the
information about the datasets. We thus consider a new problem called MSDA-DD.
To solve it, we adapt previous works in the MSDA literature, such as
Wasserstein Barycenter Transport and Dataset Dictionary Learning, as well as DD
method Distribution Matching. We thoroughly experiment with this novel problem
on four benchmarks (Caltech-Office 10, Tennessee-Eastman Process, Continuous
Stirred Tank Reactor, and Case Western Reserve University), where we show that,
even with as little as 1 sample per class, one achieves state-of-the-art
adaptation performance.]]></summary>

systems makes it hard to decide what architecture and algorithm to use for a
given problem. In science and engineering, modeling is a methodology used to
understand complex systems whose internal processes are opaque. Modeling
replaces a complex system with a simpler, more interpretable surrogate. Drawing
inspiration from this, we construct a class of surrogate models for neural
networks using Gaussian processes. Rather than deriving kernels for infinite
neural networks, we learn kernels empirically from the naturalistic behavior of
finite neural networks. We demonstrate our approach captures existing phenomena
related to the spectral bias of neural networks, and then show that our
surrogate models can be used to solve practical problems such as identifying
which points most influence the behavior of specific neural networks and
predicting which architectures and algorithms will generalize well for specific

mixture without prior knowledge of the sources or the mixing system. This is a
challenging problem that often requires making restrictive assumptions about
both the mixing system and the sources. In this paper, we propose a novel
method for addressing BSS of non-linear mixtures by leveraging the natural
feature subspace specialization ability of multi-encoder autoencoders with
fully self-supervised learning without strong priors. During the training
phase, our method unmixes the input into the separate encoding spaces of the
multi-encoder network and then remixes these representations within the decoder
for a reconstruction of the input. Then to perform source inference, we
introduce a novel encoding masking technique whereby masking out all but one of
the encodings enables the decoder to estimate a source signal. To this end, we
also introduce a so-called pathway separation loss that encourages sparsity
between the unmixed encoding spaces throughout the decoder's layers and a
so-called zero reconstruction loss on the decoder for coherent source
estimations. In order to carefully evaluate our method, we conduct experiments
on a toy dataset and with real-world biosignal recordings from a
polysomnography sleep study for extracting respiration.]]></summary>

experimental data will speed up the pace of scientific discovery. Previous
randomized algorithms exploit sparsity in PDE updates for acceleration. However
such methods are applicable to a limited class of decomposable PDEs, which have
sparse features in the value domain. We propose Reel, which accelerates the
learning of PDEs via random projection and has much broader applicability. Reel
exploits the sparsity by decomposing dense updates into sparse ones in both the
value and frequency domains. This decomposition enables efficient learning when
the source of the updates consists of gradually changing terms across large
areas (sparse in the frequency domain) in addition to a few rapid updates
concentrated in a small set of "interfacial" regions (sparse in the value
domain). Random projection is then applied to compress the sparse signals for
learning. To expand the model applicability, Taylor series expansion is used in
Reel to approximate the nonlinear PDE updates with polynomials in the
decomposable form. Theoretically, we derive a constant factor approximation
between the projected loss function and the original one with poly-logarithmic
number of projected dimensions. Experimentally, we provide empirical evidence
that our proposed Reel can lead to faster learning of PDE models (70-98%
reduction in training time when the data is compressed to 1% of its original

genomic studies to identify differentially expressed genes. However, due to
unmeasured confounders, many standard statistical approaches may be
substantially biased. This paper investigates the large-scale hypothesis
testing problem for multivariate generalized linear models in the presence of
confounding effects. Under arbitrary confounding mechanisms, we propose a
unified statistical estimation and inference framework that harnesses
orthogonal structures and integrates linear projections into three key stages.
It first leverages multivariate responses to separate marginal and uncorrelated
confounding effects, recovering the confounding coefficients' column space.
Subsequently, latent factors and primary effects are jointly estimated,
utilizing $\ell_1$-regularization for sparsity while imposing orthogonality
onto confounding coefficients. Finally, we incorporate projected and weighted
bias-correction steps for hypothesis testing. Theoretically, we establish
various effects' identification conditions and non-asymptotic error bounds. We
show effective Type-I error control of asymptotic $z$-tests as sample and
response sizes approach infinity. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method controls the false discovery rate by the Benjamini-Hochberg
procedure and is more powerful than alternative methods. By comparing
single-cell RNA-seq counts from two groups of samples, we demonstrate the
suitability of adjusting confounding effects when significant covariates are
absent from the model.]]></summary>

learning works through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) [jgh18], a kernel method
that is equivalent to using gradient descent to train a multi-layer
infinitely-wide neural network. NTK is a major step forward in the theoretical
deep learning because it allows researchers to use traditional mathematical
tools to analyze properties of deep neural networks and to explain various
neural network techniques from a theoretical view. A natural extension of NTK
on graph learning is \textit{Graph Neural Tangent Kernel (GNTK)}, and
researchers have already provide GNTK formulation for graph-level regression
and show empirically that this kernel method can achieve similar accuracy as
GNNs on various bioinformatics datasets [dhs+19]. The remaining question now is
whether solving GNTK regression is equivalent to training an infinite-wide
multi-layer GNN using gradient descent. In this paper, we provide three new
theoretical results. First, we formally prove this equivalence for graph-level

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper investigates a challenging problem of zero-shot learning in the
multi-label scenario (MLZSL), wherein, the model is trained to recognize
multiple unseen classes within a sample (e.g., an image) based on seen classes
and auxiliary knowledge, e.g., semantic information. Existing methods usually
resort to analyzing the relationship of various seen classes residing in a
sample from the dimension of spatial or semantic characteristics, and transfer
the learned model to unseen ones. But they ignore the effective integration of
local and global features. That is, in the process of inferring unseen classes,
global features represent the principal direction of the image in the feature
space, while local features should maintain uniqueness within a certain range.
This integrated neglect will make the model lose its grasp of the main
components of the image. Relying only on the local existence of seen classes
during the inference stage introduces unavoidable bias. In this paper, we
propose a novel and effective group bi-enhancement framework for MLZSL, dubbed
GBE-MLZSL, to fully make use of such properties and enable a more accurate and
robust visual-semantic projection. Specifically, we split the feature maps into
several feature groups, of which each feature group can be trained
independently with the Local Information Distinguishing Module (LID) to ensure
uniqueness. Meanwhile, a Global Enhancement Module (GEM) is designed to
preserve the principal direction. Besides, a static graph structure is designed
to construct the correlation of local features. Experiments on large-scale
MLZSL benchmark datasets NUS-WIDE and Open-Images-v4 demonstrate that the
proposed GBE-MLZSL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods with large
margins.]]></summary>

multi-modal understanding and execution capabilities. To achieve this, we have
made the following efforts: (i) We craft a large-scale embodied planning
dataset, termed EgoCOT. The dataset consists of carefully selected videos from
the Ego4D dataset, along with corresponding high-quality language instructions.
Specifically, we generate a sequence of sub-goals with the "Chain of Thoughts"
mode for effective embodied planning. (ii) We introduce an efficient training
approach to EmbodiedGPT for high-quality plan generation, by adapting a 7B
large language model (LLM) to the EgoCOT dataset via prefix tuning. (iii) We
introduce a paradigm for extracting task-related features from LLM-generated
planning queries to form a closed loop between high-level planning and
low-level control. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of EmbodiedGPT
on embodied tasks, including embodied planning, embodied control, visual
captioning, and visual question answering. Notably, EmbodiedGPT significantly
enhances the success rate of the embodied control task by extracting more

individuals globally, and continuous monitoring coupled with automated seizure
detection appears as a necessity for effective patient treatment. To enable
long-term care in daily-life conditions, comfortable and smart wearable devices
with long battery life are required, which in turn set the demand for
resource-constrained and energy-efficient computing solutions. In this context,
the development of machine learning algorithms for seizure detection faces the
challenge of heavily imbalanced datasets. This paper introduces EpiDeNet, a new
lightweight seizure detection network, and Sensitivity-Specificity Weighted
Cross-Entropy (SSWCE), a new loss function that incorporates sensitivity and
specificity, to address the challenge of heavily unbalanced datasets. The
proposed EpiDeNet-SSWCE approach demonstrates the successful detection of
91.16% and 92.00% seizure events on two different datasets (CHB-MIT and
PEDESITE, respectively), with only four EEG channels. A three-window majority
voting-based smoothing scheme combined with the SSWCE loss achieves 3x
reduction of false positives to 1.18 FP/h. EpiDeNet is well suited for
implementation on low-power embedded platforms, and we evaluate its performance
on two ARM Cortex-based platforms (M4F/M7) and two parallel ultra-low power
(PULP) systems (GAP8, GAP9). The most efficient implementation (GAP9) achieves
an energy efficiency of 40 GMAC/s/W, with an energy consumption per inference
of only 0.051 mJ at high performance (726.46 MMAC/s), outperforming the best
ARM Cortex-based solutions by approximately 160x in energy efficiency. The
EpiDeNet-SSWCE method demonstrates effective and accurate seizure detection
performance on heavily imbalanced datasets, while being suited for

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The widespread integration of Internet of Things (IoT) devices across all
facets of life has ushered in an era of interconnectedness, creating new
avenues for cybersecurity challenges and underscoring the need for robust
intrusion detection systems. However, traditional security systems are designed
with a closed-world perspective and often face challenges in dealing with the
ever-evolving threat landscape, where new and unfamiliar attacks are constantly
emerging. In this paper, we introduce a framework aimed at mitigating the open
set recognition (OSR) problem in the realm of Network Intrusion Detection
Systems (NIDS) tailored for IoT environments. Our framework capitalizes on
image-based representations of packet-level data, extracting spatial and
temporal patterns from network traffic. Additionally, we integrate stacking and
sub-clustering techniques, enabling the identification of unknown attacks by
effectively modeling the complex and diverse nature of benign behavior. The
empirical results prominently underscore the framework's efficacy, boasting an
impressive 88\% detection rate for previously unseen attacks when compared
against existing approaches and recent advancements. Future work will perform
extensive experimentation across various openness levels and attack scenarios,
further strengthening the adaptability and performance of our proposed solution
in safeguarding IoT environments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In many randomized experiments, the treatment effect of the long-term metric
(i.e. the primary outcome of interest) is often difficult or infeasible to
measure. Such long-term metrics are often slow to react to changes and
sufficiently noisy they are challenging to faithfully estimate in short-horizon
experiments. A common alternative is to measure several short-term proxy
metrics in the hope they closely track the long-term metric -- so they can be
used to effectively guide decision-making in the near-term. We introduce a new
statistical framework to both define and construct an optimal proxy metric for
use in a homogeneous population of randomized experiments. Our procedure first
reduces the construction of an optimal proxy metric in a given experiment to a
portfolio optimization problem which depends on the true latent treatment
effects and noise level of experiment under consideration. We then denoise the
observed treatment effects of the long-term metric and a set of proxies in a
historical corpus of randomized experiments to extract estimates of the latent
treatment effects for use in the optimization problem. One key insight derived
from our approach is that the optimal proxy metric for a given experiment is
not apriori fixed; rather it should depend on the sample size (or effective
noise level) of the randomized experiment for which it is deployed. To
instantiate and evaluate our framework, we employ our methodology in a large
corpus of randomized experiments from an industrial recommendation system and
construct proxy metrics that perform favorably relative to several baselines.]]></summary>

convolution has been applied in a wide range of fields such as traffic flow
prediction. However, current popular works of graph convolution cannot
guarantee spatio-temporal consistency in a long period. The ignorance of
correlational dynamics, convolutional locality and temporal comprehensiveness
would limit predictive accuracy. In this paper, a novel Attention-based Dynamic
Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (ADGCRNN) is proposed to improve
traffic flow prediction in highway transportation. Three temporal resolutions
of data sequence are effectively integrated by self-attention to extract
characteristics; multi-dynamic graphs and their weights are dynamically created
to compliantly combine the varying characteristics; a dedicated gated kernel
emphasizing highly relative nodes is introduced on these complete graphs to
reduce overfitting for graph convolution operations. Experiments on two public
datasets show our work better than state-of-the-art baselines, and case studies
of a real Web system prove practical benefit in highway transportation.]]></summary>

extracting surface electromyographic (sEMG) activity from eight electrodes in a
wrist-band configuration. sEMG data were streamed into a machine-learning

calibration, participants were presented with one of three types of feedback
during a human-learning stage: veridical feedback, in which predicted
probabilities from the gesture classification algorithm were displayed without
alteration, modified feedback, in which we applied a hidden augmentation of
error to these probabilities, and no feedback. User performance was then
evaluated in a series of minigames, in which subjects were required to use
eight gestures to manipulate their game avatar to complete a task. Experimental
results indicated that, relative to baseline, the modified feedback condition
led to significantly improved accuracy and improved gesture class separation.
These findings suggest that real-time feedback in a gamified user interface

take treatment, so that optimal policy rules are merely suggestions in the
presence of human non-adherence to treatment recommendations. In these same
domains, there may be heterogeneity both in who responds in taking-up
treatment, and heterogeneity in treatment efficacy. While optimal treatment
rules can maximize causal outcomes across the population, access parity
constraints or other fairness considerations can be relevant in the case of
encouragement. For example, in social services, a persistent puzzle is the gap
in take-up of beneficial services among those who may benefit from them the
most. When in addition the decision-maker has distributional preferences over
both access and average outcomes, the optimal decision rule changes. We study
causal identification, statistical variance-reduced estimation, and robust
estimation of optimal treatment rules, including under potential violations of
positivity. We consider fairness constraints such as demographic parity in
treatment take-up, and other constraints, via constrained optimization. Our
framework can be extended to handle algorithmic recommendations under an
often-reasonable covariate-conditional exclusion restriction, using our
robustness checks for lack of positivity in the recommendation. We develop a
two-stage algorithm for solving over parametrized policy classes under general
constraints to obtain variance-sensitive regret bounds. We illustrate the
methods in two case studies based on data from randomized encouragement to
enroll in insurance and from pretrial supervised release with electronic

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clustering high-dimensional spatiotemporal data using an unsupervised
approach is a challenging problem for many data-driven applications. Existing
state-of-the-art methods for unsupervised clustering use different similarity
and distance functions but focus on either spatial or temporal features of the
data. Concentrating on joint deep representation learning of spatial and
temporal features, we propose Deep Spatiotemporal Clustering (DSC), a novel
algorithm for the temporal clustering of high-dimensional spatiotemporal data
using an unsupervised deep learning method. Inspired by the U-net architecture,
DSC utilizes an autoencoder integrating CNN-RNN layers to learn latent
representations of the spatiotemporal data. DSC also includes a unique layer
for cluster assignment on latent representations that uses the Student's
t-distribution. By optimizing the clustering loss and data reconstruction loss
simultaneously, the algorithm gradually improves clustering assignments and the
nonlinear mapping between low-dimensional latent feature space and
high-dimensional original data space. A multivariate spatiotemporal climate
dataset is used to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method. Our extensive
experiments show our approach outperforms both conventional and deep
learning-based unsupervised clustering algorithms. Additionally, we compared
the proposed model with its various variants (CNN encoder, CNN autoencoder,
CNN-RNN encoder, CNN-RNN autoencoder, etc.) to get insight into using both the
CNN and RNN layers in the autoencoder, and our proposed technique outperforms
these variants in terms of clustering results.]]></summary>

process by sequence models. This problem results in insufficient precision of
the prediction. Therefore, a short-term load forecasting method based on
convolutional neural network (CNN), self-attention encoder-decoder network
(SAEDN) and residual-refinement (Res) is proposed. In this method, feature
extraction module is composed of a two-dimensional convolutional neural
network, which is used to mine the local correlation between data and obtain
high-dimensional data features. The initial load fore-casting module consists
of a self-attention encoder-decoder network and a feedforward neural network
(FFN). The module utilizes self-attention mechanisms to encode high-dimensional
features. This operation can obtain the global correlation between data.
Therefore, the model is able to retain important information based on the
coupling relationship between the data in data mixed with non-time series
factors. Then, self-attention decoding is per-formed and the feedforward neural
network is used to regression initial load. This paper introduces the residual
mechanism to build the load optimization module. The module generates residual
load values to optimize the initial load. The simulation results show that the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basecalling is an essential step in nanopore sequencing analysis where the
raw signals of nanopore sequencers are converted into nucleotide sequences,
i.e., reads. State-of-the-art basecallers employ complex deep learning models
to achieve high basecalling accuracy. This makes basecalling
computationally-inefficient and memory-hungry; bottlenecking the entire genome
analysis pipeline. However, for many applications, the majority of reads do no
match the reference genome of interest (i.e., target reference) and thus are
discarded in later steps in the genomics pipeline, wasting the basecalling
computation. To overcome this issue, we propose TargetCall, the first
pre-basecalling filter to eliminate the wasted computation in basecalling.
TargetCall's key idea is to discard reads that will not match the target
reference (i.e., off-target reads) prior to basecalling. TargetCall consists of
two main components: (1) LightCall, a lightweight neural network basecaller
that produces noisy reads; and (2) Similarity Check, which labels each of these
noisy reads as on-target or off-target by matching them to the target
reference. TargetCall aims to filter out all off-target reads before
basecalling. The highly-accurate but slow basecalling is performed only on the
raw signals whose noisy reads are labeled as on-target. Our thorough
experimental evaluations using both real and simulated data show that
TargetCall 1) improves the end-to-end basecalling performance while maintaining
high sensitivity in keeping on-target reads, 2) maintains high accuracy in
downstream analysis, 3) precisely filters out up to 94.71% of off-target reads,
and 4) achieves better performance, throughput, sensitivity, precision, and
generality compared to prior works. We open-source TargetCall at

efficiently learn a rich representation of the input. However, for adapting to
downstream tasks, they require a sufficient amount of labeled data since their
rich features code not only objects but also less relevant image background. In
contrast, Instance Discrimination (ID) methods focus on objects. In this work,
we study how to combine the efficiency and scalability of MIM with the ability
of ID to perform downstream classification in the absence of large amounts of
labeled data. To this end, we introduce Masked Autoencoder Contrastive Tuning
(MAE-CT), a sequential approach that utilizes the implicit clustering of the
Nearest Neighbor Contrastive Learning (NNCLR) objective to induce abstraction
in the topmost layers of a pre-trained MAE. MAE-CT tunes the rich features such
that they form semantic clusters of objects without using any labels. Notably,
MAE-CT does not rely on hand-crafted augmentations and frequently achieves its
best performances while using only minimal augmentations (crop & flip).
Further, MAE-CT is compute efficient as it requires at most 10% overhead
compared to MAE re-training. Applied to large and huge Vision Transformer (ViT)
models, MAE-CT excels over previous self-supervised methods trained on ImageNet
in linear probing, k-NN and low-shot classification accuracy as well as in
unsupervised clustering accuracy. With ViT-H/16 MAE-CT achieves a new

optimisation space to run efficiently. In geometric quantum machine learning,
one achieves this by encoding group structure into parameterised quantum
circuits to include the symmetries of a problem as an inductive bias. However,
constructing such circuits is challenging as a concrete guiding principle has
yet to emerge. In this paper, we propose the use of spin networks, a form of
directed tensor network invariant under a group transformation, to devise SU(2)
equivariant quantum circuit ans\"atze -- circuits possessing spin rotation
symmetry. By changing to the basis that block diagonalises SU(2) group action,
these networks provide a natural building block for constructing parameterised
equivariant quantum circuits. We prove that our construction is mathematically
equivalent to other known constructions, such as those based on twirling and
generalised permutations, but more direct to implement on quantum hardware. The
efficacy of our constructed circuits is tested by solving the ground state
problem of SU(2) symmetric Heisenberg models on the one-dimensional triangular
lattice and on the Kagome lattice. Our results highlight that our equivariant
circuits boost the performance of quantum variational algorithms, indicating

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meteorological radar reflectivity data (i.e. radar echo) significantly
influences precipitation prediction. It can facilitate accurate and expeditious
forecasting of short-term heavy rainfall bypassing the need for complex
Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models. In comparison to conventional
models, Deep Learning (DL)-based radar echo extrapolation algorithms exhibit
higher effectiveness and efficiency. Nevertheless, the development of reliable
and generalized echo extrapolation algorithm is impeded by three primary
challenges: cumulative error spreading, imprecise representation of sparsely
distributed echoes, and inaccurate description of non-stationary motion
processes. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel radar echo
extrapolation algorithm called Temporal-Spatial Parallel Transformer, referred
to as TempEE. TempEE avoids using auto-regression and instead employs a
one-step forward strategy to prevent cumulative error spreading during the
extrapolation process. Additionally, we propose the incorporation of a
Multi-level Temporal-Spatial Attention mechanism to improve the algorithm's
capability of capturing both global and local information while emphasizing
task-related regions, including sparse echo representations, in an efficient
manner. Furthermore, the algorithm extracts spatio-temporal representations
from continuous echo images using a parallel encoder to model the
non-stationary motion process for echo extrapolation. The superiority of our
TempEE has been demonstrated in the context of the classic radar echo
extrapolation task, utilizing a real-world dataset. Extensive experiments have
further validated the efficacy and indispensability of various components
within TempEE.]]></summary>

Kaplan-Meier estimator (also known as the Beran estimator) consistently
estimates the conditional survival function of the random follow-up for the

of whether each individual is censored or not, which may be incomplete in
practice. We therefore propose a study of the Beran estimator when the
censoring indicators are generic random variables and discuss necessary
conditions for the efficiency of the Beran estimator. From this, we provide a
new estimator for the conditional survival function with missing not at random

how the estimators work for small samples through a simulation study and show

increasingly popular in the field of recommender systems. Currently, two
state-of-the-art baselines are Transformer-based models SASRec and BERT4Rec.
Over the past few years, there have been quite a few publications comparing
these two algorithms and proposing new state-of-the-art models. In most of the
publications, BERT4Rec achieves better performance than SASRec. But BERT4Rec
uses cross-entropy over softmax for all items, while SASRec uses negative
sampling and calculates binary cross-entropy loss for one positive and one
negative item. In our work, we show that if both models are trained with the
same loss, which is used by BERT4Rec, then SASRec will significantly outperform
BERT4Rec both in terms of quality and training speed. In addition, we show that
SASRec could be effectively trained with negative sampling and still outperform

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Automatic static cost analysis infers information about the resources used by
programs without actually running them with concrete data, and presents such
information as functions of input data sizes. Most of the analysis tools for
logic programs (and other languages) are based on setting up recurrence
relations representing (bounds on) the computational cost of predicates, and
solving them to find closed-form functions that are equivalent to (or a bound
on) them. Such recurrence solving is a bottleneck in current tools: many of the
recurrences that arise during the analysis cannot be solved with current
solvers, such as Computer Algebra Systems (CASs), so that specific methods for
different classes of recurrences need to be developed. We address such a
challenge by developing a novel, general approach for solving arbitrary,
constrained recurrence relations, that uses machine-learning sparse regression
techniques to guess a candidate closed-form function, and a combination of an
SMT-solver and a CAS to check whether such function is actually a solution of
the recurrence. We have implemented a prototype and evaluated it with
recurrences generated by a cost analysis system (the one in CiaoPP). The
experimental results are quite promising, showing that our approach can find
closed-form solutions, in a reasonable time, for classes of recurrences that
cannot be solved by such a system, nor by current CASs.]]></summary>

encode the pertinent data invariances through simplicial neural networks and
devise augmentations that yield positive contrastive examples with suitable

similarity of their Hodge components to the anchor. By encouraging a stronger
separation among less similar instances, we obtain an embedding space that

However, current methods are strongly limited in terms of scalability on Noisy
Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we propose a novel
approach called the Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS) enhanced QSVM.
This is built upon our idea of utilizing the variational quantum linear solver
to solve system of linear equations of a least squares-SVM on a NISQ device.
The implementation of our approach is evaluated by an extensive series of
numerical experiments with the Iris dataset, which consists of three distinct
iris plant species. Based on this, we explore the practicality and
effectiveness of our algorithm by constructing a classifier capable of
classification in a feature space ranging from one to seven dimensions.
Furthermore, by strategically exploiting both classical and quantum computing
for various subroutines of our algorithm, we effectively mitigate practical
challenges associated with the implementation. These include significant
improvement in the trainability of the variational ansatz and notable
reductions in run-time for cost calculations. Based on the numerical
experiments, our approach exhibits the capability of identifying a separating
hyperplane in an 8-dimensional feature space. Moreover, it consistently
demonstrated strong performance across various instances with the same dataset.]]></summary>

performance of the algorithm alone, but recently more attention has been
focused on optimizing joint human-algorithm performance. Here, we analyze a
specific type of human-algorithm collaboration where the algorithm has access
to a set of $n$ items, and presents a subset of size $k$ to the human, who
selects a final item from among those $k$. This scenario could model content
recommendation, route planning, or any type of labeling task. Because both the
human and algorithm have imperfect, noisy information about the true ordering
of items, the key question is: which value of $k$ maximizes the probability
that the best item will be ultimately selected? For $k=1$, performance is
optimized by the algorithm acting alone, and for $k=n$ it is optimized by the
human acting alone. Surprisingly, we show that for multiple of noise models, it
is optimal to set $k \in [2, n-1]$ - that is, there are strict benefits to
collaborating, even when the human and algorithm have equal accuracy
separately. We demonstrate this theoretically for the Mallows model and
experimentally for the Random Utilities models of noisy permutations. However,
we show this pattern is reversed when the human is anchored on the algorithm's
presented ordering - the joint system always has strictly worse performance. We
extend these results to the case where the human and algorithm differ in their
accuracy levels, showing that there always exist regimes where a more accurate
agent would strictly benefit from collaborating with a less accurate one, but
these regimes are asymmetric between the human and the algorithm's accuracy.]]></summary>

domains, and methods based on machine learning have been widely adopted in the
field to monitor wear and spot defects before they lead to failures. Few
studies, however, have addressed the problem of censored data, in which failure
is not observed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to predict the time
to failure in ball bearings using survival analysis. First, we analyze bearing
data in the frequency domain and annotate when a bearing fails by comparing the
Kullback-Leibler divergence and the standard deviation between its break-in
frequency bins and its break-out frequency bins. Second, we train several
survival models to estimate the time to failure based on the annotated data and
covariates extracted from the time domain, such as skewness, kurtosis and
entropy. The models give a probabilistic prediction of risk over time and allow
us to compare the survival function between groups of bearings. We demonstrate
our approach on the XJTU and PRONOSTIA datasets. On XJTU, the best result is a
0.70 concordance-index and 0.21 integrated Brier score. On PRONOSTIA, the best
is a 0.76 concordance-index and 0.19 integrated Brier score. Our work motivates
further work on incorporating censored data in models for predictive

specific facets of human-object interactions, a comprehensive physics-based

approaches. Through a hierarchical framework, we first learn skill priors for
both body and hand movements in a decoupled setting. The generic skill priors
learn to decode a latent skill embedding into the motion of the underlying
part. A high-level policy then controls hand-object interactions in these
pretrained latent spaces, guided by task objectives of grasping and 3D target
trajectory following. It is trained using a novel reward function that combines
an adversarial style term with a task reward, encouraging natural motions while
fulfilling the task incentives. Our method successfully accomplishes the
complete interaction task, from approaching an object to grasping and
subsequent manipulation. We compare our approach against kinematics-based
baselines and show that it leads to more physically plausible motions.]]></summary>

techniques allows development of relatively complex monitoring systems in many
domains. Besides the traditional industrial domain, new application appears
also in biology and agriculture, where we could speak about the detection of
infections, parasites and weeds, but also about automated monitoring and early
warning systems. This is also connected with the introduction of the easily
accessible hardware and development kits such as Arduino, or RaspberryPi
family. In this paper, we survey 50 existing papers focusing on the methods of
automated beehive monitoring methods using the computer vision techniques,
particularly on the pollen and Varroa mite detection together with the bee
traffic monitoring. Such systems could also be used for the monitoring of the
honeybee colonies and for the inspection of their health state, which could
identify potentially dangerous states before the situation is critical, or to
better plan periodic bee colony inspections and therefore save significant
costs. Later, we also include analysis of the research trends in this
application field and we outline the possible direction of the new
explorations. Our paper is aimed also at veterinary and apidology professionals
and experts, who might not be familiar with machine learning to introduce them
to its possibilities, therefore each family of applications is opened by a
brief theoretical introduction and motivation related to its base method. We
hope that this paper will inspire other scientists to use machine learning
techniques for other applications in beehive monitoring.]]></summary>

unobserved confounders. Sensitivity analysis methods are commonly used to
estimate the policy value under the worst-case confounding over a given
uncertainty set. However, existing work often resorts to some coarse relaxation
of the uncertainty set for the sake of tractability, leading to overly
conservative estimation of the policy value. In this paper, we propose a
general estimator that provides a sharp lower bound of the policy value. It can
be shown that our estimator contains the recently proposed sharp estimator by
Dorn and Guo (2022) as a special case, and our method enables a novel extension
of the classical marginal sensitivity model using f-divergence. To construct
our estimator, we leverage the kernel method to obtain a tractable
approximation to the conditional moment constraints, which traditional
non-sharp estimators failed to take into account. In the theoretical analysis,
we provide a condition for the choice of the kernel which guarantees no
specification error that biases the lower bound estimation. Furthermore, we
provide consistency guarantees of policy evaluation and learning. In the
experiments with synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.]]></summary>

EarthPT is a 700 million parameter decoding transformer foundation model

forecaster that can accurately predict future pixel-level surface reflectances
across the 400-2300 nm range well into the future. For example, forecasts of
the evolution of the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) have a
typical error of approximately 0.05 (over a natural range of -1 -> 1) at the
pixel level over a five month test set horizon, out-performing simple
phase-folded models based on historical averaging. We also demonstrate that
embeddings learnt by EarthPT hold semantically meaningful information and could
be exploited for downstream tasks such as highly granular, dynamic land use
classification. Excitingly, we note that the abundance of EO data provides us
with -- in theory -- quadrillions of training tokens. Therefore, if we assume
that EarthPT follows neural scaling laws akin to those derived for Large

technique, even a simple Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) achieves close to

the security and robustness of RL systems are worthy of more attention and
exploration. In particular, recent works have revealed that, in a multi-agent
RL environment, backdoor trigger actions can be injected into a victim agent
(a.k.a. Trojan agent), which can result in a catastrophic failure as soon as it
sees the backdoor trigger action. To ensure the security of RL agents against
malicious backdoors, in this work, we propose the problem of Backdoor Detection
in a multi-agent competitive reinforcement learning system, with the objective
of detecting Trojan agents as well as the corresponding potential trigger
actions, and further trying to mitigate their Trojan behavior. In order to
solve this problem, we propose PolicyCleanse that is based on the property that
the activated Trojan agents accumulated rewards degrade noticeably after
several timesteps. Along with PolicyCleanse, we also design a machine
unlearning-based approach that can effectively mitigate the detected backdoor.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods can accurately
detect Trojan agents, and outperform existing backdoor mitigation baseline
approaches by at least 3% in winning rate across various types of agents and
environments.]]></summary>

identically distributed (IID) data. They, on the other hand, suffer greatly
from heterogeneous environments, i.e., Non-IID data. Despite the fact that many
research projects have been done to address this issue, recent findings
indicate that they are still sub-optimal when compared to training on IID data.
In this work, we carefully analyze the existing methods in heterogeneous
environments. Interestingly, we find that regularizing the classifier's outputs
is quite effective in preventing performance degradation on Non-IID data.
Motivated by this, we propose Learning from Drift (LfD), a novel method for
effectively training the model in heterogeneous settings. Our scheme
encapsulates two key components: drift estimation and drift regularization.
Specifically, LfD first estimates how different the local model is from the
global model (i.e., drift). The local model is then regularized such that it
does not fall in the direction of the estimated drift. In the experiment, we
evaluate each method through the lens of the five aspects of federated
learning, i.e., Generalization, Heterogeneity, Scalability, Forgetting, and
Efficiency. Comprehensive evaluation results clearly support the superiority of
LfD in federated learning with Non-IID data.]]></summary>

Wearable device-based prediction models allow for continuous health monitoring

we first derived novel wearable-based features related to circadian rhythms,
ambient light exposure, physical activity levels, sleep, and signal processing.
Then, we quantified the ability of wearable-based machine-learning models to
predict poor cognition based on outcomes from the Digit Symbol Substitution
Test (DSST), the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimers Disease
Word-Learning subtest (CERAD-WL), and the Animal Fluency Test (AFT). We found
that the wearable-based models had significantly higher AUCs when predicting
all three cognitive outcomes compared to benchmark models containing age, sex,
education, marital status, household income, diabetic status, depression
symptoms, and functional independence scores. In addition to uncovering
previously unidentified wearable-based features that are predictive of poor
cognition such as the standard deviation of the midpoints of each persons most

proof-of-concept that wearable-based machine learning models can be used to

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A growing body of research has focused on the Reinforcement Learning (RL)
methods which allow the agent to learn from trial-and-error experiences
gathered during the interaction with the environment. Recently, offline RL
becomes a popular RL paradigm because it saves the interactions with
environments. In offline RL, data providers share large pre-collected datasets,
and others can train high-quality agents without interacting with the
environments. This paradigm has demonstrated effectiveness in critical tasks
like robot control, autonomous driving, etc. However, less attention is paid to
investigating the security threats to the offline RL system. This paper focuses
on backdoor attacks, where some perturbations are added to the data
(observations) such that given normal observations, the agent takes
high-rewards actions, and low-reward actions on observations injected with
triggers. In this paper, we propose Baffle (Backdoor Attack for Offline
Reinforcement Learning), an approach that automatically implants backdoors to
RL agents by poisoning the offline RL dataset, and evaluate how different
offline RL algorithms react to this attack. Our experiments conducted on four
tasks and four offline RL algorithms expose a disquieting fact: none of the
existing offline RL algorithms is immune to such a backdoor attack. Baffle
modifies $10\%$ of the datasets for four tasks. Agents trained on the poisoned
datasets perform well in normal settings. However, when triggers are presented,
the agents' performance decreases drastically by $63.2\%$, $53.9\%$, $64.7\%$,
and $47.4\%$ in the four tasks on average. The backdoor still persists after
fine-tuning poisoned agents on clean datasets. We further show that the
inserted backdoor is also hard to be detected by a popular defensive method.
This paper calls attention to developing more effective protection for the
open-source offline RL dataset.]]></summary>

systems makes it hard to decide what architecture and algorithm to use for a
given problem. In science and engineering, modeling is a methodology used to
understand complex systems whose internal processes are opaque. Modeling
replaces a complex system with a simpler, more interpretable surrogate. Drawing
inspiration from this, we construct a class of surrogate models for neural
networks using Gaussian processes. Rather than deriving kernels for infinite
neural networks, we learn kernels empirically from the naturalistic behavior of
finite neural networks. We demonstrate our approach captures existing phenomena
related to the spectral bias of neural networks, and then show that our
surrogate models can be used to solve practical problems such as identifying
which points most influence the behavior of specific neural networks and
predicting which architectures and algorithms will generalize well for specific
datasets.]]></summary>

to automation processes to support all the activities related to field
management. Service robotics plays a predominant role in this evolution by
deploying autonomous agents that can navigate fields while performing tasks
without human intervention, such as monitoring, spraying, and harvesting. To
execute these precise actions, mobile robots need a real-time perception system
that understands their surroundings and identifies their targets in the wild.
Generalizing to new crops and environmental conditions is critical for
practical applications, as labeled samples are rarely available. In this paper,
we investigate the problem of crop segmentation and propose a novel approach to
enhance domain generalization using knowledge distillation. In the proposed
framework, we transfer knowledge from an ensemble of models individually
trained on source domains to a student model that can adapt to unseen target
domains. To evaluate the proposed method, we present a synthetic multi-domain
dataset for crop segmentation containing plants of variegate shapes and
covering different terrain styles, weather conditions, and light scenarios for
more than 50,000 samples. We demonstrate significant improvements in
performance over state-of-the-art methods and superior sim-to-real
generalization. Our approach provides a promising solution for domain
generalization in crop segmentation and has the potential to enhance a wide
variety of precision agriculture applications.]]></summary>

\mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$ in $L^p(\mu)$ norm by sequentially querying its
values, for known compact real intervals $\mathcal{X}$, $\mathcal{Y}$ and a
known probability measure $\mu$ on $\cX$. For any function~$f$ we characterize
the minimum number of evaluations of $f$ that algorithms need to guarantee an
approximation $\hat{f}$ with an $L^p(\mu)$ error below $\epsilon$ after
stopping. Unlike worst-case results that hold uniformly over all $f$, our
complexity measure is dependent on each specific function $f$. To address this
problem, we introduce GreedyBox, a generalization of an algorithm originally
proposed by Novak (1992) for numerical integration. We prove that GreedyBox
achieves an optimal sample complexity for any function $f$, up to logarithmic
factors. Additionally, we uncover results regarding piecewise-smooth functions.
Perhaps as expected, the $L^p(\mu)$ error of GreedyBox decreases much faster
for piecewise-$C^2$ functions than predicted by the algorithm (without any
knowledge on the smoothness of $f$). A simple modification even achieves
optimal minimax approximation rates for such functions, which we compute
explicitly. In particular, our findings highlight multiple performance gaps
between adaptive and non-adaptive algorithms, smooth and piecewise-smooth
functions, as well as monotone or non-monotone functions. Finally, we provide
numerical experiments to support our theoretical results.]]></summary>

are distant in time from each other and from the final reward. These critical
steps are challenging to identify with traditional reinforcement learning (RL)
methods that rely on the Bellman equation for credit assignment. Here, we
present a new RL algorithm that uses offline contrastive learning to hone in on
critical steps. This algorithm, which we call contrastive introspection
(ConSpec), can be added to any existing RL algorithm. ConSpec learns a set of
prototypes for the critical steps in a task by a novel contrastive loss and
delivers an intrinsic reward when the current state matches one of these
prototypes. The prototypes in ConSpec provide two key benefits for credit
assignment: (1) They enable rapid identification of all the critical steps. (2)
They do so in a readily interpretable manner, enabling out-of-distribution
generalization when sensory features are altered. Distinct from other
contemporary RL approaches to credit assignment, ConSpec takes advantage of the
fact that it is easier to retrospectively identify the small set of steps that
success is contingent upon than it is to prospectively predict reward at every
step taken in the environment. Altogether, ConSpec improves learning in a
diverse set of RL tasks, including both those with explicit, discrete critical
steps and those with complex, continuous critical steps.]]></summary>

various facets of our daily existence. Solving attention regression is a
fundamental task in optimizing LLMs. In this work, we focus on giving a
provable guarantee for the one-layer attention network objective function
$L(X,Y) = \sum_{j_0 = 1}^n \sum_{i_0 = 1}^d ( \langle \langle \exp(
\mathsf{A}_{j_0} x ) , {\bf 1}_n \rangle^{-1} \exp( \mathsf{A}_{j_0} x ), A_{3}
Y_{*,i_0} \rangle - b_{j_0,i_0} )^2$. Here $\mathsf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n^2
\times d^2}$ is Kronecker product between $A_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ and
$A_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$. $A_3$ is a matrix in $\mathbb{R}^{n \times
d}$, $\mathsf{A}_{j_0} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d^2}$ is the $j_0$-th block of
$\mathsf{A}$. The $X, Y \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ are variables we want to
learn. $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ and $b_{j_0,i_0} \in \mathbb{R}$ is one
entry at $j_0$-th row and $i_0$-th column of $B$, $Y_{*,i_0} \in \mathbb{R}^d$
is the $i_0$-column vector of $Y$, and $x \in \mathbb{R}^{d^2}$ is the
vectorization of $X$.

In a multi-layer LLM network, the matrix $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ can
be viewed as the output of a layer, and $A_1= A_2 = A_3 \in \mathbb{R}^{n
\times d}$ can be viewed as the input of a layer. The matrix version of $x$ can
be viewed as $QK^\top$ and $Y$ can be viewed as $V$. We provide an iterative
greedy algorithm to train loss function $L(X,Y)$ up $\epsilon$ that runs in
$\widetilde{O}( ({\cal T}_{\mathrm{mat}}(n,n,d) + {\cal
T}_{\mathrm{mat}}(n,d,d) + d^{2\omega}) \log(1/\epsilon) )$ time. Here ${\cal
T}_{\mathrm{mat}}(a,b,c)$ denotes the time of multiplying $a \times b$ matrix
another $b \times c$ matrix, and $\omega\approx 2.37$ denotes the exponent of
matrix multiplication.]]></summary>

propose to learn sets that satisfy a more relaxed notion of containment known

every trajectory that starts within the set, returns to it after at most $\tau$
seconds (resp. $k$ steps). We show that under mild assumptions a
$\tau$-recurrent set containing a stable equilibrium must be a subset of its
ROA. We then leverage this property to develop algorithms that compute inner
approximations of the ROA using counter-examples of recurrence that are
obtained by sampling finite-length trajectories. Our algorithms process samples
sequentially, which allow them to continue being executed even after an initial

effectiveness in generating naturalistic behaviors. In this paper, we propose a
new learning framework in this paradigm for controlling physics-based
characters with significantly improved motion quality and diversity over
existing state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method uses reinforcement
learning (RL) to initially track and imitate life-like movements from
unstructured motion clips using the discrete information bottleneck, as adopted
in the Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE). This structure
compresses the most relevant information from the motion clips into a compact
yet informative latent space, i.e., a discrete space over vector quantized
codes. By sampling codes in the space from a trained categorical prior
distribution, high-quality life-like behaviors can be generated, similar to the
usage of VQ-VAE in computer vision. Although this prior distribution can be
trained with the supervision of the encoder's output, it follows the original
motion clip distribution in the dataset and could lead to imbalanced behaviors
in our setting. To address the issue, we further propose a technique named
prior shifting to adjust the prior distribution using curiosity-driven RL. The
outcome distribution is demonstrated to offer sufficient behavioral diversity
and significantly facilitates upper-level policy learning for downstream tasks.
We conduct comprehensive experiments using humanoid characters on two
challenging downstream tasks, sword-shield striking and two-player boxing game.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed framework is capable of controlling
the character to perform considerably high-quality movements in terms of
behavioral strategies, diversity, and realism. Videos, codes, and data are

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Community question answering (CQA) forums are Internet-based platforms where
users ask questions about a topic and other expert users try to provide
solutions. Many CQA forums such as Quora, Stackoverflow, Yahoo!Answer,
StackExchange exist with a lot of user-generated data. These data are leveraged
in automated CQA ranking systems where similar questions (and answers) are
presented in response to the query of the user. In this work, we empirically
investigate a few aspects of this domain. Firstly, in addition to traditional
features like TF-IDF, BM25 etc., we introduce a BERT-based feature that
captures the semantic similarity between the question and answer. Secondly,
most of the existing research works have focused on features extracted only
from the question part; features extracted from answers have not been explored
extensively. We combine both types of features in a linear fashion. Thirdly,
using our proposed concepts, we conduct an empirical investigation with
different rank-learning algorithms, some of which have not been used so far in
CQA domain. On three standard CQA datasets, our proposed framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance. We also analyze importance of the features we use
in our investigation. This work is expected to guide the practitioners to
select a better set of features for the CQA retrieval task.]]></summary>

radar intelligently targets ice storms based on information collected by a
lookahead radiometer. Critical to the intelligent targeting is accurate
identification of storm/cloud types from eight bands of radiance collected by
the radiometer. The cloud types of interest are: clear sky, thin cirrus,
cirrus, rainy anvil, and convection core.

We describe multi-step use of Machine Learning and Digital Twin of the
Earth's atmosphere to derive such a classifier. First, a digital twin of
Earth's atmosphere called a Weather Research Forecast (WRF) is used generate
simulated lookahead radiometer data as well as deeper "science" hidden
variables. The datasets simulate a tropical region over the Caribbean and a
non-tropical region over the Atlantic coast of the United States. A K-means
clustering over the scientific hidden variables was utilized by human experts
to generate an automatic labelling of the data - mapping each physical data
point to cloud types by scientists informed by mean/centroids of hidden
variables of the clusters. Next, classifiers were trained with the inputs of
the simulated radiometer data and its corresponding label. The classifiers of a
random decision forest (RDF), support vector machine (SVM), Gaussian na\"ive
bayes, feed forward artificial neural network (ANN), and a convolutional neural
network (CNN) were trained. Over the tropical dataset, the best performing
classifier was able to identify non-storm and storm clouds with over 80%
accuracy in each class for a held-out test set. Over the non-tropical dataset,
the best performing classifier was able to classify non-storm clouds with over
90% accuracy and storm clouds with over 40% accuracy. Additionally both sets of
classifiers were shown to be resilient to instrument noise.]]></summary>

Learning (HRL) approaches relying on symbolic reasoning are often limited as

developmental mechanism for subgoal discovery via an emergent representation
that abstracts (i.e., groups together) sets of environment states that have

accuracy, managing risks, and fostering strategic financial decision-making.
Despite the development of financial market simulation methodologies, existing
frameworks often struggle with adapting to specialized simulation context. We
pinpoint the challenges as i) current financial datasets do not contain context
labels; ii) current techniques are not designed to generate financial data with
context as control, which demands greater precision compared to other
modalities; iii) the inherent difficulties in generating context-aligned,
high-fidelity data given the non-stationary, noisy nature of financial data. To
address these challenges, our contributions are: i) we proposed the Contextual
Market Dataset with market dynamics, stock ticker, and history state as
context, leveraging a market dynamics modeling method that combines linear
regression and Dynamic Time Warping clustering to extract market dynamics; ii)
we present Market-GAN, a novel architecture incorporating a Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN) for the controllable generation with context, an
autoencoder for learning low-dimension features, and supervisors for knowledge
transfer; iii) we introduce a two-stage training scheme to ensure that
Market-GAN captures the intrinsic market distribution with multiple objectives.
In the pertaining stage, with the use of the autoencoder and supervisors, we
prepare the generator with a better initialization for the adversarial training
stage. We propose a set of holistic evaluation metrics that consider alignment,
fidelity, data usability on downstream tasks, and market facts. We evaluate
Market-GAN with the Dow Jones Industrial Average data from 2000 to 2023 and
showcase superior performance in comparison to 4 state-of-the-art time-series
generative models.]]></summary>

illustrating how layer normalization confines the latent features to a
hyper-sphere, subsequently enabling attention to mold the semantic
representation of words on this surface. This geometric viewpoint seamlessly
connects established properties such as iterative refinement and contextual
embeddings. We validate our insights by probing a pre-trained 124M parameter
GPT-2 model. Our findings reveal clear query-key attention patterns in early
layers and build upon prior observations regarding the subject-specific nature
of attention heads at deeper layers. Harnessing these geometric insights, we

semi-supervised learning methods often under-utilize available unlabeled data.
To address this, we propose a novel reliability-based training data cleaning
method employing inductive conformal prediction (ICP). This method capitalizes
on a small set of accurately labeled training data and leverages ICP-calculated
reliability metrics to rectify mislabeled data and outliers within vast
quantities of noisy training data. The efficacy of the method is validated
across three classification tasks within distinct modalities: filtering
drug-induced-liver-injury (DILI) literature with title and abstract, predicting
ICU admission of COVID-19 patients through CT radiomics and electronic health
records, and subtyping breast cancer using RNA-sequencing data. Varying levels
of noise to the training labels were introduced through label permutation.
Results show significant enhancements in classification performance: accuracy
enhancement in 86 out of 96 DILI experiments (up to 11.4%), AUROC and AUPRC
enhancements in all 48 COVID-19 experiments (up to 23.8% and 69.8%), and
accuracy and macro-average F1 score improvements in 47 out of 48 RNA-sequencing
experiments (up to 74.6% and 89.0%). Our method offers the potential to
substantially boost classification performance in multi-modal biomedical
machine learning tasks. Importantly, it accomplishes this without necessitating

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In many randomized experiments, the treatment effect of the long-term metric
(i.e. the primary outcome of interest) is often difficult or infeasible to
measure. Such long-term metrics are often slow to react to changes and
sufficiently noisy they are challenging to faithfully estimate in short-horizon
experiments. A common alternative is to measure several short-term proxy
metrics in the hope they closely track the long-term metric -- so they can be
used to effectively guide decision-making in the near-term. We introduce a new
statistical framework to both define and construct an optimal proxy metric for
use in a homogeneous population of randomized experiments. Our procedure first
reduces the construction of an optimal proxy metric in a given experiment to a
portfolio optimization problem which depends on the true latent treatment
effects and noise level of experiment under consideration. We then denoise the
observed treatment effects of the long-term metric and a set of proxies in a
historical corpus of randomized experiments to extract estimates of the latent
treatment effects for use in the optimization problem. One key insight derived
from our approach is that the optimal proxy metric for a given experiment is
not apriori fixed; rather it should depend on the sample size (or effective
noise level) of the randomized experiment for which it is deployed. To
instantiate and evaluate our framework, we employ our methodology in a large
corpus of randomized experiments from an industrial recommendation system and
construct proxy metrics that perform favorably relative to several baselines.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We introduce beta diffusion, a novel generative modeling method that
integrates demasking and denoising to generate data within bounded ranges.
Using scaled and shifted beta distributions, beta diffusion utilizes
multiplicative transitions over time to create both forward and reverse
diffusion processes, maintaining beta distributions in both the forward
marginals and the reverse conditionals, given the data at any point in time.
Unlike traditional diffusion-based generative models relying on additive
Gaussian noise and reweighted evidence lower bounds (ELBOs), beta diffusion is
multiplicative and optimized with KL-divergence upper bounds (KLUBs) derived
from the convexity of the KL divergence. We demonstrate that the proposed KLUBs
are more effective for optimizing beta diffusion compared to negative ELBOs,
which can also be derived as the KLUBs of the same KL divergence with its two
arguments swapped. The loss function of beta diffusion, expressed in terms of
Bregman divergence, further supports the efficacy of KLUBs for optimization.
Experimental results on both synthetic data and natural images demonstrate the
unique capabilities of beta diffusion in generative modeling of range-bounded
data and validate the effectiveness of KLUBs in optimizing diffusion models,
thereby making them valuable additions to the family of diffusion-based
generative models and the optimization techniques used to train them.]]></summary>

be viewed as the output of a layer, and $A_1= A_2 = A_3 \in \mathbb{R}^{n
\times d}$ can be viewed as the input of a layer. The matrix version of $x$ can
be viewed as $QK^\top$ and $Y$ can be viewed as $V$. We provide an iterative
greedy algorithm to train loss function $L(X,Y)$ up $\epsilon$ that runs in
$\widetilde{O}( ({\cal T}_{\mathrm{mat}}(n,n,d) + {\cal
T}_{\mathrm{mat}}(n,d,d) + d^{2\omega}) \log(1/\epsilon) )$ time. Here ${\cal
T}_{\mathrm{mat}}(a,b,c)$ denotes the time of multiplying $a \times b$ matrix
another $b \times c$ matrix, and $\omega\approx 2.37$ denotes the exponent of
matrix multiplication.]]></summary>

unobserved confounders. Sensitivity analysis methods are commonly used to
estimate the policy value under the worst-case confounding over a given
uncertainty set. However, existing work often resorts to some coarse relaxation
of the uncertainty set for the sake of tractability, leading to overly
conservative estimation of the policy value. In this paper, we propose a
general estimator that provides a sharp lower bound of the policy value. It can
be shown that our estimator contains the recently proposed sharp estimator by
Dorn and Guo (2022) as a special case, and our method enables a novel extension
of the classical marginal sensitivity model using f-divergence. To construct
our estimator, we leverage the kernel method to obtain a tractable
approximation to the conditional moment constraints, which traditional
non-sharp estimators failed to take into account. In the theoretical analysis,
we provide a condition for the choice of the kernel which guarantees no
specification error that biases the lower bound estimation. Furthermore, we
provide consistency guarantees of policy evaluation and learning. In the
experiments with synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.]]></summary>

optimisation space to run efficiently. In geometric quantum machine learning,
one achieves this by encoding group structure into parameterised quantum
circuits to include the symmetries of a problem as an inductive bias. However,
constructing such circuits is challenging as a concrete guiding principle has
yet to emerge. In this paper, we propose the use of spin networks, a form of
directed tensor network invariant under a group transformation, to devise SU(2)
equivariant quantum circuit ans\"atze -- circuits possessing spin rotation
symmetry. By changing to the basis that block diagonalises SU(2) group action,
these networks provide a natural building block for constructing parameterised
equivariant quantum circuits. We prove that our construction is mathematically
equivalent to other known constructions, such as those based on twirling and
generalised permutations, but more direct to implement on quantum hardware. The
efficacy of our constructed circuits is tested by solving the ground state
problem of SU(2) symmetric Heisenberg models on the one-dimensional triangular
lattice and on the Kagome lattice. Our results highlight that our equivariant
circuits boost the performance of quantum variational algorithms, indicating

that bypasses the restrictions on covariate distributions imposed by modern
debiasing technology. We study the prevalent setting where the number of
features and samples are both large and comparable. In this context,
state-of-the-art debiasing technology uses a degrees-of-freedom correction to
remove shrinkage bias of regularized estimators and conduct inference. However,
this method requires that the observed samples are i.i.d., the covariates
follow a mean zero Gaussian distribution, and reliable covariance matrix
estimates for observed features are available. This approach struggles when (i)
covariates are non-Gaussian with heavy tails or asymmetric distributions, (ii)
rows of the design exhibit heterogeneity or dependencies, and (iii) reliable
feature covariance estimates are lacking.

To address these, we develop a new strategy where the debiasing correction is
a rescaled gradient descent step (suitably initialized) with step size
determined by the spectrum of the sample covariance matrix. Unlike prior work,
we assume that eigenvectors of this matrix are uniform draws from the
orthogonal group. We show this assumption remains valid in diverse situations
where traditional debiasing fails, including designs with complex row-column
dependencies, heavy tails, asymmetric properties, and latent low-rank
structures. We establish asymptotic normality of our proposed estimator
(centered and scaled) under various convergence notions. Moreover, we develop a
consistent estimator for its asymptotic variance. Lastly, we introduce a
debiased Principal Component Regression (PCR) technique using our
Spectrum-Aware approach. In varied simulations and real data experiments, we
observe that our method outperforms degrees-of-freedom debiasing by a margin.]]></summary>

applications when using complex learners, such as deep neural networks, on

schemes. On the flip side, these approaches risk misidentifying unimportant

Importance (CPI) that is model agnostic and computationally lean, as well as
reusable benchmarks of state-of-the-art variable importance estimators. We show
theoretically and empirically that $\textit{CPI}$ overcomes the limitations of
standard permutation importance by providing accurate type-I error control.
When used with a deep neural network, $\textit{CPI}$ consistently showed top
accuracy across benchmarks. An empirical benchmark on real-world data analysis

realm of statistical mechanics. ML techniques have attracted attention by the
classical density-functional theory (DFT) community, as they enable discovery
of free-energy functionals to determine the equilibrium-density profile of a
many-particle system. Within DFT, the external potential accounts for the
interaction of the many-particle system with an external field, thus, affecting
the density distribution. In this context, we introduce a statistical-learning
framework to infer the external potential exerted on a many-particle system. We
combine a Bayesian inference approach with the classical DFT apparatus to
reconstruct the external potential, yielding a probabilistic description of the
external potential functional form with inherent uncertainty quantification.
Our framework is exemplified with a grand-canonical one-dimensional particle
ensemble with excluded volume interactions in a confined geometry. The required
training dataset is generated using a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation where the
external potential is applied to the grand-canonical ensemble. The resulting
particle coordinates from the MC simulation are fed into the learning framework
to uncover the external potential. This eventually allows us to compute the
equilibrium density profile of the system by using the tools of DFT. Our
approach benchmarks the inferred density against the exact one calculated
through the DFT formulation with the true external potential. The proposed
Bayesian procedure accurately infers the external potential and the density
profile. We also highlight the external-potential uncertainty quantification
conditioned on the amount of available simulated data. The seemingly simple
case study introduced in this work might serve as a prototype for studying a
wide variety of applications, including adsorption and capillarity.]]></summary>

interpretability. Despite the advancements in interpretable machine learning
(IML) methods, they frequently assign importance to features which lack causal
influence on the outcome variable. Selecting causally relevant features among
those identified as relevant by these methods, or even before model training,
would offer a solution. Feature selection methods utilizing information
theoretical quantities have been successful in identifying statistically
relevant features. However, the information theoretical quantities they are
based on do not incorporate causality, rendering them unsuitable for such
scenarios. To address this challenge, this article proposes information
theoretical quantities that incorporate the causal structure of the system,
which can be used to evaluate causal importance of features for some given
outcome variable. Specifically, we introduce causal versions of entropy and
mutual information, termed causal entropy and causal information gain, which
are designed to assess how much control a feature provides over the outcome
variable. These newly defined quantities capture changes in the entropy of a
variable resulting from interventions on other variables. Fundamental results
connecting these quantities to the existence of causal effects are derived. The
use of causal information gain in feature selection is demonstrated,
highlighting its superiority over standard mutual information in revealing
which features provide control over a chosen outcome variable. Our

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gaussian process is an indispensable tool in clustering functional data,
owing to it's flexibility and inherent uncertainty quantification. However,
when the functional data is observed over a large grid (say, of length $p$),
Gaussian process clustering quickly renders itself infeasible, incurring
$O(p^2)$ space complexity and $O(p^3)$ time complexity per iteration; and thus
prohibiting it's natural adaptation to large environmental applications. To
ensure scalability of Gaussian process clustering in such applications, we
propose to embed the popular Vecchia approximation for Gaussian processes at
the heart of the clustering task, provide crucial theoretical insights towards
algorithmic design, and finally develop a computationally efficient expectation
maximization (EM) algorithm. Empirical evidence of the utility of our proposal
is provided via simulations and analysis of polar temperature anomaly

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In consequential domains, it is often impossible to compel individuals to
take treatment, so that optimal policy rules are merely suggestions in the
presence of human non-adherence to treatment recommendations. In these same
domains, there may be heterogeneity both in who responds in taking-up
treatment, and heterogeneity in treatment efficacy. While optimal treatment
rules can maximize causal outcomes across the population, access parity
constraints or other fairness considerations can be relevant in the case of
encouragement. For example, in social services, a persistent puzzle is the gap
in take-up of beneficial services among those who may benefit from them the
most. When in addition the decision-maker has distributional preferences over
both access and average outcomes, the optimal decision rule changes. We study
causal identification, statistical variance-reduced estimation, and robust
estimation of optimal treatment rules, including under potential violations of
positivity. We consider fairness constraints such as demographic parity in
treatment take-up, and other constraints, via constrained optimization. Our
framework can be extended to handle algorithmic recommendations under an
often-reasonable covariate-conditional exclusion restriction, using our
robustness checks for lack of positivity in the recommendation. We develop a
two-stage algorithm for solving over parametrized policy classes under general
constraints to obtain variance-sensitive regret bounds. We illustrate the
methods in two case studies based on data from randomized encouragement to
enroll in insurance and from pretrial supervised release with electronic
monitoring.]]></summary>

neural networks and gradient-based optimization. Understanding the behavior of
gradient descent however, and particularly its instability, has lagged behind
its empirical success. To add to the theoretical tools available to study
gradient descent we propose the principal flow (PF), a continuous time flow
that approximates gradient descent dynamics. To our knowledge, the PF is the
only continuous flow that captures the divergent and oscillatory behaviors of
gradient descent, including escaping local minima and saddle points. Through
its dependence on the eigendecomposition of the Hessian the PF sheds light on
the recently observed edge of stability phenomena in deep learning. Using our
new understanding of instability we propose a learning rate adaptation method
which enables us to control the trade-off between training stability and test
set evaluation performance.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google has developed an AI algorithm to refine route suggestions on Google Maps, personalizing it based on user data and behavior, allegedly improving the accuracy on an average by 16-24 percent.
 To stay on top of the latest advancements in AI, look here first.
 https://preview.redd.it/rp21ylzo7iob1.jpg?width=770&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=737cf3fd278ade42900e8586d626a7c729522c1a
 Personalized Route Suggestions through AI
  
The AI model comprises 360 million parameters, using real-time data from Maps users to influence factors including travel time, road conditions, tolls, and personal preferences to suggest routes.
 This technology is grounded on "inverse reinforcement learning" (IRL), specifically a new IRL algorithm - "Receding Horizon Inverse Planning (RHIP)".
  
The Power of RHIP and AI in Maps
  
Google and Deepmind jointly worked to develop RHIP, using complex stochastic models in immediate vicinity areas, but switching to simpler deterministic methods for distant areas for power conservation.
 The AI improves route suggestions for both driving and two-wheeled vehicles by learning from Maps users' movements and behaviors over time.
 Google states that this is the largest application of inverse reinforcement learning for route planning to date.
  
Implementation and User Testing
  
Google has applied the algorithm to Maps data globally, but extensive user testing is needed to confirm if the technique consistently produces better routes.
 Previous attempts at using AI systems for route planning on a large scale have often failed due to the complexity of road networks.

 Many Republicans have been reluctant to criticize Trump for fear of alienating his supporters. This is especially true for Republican politicians who are up for re-election in 2022.
 Some Republicans may genuinely believe that Trump did not incite the riot. They may point to the fact that he did not explicitly call for violence, or that he told his supporters to "peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard."

They are given antibiotics to prevent disease and growth hormones to make them grow faster. This leads to a variety of health problems for the animals, as well as for the people who eat their meat.
 Clean meat is a new technology that offers a more humane and sustainable way to produce meat. It is made from animal cells that are grown in a lab, without the need for animals to be raised or slaughtered. Clean meat is still in its early stages of development, but it has the potential to revolutionize the meat industry.

 Abstract:
  
Recent advances on large language models (LLMs) enable researchers and developers to build autonomous language agents that can automatically solve various tasks and interact with environments, humans, and other agents using natural language interfaces. We consider language agents as a promising direction towards artificial general intelligence and release Agents, an open-source library with the goal of opening up these advances to a wider non-specialist audience. Agents is carefully engineered to support important features including planning, memory, tool usage, multi-agent communication, and fine-grained symbolic control. Agents is user-friendly as it enables non-specialists to build, customize, test, tune, and deploy state-of-the-art autonomous language agents without much coding. The library is also research-friendly as its modularized design makes it easily extensible for researchers.

 I have about 100K images on my machine and I am looking for a tool that can help me do some QA on it.
 Example features I would love:
  
Search and visualize all images with a prefix "cls1_" or "cls2_"
 Easily rename file names if they're not named correctly
 
Visualize all captions associated with each image 
  
We can assume they have the same name but with extension ".txt" or ".captions"
 Or there's a metadata.json linking between "img_file" and "caption_file"
 
 
Easily edit captions in the dashboard
 
 I can also work with some kind of metadata file instead of relying on filename logic if it really helps a certain tool.
 I prefer a locally run, open-source tool. It would be a problem for me to upload this data to any online platform.
 Many thanks in advance for any help or guidance.

I then split the data without shuffling. Training, validation and testing averages at 75% accuracy. 
 Now my next step I wanted to do a "real world" data test where I collect the exact same data as my testing data and predict it using my previously built model but the values inside test_dataset1 are different to test_dataset2 within the last 6-9 decimal places even though the data is going through the exact same code. For example 
 Test_dataset1 Value : 1.123456789

In recent years, we have witnessed rising interest across consumers and researchers in integrated augmented reality (AR) experiences using real-time face feature generation and editing functions in mobile applications, including short videos, virtual reality, and gaming. As a result, there is a growing demand for lightweight, yet high-quality face generation and editing models, which are often based on generative adversarial network (GAN) techniques. However, the majority of GAN models suffer from high computational complexity and the need for a large training dataset. In addition, it is also important to employ GAN models responsibly.

 Abstract:
  
Transformers have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing, but comprehending their internal mechanisms remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel geometric perspective that elucidates the inner mechanisms of transformer operations. Our primary contribution is illustrating how layer normalization confines the latent features to a hyper-sphere, subsequently enabling attention to mold the semantic representation of words on this surface. This geometric viewpoint seamlessly connects established properties such as iterative refinement and contextual embeddings. We validate our insights by probing a pre-trained 124M parameter GPT-2 model. Our findings reveal clear query-key attention patterns in early layers and build upon prior observations regarding the subject-specific nature of attention heads at deeper layers. Harnessing these geometric insights, we present an intuitive understanding of transformers, depicting them as processes that model the trajectory of word particles along the hyper-sphere.

But in Dreamer algorithm (DreamerV3), why does it require to combine actor and critic network to the model-based planning approach, as the model-based also able to perform an action by planning to the simulation state. It is mean that using model-based to simulate the possible future then update the critic according to the simulation might sound good in training an agent?

 The library was in plain Python before (using pandas for all the sliding operations, median computation etc), but now it has been replaced by a Cython implementation, which speeds up things quite a bit! 😀
 It also provides much more valuable information (thresholds, median absolute deviations, etc.), allowing us to create plots like this one:

 Abstract:
  
Transformers have become the dominant model in deep learning, but the reason for their superior performance is poorly understood. Here, we hypothesize that the strong performance of Transformers stems from an architectural bias towards mesa-optimization, a learned process running within the forward pass of a model consisting of the following two steps: (i) the construction of an internal learning objective, and (ii) its corresponding solution found through optimization. To test this hypothesis, we reverse-engineer a series of autoregressive Transformers trained on simple sequence modeling tasks, uncovering underlying gradient-based mesa-optimization algorithms driving the generation of predictions. Moreover, we show that the learned forward-pass optimization algorithm can be immediately repurposed to solve supervised few-shot tasks, suggesting that mesa-optimization might underlie the in-context learning capabilities of large language models. Finally, we propose a novel self-attention layer, the mesa-layer, that explicitly and efficiently solves optimization problems specified in context. We find that this layer can lead to improved performance in synthetic and preliminary language modeling experiments, adding weight to our hypothesis that mesa-optimization is an important operation hidden within the weights of trained Transformers.

γ is a decay factor, and K, Q, and V have their standard transformer definitions.
 What confuses me is the derivation of Sn. The formula makes it look like a scalar. But if that's the case, are we saying that for a given token, the retention mechanism is just multiplying the Query by a scalar? That's surprising! How is that able to provide enough context?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking for a free AI tool, site (may be paid with free account limited options) that can do a summary of English article (like BBC, youtube) based on most frequently used English words, for example Oxford list of 3000 most frequently used words in English. In other words if word is not in that list it should replace the word with the one that is on the list or its definition.

 It seems like these are difficult times. Compare today with the WWII years, explaining how much we have to be grateful for.
 Bard said:
 I agree that these are difficult times. The world is facing many challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and political instability. However, I believe that we have much to be grateful for today compared to the WWII years.
 Here are just a few things:
 We live in a time of peace. World War II was a global conflict that caused the deaths of millions of people. Today, there are no major wars raging on.
 We have access to advanced medical care. During WWII, many people died from diseases that are now easily treatable. Today, we have antibiotics, vaccines, and other medical advances that have saved countless lives.
 We have a higher standard of living. In the WWII years, many people lived in poverty. Today, most people in the developed world have access to clean water, food, and shelter.
 We have more opportunities for education and advancement. In the WWII years, many people were denied an education because of their race, gender, or social class. Today, education is more accessible than ever before, and people from all backgrounds have the opportunity to succeed.
 We have a better understanding of the world. During WWII, there was a lot of misinformation and propaganda. Today, we have access to more information than ever before, and we can make more informed decisions about our lives.
 Of course, there are still many challenges that we face today. But I believe that we have come a long way since the WWII years, and we have much to be grateful for. Let us never forget the sacrifices that were made during that time, and let us continue to work towards a better future for all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The AI-based techno-economic war between the West and China will determine the global distribution of technology, economic benefits, and influence.
 
The winner of this race, particularly in AI, will have the power to accelerate GDP growth and project global economic benefits.
 
China is actively pursuing technological leadership in AI and 5G wireless, while the West must prioritize technological talent influx and leverage its venture and technology ecosystem.
 
Aggressive AI regulation could hinder the West's momentum in this race.
 
The risks of this war and AI technology are significant, but it is a greater risk to let adversaries have unconstrained power.
 
Global treaties are not enforceable solutions to regulate AI.

 A skew-symmetric matrix is a square matrix whose transpose equals to its negative. It should satisfy the below condition:
 AT = –A
 Just wondering do these have any applications in ML at all? I never came across this in my math classes so just wondering if the property pops up anywhere else in the field. Maybe in 3D space applications? Or maybe RBG data augmentation? But yeah not 100% sure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have a dataset that consists of 2D trajectories and I am aiming to develop an autoencoder architecture to learn a compressed set of features that reasonable represents and can reconstruct the trajectories. 
 The trajectories may look something like this as an example. A 2D image as input would seem to require a very sparse representation with high resolution to track the trajectory path. I am hoping there is a better way to input the path without requiring high resolution. 
 An alternative might be to use a LSTM structure to input as a sequence, although not sure that solves the resolution issue.
 Do you have any suggestions? I've worked with 1d time series and 2D images just fine but this is a bit different.

 I'm running llama-2-7b-chat-hf with 4bit quantization on a g5.2xlarge instance on sagemaker.
 The method I'm using is map_reduce (option 2)from this webpage https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/summarization)
 Of everything I've tried this is the only one that's been able to do decent summaries in a reasonable amount of time. However with really long articles (10,000+ words) it takes ~6 minutes before giving an output.
 I tried running this same thing on a g5.12xlarge instance which has 4 A10G gpus but it hasn't reduced the time by any noticeable amount.
 Is there anything else I could be doing to speed this up?

Also if it's slower than the c++ one how slow is it? I'll probably have to make something real time and hence can't compromise much on the speed, but if it's only and small amount it's acceptable.
 would really appreciate some guidance in this matter

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I asked ChatGPT to talk with Trump's jury about the 3-hour delay. Not bad.
 ChatGPT:
 Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, today, we present a compelling case that the three-hour delay in President Trump's response to the events of January 6th is, without a doubt, overwhelming and irrefutable evidence of his planning and conducting the insurrection that unfolded before our eyes.
 First, consider the timeline. As the violence escalated, President Trump did not immediately call for an end to the chaos. This delay allowed the mob to wreak havoc, endanger lives, and damage our democracy. A leader's duty is to protect the nation and its citizens, and a three-hour wait to act is inexplicable unless there was intent behind it.
 Second, let's talk about intent. In criminal law, intent matters. It's the difference between an accident and a crime. A deliberate delay in response to an unfolding insurrection suggests a guilty mind. President Trump had the power and the responsibility to intervene immediately. Yet, he chose not to, allowing the violence to escalate.
 Furthermore, we must consider his words leading up to and during the events of January 6th. His rhetoric could be interpreted as encouragement for his supporters to take matters into their own hands. This, coupled with the delay, paints a picture of a leader who not only knew what was happening but may have orchestrated it.
 Ladies and gentlemen, we are not here to pass judgment but to seek justice. The evidence of a three-hour delay in responding to the insurrection, along with the surrounding circumstances, presents a compelling case that President Trump planned and conducted this insurrection. It is our duty to hold individuals accountable for their actions, regardless of their position.

 Bard seemed informed and sharp:
 "The film The Social Network is a dramatization of the founding of Facebook, and as such, it takes some liberties with the truth. However, the film does accurately portray the fact that Mark Zuckerberg was sued by the Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler, who claimed that he stole their idea for a social networking website called HarvardConnection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there! I'm participating in a Hackathon at work and am wondering if this community can give me some direction. Every year our company receives mandates / updates from different parties. In turn, our development teams have to parse through heavy documentation to figure out what needs to change in our code. Ingesting the data is what takes the longest. Our goal is to feed the mandates documentation through an AI and have it return what is needed to be changed in our code. For example, something might say field 200 now needs to include a 6 digit date format vs the 4 digit date format we've had in years past. We have secured a license for Azure AI but honestly no idea if that is the right AI to use. I youtubed a bunch of videos on document processing but I'm also not sure if that is what we are trying to do. Any advice on this is much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07062 
 Abstract:
  
We explore the novel application of Large Language Models to code optimization. We present a 7B-parameter transformer model trained from scratch to optimize LLVM assembly for code size. The model takes as input unoptimized assembly and outputs a list of compiler options to best optimize the program. Crucially, during training, we ask the model to predict the instruction counts before and after optimization, and the optimized code itself. These auxiliary learning tasks significantly improve the optimization performance of the model and improve the model's depth of understanding.
 We evaluate on a large suite of test programs. Our approach achieves a 3.0% improvement in reducing instruction counts over the compiler, outperforming two state-of-the-art baselines that require thousands of compilations. Furthermore, the model shows surprisingly strong code reasoning abilities, generating compilable code 91% of the time and perfectly emulating the output of the compiler 70% of the time.

 Anyway, I'm searching for alternative methods, algoritms (NLP or not) and models... There are lots of info and different implementation on RAG, but as I can see noone put much effort to augment chunking quality. 
 Also, there are other approach than this one I'm currently using? bi-encoder (instructor) - > cross-encoder (reranking) - > LLM 
 Can someone share some resources, repo, lib or existing implementation of different chunking methods? (or simply discuss here some idea, though or approach) 
 Thanks in advance for you time!!

 Cambridge University Press
 I am solving the problem I attach and I have a doubt in section (f). I have solved all the sections (a)-(e).
 In section (e) I have obtained that I need
 $$
 k \geq \frac{\lambda_{\text{max}}\left(\frac{2}{N} A^TA + 2\mu I\right)}{\lambda_{\text{min}}\left(\frac{2}{N} A^TA + 2\mu I\right)}log((f(x^0)-f(x_\mu)/\epsilon).
 $$
 However in section (f) asks for a tight upper bound but I only can think about the following bound:
 $f(\hat{x}) \leq f_\mu(x_\mu) + ||\hat{x}||^2+ \epsilon$,
 which is very simple.
 Do you think that I can obtain the result in (e) to obtain another bond, or what would you do?

 I'm trying to figure out what is the best way to use LLMs to analyse a very old software entirely written in C.
 I've tried to to some basic prompts with ChatGPT and it seems to recognise the language.
 The situation is that I've many .c files with thousands of lines and with a lot of redundant code.
 Moreover, since there are a lot of data structure with variables names not easily understandable, I need to provide some context to allow the model to trying to understand what the code does.
 My worry is that providing all the needed info + the file itself (even considering 1 file at a time) I could consume all the model context and therefore not leave room for generating anything of value.
 Has anyone had the opportunity to face similar problems? Ideas?

 Abstract:
  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results. However, existing models are expensive to train and deploy, and it is also difficult to expand their knowledge beyond pre-training data without forgetting previous knowledge. This paper proposes a new neural network architecture, ModuleFormer, that leverages modularity to improve the efficiency and flexibility of large language models. ModuleFormer is based on the Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE). Unlike the previous SMoE-based modular language model, which requires domain-labeled data to learn domain-specific experts, ModuleFormer can i…]]></summary>

 I wasn't doing any ml in some time and forgot basics. I was thinking that you may help me. So I trained svc model on small dataset (around 1400 unical records). I have 13 classes, which are badly distributed in the training set and inbalanced. 3 classes took around 80% of all. What the business wants is keep the 3 classes and categorize the rest as "Other" class. In the future they may be able to generate more training data for the remaining labels.
 How should I do it? I know I can assign everytning to "Other" class, before training with simple if then formula, but dont know if this is the right approach. Any sugestions? I know this may be some case of 1 vs all case, but don't know which exactly.
 Thanks in advance for any help.

 I was really excited that Mojo became publicly available and thinking which project can I implement to learn Mojo concepts. Since I have already ported llama2.c to pure Python, I decided why not try to port llama2.py to Mojo now.. And here is what I got
 First round of llama2.c vs llama2.🔥 battle. Mojo demonstrated 20% better performance than C in a single threaded execution of llama2 inference and 250x times better performance than Python
 https://i.redd.it/0gcwwfc2r7ob1.gif
 For reference Mojo is using SIMD vectorization, that's why it's performing great for matmul operations. In the other hand, it turned out that gcc also aggressively optimizes all for loops it can find, so I suggest this benchmark is pretty fair.
 ​
 Mojo natively supports SIMD vectorizations out of the box
 gcc aggressively vectorizing loops
 ​
 After that I decided to compare both solutions in multi-threaded (parallelized) mode, and now `llama2.c` strike back with help of OMP demonstrating 20% better performance than Mojo
 ​
 https://i.redd.it/gwymffods7ob1.gif
 I hope this post will be useful for all Machine Learning engineers/enthusiasts/students out there, ensuring we're up-to-date with Modular/Mojo's game-changing AI tech developments.
 Stay informed and ahead of the curve!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I'm currently at a crossroads with a decision that I believe many in this community might have faced or will face at some point: Should I use cloud-based GPU instances like AWS's p3.2xlarge EC2 (with Tesla V100) or invest in building a high-performance rig at home with multiple RTX 4090s for training a large language model?
 Context: I run a startup and we're currently fine-tuning an open source LLM, and the computational demands are of course high. We want to make an informed choice between using AWS's offerings or setting up a high-performance system at home to start.
 Cloud Option: AWS p3.2xlarge EC2
  
Cost: Approximately $3.06 per hour.
 Specifications: One Tesla V100 GPU, 8 vCPUs, 61 GiB RAM.
 Pros: Scalability, reliability, specialized software optimizations.
 Cons: Recurring costs, potential limitations on customization.
  
Home Rig Option: Multiple RTX 4090s
  
Cost: Around $1,600 for each 4090, but I'd own them.
 Specifications: Even higher TFLOPs than a V100, and memory isn't a constraint (24GB per card).
 Pros: One-time investment, flexibility, potentially higher raw computational power.
 Cons: Need to handle cooling, power, and system integration myself
  
I'd love to hear your thoughts, experiences, and recommendations. Here are some specific questions:
  
Performance: How many RTX 4090s would roughly equal the computational power of an AWS p3.2xlarge instance for ML tasks?
 Cost-Effectiveness: Given that we're a startup with limited resources, does it make more financial sense to invest upfront in hardware?
 Reliability and Maintenance: For those who have run multi-GPU setups at home, how reliable are they, and what maintenance work is required?
 Other Considerations: Are there factors I haven't considered that you think are critical?
  
Thank you in advance for sharing your insights!

Abstract:
  
The current trend of scaling language models involves increasing both parameter count and training dataset size. Extrapolating this trend suggests that training dataset size may soon be limited by the amount of text data available on the internet. Motivated by this limit, we investigate scaling language models in data-constrained regimes. Specifically, we run a large set of experiments varying the extent of data repetition and compute budget, ranging up to 900 billion training tokens and 9 billion parameter models. We find that with constrained data for a fixed compute budget, training with up to 4 epochs of repeated data yields negligible changes to loss compared to having unique data. However, with more repetition, the value of adding compute eventually decays to zero. We propose and empirically validate a scaling law for compute optimality that accounts for the decreasing value of repeated tokens and excess parameters. Finally, we experiment with approaches mitigating data scarcity, including augmenting the training dataset with code data or removing commonly used filters. Models and datasets from our 400 training runs are freely available at this https URL.

But how are consumers using other GenAI products apart from ChatGPT? An a16z Consumer report examines the top 50 GenAI web products (based on SimilarWeb data) to find out.
 To stay on top of the latest advancements in AI, look here first.
 https://preview.redd.it/f0kh5qag16ob1.png?width=2058&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cab11a31d384c068912c9fca32a000393b795d5
  
Proprietary models are dominating: 80% of the top 50 GenAI products didn’t exist a year ago—suggesting many of the most compelling consumer experiences are completely novel. Interestingly, 48% of these are bootstrapped—with no outside funding.
 ChatGPT holds a massive lead: ChatGPT alone accounts for 60% of the entire list's monthly traffic, with roughly 1.6 billion visits and 200 million monthly users as of June 2023.
 LLM assistants are dominating: LLMs, including Google’s Bard and Quora’s Poe, constitute 68% of total consumer traffic to the top 50. The other categories seeing significant traffic are AI companions and content-generation tools.
 GenAI marketing is mostly organic: Marketing for most of these products has been reliant on referrals, word of mouth, and other traditional marketing as they enter the market. About 90% of these companies are already monetizing, and most do so via a subscription model.
 GenAI and mobile adaptability: Given the extensive consumer time spent on mobile, an increase in mobile-first GenAI products is expected as the technology evolves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 Recently, I tried to follow fetch_pick_and_place.env in gymnasium_robotics to build a similar environment with Franka.
 I found that the core of this implementation is to use the mocap to control the end-effector, and then mocap derives joint angles using the built-in inverse kinematics algorithm.
 For the fetch_pick_and_place.env, mocap does not cause mutations and oscillations in configuration space. However, when I use mocap to control Franka, oscillations in joint space occur frequently, although I've minimized the step size of the mocap to ensure that the movement of the end-effector in Cartesian space is minor. Fetch and Franka are both redundant arms, I don't know why there is such a big difference in mocap performance.
 Here is the video to illustrate the above phenomenon
 Franka
 I've opened issues on mujoco and gymnasium robotics repositories, but it didn't initiate any discussion.
 Any help would be appreciated! Thanks!

Prompt Engineering seems like a pretty fresh field of study. Is it up and coming as a career path?
 People that specialize in this, what field(s) did you come from and how would you recommend diving into it?
 Considering my experience, would I be able to actually find work, freelancing or employed?
 How on earth do I get started in this world? It seems so insanely big and complicated but I am just fascinated by the idea of using written dialogue to manipulate the output of an LLM!
 From my very high overview of PE and the recent advances in AI, PE as a field of study and interest is going to expand exponentially, is that accurate?

 What is the best way to get my python code for the agent to run onto the spare PC? I know I can manually load copy the code over, but I'm looking for a more efficient method that will maintain any changes made to the source code. Maybe packaging up the python code within the sweep and having the agent download and execute it? I'm not all too familiar with possibilities and limits of trying to achieve this so any and all input is appreciated. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have this question that I cannot seem to settle in my head. All papers that I read, report the average (std) performance results across each folds when they report F1, Precision, etc.. Somebody that I highly trust in ML (somebody with a PhD in the field) was reporting the results after saving all the predicted labels (y_pred) and actual labels (y_true) to a list and compute the F1 score one time with the pooled predictions.
 I now am working on a dataset (binary classification) and trying to validate my model using leave-one-subject-out CV (Some people in my dataset have more lines than others). When I take the average of all iterations I get poor results (F1 score= 0.5), but if I pool all the predictions and compute the F1 score at the end, I achieve decent performance (F1 score =0.7). So, in my project, it is in my best interest to use the second approach, and somebody that I trust tells me that it is okay to do this approach. But I cannot seem to find a paper that says that this approach is acceptable or good. What do you guys think and do you have any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was thinking of some major challenges in modeling a generic real-world environment. Some of them are: adaptive agents, uncertain intentions, and lack of common knowledge.
 However, most of the papers I see on RL make some assumption or other violating one or more of these, like considering simple agents, assuming known knowledge about others' intentions, and considering that the models of other agents are known when irl an agent hardly has a model of other agents it interacts with apriori. 
 Consider an airport scenario where agents are trying to get into respective planes within a given time, and the gates to each plane allow one person at a time. Looking at the scenario from the view of a single agent, they know what they want, but they can't really make any assumptions about the intentions, strategy, and complexity of other agents beforehand. These other agents can be neutral or adversarial (competing for getting in the same plane) from the agent's viewpoint. All they can see is a restricted view of the motions of some of the other agents.
 What would you say could model and provide a solution in such a scenario? It is to be noted that other agents can change their strategies based on actions taken by you till now, and so can you. Due to having incomplete information, I fail to see the notion of an equilibrium, and the agents needn't be fully rational as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on a project that involves analyzing large samples of Java codes. My end goal is to perform classification based on these codes. For this, I've been trying to efficiently encode the full names of the methods (in the package.class.methodname format) in the Java code.
 Currently, I am experimenting with doc2vec. I'm treating the components of each method's full name (separated by dots) as individual documents. This allows me to produce vectors for each method name, and I evaluate the results by computing the cosine similarity between pairs of similar method names. The results were not good so far.
 Before moving to doc2vec, I tried using an LLM which gave me good results. However, the inference time was far too long, especially given the scale at which I'm working. I also considered using a Bag of Words model, but quickly realized it wouldn't be effective. Many of the method names in my samples are obfuscated, making this approach unsuitable.
 The issue I'm facing is that using the direct method names as features is not generalizing well for classification. A slight change in a method's name results in losing that particular feature, making my model fragile.
 What are some optimal encoding methods for small sentences (around 5-6 words) like these method names, that can scale well? 
 Also, Are there any specialized encoding techniques tailored for software code that I could use for this task?
 Any suggestions or insights would be really helpful. Thank you!

 Github: https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm 
 Blog: https://vllm.ai/ 
 Abstract:
  
High throughput serving of large language models (LLMs) requires batching sufficiently many requests at a time. However, existing systems struggle because the key-value cache (KV cache) memory for each request is huge and grows and shrinks dynamically. When managed inefficiently, this memory can be significantly wasted by fragmentation and redundant duplication, limiting the batch size. To address this problem, we propose PagedAttention, an attention algorithm inspired by the classical virtual memory and paging techniques in operating systems. On top of it, we build vLLM, an LLM serving system that achieves (1) near-zero waste in KV cache memory and (2) flexible sharing of KV cache within and across requests to further reduce memory usage. Our evaluations show that vLLM improves the throughput of popular LLMs by 2-4× with the same level of latency compared to the state-of-the-art systems, such as FasterTransformer and Orca. The improvement is more pronounced with longer sequences, larger models, and more complex decoding algorithms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I would love to create a small group of people who work together in AI.
 The project would be to create an AI that can infer new novel knowledge from existing datasets, as opposed to be being limited by operating within the training data. Specifically to be used in the quest to learn more about the universe.
 So I am looking for a team of likeminded individuals who want to grow in the field of AI.
 I'd love to setup a discord, subreddit and github profile to showcase our work.
 My introduction question is: How do we get AI's to expand upon current knowledge instead of just serving from the knowledge itself.
 Anyone interested in joining me in this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Eight big names in tech, including Nvidia, Palantir, and Adobe, have agreed to red team their AI applications before they're released and prioritize research that will make their systems more trustworthy.
 
The White House has secured voluntary commitments from Adobe, Cohere, IBM, Nvidia, Palantir, Salesforce, Scale AI, and Stability AI to develop machine-learning software and models in a safe, secure, and trustworthy way. The commitments only cover future generative AI models.
 
Each of the corporations has promised to submit their software to internal and external audits, where independent experts can attack the models to see how they can be misused.
 
The organizations agreed to safeguard their intellectual property and make sure things like the weights of their proprietary neural networks don't leak, while giving users a way to easily report vulnerabilities or bugs.
 
All eight companies agreed to focus on research to investigate societal and civil risks AI might pose if they lead to discriminatory decision-making or have weaknesses in data privacy.
 
The US government wants Big Tech to develop watermarking techniques that can identify AI-generated content.
 
The US has asked the corporations to commit to building models for good, such as fighting climate change or improving healthcare.

 I have a BSc in Mathematics and currently I'm going to start a MSc in FinTech ( it has 3 courses out of 9 that have to do with ML, NN and many more ).
 Since I am really fascinated about programming ( didn't like it when I was at Maths department because of teachers and I am starting learning on my own through courses and we will have many programming languages in my masters degree ex. R,Python, SQL and others) and I would start as a data scientist at the beginning, could I through years of experience later ( ideally 1-2 years later, provided that I have a solid and good programming skills and projects) become a ML engineer? ( Now of course I can't become one because I know that it is difficult since I am competing with people that have CS degrees).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there!
 I bring 2 years of experience from a European investment fund and a solid idea for a B2B SaaS solution targeting private equity investment funds. 
 This market is notoriously challenging to penetrate without insider knowledge. The timing couldn't be better. Similar kind of software is currently sold €20k per user by a semi-monopolistic boomer company that is ready to be disrupted.
 Offer:
 - Equity shared equally.
 - Ready to quit my job and go full-time on it, if I find the right co-founder.
 Ideal Partner:
 Seeking someone proficient in SQL for handling large datasets and able to integrate OpenAI's API within such datasets (technical AI skills required). While I'm based in Berlin and prefer a European co-founder, it's not mandatory, but meeting in person is a must before we commit.
 Don't be afraid to DM me if intrigued! Together, we can make it happen. Let's revolutionize the sector!

 I've been using TF pretty much my whole deep learning career starting in 2017. I've also used it on Windows the entire time. This was never a major issue.
 Now when I tried (somewhat belatedly) upgrading from 2.10 to 2.13, I see the GPU isnt being utilized and upon further digging see that they dropped Windows GPU support after 2.10:
 "Caution: TensorFlow 2.10 was the last TensorFlow release that supported GPU on native-Windows. Starting with TensorFlow 2.11, you will need to install TensorFlow in WSL2, or install tensorflow or tensorflow-cpu and, optionally, try the TensorFlow-DirectML-Plugin"
 This is really upsetting! Most of the ML developers I know actually use Windows machines since we develop locally and only switch to Linux for deployment.
 I know WSL is an option, but it (1) can only use 50% RAM (2) doesnt use the native file system.
 I feel very betrayed. After sticking with, and even advocating for Tensorflow when everyone was (and still is) switching to PyTorch, TF dropped me! This is probably the final nail in the coffin for me. I will be switching to PyTorch as soon as I can :-(

I want to show different types of implementations, how those affect the final trained model, when to use which type of data preprocessing and things similar to this. It would be great if you can suggest me some topic, notebooks or datasets for the same. All the notebooks that show good implementation and affect of data preprocessing are absolutely welcome.
 Also, as this is **Keras** Community Day, I'll have to include more about data preprocessing using Keras and less about other libraries. 
 Also, if you could help me with this: I am confused between showing preprocessing using layers or doing the preprocessing without layers. I know this sounds vague, but if you have any idea about this, let me know.

 I’m Eli, and my co-founder and I built Beam to run workloads on serverless cloud GPUs with hot reloading, autoscaling, and (of course) fast cold start. You don’t need Docker or AWS to use it, and everyone who signs up gets 10 hours of free GPU credit to try it out.
 Here a few examples of things you can run on Beam:
  
Fine-tune a LLaMA LLM
 Transcribe videos with Whisper
 Train a custom stable diffusion model
  
Beam is built for a fast developer experience. We’ve felt that using Docker and AWS directly is too slow for iterative development. You’ll often find yourself making changes to your code and waiting 10 minutes for a new image to bu…]]></summary>

I’m getting tired trying to find matching stock footages for the videos. I was wondering if there is a way to do this using AI tools? Synthesia won’t do because it looks like a video narration, more than a video essay. Any suggestions would help. Thanks in advanced!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Someone asked me today "why are LLMs still non deterministic in their output when temperature is set to 0. Assume fixed model between runs on the same machine" 
 I was like WTF are you saying - the randomness in LLM comes from temperature - chat gpt etc.. might have other randomness in the process but we don't have exact info on this. What I know is that in a standard transformers architecture, temperature is the only parameter that can enduce non deterministic behaviour at inference time. 
 He was convinced that there was more to it "i spoke about this to other LLM experts and they also are not sure" 
 I'm like wtf - I start looking up online and do find some people who claim that temperature is not the only thing that influences stochasticity during inference, but I can't find an answer as to what it is exactly. 
 Anyone has a clue of what I am missing here? 
 Thanks!

 A composite of specialized Tsetlin machines that enables plug-and-play collaboration.
 I have a love-and-hate relationship with CIFAR-10/100. I love the datasets for the challenge. On the other hand, they are two datasets where Tsetlin machines have struggled with getting state-of-the-art performance. (The Tsetlin machine is a low-energy logic-based alternative to deep learning that has done well on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-2, and various NLP tasks.)
 I have been working for some time now on figuring out a solution, and this summer, I finally had a breakthrough: a new architecture that allows multiple Tsetlin machines to collaborate in a plug-and-play manner, forming a Tsetlin machine composite.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can a single layer neural network solve the XOR problem?
 Most answers say no, but with this one weird trick the answer is yes! And we don't even need a bias! The trick is to multiply the outputs of a single (2,2) linear layer. Here is how:
 class XorSolver(nn.Module): def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs) -> None: super().__init__(*args, **kwargs) self.layer = nn.Linear(2, 2, bias=False) # we don't even need a bias! def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor: z = self.layer.forward(x) y = z[:, 0] * z[:, 1] return y 
 This is the loss and model output after 5000 epochs:
 loss: 6.516383166399464e-08 Input: [[0. 0.] [0. 1.] [1. 0.] [1. 1.]] Model output: [0. 1. 1. 0.] Expected output: [0. 1. 1. 0.] Layer weight: [[-1.248097 1.2202195 ] [-0.80121976 0.81952316]] 
 The full implementation with training and inference - around 50 lines of code - can be found on GitHub.
 Why it works?
 Basically the model simulates a more sophisticated neuron which allows more interactions between the inputs.
 By multiplying the outputs of two neurons, we introduce a form of non-linearity that allows us to separate data that are not linearly separable, like in the XOR problem:
 f(x1, x2, w1, w2, w3, w4) = (x1 * w1 + x2 * w2) * (x1 * w3 + x2 * w4)
  
w1, w2 are learnable parameters of the first neuron
 w3, w4 are learnable parameters of the second neuron
 x1, x2 are inputs to the model

 I've recently been working on TurboZero, a vectorized implementation of AlphaZero where model inference, search (MCTS), and environment simulation all run in parallel on the GPU. I've also implemented a self-contained training/evaluation pipeline, along with a few environments. I've written a wiki and a starter notebook for those who want to dig deeper. 
 This project is similar to DeepMind's mctx, but supports MCTS subtree persistence (unnecessary for MuZero, which is what mctx was mainly built to support), is written with PyTorch rather than JAX, and can also stand on its own and train models end-to-end.
 I hope to continue to expand and improve upon this as time allows, and I hope someone here might find it useful or interesting! 
 This is my first major open-source project of any real substance and I still don't have tons of experience with RL, so any feedback/advice is greatly appreciated.

 To stay on top of the latest advancements in AI, look here first.

 The AI Tech Company Experiment
  
Brown University and several Chinese University researchers put ChatGPT-powered AI bots to the test by making them run a hypothetical software development company, ChatDev.
 The AI chatbots were given specific roles and allocated respective stages based on the traditional waterfall model encompassing designing, coding, testing, and documenting.
 AI 'employees' functioned with minimal human input to complete their parts of the software development process.
  
Impressive Results
  
Assigning 70 tasks to ChatDev led to the completion of the entire software development process in under seven minutes at a cost of less than one dollar on average.
 A stunning 86.66% of the generated software systems performed flawlessly.
 Despite some language model errors and biases, the study demonstrates AI's immense potential in automating tasks - a boon, especially to junior programmers around the world.
  
Broader Implications
  
Powerfully generative AI technologies like ChatGPT can perform specific job functions, saving time, and boosting productivity in several industries.
 While coders find such tools beneficial, it's also critical to note that limitations and biases do exist in AI models which could potentially affect the software creation process.

Obviously I don't want to train the full-sized models and then compare them, thats a waste of money. So I'm thinking of training smaller versions (~100M) and then comparing those instead.
 My question is there some sort of best practice for this? Some smaller multiple of your full model size where it is best to compare? Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, all,
 I'm working on a GPT-powered game where the characters speak using API calls.
 For this, I need an inexpensive vector database that does not require an API, or at least if it does, it leverages the OpenAI API. Also, this vector database must be runnable on consumer-grade gaming hardware with a small search space (let's say 10-50 entries in the DB).
 Also, I need to package it with the game somehow. My game is in the Godot engine which can use Python with a plug-in. Other approaches I was considering is having a second process communicate with the game through a socket. Ideally the vector DB solution would be easy to install - that is, I could package it with a .exe, and simply run both without the player having to download anything else.
 Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I'm currently tasked with something at my company that I'm facing some difficulty with because it's not in my domain. My company has a service where we provide video chatting to users and match users with others based on various features.
 Currently I've implemented a simple model where we have separate embedding matrices for each user feature, create a user representation by aggregating these features, and performing regression between two users. The way that regression works is that the final score output from the model would act as a "matching score" and we'll match user A with the highest other user.
 The problem is that obviously running inference on every single pair of users is very slow and I need to speed this up.
 Some methods I thought about were to either use a feature store or perform sampling on users so we're not running inference on the entire users, but I'm not sure if this is optimal.
 Just curious what other people who have tackled problems like these have done and looking for second opinions. Thanks.

Routing in Google Maps remains one of our most helpful and frequently used features. Determining the best route from A to B requires making complex trade-offs between factors including the estimated time of arrival (ETA), tolls, directness, surface conditions (e.g., paved, unpaved roads), and user preferences, which vary across transportation mode and local geography. Often, the most natural visibility we have into travelers' preferences is by analyzing real-world travel patterns.



Learning preferences from observed sequential decision making behavior is a classic application of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Given a Markov decision process (MDP) — a formalization of the road network — and a set of demonstration traject…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I've been working on an AI data marketplace platform for a few months now. Users can buy, sell, request, and subscribe to data/datasets (and soon even train their ML/AI models using other users' datasets). One of our key features is the request feature, which allows users to submit data requests for free. These requests include descriptions, required fields, geographical scope, budget etc... Once a request is posted, it's sent to numerous companies, organizations, and data vendors that have the potential to fulfill it.
 I understand how frustrating the data acquisition process can be, so I designed this platform to be your one-stop shop for all data-related transactions. You no longer have to spend weeks or months dealing with different vendors and companies through slow emails. With our platform, you can request, negotiate, and purchase data all in one place, and it's completely free to post a request, by the way.
 We've already achieved some successes, and we hope to help more people access the datasets they need. After all, the best AI models are built on diverse and differentiating data. We've had some notable achievements, and we're eager to see if we can fulfill even more interesting dataset requests!

With their recent development, large language models (LLMs) have been found to exhibit a certain level of Theory of Mind (ToM), a complex cognitive capacity that is related to our conscious mind and that allows us to infer another's beliefs and perspective. While human ToM capabilities are believed to derive from the neural activity of a broadly interconnected brain network, including that of dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) neurons, the precise processes underlying LLM's capacity for ToM or their similarities with that of humans remains largely unknown. In this study, we drew inspiration from the dmPFC neurons subserving human ToM and employed a similar methodology to examine whether LLMs exhibit comparable characteristics. Surp…]]></summary>

 I'm trying to create an alignment between source audio in a different language than the translated transcript. Essentially want to align the translated transcript with the word-level timestamps on an Audio, programmatically. I've tried to find different tools; some open-source ML models force alignment if the source audio and transcript language are the same. 
 My goal is to have audio in a dubbed language, which I generate using a translated transcript that has been originally transcribed from my audio. Alignment seems tough since languages are spoken at different rates, so I'm figuring out the best way to optimize alignment without having to speed up/slow down the audio too much for each sentence.

 The TTS quality is similar to Elevenlabs, and there are some sample clips on the home page.
 Stuff I'm working on:
 - Emotional speech (where you can select the emotion of the TTS). Right now you can already do it by putting the emotion in brackets: e.g. "[Angrily] Please go away!" but I want to make it better.
 - Music with vocals. Currently the model only generates instrumental music. I am retraining it/tweaking the model to allow for music with lyrics.
 - Faster Inference: Since I'm doing this all myself and I'm not rich, I don't have access to the best hardware. However, I am working on some optimizations like speculative decoding that should speed things up.
 Anyways, let me know if you have any questions/comments/feature suggestions/see any bugs! Feel free to DM me. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, we just released our new project/paper and we thought you all might find it useful!
 Our project (Kani) is a super lightweight and hackable alternative to frameworks like LangChain or simpleAIchat meant to help developers hook in callable functions or tools to chat models easily. With Kani, devs can write functions in pure python and just add one line (the @ai_function() decorator) to turn any function into an AI-callable function!
 Kani works with any model and has built-in tools for OpenAI, HuggingFace, LLaMAv2, Vicuna, and GGML with more to come. Kani also never does any prompt engineering under the hood and doesn't require learning complex library tools---all defaults are minimal and highly customizable.
 Check out our Colab for mini-examples of things like retrieval, web-search, model routing, etc. https://colab.research.google.com/github/zhudotexe/kani/blob/main/examples/colab_examples.ipynb

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Morgan Stanley Research has valued Tesla's soon-to-be-released Dojo supercomputer at up to $500 billion, potentially increasing the auto giant's valuation significantly. The financial institution believes Dojo’s applications will go beyond Tesla's Full-Self Driving (FSD) capabilities.
 To stay on top of the latest advancements in AI, look here first.
 https://preview.redd.it/yhia3c5f1vnb1.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7adf40e7b868a4fbf6eb3d696132652f4f549f23
 Morgan Stanley's Bullish Prediction on Dojo
  
Morgan Stanley has suggested that Dojo might not just enhance Tesla's FSD technology, but could find use in other devices that make real-time decisions based on a visual field.
 Apart from raising Tesla’s valuation, this could potentially open up new markets for the company.
 Following this, Morgan Stanley has increased its target price for Tesla shares from $250 to $400 each.
  
Dojo Supercomputer Overview
  
Tesla has developed Dojo in-house, diverging from conventional AI accelerators and involving its own computing, networking, IO, and instruction set.
 At the heart of Dojo is the D1 AI accelerator processor, containing 354 custom CPU cores. Twenty-five D1 chips are combined to create a Dojo training tile, which could expedite Tesla’s move towards earning revenue from vehicle software.
  
Future Plans and Implications
  
Tesla could potentially become an AI-as-a-service provider to automakers in need of FSD capabilities with Dojo.
 As the development of Dojo continues, Tesla has invested in alternative AI infrastructures, including a cluster of 10,000 of Nvidia's most potent H100 accelerators.

 The way i understand it there are 3 main methods which are compatible with different backends (the backend part is still quite confusing to me). What is the core diference between what the methods do and the backends? What are some core diferences between the backends? What is the main distinction between GPTQ and NF4? How does NF4 relate to QLoRa, is it the same or is it just a small part of QLoRa?
 Thanks in advance and i apologize for any ignorance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, everyone,
 I'm currently working on a computer vision project using the Oxford Pets Dataset, which consists of 37 different pet categories. I initially used a pre-trained ViT model with ImageNet weights model=vit_b_32(ViT_B_32_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V1), and it gave me an impressive accuracy of 88%. However, I want to modify the architecture of the ViT model and train it from scratch without relying on ImageNet weights.
 I'm aware that ViT models are data-hungry and that training from scratch (model=vit_b_32( )) can be challenging, especially with limited data. I've already applied data augmentation techniques to enhance my dataset, but I'm still struggling to achieve satisfactory results. My accuracy is currently only 7%.
 I'd appreciate any advice or tips from the community on how I can improve the performance of my scratch-trained ViT model. Are there any specific training strategies, hyperparameters, or architectural modifications that I should consider? How can I make the most out of my limited dataset to boost accuracy?
 Thank you in advance for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Somewhere in the world there's a person who is the smartest. Why stop there? There are ten people who are the smartest. And if they are on the Internet, AI will find them.
 Perhaps not yet. It probably needs to get smarter. Maybe by Gemini. Or GPT-5. But eventually an AI will analyze all of the content on the Internet, and determine from that data who are the ten most intelligent people on the planet, (whose material is online).
 Of course if AI can determine the top ten, it can certainly determine the top 100, and the top 1,000, and even the top 100,000. I suppose when that happens there will be a lot more human brain power available to solve our problems. Although by then AI will be solving them far better than we could, haha. 
 But think about it for a minute. There are very smart people out there who don't publish in traditional mass media channels. The geniuses among us who don't fit in so well, and are therefore resigned to the margins, remaining unrecognized. 
 Wouldn't it be great if AI discovered them, and gave them the validation they deserve? Wouldn't it be great to find out who they are so that they can better work on whatever.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been working on a simple ML classifier that predicts the size of a piece of clothing based in user body specifications (such as height, weight, age, etc). As we want to move the model to production, I’m keen on understanding the best strategies to evaluate its performance in a real-world setting.
 This is a small example of how we would “tag” our recommendations:
  
If the model predicts a size M, and the user buys and keeps it, it’s a correct prediction
 If the user buys and M and returns it due to size issues, it’s incorrect
 If the user buys a different size, returns it, and then buys the size initially recommended, it’s counted as correct.
  
Additionally since we cache user input data, when they visit the same product after a while, or if they visit different product pages, they don’t need to re-input. We need to determine if they looked at this recommendation or if they even took it into account, especially if some time has passed since the original recommendation was made.
 Main questions I have: 1. What scenarios might I be missing when tagging incorrect/correct predictions 2. How would you approach the data tagging issue in this context? 3. What would be the best strategy to determine if a recommendation was considered by the user or if it’s too old to be reliable?
 I’ve gotten some insights already but would love to hear more perspectives. Any feedback, experiences, or even related research would be much appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI, with its vast resource needs, is raising concerns over sustainability and environmental impact. Last year, Microsoft's data centers drained over 2,500 Olympic-sized swimming pools worth of water, reflecting a 34% increase from the previous year. Google also reported a 20% water consumption increase over the same period.
 To stay on top of the latest advancements in AI, look here first.

 A deeper look at AI's water footprint
  
The growth of AI and related technologies increases the need for vast server farms, which depend heavily on water for cooling purposes.
 The spike in water usage can be attributed primarily to AI, as per Shaolei Ren, a researcher at the UC, Riverside, who focuses on AI's environmental impact.
 For every 5 to 50 prompts submitted to ChatGPT, it consumes about 500 ml of water, according to an upcoming paper from Professor Ren's team.
  
Big Tech and Responsible Water Usage
  
Recognizing their significant water consumption, tech companies like Google have voiced concerns and are exploring ways to mitigate the negative effects.
 Google has committed to responsible water usage, which includes assessing where and how their water usage might affect surrounding areas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 "Hallucinations" seem to be one of the major blockers to the adoption of LLMs, especially in enterprise settings where seemingly plausible but false information/decisions can be disastrous.
 I am wondering whether or not current LLMs, like GPT4 or Llama 2 70b have reached the reasoning capabilities to be able not to hallucinate when fed the proper information.
 One can see a LLMs as college / high school students that have some basic reasoning and knowledge but might need to be nudged to answer business / scientific questions.
 What is your opinion on the topic? Is there for instance, a database of hallucinations, so that one could test that if the model would have answered properly if the right context was fed in the prompt?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've consulted all the AIs and all of the search engines I could think of and am still coming up short. 
 I'm pretty sure I just didn't make this up, somewhere between 2005 and 2015 there was a paper where the authors describe a method for using silicon neuron forests to predict traffic patterns. 
 They etched silicon columns onto a wafer and then submerged the wafer in an ionic solution. They sent electrical signals into the column array and recorded the output. As the signal was allowed to interact with the silicon in solution, the columns would begin to form small conductive tendrils or filaments to neighboring pillars. These filaments formed a neural network, which could be used to predict traffic patterns.
 I'm sure there were at least 2 papers that came out about this subject, but for the life of me I cannot find them. I've spent many many hours looking for at least one of the papers and am hoping for a longshot...that some kind internet stranger comes across this and can point me in the right direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Please let me know if there is a better sub for this!
 I trained a local voice model of my father, who recently passed away. He was a musician, and I found a handful of songs he had recorded in the 80's. Unfortunately but I only have a copy coming from an audio cassette, which I've digitized. There may be a copy on open reel somewhere in our basement but I haven't found it so far.
 Any, because dad was always writing and recording new songs, my training dataset consists of all original, high quality vocal stems at 96khz/24bit, spanning at least 20 years and consisting of about 30 ish minutes of audio. I also tried starting over but with a speech he gave as additional training, coming out to around 55 minutes of audio.
 I wanted to use his voice model to essentially remaster his original vocals from the cassette audio, and rerecord the rest of the instruments myself. I isolated the vocals using UVR (also tried mdx23), and tried to clean it up further as much as possible.
 The RVC vocals comes out alright, but due to the low quality of the audio, it seems to mess up certain words, for example "free" comes out as "fee". The SVC vocals came out with a closer tonality, but had many more artifacts, and pitch had a tendency to go up/down 2 octaves at the end of certain phrases.
 When using a higher quality sample (like one of my own vocal tracks), these issues aren't so prevalent, although rvc seems to create more of a hybrid sounding timbre than svc, blending the original voice + model rather than just the sound of the model.
 Happy to post samples of input/output audio, let me know!
 tl;dr
 high quality training data, low quality inference audio. Voice model is the same voice as input audio,
 1. tips for making the best of what I've got?
 2. any way to use text along with input audio and maintain original vibrato?
 3. any way to train a UVR/MDX model using a particular voice in order to better isolate that person?
 thanks :)

 Github: https://github.com/ysymyth/awesome-language-agents 
 Twitter: https://twitter.com/ShunyuYao12/status/1699396834983362690 
 Abstract: 
  
Recent efforts have incorporated large language models (LLMs) with external resources (e.g., the Internet) or internal control flows (e.g., prompt chaining) for tasks requiring grounding or reasoning. However, these efforts have largely been piecemeal, lacking a systematic framework for constructing a fully-fledged language agent. To address this challenge, we draw on the rich history of agent design in symbolic artificial intelligence to develop a blueprint for a new wave of cognitive language agents. We first show that LLMs have many of the same properties as production systems, and recent efforts to improve their grounding or reasoning mirror the development of cognitive architectures built around production systems. We then propose Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents (CoALA), a conceptual framework to systematize diverse methods for LLM-based reasoning, grounding, learning, and decision making as instantiations of language agents in the framework. Finally, we use the CoALA framework to highlight gaps and propose actionable directions toward more capable language agents in the future.

 Here is my main code:
 gymnasium.env = snakeEnv() # data_manager = snakeEnv.get_data_manager() # Create an A2C model model = A2C("MlpPolicy", gymnasium.env, verbose=1, device="cuda") # Train the model (replace 'total_timesteps' with appropriate values) model.learn(total_timesteps=100_000, log_interval=1000) 
 Here is the relevant code in my agent file:
 class snakeEnv(gym.Env): def __init__(self): super(snakeEnv, self).__init__() # Define action and observation space # They must be gym.spaces objects # Example when using discrete actions: self.initNames() self.action_space = spaces.Discrete(3) self.gameCount = 0 self.record = 0 self.reward = 0 self.score = 0 self.game = SnakeGameAI(self.selectedChallenge) self.observation_space = spaces.Box(low=-1000, high=1000, shape=(11,), dtype=np.uint8) def step(self, action): self.reward, self.done, self.score = self.game.play_step(action) self.observation = self.getState(self.game) self.info = {} return self.observation, self.reward, self.done, self.info def reset(self): self.gameCount += 1 self.data_manager.logData(self.gameCount, self.score, self.record, self.reward, self.game.getDeathReason(),self.game.getHeadPos()) self.game.reset() observation = self.getState(self.game) if self.score > self.record: self.record = self.score return observation 
 It would be nice to be able to log the data in the reset function. I know how work with xslx files, the main things is just being able to get the model data.

 Explanation:
 An AI-driven compliance system ensuring adherence to evolving regulations, minimizing risks, and enabling businesses to operate confidently within legal boundaries. Pairing Large Language Models (LLMs) with blockchain technology to offer a range of benefits, particularly in the context of regulatory compliance.
 LLMs, powered by advanced natural language processing and machine learning capabilities, can enhance regulatory compliance processes in several ways. Firstly, they can automate the analysis of regulatory documents, helping businesses stay updated with evolving compliance requirements. LLMs can also assist in generating compliance reports, simplifying complex legal language into
 understandable summaries. Furthermore, by integrating LLMs into smart contracts, businesses
 can ensure that contract terms adhere to regulatory guidelines automatically.
 The integration of LLMs with blockchain can significantly improve regulatory compliance by automating document analysis, simplifying legal language, monitoring compliance in real-time, and enhancing customer interactions—all contributing to greater efficiency and accuracy in adhering to
 regulatory standards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone!
 I want to develop a DRL agent to play a turn-based 1v1 game and I'm starting to plan how to handle things in the future.
 One potential problem that I thought of is that there is a possible mid turn one-sided decision. An abstraction of the game would be like:
 There are two players: player A and player B. At the start of each turn, each player chooses an action between 3 possible actions. If player A chose a specific action (let's say action 1), the game asks player B to make a decision (let's say block or not block) and vice versa. Actions are calculated. Next turn starts.
 What would be a good approach to handle that? I thought of two possible solutions: 1. Anticipate the possibility of that mid turn decision beforehand adding a new dimension to the actions space (e.g. take action 3; if opponent takes action 1, block). That sounds that it could create credit assignment problems e.g. giving credit to the second action when it actually didn't happen. 2. Make two policies with shared value functions. That sounds complicated and I saw that previous works like DeepNash actually did that, but I don't know what problems could arise from that.
 Opinions/suggestions? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently trying to learn about how autodiff is used in gradient calculations. In the all sources I've came across, none can explicitly point to an authoritative, consistent or complete source on autodiff. I don't need examples of autodiff, I just need the full, generalized algorithm laid out.
 For example:
 I open this link: https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/spragunr/CS445/lectures/autodiff/autodiff.pdf which simply provides autodiff applied on an example, but not the description of the algorithm.
 The author of that link says if I need any more info, I should go to this other link: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/224140/step-by-step-example-of-reverse-mode-automatic-differentiation/235758#235758
 But this link doesn't even have topological sort as part of the operation. Therefore these descriptions of the autodiff is inconsistent and leaves me not knowing who to trust.
 Can someone point to some original paper on autodiff or a single source that describes this algorithm fully?
 I note here that this situation is completely different from backpropagation. The full backpropagation algorithm is impeccably laid out in peer-reviewed text books such as Learning from Data by Mustafa et al. and Optimization textbook by Chong and Zak. Furthermore, the algorithm defined in these two books are completely consistent with one another.

 Researchers at MIT and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute have developed an innovative AI-powered model called OncoNPC, designed to assist in identifying the origin of tumors in cancer patients where the primary site is unknown. For a small percentage of cancer patients, pinpointing the origin of their cancer can be incredibly challenging, making it difficult to select the most appropriate treatment, as many cancer drugs are designed for specific cancer types.
 Using machine learning, the researchers created OncoNPC, a computational model capable of analyzing the genetic sequences of approximately 400 genes. This model, based on genetic data routinely collected at Dana-Farbe…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I need to segment some short strings, they are about 100 tokens in length (BERT tokens), or 20-40 words. 1 segment per text.
 I'm currently using Spacy first, and if it fails, then use BERT. It's alright, but BERT is not really up to par to what I hope for. I'm wondering if there is some better use, as this is my first NLP project. I've trained the huggingface BertForTokenClassification to label the text as either part of segment, or not part. So binary token classification, then smooth out outliers and pick the longest segment of each text. Each string has only 1 segment.
 I've trained the BERT with 500 examples. I can easily make more train data, though training on my laptop takes time. If there are better/alternative approaches, I'd love to hear them. Regex rules etc. don't apply, which is why I'm using DL models. Especially I feel like I should segment the whole segment at a time, not by token.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to take a second to express my appreciation for the Folktables datasets!
 Folktables is a Python package that contains datasets derived from US Census data. The datasets cover topics about income, employment, health, transportation, and housing. They are quite useful for studying the effects of distribution shifts on ML models.
 For example, one could design experiments to:
 1. Study the model's performance under geographic distribution shifts:
 Each prediction problem in Folktables can be instantiated with data from every US state. So one could use Folktables to study questions around geographic distribution shifts. For example, we can train a classifier using data from California and then evaluate it on data from Michigan.
 2. Study the model's performance under temporal distribution shifts.
 Folktables contains data for several years, which in itself constitutes a form of temporal distribution shift. So, we can train a classifier using employment data from California in 2014 and evaluate how its equality of opportunity violation or accuracy varies over time.
 Finding non-synthetic (and open-access) datasets that exhibit these behaviors is so hard! Yet, it's quite easy to encounter them in production environments. 🫠
 So, big kudos to the UC Berkeley and Toyota Research Institute research teams for crafting these datasets.

 I read a book "Small unmanned aircraft: theory and practice" and watched few videos on YouTube that are reffering to this particular book. But there is a thing in correction step that I do not fully understand. To be clear, the correction looks as follows: x = x_(t-1) + K*(z - h(x))
 Both in the book and in videos, the state vector "x" is [roll, pitch]. But "z" and "h(x)" are the actual and predicted accelerometer readings [ax, ay, az]. So it looks to me, that they try to correct prediction of angles with readings in acceleration: [roll, pitch] = [roll, pitch]_(t-1) + K*[ax, ay, az].
 What am I missing?

 The Result: Transcribed 137 days of audio in 15 hrs for just $117.
 Traditionally, utilizing a managed service like AWS Transcribe would set you back about $10,500 for transcribing the entirety of the English CommonVoice dataset.
 Using a custom model? That’s an even steeper $13,134.
 In contrast, our approach using Whisper on a distributed cloud cost just $117, achieving the same result.

 I wrote CNN using tensor flow to predict phenotypes (cognitive impairment (0/1) and language ability (0-3)) from .vcf files.
 I transformed the .vcf into tabular format and after determining which columns to keep, I have
 Chromosome Position Mutation (taken from ref/alt columns) Genotype
 And merged it with the phenotype data so basically every row has the cog and language scores.
 I feel like this is a bad way to go about doing this since the model is likely predicting cog/language scores for each mutation rather than each patient as a whole. Am I wrong? How can I fix this so it’s more of a composite of all mutations per subject that the model trains on?
 Thanks!

 To stay on top of the latest advancements in AI, look here first.
 https://preview.redd.it/ts4a6reeuinb1.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=940be18b0c5f13e2762e1664a96274b314fe00df
 Meta’s vision for its new AI model
  
Meta's aim is to create a powerful chatbot in line with OpenAI’s GPT-4 capabilities.
 The company has reportedly been in pursuit of Nvidia H100 AI-training chips and is amplifying its infrastructure.
 The idea is to independently train its new model without outsourcing to platforms like Microsoft's Azure.
  
Efforts and roadblocks
  
Meta plans to begin the training of this LLM early in 2024, emphasizing free access for companies.
 Despite its grand vision, Meta has encountered obstacles like researcher attrition and contentious resource allocation amidst multiple LLM projects.
 Noteworthy is the intense competition from major players such as Apple, Google, and Amazon to integrate widely generative AI in their user interface.
  
Broader implications
  
While OpenAI has not immediately revealed plans for a GPT-5, other tech giants are investing heavily. Apple's investment in its "Ajax" AI model signifies the increasing race to advanced AI.
 This move by Meta represents the ongoing trend of tech conglomerates expanding in the AI space, a fact revealed through Google and Microsoft’s use of AI in their productivity tools and Amazon's ongoing developments.

I'm primarily interested in extracting specific events or insights, such as security incidents or device malfunctions. The conventional method would be to use regular expressions to filter out relevant information since the logs are structured, but I'm curious about leveraging Large Language Models for this task.
 I've experimented a bit with zero-shot learning for text summarization but didn't get satisfactory results. Before I invest more time into fine-tuning an LLM, I'd love to hear from anyone who has experience or advice on how to approach this problem.
 Could LLMs potentially make the process more efficient and effective? Any pointers or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Reddit,
 I'm working on a tool to pull data from highly irregular Excel files. I've gotten reasonable results which is extremely fast with standard Python coding, but it's far from perfect due to the lack of standardized templates. 
 Interestingly, when I tested ChatGPT-4 on a sample table, it did a decent job at data extraction. However, relying solely on GPT-4 has its downsides like token limits and slow processing speed (and data privacy issues). Plus, splitting the Excel sheet to fit within these limits results in loss of context and data.
 I'm considering fine-tuning a language model to post-process data that was in a Pandas DataFrame (perhaps converted to JSON). Has anyone had success with this approach or have alternative recommendations? I've tried Langchain, but it wasn't helpful.
 I have figured out to extract the relevant columns, but the post-processing part is where I am considering using an LLM which understands the domain and what needs to be extracted based on the examples I feed it.
 Looking forward to your thoughts! And would be happy to answer any additional questions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Tensorflow since 2017. I know it wasn't ideal or easy back then, but as an early adopter, I became very proficient with it and it has improved a lot since then. I have developed and deployed many custom models in low-level TF, both with and without utilizing the Keras abstractions. I am very comfortable with it in general.
 But I'm noticing now that Pytorch is gaining more popularity, all the younger practitioners, who got into deep learning within the last 3-5 years, are Pytorch adopters. I've also heard rumors that even googlers are also abandoning TF.
 I started playing around with Pytorch and as a TF expert, I couldn't help but getting annoyed at how far it is lagging behind in many abstractions and optimizations. I know things are getting better now with the Pytorch 2.0 and introducing some optimization such as the "compile" functionality, but still many of the pytorch project tools remain in beta such as Torchtext and I find many things very annoying, such as having to set the device and pass it on to layers if you want GPU acceleration, having to install Torchtext and other processing libraries separately, or having to use a Dataloader and the limited data type supports for torchdataset.
 Most people who have not mastered Tensorflow would not relate to my annoyance. Anyhow I'd really prefer to stay within my comfort zone and continue to develop and improve in TF, but if TF is dying, then I better not to, right? So should I convert? Is it indeed dying?

 I have just completed my MSc with really high marks and have published a paper on conversational agents. I have strong general machine learning and data analysis knowledge, strong knowledge of conversational agents and a specialism in reinforcement learning. Before returning to study, I worked for several years in engineering teams so I know how to get stuff done in a professional context too. 
 The only thing is, I have no idea how to actually find something that could be a day a week and pay a worthwhile day rate to help with crazy cost of living.
 Thank you for any tips!

 HF accelerate seems quite popular nowadays and looks nice. However, in the past I've invested in learning things like Pytorch-Lightning which look good in a minimal example, but actually add more annoyance than they're worth.
 Pytorch also can do these things, and the boiler plate doesn't look worse at a glance:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm an undergrad student working on a machine learning project about motor imagery classification for BCI. One requirement for the project is that I need to implement LIME an explainable AI tool on my model. I ran into a problem rather quickly as my model accuracy quickly decreases as I try and add more subjects to the training data, I'm the publicly avaliable EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset from physio.net. The features I'm currently using for training my model are SVD entropy, Spectral Entropy, Hjorth mobility , Hjorth complexity and CSP components after applying overlapping filter bank.
 One method I've been suggested is to train models seperately for each subject, I don't know how to go about this should I construct a new model for each subject or should I keep the architecture but reset the training weight, also would this defeat the purpose of implementing LIME in the first place.
 I'm wondering if there's a way to deal with inter-subject variability without having to make/ train models for each subject seperately.
 I'm sorry if the choice of features doesn't make much sense since I'm basically self-taught and I have no prior knowledge about EEG or BCI
 TLDR; how do I deal with inter-subject variability without having to make/ train models for each subject seperately.

 I have developed a library, called 100gecs, that makes hyperparameter tuning on LightGBM and CatBoost models trivially easy.
 Background
 LightGBM and CatBoost are gradient boosted tree models, like XGBoost, and in many cases the best baseline model in supervised learning tasks on tabular data. They work by iteratively fitting trees on data, with each subsequent tree "correcting" on some level the prediction of the prior tree. Here's a good intro, if you want some more background on these methods.
 Hyperparameter tuning promises an optimally or near-optimally configured model, thus enabling you to get the best baseline model you possibly can.

 100gecs provides custom child classes of LGBMClassifier, LGBMRegressor, CatBoostRegressor and CatBoostClassifier that can be …]]></summary>

 And, most importantly, how could new candidates (let's say recent MSc in Data Science, for instance) get into the industry? Through analyst/DE roles?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm attempting to address an issue related to electricity trading in the day-ahead market. The objective is to submit 24 bids for each hour. Each bid is represented as a vector of length 10, with 5 values indicating the price and the other 5 indicating the quantity of electricity. For instance, given a sample action vector [w, x, y, z, ...], it operates as follows: if the price is greater than w, buy/sell x units of electricity, if the price is greater than y, buy/sell z units of electricity, and so forth. I possess three years' worth of data, including crucial features like weather conditions, coal prices, wind speed, net load, forecasted load, locational marginal price, and more.
 Initially, I trained a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to tackle this problem, and it's performing quite well. However, the DQN provides a scalar action for each hour, neglecting price points. It acts regardless of the price. I'm aware that I can explore solutions like Proximal Policy Gradient to generate a vector action that includes both electricity unit amounts and prices.
 I have three questions:
  
Is it possible to solve this problem using Dynamic Programming techniques? While I understand it's not an exceedingly difficult problem, can I expect some results if I attempt to apply DP?
 
How challenging might it be to output a vector instead of a scalar, with the vector being monotonically increasing? What's the recommended approach for a problem of this nature? Is it worthwhile to explore RL and specifically Proximal Policy Optimization?
 
How would you approach such a problem while keeping it simple and avoiding unnecessary complexity? 
 
 Any guidance or insights would be greatly appreciated.

 Their AI aren't learning to play the game, they're learning to play the level.
 They'll put in 10s or 100s of hours reinforcing the level. It'll play over and over again, selecting for what works, and dropping what doesn't. And over time, the AI will be amazing at that level.
 But, if you take that reinforced data, and move to level 2 of that game... it'll be practically useless.
  
When humans play a game, say a brand new human who's never played video games before, we'll use reinforcement learning too. Most everything we do is reinforcement learning. Our brain works on reinforcement. …]]></summary>

 I'm a truck driver with a passion for creating music. While I'm familiar with basic IT tasks from my personal experiences, I'm new to the tech industry and am eager to break in.
 I've been exploring AI tools like ChatGPT and have become comfortable navigating GitHub. These experiences make me confident about diving into the tech field. After some research, I'm contemplating three domains:
  
Cloud Technology: It seems stable and beginner-friendly. I'm leaning here primarily because I've heard cybersecurity is saturated.
 Cybersecurity: Interested but cautious due to market saturation.
 Generative AI/Data: My true passion lies here, but I've gathered that projects matter more than certifications for entry-level roles in this niche, especially for someone without a degree.
  
Given my background and no technical degree, which field would you suggest I pursue? Should I focus on certifications before taking on projects? I genuinely appreciate any insights!
 (What do you guys think about this “CloudRoad map” is it good advice?)

 My Context:
 I have experience setting up linux systems, building computers by myself and training DL models (CNNs/GNNs/LLMs) in a corporate setting. I am venturing to the academic world where resources are more constrained and so I am wondering if there are any guides, tips on setting up a research computer lab that does AI. I do not expect to train from scratch an LLM but maybe finetuning an small LLM. I might also need to do a lot parallelizable IO work to preprocess data. I will talk with the IT department of the university but would like to have some ideas before that conversation.
 I would appreciate any tips or thoughts, particularly on:
 * How many GPUs/CPUs to buy? Balancing cost/compute.
 * Recommended software for managing resources.
 * Running 100s-1ks of CPU jobs in parallel.
 * Local compute cluster vs buying compute online.
 * Hyperparameter optimization and logging of metrics.
 * Anything else you can think of?

 Hi everyone, just wanted to share a dataset I've been working on for use in a personal project!
 GoodWiki is a 179 million token dataset of English Wikipedia articles collected on September 4, 2023, that have been marked as Good or Featured by Wikipedia editors. The dataset provides these articles in GitHub-flavored Markdown format, preserving layout features like lists, code blocks, math, and block quotes, unlike many other public Wikipedia datasets. Articles are accompanied by a short description of the page as well as any associated categories.
 Thanks to a careful conversion process from wikicode, the markup language used by Wikipedia, articles in GoodWiki are generally faithful reproductions of the corresponding original Wikipedia pages, minus references, files, infoboxes, and tables. Curated template transclusion and HTML tag handling have minimized instances where entire words and phrases are missing mid-sentence like in other public Wikipedia datasets.
 GoodWiki is more than 1.5 times larger (when compared using the same tokenizer) than the widely used WikiText-103 dataset by Merity et al., even after excluding article descriptions. Also limited to articles marked as Good or Featured, WikiText inspired GoodWiki.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The artificial intelligence technology behind ChatGPT was built in Iowa, specifically in the watershed of the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers.
 
Microsoft-backed OpenAI needed a lot of water to cool its powerful supercomputer as it taught its AI systems how to mimic human writing.
 
Leading tech developers like Microsoft, OpenAI, and Google have acknowledged the high costs associated with the growing demand for AI tools, including expensive semiconductors and increased water consumption.
 
Microsoft disclosed a 34% spike in global water consumption, largely attributed to its AI research.
 
A researcher estimates that ChatGPT uses 500 milliliters of water for every series of prompts or questions.

That being said, during deployment it is currently predicting 0 for all inputs regardless of how varied the inputs may be. However, during the testing phase my model had a varied accuracy rate of 75%-85%. I'm beginning to think that it is very likely that during the testing phase the model was predicting 0 for everything and just getting these higher accuracy rates because of the dominance of non-MVPs within my dataset. This all being said, I'm a noob to ML and decided it'd be best to come on here for help. Is that the likely reason and if so how do I go about fixing it? Furthermore, what other issues could cause this and how would I go about fixing it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for some ideas on Multi Agent RL that preferably involve Robotics. I've came up with two ideas based on essentially similar themes: 
 1) Multiple robots tasked with cleaning a large room (with obstacles)
 2) Multiple robots tasked with a search and rescue like mission in a particular area. 
 Both are basically applications of n agents trying to collectively cover a region. 
 Can someone recommend some frameworks and libraries that can allow me to simulate these ideas? Also, I'd love to hear some other ideas as well which use multi-agent RL for robotic applications. For now I'm only targeting a simulation based project. If I get time later I'd love to implement them on hardware as well. Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PostgresML takes Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) a step further, by running the models and vector (or btree) indexes in the same process space that also caches the data, so the retrieval step doesn't require any networking or data (de)serialization. This makes it significantly faster and more reliable than other architectures, which is important for online or interactive applications. For lack of a better term, I'm referring to this as Unified Retrieval Augmented Generation (URAG).
 The closest I can find to this in the literature is TABR which utilizes recall to improve the performance of LLMs relative to tree based models, although this particular application of Retrieval is extremely computationally expensive for a slight performance improvement, unlike RAG for LLMs that seems to provide significant new capabilities to the model.
 Is there more research going on for what I'd refer to as URAG systems? We're building open source Python & JS SDKs to make the underlying SQL API more accessible, but I'm wondering if this community, or the academic community has already done more work in this area that we should be aware of.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Based on a bit of research and a lot of gut feeling, I offer the following speculation:
  
if you self-trained an LLM with a Python interpreter or Java compiler in a feedback loop where it learned from its own mistakes then it could become dramatically better at coding. It's actually a miracle that they are "decent" at coding despite getting virtually no feedback from an interpreter or compiler.
 one could train not merely on input and output, but also on an execution trace so the LLM learned HOW the interpreter got the result
 one could also train the model on how to install and invoke open source software and thus it would learn about a variety of languages, versions and runtimes
 this might also improve its logical reasoning skills in general
  
Admittedly, running programs is a lot more expensive than doing simple next-word prediction on pre-existing texts.
 But on the other hand, a corpus of a million program executions can also be used to train future LLMs. You can keep the execution information forever and re-use it as traditional next-token prediction input.

She browses Twitter all day and writes tweets with her opinion of the stuff she comes by. With a unique mood generated for her every day, it's always a gamble to see who lands on her good or bad side.

 For ongoing research I'm defining a decision problem in the form of an MDP. In a simple form, this MDP can be solved via Dynamic Programming. Of course I would like to scale up my MDP by including a sensor simulation, which renders the MDP to such a complexity that my next step is to use a DQN.
 My challenge is that I'm not sure how to represent my more complex MDP in a fitting DQN. Quite frankly, the more I look into DQN's, the more I wonder if my MDP is correctly defined. It would be great to hear your views and suggestions if you like to share.

 The MDP aims at detecting and chasing away a mosquito. For each distance step (discrete distances although it should be continuous), for instance Si, we cycle through an episode: we detect the mosquito…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Article | Notebook | GitHub
 There are a rapidly growing number of options in the vector database space. One of the more recent developments is the creation of new vector index plugins for traditional database systems such as pgvector. This is reminiscent of the discussion back in the mid 2010s on whether one should use full text search in the database or sync with an external system such as Elasticsearch.
 Just as with full text search, it will be tough for vector indexing in the database to compete with the more dedicated solutions past the simple use cases. For example, according the ANN-Benchmarks, the dedicated vector solutions score much higher.
 The desire to reduce stack complexity and the maturity of systems like Postgres make strong arguments to try to find a way to do it all in the database.
 The referenced article above proposes a way to integrate existing databases like PostgreSQL with vector indexes such as Faiss, Hnswlib, external vector databases and even keyword indexes like Elasticsearch. This opens up the possibility of combining Postgres features such as fine-grained access control with the performance of a dedicated vector index.

The media frames AI regulation as a matter of technical knowledge rather than moral consideration.
 
The New York Times highlights the slow congressional response to new technologies and the potential influence of lawmakers' financial interests in AI companies.
 
The media fails to question why lawmakers, who have profited from AI, cannot apply their knowledge to regulate it.
 
This lack of critical information in news sources defends the inaction of lawmakers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working on clustering groups of almost identical (but time shifted) signals together. These clusters will have varying sizes, and I don´t know what the final number of clusters will be. The database consists of up to 100 thousand signals (represented by 4000 long vectors as read from individual text files) which are already quite similar to each other. 
 Ideally I would just make a huge cross-correlation matrix but that is too computationally expensive. So is DTW. What I have done is to apply the fast fourier transform to get it into the frequency domain and therefore get rid of that time shift. Then I would apply a clustering algorithm. I have tried DBSCAN and hierarchical agglomerative clustering which work relatively well but don’t scale well to datasets of this size. Affinity propagation is quick and works okish but I don’t know how to optimise it. 
 Does anyone have any recommendation on which algorithm to use and how to optimise it? Was my idea to apply the fft good? I am not a computer scientist so I am really out of my element.

( https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09533 ) The paper shows that simply applying PPO to the SMAC task to construct an IPPO (independent PPO) algorithm like IQL can surpass QMIX on SMAC. IPPO demonstrates the effectiveness of applying PPO to multi-agent systems.
 The paper further extends IPPO to MAPPO. The difference is that the critic of PPO uses the global state instead of the observation as input. Surprisingly, the global information does not enhance the actual performance of IPPO.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Data is the cornerstone of deep learning. This paper reveals that the
recently developed Diffusion Model is a scalable data engine for object
detection. Existing methods for scaling up detection-oriented data often
require manual collection or generative models to obtain target images,
followed by data augmentation and labeling to produce training pairs, which are
costly, complex, or lacking diversity. To address these issues, we
presentDiffusionEngine (DE), a data scaling-up engine that provides
high-quality detection-oriented training pairs in a single stage. DE consists
of a pre-trained diffusion model and an effective Detection-Adapter,
contributing to generating scalable, diverse and generalizable detection data
in a plug-and-play manner. Detection-Adapter is learned to align the implicit
semantic and location knowledge in off-the-shelf diffusion models with
detection-aware signals to make better bounding-box predictions. Additionally,
we contribute two datasets, i.e., COCO-DE and VOC-DE, to scale up existing
detection benchmarks for facilitating follow-up research. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that data scaling-up via DE can achieve significant improvements in
diverse scenarios, such as various detection algorithms, self-supervised
pre-training, data-sparse, label-scarce, cross-domain, and semi-supervised
learning. For example, when using DE with a DINO-based adapter to scale up
data, mAP is improved by 3.1% on COCO, 7.6% on VOC, and 11.5% on Clipart.]]></summary>

combining Federated Learning (FL) and graph models with respect to the
constrain of privacy and security. In order to make better use of the power of
graph model, some researchs also combine split learning(SL). However, there are
still several issues left unattended: 1) Clients might not be able to access
the server during inference phase; 2) The graph of clients designed manually in
the server model may not reveal the proper relationship between clients. This
paper proposes a new GNN-oriented split federated learning method, named node
{\bfseries M}asking and {\bfseries M}ulti-granularity {\bfseries M}essage
passing-based Federated Graph Model (M$^3$FGM) for the above issues. For the
first issue, the server model of M$^3$FGM employs a MaskNode layer to simulate
the case of clients being offline. We also redesign the decoder of the client
model using a dual-sub-decoders structure so that each client model can use its
local data to predict independently when offline. As for the second issue, a
new GNN layer named Multi-Granularity Message Passing (MGMP) layer enables each
client node to perceive global and local information. We conducted extensive
experiments in two different scenarios on two real traffic datasets. Results
show that M$^3$FGM outperforms the baselines and variant models, achieves the
best results in both datasets and scenarios.]]></summary>

studying biomolecules. At the same time, it is desirable to perform simulations
of a collection of particles under various conditions in which the molecules
can fluctuate. In this paper, we explore and adapt the soft prompt-based
learning method to molecular dynamics tasks. Our model can remarkably
generalize to unseen and out-of-distribution scenarios with limited training
data. While our work focuses on temperature as a test case, the versatility of
our approach allows for efficient simulation through any continuous dynamic
conditions, such as pressure and volumes. Our framework has two stages: 1)
Pre-trains with data mixing technique, augments molecular structure data and
temperature prompts, then applies a curriculum learning method by increasing
the ratio of them smoothly. 2) Meta-learning-based fine-tuning framework
improves sample-efficiency of fine-tuning process and gives the soft
prompt-tuning better initialization points. Comprehensive experiments reveal
that our framework excels in accuracy for in-domain data and demonstrates
strong generalization capabilities for unseen and out-of-distribution samples.]]></summary>

due to their superior capability in learning node embeddings for various graph
inference tasks, but training them can raise privacy concerns. To address this,
we propose using link local differential privacy over decentralized nodes,
enabling collaboration with an untrusted server to train GNNs without revealing
the existence of any link. Our approach spends the privacy budget separately on
links and degrees of the graph for the server to better denoise the graph
topology using Bayesian estimation, alleviating the negative impact of LDP on
the accuracy of the trained GNNs. We bound the mean absolute error of the
inferred link probabilities against the ground truth graph topology. We then
propose two variants of our LDP mechanism complementing each other in different
privacy settings, one of which estimates fewer links under lower privacy
budgets to avoid false positive link estimates when the uncertainty is high,
while the other utilizes more information and performs better given relatively
higher privacy budgets. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid variant that combines
both strategies and is able to perform better across different privacy budgets.
Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms existing methods in
terms of accuracy under varying privacy budgets.]]></summary>

to adverse weather effects to long-term social and economic impacts on
societies. Computer simulations of atmospheric dynamics are, therefore, of
great importance for the well-being of our and future generations. Here, we
propose AtmoRep, a novel, task-independent stochastic computer model of
atmospheric dynamics that can provide skillful results for a wide range of
applications. AtmoRep uses large-scale representation learning from artificial
intelligence to determine a general description of the highly complex,
stochastic dynamics of the atmosphere from the best available estimate of the
system's historical trajectory as constrained by observations. This is enabled
by a novel self-supervised learning objective and a unique ensemble that
samples from the stochastic model with a variability informed by the one in the
historical record. The task-independent nature of AtmoRep enables skillful
results for a diverse set of applications without specifically training for
them and we demonstrate this for nowcasting, temporal interpolation, model
correction, and counterfactuals. We also show that AtmoRep can be improved with
additional data, for example radar observations, and that it can be extended to
tasks such as downscaling. Our work establishes that large-scale neural
networks can provide skillful, task-independent models of atmospheric dynamics.
With this, they provide a novel means to make the large record of atmospheric
observations accessible for applications and for scientific inquiry,
complementing existing simulations based on first principles.]]></summary>

privacy-preserving machine learning methods have been proposed. In the
clustering domain, various algorithms with a federated learning framework
(i.e., federated clustering) have been actively studied and showed high
clustering performance while preserving data privacy. However, most of the base
clusterers (i.e., clustering algorithms) used in existing federated clustering
algorithms need to specify the number of clusters in advance. These algorithms,
therefore, are unable to deal with data whose distributions are unknown or
continually changing. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a
privacy-preserving continual federated clustering algorithm. In the proposed
algorithm, an adaptive resonance theory-based clustering algorithm capable of
continual learning is used as a base clusterer. Therefore, the proposed
algorithm inherits the ability of continual learning. Experimental results with
synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed algorithm has superior
clustering performance to state-of-the-art federated clustering algorithms
while realizing data privacy protection and continual learning ability. The

learning models tends to deteriorate. In practice, new input data tend to come

We suggest a novel approach that models how explanation characteristics shift

massive amounts of training data, medical image datasets are often limited in
diversity and size. Transfer learning has the potential to bridge the gap
between related yet different domains. For medical applications, however, it
remains unclear whether it is more beneficial to pre-train on natural or
medical images. We aim to shed light on this problem by comparing
initialization on ImageNet and RadImageNet on seven medical classification
tasks. Our work includes a replication study, which yields results contrary to
previously published findings. In our experiments, ResNet50 models pre-trained
on ImageNet tend to outperform those trained on RadImageNet. To gain further
insights, we investigate the learned representations using Canonical
Correlation Analysis (CCA) and compare the predictions of the different models.
Our results indicate that, contrary to intuition, ImageNet and RadImageNet may
converge to distinct intermediate representations, which appear to diverge
further during fine-tuning. Despite these distinct representations, the
predictions of the models remain similar. Our findings show that the similarity
between networks before and after fine-tuning does not correlate with
performance gains, suggesting that the advantages of transfer learning might
not solely originate from the reuse of features in the early layers of a
convolutional neural network.]]></summary>

of a limited capacity model (student) by pushing its responses to match a
powerful model's (teacher). Albeit useful especially in the penultimate layer
and beyond, its action on student's feature transform is rather implicit,
limiting its practice in the intermediate layers. To explicitly embed the
teacher's knowledge in feature transform, we propose a learnable KD layer for
the student which improves KD with two distinct abilities: i) learning how to
leverage the teacher's knowledge, enabling to discard nuisance information, and
ii) feeding forward the transferred knowledge deeper. Thus, the student enjoys
the teacher's knowledge during the inference besides training. Formally, we
repurpose 1x1-BN-ReLU-1x1 convolution block to assign a semantic vector to each
local region according to the template (supervised by the teacher) that the
corresponding region of the student matches. To facilitate template learning in
the intermediate layers, we propose a novel form of supervision based on the
teacher's decisions. Through rigorous experimentation, we demonstrate the

large language model (LLM)-based agents such as GPT-4. However, many commercial
conversational agent development tools are pipeline-based and have limitations
in holding a human-like conversation. This paper investigates the capabilities
of LLMs to enhance pipeline-based conversational agents during two phases: 1)
in the design and development phase and 2) during operations. In 1) LLMs can
aid in generating training data, extracting entities and synonyms,
localization, and persona design. In 2) LLMs can assist in contextualization,
intent classification to prevent conversational breakdown and handle
out-of-scope questions, auto-correcting utterances, rephrasing responses,
formulating disambiguation questions, summarization, and enabling closed
question-answering capabilities. We conducted informal experiments with GPT-4
in the private banking domain to demonstrate the scenarios above with a
practical example. Companies may be hesitant to replace their pipeline-based
agents with LLMs entirely due to privacy concerns and the need for deep
integration within their existing ecosystems. A hybrid approach in which LLMs'
are integrated into the pipeline-based agents allows them to save time and
costs of building and running agents by capitalizing on the capabilities of
LLMs while retaining the integration and privacy safeguards of their existing

making long-term fairness a crucial consideration. It has been shown that when
ignoring the long-term effect, naively imposing fairness criterion in static
settings can actually exacerbate bias over time. To explicitly address biases
in sequential decision-making, recent works formulate long-term fairness
notions in Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework. They define the long-term
bias to be the sum of static bias over each time step. However, we demonstrate
that naively summing up the step-wise bias can cause a false sense of fairness
since it fails to consider the importance difference of different time steps
during transition. In this work, we introduce a long-term fairness notion
called Equal Long-term Benefit Rate (ELBERT), which explicitly considers
varying temporal importance and adapts static fairness principles to the
sequential setting. Moreover, we show that the policy gradient of Long-term
Benefit Rate can be analytically reduced to standard policy gradient. This
makes standard policy optimization methods applicable for reducing the bias,
leading to our proposed bias mitigation method ELBERT-PO. Experiments on three
sequential decision making environments show that ELBERT-PO significantly
reduces bias and maintains high utility. Code is available at

weight tensors of deep learning models in order to reduce the number of
trainable parameters and computational complexity. However, due to high number
of new layers added to the architecture after applying LRD, it may not lead to
a high training/inference acceleration if the decomposition ranks are not small
enough. The issue is that using small ranks increases the risk of significant
accuracy drop after decomposition. In this paper, we propose two techniques for
accelerating low rank decomposed models without requiring to use small ranks
for decomposition. These methods include rank optimization and sequential
freezing of decomposed layers. We perform experiments on both convolutional and
transformer-based models. Experiments show that these techniques can improve
the model throughput up to 60% during training and 37% during inference when
combined together while preserving the accuracy close to that of the original

the principle that good models should exclude parameters beyond those minimally
required to describe the systems they represent. This is because redundancy can
lead to incorrect estimates of model parameters from data, and thus inaccurate
or ambiguous conclusions. Here, we show how deep learning can be powerfully
leveraged to address Occam's razor. FixFit, our new method, uses a feedforward
deep neural network with a bottleneck layer to characterize and predict the
behavior of a given model from its input parameters. FixFit has three major
benefits. First, it provides a metric to quantify the original model's degree
of complexity. Second, it allows for the unique fitting of data. Third, it
provides an unbiased way to discriminate between experimental hypotheses that
add value versus those that do not. In two use cases, we demonstrate the broad
applicability of this method across scientific domains. To validate the method
using a known system, we apply FixFit to recover known composite parameters for
the Kepler orbit model. To illustrate how the method can be applied to less
well-established fields, we use it to identify parameters for a multi-scale
brain model and reduce the search space for viable candidate mechanisms.]]></summary>

deep neural networks (DNNs) for perception have resulted in an increased demand
for their use in automated driving (AD) systems. The safety of such systems is
of utmost importance and thus requires to consider the unique properties of
DNNs.

In order to achieve safety of AD systems with DNN-based perception components
in a systematic and comprehensive approach, so-called safety concerns have been
introduced as a suitable structuring element. On the one hand, the concept of
safety concerns is -- by design -- well aligned to existing standards relevant
for safety of AD systems such as ISO 21448 (SOTIF). On the other hand, it has
already inspired several academic publications and upcoming standards on AI
safety such as ISO PAS 8800.

While the concept of safety concerns has been previously introduced, this
paper extends and refines it, leveraging feedback from various domain and
safety experts in the field. In particular, this paper introduces an additional
categorization for a better understanding as well as enabling cross-functional
teams to jointly address the concerns.]]></summary>

series, are gaining traction for their expansive influence. While there is keen
interest in their applicability within medical domains such as psychology,
tangible explorations on real-world data remain scant. Concurrently, users on
social media platforms are increasingly vocalizing personal sentiments; under
specific thematic umbrellas, these sentiments often manifest as negative
emotions, sometimes escalating to suicidal inclinations. Timely discernment of
such cognitive distortions and suicidal risks is crucial to effectively
intervene and potentially avert dire circumstances. Our study ventured into
this realm by experimenting on two pivotal tasks: suicidal risk and cognitive
distortion identification on Chinese social media platforms. Using supervised
learning as a baseline, we examined and contrasted the efficacy of large
language models via three distinct strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, and
fine-tuning. Our findings revealed a discernible performance gap between the
large language models and traditional supervised learning approaches, primarily
attributed to the models' inability to fully grasp subtle categories. Notably,
while GPT-4 outperforms its counterparts in multiple scenarios, GPT-3.5 shows
significant enhancement in suicide risk classification after fine-tuning. To
our knowledge, this investigation stands as the maiden attempt at gauging large
language models on Chinese social media tasks. This study underscores the
forward-looking and transformative implications of using large language models
in the field of psychology. It lays the groundwork for future applications in
psychological research and practice.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Accurate segmentation of punctate white matter lesions (PWMLs) are
fundamental for the timely diagnosis and treatment of related developmental
disorders. Automated PWMLs segmentation from infant brain MR images is
challenging, considering that the lesions are typically small and low-contrast,
and the number of lesions may dramatically change across subjects. Existing
learning-based methods directly apply general network architectures to this
challenging task, which may fail to capture detailed positional information of
PWMLs, potentially leading to severe under-segmentations. In this paper, we
propose to leverage the idea of counterfactual reasoning coupled with the
auxiliary task of brain tissue segmentation to learn fine-grained positional
and morphological representations of PWMLs for accurate localization and
segmentation. A simple and easy-to-implement deep-learning framework (i.e.,
DeepPWML) is accordingly designed. It combines the lesion counterfactual map
with the tissue probability map to train a lightweight PWML segmentation
network, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a real-clinical dataset
of infant T1w MR images. The code is available at

diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. An important metric of cardiac function is
the left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), where lower EF is associated with
cardiomyopathy. Echocardiography is a popular diagnostic tool in cardiology,
with ultrasound being a low-cost, real-time, and non-ionizing technology.
However, human assessment of echocardiograms for calculating EF is
time-consuming and expertise-demanding, raising the need for an automated
approach. In this work, we propose using the M(otion)-mode of echocardiograms
for estimating the EF and classifying cardiomyopathy. We generate multiple
artificial M-mode images from a single echocardiogram and combine them using
off-the-shelf model architectures. Additionally, we extend contrastive learning
(CL) to cardiac imaging to learn meaningful representations from exploiting
structures in unlabeled data allowing the model to achieve high accuracy, even
with limited annotations. Our experiments show that the supervised setting
converges with only ten modes and is comparable to the baseline method while
bypassing its cumbersome training process and being computationally much more
efficient. Furthermore, CL using M-mode images is helpful for limited data
scenarios, such as having labels for only 200 patients, which is common in
medical applications.]]></summary>

significant challenge for both model-based control systems and imitation
learning algorithms. The complexity arises from the need for multi-fingered
robotic hands to dynamically establish and break contacts, balance
non-prehensile forces, and control large degrees of freedom. Reinforcement
learning (RL) offers a promising approach due to its general applicability and
capacity to autonomously acquire optimal manipulation strategies. However, its
real-world application is often hindered by the necessity to generate a large
number of samples, reset the environment, and obtain reward signals. In this
work, we introduce an efficient system for learning dexterous manipulation
skills with RL to alleviate these challenges. The main idea of our approach is
the integration of recent advances in sample-efficient RL and replay buffer
bootstrapping. This combination allows us to utilize data from different tasks
or objects as a starting point for training new tasks, significantly improving
learning efficiency. Additionally, our system completes the real-world training
cycle by incorporating learned resets via an imitation-based pickup policy as
well as learned reward functions, eliminating the need for manual resets and
reward engineering. We demonstrate the benefits of reusing past data as replay
buffer initialization for new tasks, for instance, the fast acquisition of
intricate manipulation skills in the real world on a four-fingered robotic

for improving the interpretability and trustworthiness of machine learning
models. While saliency maps have stolen the show for the last few years in the
XAI field, their ability to reflect models' internal processes has been
questioned. Although less in the spotlight, example-based XAI methods have
continued to improve. It encompasses methods that use examples as explanations
for a machine learning model's predictions. This aligns with the psychological
mechanisms of human reasoning and makes example-based explanations natural and
intuitive for users to understand. Indeed, humans learn and reason by forming
mental representations of concepts based on examples.

This paper provides an overview of the state-of-the-art in natural
example-based XAI, describing the pros and cons of each approach. A "natural"
example simply means that it is directly drawn from the training data without
involving any generative process. The exclusion of methods that require
generating examples is justified by the need for plausibility which is in some
regards required to gain a user's trust. Consequently, this paper will explore
the following family of methods: similar examples, counterfactual and
semi-factual, influential instances, prototypes, and concepts. In particular,
it will compare their semantic definition, their cognitive impact, and added
values. We hope it will encourage and facilitate future work on natural
example-based XAI.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adversarial examples, inputs designed to induce worst-case behavior in
machine learning models, have been extensively studied over the past decade.
Yet, our understanding of this phenomenon stems from a rather fragmented pool
of knowledge; at present, there are a handful of attacks, each with disparate
assumptions in threat models and incomparable definitions of optimality. In
this paper, we propose a systematic approach to characterize worst-case (i.e.,
optimal) adversaries. We first introduce an extensible decomposition of attacks
in adversarial machine learning by atomizing attack components into surfaces
and travelers. With our decomposition, we enumerate over components to create
576 attacks (568 of which were previously unexplored). Next, we propose the
Pareto Ensemble Attack (PEA): a theoretical attack that upper-bounds attack
performance. With our new attacks, we measure performance relative to the PEA
on: both robust and non-robust models, seven datasets, and three extended
lp-based threat models incorporating compute costs, formalizing the Space of
Adversarial Strategies. From our evaluation we find that attack performance to
be highly contextual: the domain, model robustness, and threat model can have a
profound influence on attack efficacy. Our investigation suggests that future
studies measuring the security of machine learning should: (1) be
contextualized to the domain & threat models, and (2) go beyond the handful of
known attacks used today.]]></summary>

for effective traffic management, public service, and urban planning. Despite
this importance, due to the limitations of urban sensing techniques, the data
quality from most sources is inadequate for monitoring crowd flow at each POI.
This renders the inference of accurate crowd flow from low-quality data a
critical and challenging task. The complexity is heightened by three key
factors: 1) \emph{The scarcity and rarity of labeled data}, 2) \emph{The
intricate spatio-temporal dependencies among POIs}, and 3) \emph{The myriad
correlations between precise crowd flow and GPS reports}.

To address these challenges, we recast the crowd flow inference problem as a
self-supervised attributed graph representation learning task and introduce a
novel \underline{C}ontrastive \underline{S}elf-learning framework for
\underline{S}patio-\underline{T}emporal data (\model). Our approach initiates
with the construction of a spatial adjacency graph founded on the POIs and
their respective distances. We then employ a contrastive learning technique to
exploit large volumes of unlabeled spatio-temporal data. We adopt a swapped
prediction approach to anticipate the representation of the target subgraph
from similar instances. Following the pre-training phase, the model is
fine-tuned with accurate crowd flow data. Our experiments, conducted on two
real-world datasets, demonstrate that the \model pre-trained on extensive noisy
data consistently outperforms models trained from scratch.]]></summary>

a generalization of quantum models to include a set of trainable parameters in

numerically demonstrate how TF models can learn generators with desirable

showcase the real-world effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating an
improved accuracy in solving the Navier-Stokes equations using a TF model with

modern approximation. These approaches are able to produce accurate
approximations to nonsmooth and non-Lipschitz functions, including multivariate
domain functions. In this paper we compare the efficiency of function
approximation using rational approximation, neural network and their
combinations. It was found that rational approximation is superior to neural
network based approaches with the same number of decision variables. Our
numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of rational approximation,
even when the number of approximation parameters (that is, the dimension of the
corresponding optimisation problems) is small. Another important contribution
of this paper lies in the improvement of rational approximation algorithms.
Namely, the optimisation based algorithms for rational approximation can be
adjusted to in such a way that the conditioning number of the constraint
matrices are controlled. This simple adjustment enables us to work with high
dimension optimisation problems and improve the design of the neural network.
The main strength of neural networks is in their ability to handle models with
a large number of variables: complex models are decomposed in several simple
optimisation problems. Therefore the the large number of decision variables is
in the nature of neural networks.]]></summary>

pronunciation. In this work, we perform AAI for dysarthric speech using
representations from pre-trained self-supervised learning (SSL) models. We
demonstrate the impact of different pre-trained features on this challenging
AAI task, at low-resource conditions. In addition, we also condition x-vectors
to the extracted SSL features to train a BLSTM network. In the seen case, we
experiment with three AAI training schemes (subject-specific, pooled, and
fine-tuned). The results, consistent across training schemes, reveal that
DeCoAR, in the fine-tuned scheme, achieves a relative improvement of the
Pearson Correlation Coefficient (CC) by ${\sim}$1.81\% and ${\sim}$4.56\% for
healthy controls and patients, respectively, over MFCCs. In the unseen case, we
observe similar average trends for different SSL features. Overall, SSL

arising in applications where data is recorded over time and over multiple
channels. For example, a smartwatch can record the acceleration and orientation
of a person's motion, and these signals are recorded as multivariate time
series. We can classify this data to understand and predict human movement and
various properties such as fitness levels. In many applications classification
alone is not enough, we often need to classify but also understand what the
model learns (e.g., why was a prediction given, based on what information in
the data). The main focus of this paper is on analysing and evaluating
explanation methods tailored to Multivariate Time Series Classification (MTSC).
We focus on saliency-based explanation methods that can point out the most
relevant channels and time series points for the classification decision. We
analyse two popular and accurate multivariate time series classifiers, ROCKET
and dResNet, as well as two popular explanation methods, SHAP and dCAM. We
study these methods on 3 synthetic datasets and 2 real-world datasets and
provide a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the explanations provided.
We find that flattening the multivariate datasets by concatenating the channels
works as well as using multivariate classifiers directly and adaptations of
SHAP for MTSC work quite well. Additionally, we also find that the popular

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is shown that a class of optical physical unclonable functions (PUFs) can
be learned to arbitrary precision with arbitrarily high probability, even in
the presence of noise, given access to polynomially many challenge-response
pairs and polynomially bounded computational power, under mild assumptions
about the distributions of the noise and challenge vectors. This extends the
results of Rh\"uramir et al. (2013), who showed a subset of this class of PUFs
to be learnable in polynomial time in the absence of noise, under the
assumption that the optics of the PUF were either linear or had negligible
nonlinear effects. We derive polynomial bounds for the required number of
samples and the computational complexity of a linear regression algorithm,
based on size parameters of the PUF, the distributions of the challenge and
noise vectors, and the probability and accuracy of the regression algorithm,
with a similar analysis to one done by Bootle et al. (2018), who demonstrated a
learning attack on a poorly implemented version of the Learning With Errors

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While recommender systems have significantly benefited from implicit
feedback, they have often missed the nuances of multi-behavior interactions
between users and items. Historically, these systems either amalgamated all
behaviors, such as \textit{impression} (formerly \textit{view}),
\textit{add-to-cart}, and \textit{buy}, under a singular 'interaction' label,
or prioritized only the target behavior, often the \textit{buy} action,
discarding valuable auxiliary signals. Although recent advancements tried
addressing this simplification, they primarily gravitated towards optimizing
the target behavior alone, battling with data scarcity. Additionally, they
tended to bypass the nuanced hierarchy intrinsic to behaviors. To bridge these
gaps, we introduce the \textbf{H}ierarchical \textbf{M}ulti-behavior
\textbf{G}raph Attention \textbf{N}etwork (HMGN). This pioneering framework
leverages attention mechanisms to discern information from both inter and
intra-behaviors while employing a multi-task Hierarchical Bayesian Personalized
Ranking (HBPR) for optimization. Recognizing the need for scalability, our
approach integrates a specialized multi-behavior sub-graph sampling technique.
Moreover, the adaptability of HMGN allows for the seamless inclusion of
knowledge metadata and time-series data. Empirical results attest to our
model's prowess, registering a notable performance boost of up to 64\% in
NDCG@100 metrics over conventional graph neural network methods.]]></summary>

However, learning the value function via bootstrapping often leads to unstable
training due to fast-changing target values. Target Networks are employed to
stabilize training by using an additional set of lagging parameters to estimate
the target values. Despite the popularity of Target Networks, their effect on
the optimization is still misunderstood. In this work, we show that they act as
an implicit regularizer which can be beneficial in some cases, but also have
disadvantages such as being inflexible and can result in instabilities, even
when vanilla TD(0) converges. To overcome these issues, we propose an explicit
Functional Regularization alternative that is flexible and a convex regularizer
in function space and we theoretically study its convergence. We conduct an
experimental study across a range of environments, discount factors, and
off-policiness data collections to investigate the effectiveness of the
regularization induced by Target Networks and Functional Regularization in
terms of performance, accuracy, and stability. Our findings emphasize that
Functional Regularization can be used as a drop-in replacement for Target
Networks and result in performance improvement. Furthermore, adjusting both the
regularization weight and the network update period in Functional
Regularization can result in further performance improvements compared to
solely adjusting the network update period as typically done with Target
Networks. Our approach also enhances the ability to networks to recover
accurate $Q$-values.]]></summary>

value. Those risk values can be robustly estimated via using the remarkable
Catoni's method (Catoni, 2012). Thanks to the structure of Catoni-type
influence functions, we are able to establish excess risk upper bounds via
using generalized generic chaining methods. Moreover, we take computational
issues into consideration. We especially theoretically investigate two types of
optimization methods, robust gradient descent algorithm and empirical
risk-based methods. With an extensive numerical study, we find that the

events over time. We ask a relatively basic question: how might we compare
these forecasters, either online or post-hoc, while avoiding unverifiable
assumptions on how the forecasts and outcomes were generated? In this paper, we
present a rigorous answer to this question by designing novel sequential
inference procedures for estimating the time-varying difference in forecast
scores. To do this, we employ confidence sequences (CS), which are sequences of
confidence intervals that can be continuously monitored and are valid at
arbitrary data-dependent stopping times ("anytime-valid"). The widths of our
CSs are adaptive to the underlying variance of the score differences.
Underlying their construction is a game-theoretic statistical framework, in
which we further identify e-processes and p-processes for sequentially testing
a weak null hypothesis -- whether one forecaster outperforms another on average
(rather than always). Our methods do not make distributional assumptions on the
forecasts or outcomes; our main theorems apply to any bounded scores, and we
later provide alternative methods for unbounded scores. We empirically validate
our approaches by comparing real-world baseball and weather forecasters.]]></summary>

a universal function approximator for generic antisymmetric functions, which
are ubiquitous in quantum physics. However, this procedure is a priori
factorially costly to implement, making it impractical for large numbers of
particles. The strategy also suffers from a sign problem. Namely, due to
near-exact cancellation of positive and negative contributions, the magnitude
of the antisymmetrized function may be significantly smaller than before
anti-symmetrization. We show that the anti-symmetric projection of a two-layer
neural network can be evaluated efficiently, opening the door to using a
generic antisymmetric layer as a building block in anti-symmetric neural
network Ansatzes. This approximation is effective when the sign problem is
controlled, and we show that this property depends crucially the choice of
activation function under standard Xavier/He initialization methods. As a
consequence, using a smooth activation function requires re-scaling of the
neural network weights compared to standard initializations.]]></summary>

security, especially in recent rampant research in security breach such as
adversarial/membership attacks. To this end, \textit{unlearnable examples}
(UEs) have been recently proposed as a compelling protection, by adding
imperceptible perturbation to data so that models trained on them cannot
classify them accurately on original clean distribution. Unfortunately, we find
UEs provide a false sense of security, because they cannot stop unauthorized
users from utilizing other unprotected data to remove the protection, by
turning unlearnable data into learnable again. Motivated by this observation,
we formally define a new threat by introducing \textit{learnable unauthorized
examples} (LEs) which are UEs with their protection removed. The core of this
approach is a novel purification process that projects UEs onto the manifold of
LEs. This is realized by a new joint-conditional diffusion model which denoises
UEs conditioned on the pixel and perceptual similarity between UEs and LEs.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LE delivers state-of-the-art countering
performance against both supervised UEs and unsupervised UEs in various
scenarios, which is the first generalizable countermeasure to UEs across
supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Our code is available at

comparing 2-dimensional algorithms and a multiway algorithm in Python. Results
indicate that multiway analysis is more expressive. Contrary to the intuition

the agreement between the reference annotation and the predicted segmentation.
Usually, overlap metrics, such as the Dice, are used as a metric to evaluate
the performance of these models in order for results to be comparable. However,
there is a mismatch between the distributions of cases and difficulty level of
segmentation tasks in public data sets compared to clinical practice. Common
metrics fail to measure the impact of this mismatch, especially for clinical
data sets that include low signal pathologies, a difficult segmentation task,
and uncertain, small, or empty reference annotations. This limitation may
result in ineffective research of machine learning practitioners in designing
and optimizing models. Dimensions of evaluating clinical value include
consideration of the uncertainty of reference annotations, independence from
reference annotation volume size, and evaluation of classification of empty
reference annotations. We study how uncertain, small, and empty reference
annotations influence the value of metrics for medical image segmentation on an
in-house data set regardless of the model. We examine metrics behavior on the
predictions of a standard deep learning framework in order to identify metrics
with clinical value. We compare to a public benchmark data set (BraTS 2019)
with a high-signal pathology and certain, larger, and no empty reference
annotations. We may show machine learning practitioners, how uncertain, small,
or empty reference annotations require a rethinking of the evaluation and
optimizing procedures. The evaluation code was released to encourage further
analysis of this topic.

Diagrammatic Teaching aims to teach robots novel skills by prompting the user
to sketch out demonstration trajectories on 2D images of the scene, these are
then synthesised as a generative model of motion trajectories in 3D task space.
Additionally, we present the Ray-tracing Probabilistic Trajectory Learning
(RPTL) framework for Diagrammatic Teaching. RPTL extracts time-varying
probability densities from the 2D sketches, applies ray-tracing to find
corresponding regions in 3D Cartesian space, and fits a probabilistic model of
motion trajectories to these regions. New motion trajectories, which mimic
those sketched by the user, can then be generated from the probabilistic model.
We empirically validate our framework both in simulation and on real robots,
which include a fixed-base manipulator and a quadruped-mounted manipulator.]]></summary>

(ITS), the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) plays a vital role in alleviating traffic
issues. Object detection is one of the key technologies in the IoV, which has
been widely used to provide traffic management services by analyzing timely and
sensitive vehicle-related information. However, the current object detection
methods are mostly based on centralized deep training, that is, the sensitive
data obtained by edge devices need to be uploaded to the server, which raises
privacy concerns. To mitigate such privacy leakage, we first propose a
federated learning-based framework, where well-trained local models are shared
in the central server. However, since edge devices usually have limited
computing power, plus a strict requirement of low latency in IoVs, we further
propose a sparse training process on edge devices, which can effectively
lighten the model, and ensure its training efficiency on edge devices, thereby
reducing communication overheads. In addition, due to the diverse computing
capabilities and dynamic environment, different sparsity rates are applied to
edge devices. To further guarantee the performance, we propose, FedWeg, an
improved aggregation scheme based on FedAvg, which is designed by the inverse
ratio of sparsity rates. Experiments on the real-life dataset using YOLO show
that the proposed scheme can achieve the required object detection rate while
saving considerable communication costs.]]></summary>

remarkable ability to generate fitting responses to natural language
instructions. However, an open research question concerns the inherent biases
of trained models and their responses. For instance, if the data used to tune
an LLM is dominantly written by persons with a specific political bias, we
might expect generated answers to share this bias. Current research work seeks
to de-bias such models, or suppress potentially biased answers. With this
demonstration, we take a different view on biases in instruction-tuning: Rather
than aiming to suppress them, we aim to make them explicit and transparent. To
this end, we present OpinionGPT, a web demo in which users can ask questions
and select all biases they wish to investigate. The demo will answer this
question using a model fine-tuned on text representing each of the selected
biases, allowing side-by-side comparison. To train the underlying model, we
identified 11 different biases (political, geographic, gender, age) and derived
an instruction-tuning corpus in which each answer was written by members of one
of these demographics. This paper presents OpinionGPT, illustrates how we
trained the bias-aware model and showcases the web application (available at

and image instruction tuning, different from which, our ImageBind-LLM can
respond to multi-modality conditions, including audio, 3D point clouds, video,
and their embedding-space arithmetic by only image-text alignment training.
During training, we adopt a learnable bind network to align the embedding space
between LLaMA and ImageBind's image encoder. Then, the image features
transformed by the bind network are added to word tokens of all layers in
LLaMA, which progressively injects visual instructions via an attention-free
and zero-initialized gating mechanism. Aided by the joint embedding of
ImageBind, the simple image-text training enables our model to exhibit superior
multi-modality instruction-following capabilities. During inference, the
multi-modality inputs are fed into the corresponding ImageBind encoders, and
processed by a proposed visual cache model for further cross-modal embedding
enhancement. The training-free cache model retrieves from three million image
features extracted by ImageBind, which effectively mitigates the
training-inference modality discrepancy. Notably, with our approach,
ImageBind-LLM can respond to instructions of diverse modalities and demonstrate
significant language generation quality. Code is released at

Quantized Q-Learning) converges to a limit, and furthermore this limit
satisfies an optimality equation which leads to near optimality with either
explicit performance bounds or which are guaranteed to be asymptotically

kernel and thus a quantized MDP as a partially observed Markov decision process
(POMDP), (ii) utilizing near optimality and convergence results of Q-learning
for POMDPs, and (iii) finally, near-optimality of finite state model
approximations for MDPs with weakly continuous kernels which we show to

of machine learning (ML). In practice, users are often interested in
multi-objective (MO) problems, i.e., optimizing potentially conflicting
objectives, like accuracy and energy consumption. To tackle this, the vast
majority of MO-ML algorithms return a Pareto front of non-dominated machine
learning models to the user. Optimizing the hyperparameters of such algorithms
is non-trivial as evaluating a hyperparameter configuration entails evaluating
the quality of the resulting Pareto front. In literature, there are known
indicators that assess the quality of a Pareto front (e.g., hypervolume, R2) by
quantifying different properties (e.g., volume, proximity to a reference
point). However, choosing the indicator that leads to the desired Pareto front
might be a hard task for a user. In this paper, we propose a human-centered
interactive HPO approach tailored towards multi-objective ML leveraging
preference learning to extract desiderata from users that guide the
optimization. Instead of relying on the user guessing the most suitable
indicator for their needs, our approach automatically learns an appropriate
indicator. Concretely, we leverage pairwise comparisons of distinct Pareto
fronts to learn such an appropriate quality indicator. Then, we optimize the
hyperparameters of the underlying MO-ML algorithm towards this learned
indicator using a state-of-the-art HPO approach. In an experimental study
targeting the environmental impact of ML, we demonstrate that our approach
leads to substantially better Pareto fronts compared to optimizing based on a
wrong indicator pre-selected by the user, and performs comparable in the case
of an advanced user knowing which indicator to pick.]]></summary>

maximum changes in the output concerning the input, taking into account
associated irrelevant biased factors. It is an efficient and provable method
for examining the output stability of machine learning models without incurring
additional computation costs. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which
operate on non-Euclidean data, have gained significant attention. However, no
previous research has investigated the GNN Lipschitz bounds to shed light on
stabilizing model outputs, especially when working on non-Euclidean data with
inherent biases. Given the inherent biases in common graph data used for GNN
training, it poses a serious challenge to constraining the GNN output
perturbations induced by input biases, thereby safeguarding fairness during
training. Recently, despite the Lipschitz constant's use in controlling the
stability of Euclideanneural networks, the calculation of the precise Lipschitz
constant remains elusive for non-Euclidean neural networks like GNNs,
especially within fairness contexts. To narrow this gap, we begin with the
general GNNs operating on an attributed graph, and formulate a Lipschitz bound
to limit the changes in the output regarding biases associated with the input.
Additionally, we theoretically analyze how the Lipschitz constant of a GNN
model could constrain the output perturbations induced by biases learned from
data for fairness training. We experimentally validate the Lipschitz bound's
effectiveness in limiting biases of the model output. Finally, from a training
dynamics perspective, we demonstrate why the theoretical Lipschitz bound can
effectively guide the GNN training to better trade-off between accuracy and
fairness.]]></summary>

novel Positive-Unlabeled Learning Tree (PUtree) algorithm. PUtree is designed
to take into account communities such as different age or income brackets, in
tasks of chronic disease prediction. We propose a novel approach for binary
decision-making, which hierarchically builds community-based PU models and then
aggregates their deliverables. Our method can explicate each PU model on the
tree for the optimized non-leaf PU node splitting. Furthermore, a mask-recovery
data augmentation strategy enables sufficient training of the model in
individual communities. Additionally, the proposed approach includes an
adversarial PU risk estimator to capture hierarchical PU-relationships, and a
model fusion network that integrates data from each tree path, resulting in
robust binary classification results. We demonstrate the superior performance
of PUtree as well as its variants on two benchmarks and a new
diabetes-prediction dataset.]]></summary>

crucial in planning its supply and consumption and optimizing the cost of
obtaining it, mainly by industrial entities. However, in times of threats to
its supply, it is also a critical element that guarantees the supply of this
raw material to meet individual consumers' needs, ensuring society's energy
security. This article introduces a novel multistep ahead forecasting of
natural gas consumption with change point detection integration for model
collection selection with continual learning capabilities using data stream
processing. The performance of the forecasting models based on the proposed
approach is evaluated in a complex real-world use case of natural gas
consumption forecasting. We employed Hoeffding tree predictors as forecasting
models and the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) algorithm for the change point
detection procedure. The change point detection integration enables selecting a
different model collection for successive time frames. Thus, three model
collection selection procedures (with and without an error feedback loop) are
defined and evaluated for forecasting scenarios with various densities of
detected change points. These models were compared with change point agnostic
baseline approaches. Our experiments show that fewer change points result in a
lower forecasting error regardless of the model collection selection procedure
employed. Also, simpler model collection selection procedures omitting
forecasting error feedback leads to more robust forecasting models suitable for
continual learning tasks.]]></summary>

accurately segment acute ischemic changes on non-contrast CT compared to
neuroradiologists. Non-contrast CT (NCCT) examinations from 232 acute ischemic
stroke patients who were enrolled in the DEFUSE 3 trial were included in this
study. Three experienced neuroradiologists independently segmented hypodensity
that reflected the ischemic core on each scan. The neuroradiologist with the
most experience (expert A) served as the ground truth for deep learning model
training. Two additional neuroradiologists (experts B and C) segmentations were
used for data testing. The 232 studies were randomly split into training and
test sets. The training set was further randomly divided into 5 folds with
training and validation sets. A 3-dimensional CNN architecture was trained and
optimized to predict the segmentations of expert A from NCCT. The performance
of the model was assessed using a set of volume, overlap, and distance metrics
using non-inferiority thresholds of 20%, 3ml, and 3mm. The optimized model
trained on expert A was compared to test experts B and C. We used a one-sided
Wilcoxon signed-rank test to test for the non-inferiority of the model-expert
compared to the inter-expert agreement. The final model performance for the
ischemic core segmentation task reached a performance of 0.46+-0.09 Surface
Dice at Tolerance 5mm and 0.47+-0.13 Dice when trained on expert A. Compared to
the two test neuroradiologists the model-expert agreement was non-inferior to

underwater acoustic data by leveraging a model trained on a broad spectrum of
non-underwater (aerial) sounds. Recognizing the challenge in labeling vast
amounts of underwater data, we propose a two-fold methodology to accelerate
this labor-intensive procedure.

The first part of our approach involves PCA and UMAP visualization of the
underwater data using the feature vectors of an aerial sound recognition model.
This enables us to cluster the data in a two dimensional space and listen to
points within these clusters to understand their defining characteristics. This
innovative method simplifies the process of selecting candidate labels for
further training.

In the second part, we train a neural network model using both the selected
underwater data and the non-underwater dataset. We conducted a quantitative
analysis to measure the precision, recall, and F1 score of our model for
recognizing airgun sounds, a common type of underwater sound. The F1 score
achieved by our model exceeded 84.3%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach in analyzing underwater acoustic data.

The methodology presented in this paper holds significant potential to reduce
the amount of labor required in underwater data analysis and opens up new
possibilities for further research in the field of cross-domain data analysis.]]></summary>

to proactively prevent any potential performance regression. However,
supervised drift detection methods require human annotation and consequently
lead to a longer time to detect and mitigate the drift. In our proposed
unsupervised drift detection method, we follow a two step process. Our first
step involves encoding a sample of production data as the target distribution,
and the model training data as the reference distribution. In the second step,
we employ a kernel-based statistical test that utilizes the maximum mean
discrepancy (MMD) distance metric to compare the reference and target
distributions and estimate any potential drift. Our method also identifies the
subset of production data that is the root cause of the drift. The models
retrained using these identified high drift samples show improved performance

are a type of IQ test that requires deriving an abstract "concept" from a set
of positive and negative "support" images, and then classifying whether or not
a new query image depicts the key concept. On Bongard-HOI, a benchmark for
natural-image Bongard problems, existing methods have only reached 66% accuracy
(where chance is 50%). Low accuracy is often attributed to neural nets' lack of
ability to find human-like symbolic rules. In this work, we point out that many
existing methods are forfeiting accuracy due to a much simpler problem: they do
not incorporate information contained in the support set as a whole, and rely
instead on information extracted from individual supports. This is a critical
issue, because unlike in few-shot learning tasks concerning object
classification, the "key concept" in a typical Bongard problem can only be
distinguished using multiple positives and multiple negatives. We explore a
variety of simple methods to take this cross-image context into account, and
demonstrate substantial gains over prior methods, leading to new
state-of-the-art performance on Bongard-LOGO (75.3%) and Bongard-HOI (72.45%)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In lending, where prices are specific to both customers and products, having
a well-functioning personalized pricing policy in place is essential to
effective business making. Typically, such a policy must be derived from
observational data, which introduces several challenges. While the problem of
``endogeneity'' is prominently studied in the established pricing literature,
the problem of selection bias (or, more precisely, bid selection bias) is not.
We take a step towards understanding the effects of selection bias by posing
pricing as a problem of causal inference. Specifically, we consider the
reaction of a customer to price a treatment effect. In our experiments, we
simulate varying levels of selection bias on a semi-synthetic dataset on
mortgage loan applications in Belgium. We investigate the potential of
parametric and nonparametric methods for the identification of individual
bid-response functions. Our results illustrate how conventional methods such as
logistic regression and neural networks suffer adversely from selection bias.
In contrast, we implement state-of-the-art methods from causal machine learning
and show their capability to overcome selection bias in pricing data.]]></summary>

Adversarial Neural Operator (GANO) that combines recent advancements in machine
learning and open access strong motion data sets to generate three-component
acceleration time histories conditioned on moment magnitude ($M$), rupture
distance ($R_{rup}$), time-average shear-wave velocity at the top $30m$
($V_{S30}$), and tectonic environment or style of faulting. We use Neural
Operators, a resolution invariant architecture that guarantees that the model
training is independent of the data sampling frequency. We first present the
conditional ground-motion synthesis algorithm (referred to heretofore as
cGM-GANO) and discuss its advantages compared to previous work. Next, we verify
the cGM-GANO framework using simulated ground motions generated with the
Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) Broadband Platform (BBP). We
lastly train cGM-GANO on a KiK-net dataset from Japan, showing that the
framework can recover the magnitude, distance, and $V_{S30}$ scaling of Fourier
amplitude and pseudo-spectral accelerations. We evaluate cGM-GANO through
residual analysis with the empirical dataset as well as by comparison with
conventional Ground Motion Models (GMMs) for selected ground motion scenarios.
Results show that cGM-GANO produces consistent median scaling with the GMMs for
the corresponding tectonic environments. The largest misfit is observed at
short distances due to the scarcity of training data. With the exception of
short distances, the aleatory variability of the response spectral ordinates is
also well captured, especially for subduction events due to the adequacy of
training data. Applications of the presented framework include generation of
risk-targeted ground motions for site-specific engineering applications.]]></summary>

the need to access the source data during the adaptation phase through a priori
inference of source prototypes. We conducted a series of comprehensive

three major personas among KG practitioners - KG Builders, Analysts, and

discover that KG Builders would benefit from schema enforcers, while KG
Analysts need customizable query builders that provide interim query results.
For KG Consumers, we identify a lack of efficacy for node-link diagrams, and
the need for tailored domain-specific visualizations to promote KG adoption and
comprehension. Lastly, we find that implementing KGs effectively in practice
requires both technical and social solutions that are not addressed with
current tools, technologies, and collaborative workflows. From the analysis of
our interviews, we distill several visualization research directions to improve

block-based computational neural network tailored for medical image
segmentation on IoT and edge platforms. Conventional U-Net-based models face
challenges in meeting the speed and efficiency demands of real-time clinical
applications, such as disease monitoring, radiation therapy, and image-guided

resource-constrained devices. The model's key innovation lies in its dual
multi-residual block architecture, which enables the extraction of refined
features on multiple scales, enhancing overall segmentation performance. To
further optimize efficiency, the number of filters is carefully selected to
prevent overlap, reduce training time, and improve computational efficiency.
The study includes comprehensive evaluations, focusing on segmentation of the
retinal image of vessels and hard exudates crucial for the diagnosis and
treatment of ophthalmology. The results demonstrate the robustness,
generalizability, and high segmentation accuracy of LDMRes-Net, positioning it
as an efficient tool for accurate and rapid medical image segmentation in
diverse clinical applications, particularly on IoT and edge platforms. Such
advances hold significant promise for improving healthcare outcomes and

address this challenge, the paper presents a convolutional neural network
architecture designed specifically for computationally constrained robotic

positions. The paper further integrates Early Exits into the existing
high-precision CNN architecture to reduce the computational cost of easily
rejectable cases in the background class. The training process involves a
composite loss function based on confidence and positional losses with dynamic
weighting and data augmentation. The proposed approach achieves a precision of
100% on the validation dataset and a recall of almost 87%, while maintaining an
execution time of around 170 $\mu$s per hypotheses. By combining the proposed
approach with an Early Exit, a runtime optimization of more than 28%, on

training, where the data remains on the client side (i.e., IoT devices), and
only model updates of clients are shared iteratively for collaborative
learning. However, this process is vulnerable to privacy attacks and Byzantine
attacks: the local model updates shared throughout the FL network will leak
private information about the local training data, and they can also be
maliciously crafted by Byzantine attackers to disturb the learning. In this
paper, we propose a new FL scheme that guarantees rigorous privacy and
simultaneously enhances system robustness against Byzantine attacks. Our
approach introduces sparsification- and momentum-driven variance reduction into
the client-level differential privacy (DP) mechanism, to defend against
Byzantine attackers. The security design does not violate the privacy guarantee
of the client-level DP mechanism; hence, our approach achieves the same
client-level DP guarantee as the state-of-the-art. We conduct extensive
experiments on both IID and non-IID datasets and different tasks and evaluate
the performance of our approach against different Byzantine attacks by
comparing it with state-of-the-art defense methods. The results of our

security in the modern world. Their ubiquity aids in monitoring suspicious
activities effectively. However, in densely populated environments, continuous
active monitoring becomes impractical, necessitating the development of
intelligent surveillance systems. AI integration in the surveillance domain was
a big revolution, however, speed issues have prevented its widespread
implementation in the field. It has been observed that quantum artificial
intelligence has led to a great breakthrough. Quantum artificial
intelligence-based surveillance systems have shown to be more accurate as well
as capable of performing well in real-time scenarios, which had never been seen
before. In this research, a RentinaNet model is integrated with Quantum CNN and
termed as Quantum-RetinaNet. By harnessing the Quantum capabilities of QCNN,
Quantum-RetinaNet strikes a balance between accuracy and speed. This innovative
integration positions it as a game-changer, addressing the challenges of active
monitoring in densely populated scenarios. As demand for efficient surveillance
solutions continues to grow, Quantum-RetinaNet offers a compelling alternative
to existing CNN models, upholding accuracy standards without sacrificing
real-time performance. The unique attributes of Quantum-RetinaNet have
far-reaching implications for the future of intelligent surveillance. With its
enhanced processing speed, it is poised to revolutionize the field, catering to
the pressing need for rapid yet precise monitoring. As Quantum-RetinaNet
becomes the new standard, it ensures public safety and security while pushing
the boundaries of AI in surveillance.]]></summary>

challenges in high-resolution generation. Through the lens of discrete cosine
transformation, we find the main reason is that \emph{the same noise level on a
higher resolution results in a higher Signal-to-Noise Ratio in the frequency
domain}. In this work, we present Relay Diffusion Model (RDM), which transfers
a low-resolution image or noise into an equivalent high-resolution one for
diffusion model via blurring diffusion and block noise. Therefore, the
diffusion process can continue seamlessly in any new resolution or model
without restarting from pure noise or low-resolution conditioning. RDM achieves
state-of-the-art FID on CelebA-HQ and sFID on ImageNet 256$\times$256,
surpassing previous works such as ADM, LDM and DiT by a large margin. All the

attributed the composition of data augmentations as a crucial factor for their
strong representation learning capabilities. While regional dropout strategies
have proven to guide models to focus on lesser indicative parts of the objects
in supervised methods, it hasn't been adopted by self-supervised methods for
generating positive pairs. This is because the regional dropout methods are not
suitable for the input sampling process of the self-supervised methodology.
Whereas dropping informative pixels from the positive pairs can result in
inefficient training, replacing patches of a specific object with a different
one can steer the model from maximizing the agreement between different
positive pairs. Moreover, joint embedding representation learning methods have
not made robustness their primary training outcome. To this end, we propose the
ViewMix augmentation policy, specially designed for self-supervised learning,
upon generating different views of the same image, patches are cut and pasted
from one view to another. By leveraging the different views created by this
augmentation strategy, multiple joint embedding-based self-supervised
methodologies obtained better localization capability and consistently
outperformed their corresponding baseline methods. It is also demonstrated that
incorporating ViewMix augmentation policy promotes robustness of the
representations in the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our
experimentation and analysis of compute times suggest that ViewMix augmentation
doesn't introduce any additional overhead compared to other counterparts.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Knowledge Distillation (KD) is one proposed solution to large model sizes and
slow inference speed in semantic segmentation. In our research we identify 25
proposed distillation loss terms from 14 publications in the last 4 years.
Unfortunately, a comparison of terms based on published results is often
impossible, because of differences in training configurations. A good
illustration of this problem is the comparison of two publications from 2022.
Using the same models and dataset, Structural and Statistical Texture
Distillation (SSTKD) reports an increase of student mIoU of 4.54 and a final
performance of 29.19, while Adaptive Perspective Distillation (APD) only
improves student performance by 2.06 percentage points, but achieves a final
performance of 39.25. The reason for such extreme differences is often a
suboptimal choice of hyperparameters and a resulting underperformance of the
student model used as reference point. In our work, we reveal problems of
insufficient hyperparameter tuning by showing that distillation improvements of
two widely accepted frameworks, SKD and IFVD, vanish when hyperparameters are
optimized sufficiently. To improve comparability of future research in the
field, we establish a solid baseline for three datasets and two student models
and provide extensive information on hyperparameter tuning. We find that only
two out of eight techniques can compete with our simple baseline on the ADE20K
dataset.]]></summary>

multimodal approaches often assume unchanged modalities from training stage to
inference stage. In practice, however, many scenarios fail to satisfy such

problem through reconstructing the missing modalities, it increases unnecessary
computational cost, which could be just as critical, especially for large,
deployed systems. To solve the problem from both sides, we propose a novel
guidance network that promotes knowledge sharing during training, taking
advantage of the multimodal representations to train better single-modality
models for inference. Real-life experiment in violence detection shows that our
proposed framework trains single-modality models that significantly outperform
its traditionally trained counterparts while maintaining the same inference

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The analysis of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is an important step
in remote sensing applications, and it is a challenging problem due to its
inherent speckle noise. One typical solution is to model the data using the
$G_I^0$ distribution and extract its roughness information, which in turn can
be used in posterior imaging tasks, such as segmentation, classification and
interpretation. This leads to the need of quick and reliable estimation of the
roughness parameter from SAR data, especially with high resolution images.
Unfortunately, traditional parameter estimation procedures are slow and prone
to estimation failures. In this work, we proposed a neural network-based
estimation framework that first learns how to predict underlying parameters of
$G_I^0$ samples and then can be used to estimate the roughness of unseen data.
We show that this approach leads to an estimator that is quicker, yields less
estimation error and is less prone to failures than the traditional estimation
procedures for this problem, even when we use a simple network. More
importantly, we show that this same methodology can be generalized to handle
image inputs and, even if trained on purely synthetic data for a few seconds,
is able to perform real time pixel-wise roughness estimation for high
resolution real SAR imagery.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Synthetic Time Series Generation (TSG) is crucial in a range of applications,
including data augmentation, anomaly detection, and privacy preservation.
Although significant strides have been made in this field, existing methods
exhibit three key limitations: (1) They often benchmark against similar model
types, constraining a holistic view of performance capabilities. (2) The use of
specialized synthetic and private datasets introduces biases and hampers
generalizability. (3) Ambiguous evaluation measures, often tied to custom
networks or downstream tasks, hinder consistent and fair comparison.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce \textsf{TSGBench}, the inaugural
TSG Benchmark, designed for a unified and comprehensive assessment of TSG
methods. It comprises three modules: (1) a curated collection of publicly
available, real-world datasets tailored for TSG, together with a standardized
preprocessing pipeline; (2) a comprehensive evaluation measures suite including
vanilla measures, new distance-based assessments, and visualization tools; (3)
a pioneering generalization test rooted in Domain Adaptation (DA), compatible
with all methods. We have conducted extensive experiments across ten real-world
datasets from diverse domains, utilizing ten advanced TSG methods and twelve
evaluation measures, all gauged through \textsf{TSGBench}. The results
highlight its remarkable efficacy and consistency. More importantly,
\textsf{TSGBench} delivers a statistical breakdown of method rankings,
illuminating performance variations across different datasets and measures, and
offering nuanced insights into the effectiveness of each method.]]></summary>

distortion-oriented baselines, including HiFiC, MRIC and DIRAC, while
performing almost on par with VTM-20.0 on the distortion end. EGIC is simple to
implement, very lightweight (e.g. 0.18x model parameters compared to HiFiC) and
provides excellent interpolation characteristics, which makes it a promising
candidate for practical applications targeting the low bit range.]]></summary>

several image analysis tasks in the computer-aided diagnosis scheme for
mammography. The training of an efficacious deep learning model requires large
data with diverse styles and qualities. The diversity of data often comes from
the use of various scanners of vendors. But, in practice, it is impractical to
collect a sufficient amount of diverse data for training. To this end, a novel
contrastive learning is developed to equip the deep learning models with better
style generalization capability. Specifically, the multi-style and multi-view
unsupervised self-learning scheme is carried out to seek robust feature
embedding against style diversity as a pretrained model. Afterward, the
pretrained network is further fine-tuned to the downstream tasks, e.g., mass
detection, matching, BI-RADS rating, and breast density classification. The
proposed method has been evaluated extensively and rigorously with mammograms
from various vendor style domains and several public datasets. The experimental
results suggest that the proposed domain generalization method can effectively
improve performance of four mammographic image tasks on the data from both seen
and unseen domains, and outperform many state-of-the-art (SOTA) generalization

new class of optimal-transport-regularized divergences, constructed via an
infimal convolution between an information divergence and an optimal-transport
(OT) cost. We use these as tools to enhance adversarial robustness by
maximizing the expected loss over a neighborhood of distributions, a technique
known as distributionally robust optimization. Viewed as a tool for
constructing adversarial samples, our method allows samples to be both
transported, according to the OT cost, and re-weighted, according to the
information divergence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on
malware detection and image recognition applications and find that, to our
knowledge, it outperforms existing methods at enhancing the robustness against
adversarial attacks. $ARMOR_D$ yields the robustified accuracy of $98.29\%$
against $FGSM$ and $98.18\%$ against $PGD^{40}$ on the MNIST dataset, reducing
the error rate by more than $19.7\%$ and $37.2\%$ respectively compared to

outcome, the "dose response", is relevant in a variety of domains, from
healthcare to business, economics, and beyond. Such effects, also known as
continuous-valued treatment effects, are typically estimated from observational
data, which may be subject to dose selection bias. This means that the
allocation of doses depends on pre-treatment covariates. Previous studies have
shown that conventional machine learning approaches fail to learn accurate
individual estimates of dose responses under the presence of dose selection
bias. In this work, we propose CBRNet, a causal machine learning approach to
estimate an individual dose response from observational data. CBRNet adopts the
Neyman-Rubin potential outcome framework and extends the concept of balanced
representation learning for overcoming selection bias to continuous-valued
treatments. Our work is the first to apply representation balancing in a
continuous-valued treatment setting. We evaluate our method on a newly proposed
benchmark. Our experiments demonstrate CBRNet's ability to accurately learn
treatment effects under selection bias and competitive performance with respect

both the graph structure and node features for learning discriminative node
representations. These skip connections are integrated by design in our

only to restart the process over again once new data becomes available. A much
cheaper and more efficient solution would be to enable the continual
pre-training of these models, i.e. updating pre-trained models with new data
instead of re-training them from scratch. However, the distribution shift
induced by novel data typically results in degraded performance on past data.
Taking a step towards efficient continual pre-training, in this work, we
examine the effect of different warm-up strategies. Our hypothesis is that the
learning rate must be re-increased to improve compute efficiency when training
on a new dataset. We study the warmup phase of models pre-trained on the Pile
(upstream data, 300B tokens) as we continue to pre-train on SlimPajama
(downstream data, 297B tokens), following a linear warmup and cosine decay
schedule. We conduct all experiments on the Pythia 410M language model
architecture and evaluate performance through validation perplexity. We
experiment with different pre-training checkpoints, various maximum learning
rates, and various warmup lengths. Our results show that while rewarming models
first increases the loss on upstream and downstream data, in the longer run it
improves the downstream performance, outperforming models trained from

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper introduces the Trinary decision tree, an algorithm designed to
improve the handling of missing data in decision tree regressors and
classifiers. Unlike other approaches, the Trinary decision tree does not assume
that missing values contain any information about the response. Both
theoretical calculations on estimator bias and numerical illustrations using
real data sets are presented to compare its performance with established
algorithms in different missing data scenarios (Missing Completely at Random
(MCAR), and Informative Missingness (IM)). Notably, the Trinary tree
outperforms its peers in MCAR settings, especially when data is only missing
out-of-sample, while lacking behind in IM settings. A hybrid model, the
TrinaryMIA tree, which combines the Trinary tree and the Missing In Attributes
(MIA) approach, shows robust performance in all types of missingness. Despite
the potential drawback of slower training speed, the Trinary tree offers a
promising and more accurate method of handling missing data in decision tree
algorithms.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We present a novel approach for efficiently generating quantum feature maps
for quantum-enhanced support vector machines, a kernel-based classifier,
enabling access to high-dimensional Hilbert space. Our method employs a
multi-objective genetic algorithm that simultaneously maximizes classification
accuracy while minimizing both the local and non-local gate costs of the
quantum feature map's circuit. To achieve this, we define distinct fitness
functions for local gates and entanglement gates. Comparisons with classical
classifiers are given in order to understand the advantages of using quantum
machine learning. Surprisingly, our experiments reveal that the optimal
configuration of quantum circuits for the quantum kernel method incorporates a
proportional number of non-local gates for entanglement, contrary to previous
literature where non-local gates were largely suppressed.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that the separability indexes of data can be
effectively leveraged to determine the number of non-local gates required for
the quantum support vector machine's feature maps. This insight can
significantly aid in selecting appropriate parameters, such as the entanglement
parameter, in various quantum programming packages like quiskit.org based on
data analysis. Our findings offer valuable guidance for enhancing the
efficiency and accuracy of quantum machine learning algorithms.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graph classification is a crucial task in many real-world multimedia
applications, where graphs can represent various multimedia data types such as
images, videos, and social networks. Previous efforts have applied graph neural
networks (GNNs) in balanced situations where the class distribution is
balanced. However, real-world data typically exhibit long-tailed class
distributions, resulting in a bias towards the head classes when using GNNs and
limited generalization ability over the tail classes. Recent approaches mainly
focus on re-balancing different classes during model training, which fails to
explicitly introduce new knowledge and sacrifices the performance of the head
classes. To address these drawbacks, we propose a novel framework called
Retrieval Augmented Hybrid Network (RAHNet) to jointly learn a robust feature
extractor and an unbiased classifier in a decoupled manner. In the feature
extractor training stage, we develop a graph retrieval module to search for
relevant graphs that directly enrich the intra-class diversity for the tail
classes. Moreover, we innovatively optimize a category-centered supervised
contrastive loss to obtain discriminative representations, which is more
suitable for long-tailed scenarios. In the classifier fine-tuning stage, we
balance the classifier weights with two weight regularization techniques, i.e.,
Max-norm and weight decay. Experiments on various popular benchmarks verify the
superiority of the proposed method against state-of-the-art approaches.]]></summary>

each step, they adequately tune the interaction of biomechanical muscle
dynamics and neuronal signals to be robust against uncertainties in ground
conditions. However, it is still not fully understood how the nervous system
resolves the musculoskeletal redundancy to solve the multi-objective control
problem considering stability, robustness, and energy efficiency. In computer
simulations, energy minimization has been shown to be a successful optimization
target, reproducing natural walking with trajectory optimization or
reflex-based control methods. However, these methods focus on particular
motions at a time and the resulting controllers are limited when compensating
for perturbations. In robotics, reinforcement learning~(RL) methods recently
achieved highly stable (and efficient) locomotion on quadruped systems, but the
generation of human-like walking with bipedal biomechanical models has required
extensive use of expert data sets. This strong reliance on demonstrations often
results in brittle policies and limits the application to new behaviors,
especially considering the potential variety of movements for high-dimensional
musculoskeletal models in 3D. Achieving natural locomotion with RL without
sacrificing its incredible robustness might pave the way for a novel approach
to studying human walking in complex natural environments. Videos:

to computational constraints. A consequence is inaccurate and imprecise
predictions of critical processes such as storms. Hybrid methods that combine
physics with machine learning (ML) have introduced a new generation of higher
fidelity climate simulators that can sidestep Moore's Law by outsourcing
compute-hungry, short, high-resolution simulations to ML emulators. However,
this hybrid ML-physics simulation approach requires domain-specific treatment
and has been inaccessible to ML experts because of lack of training data and
relevant, easy-to-use workflows. We present ClimSim, the largest-ever dataset
designed for hybrid ML-physics research. It comprises multi-scale climate
simulations, developed by a consortium of climate scientists and ML
researchers. It consists of 5.7 billion pairs of multivariate input and output
vectors that isolate the influence of locally-nested, high-resolution,
high-fidelity physics on a host climate simulator's macro-scale physical state.

The dataset is global in coverage, spans multiple years at high sampling
frequency, and is designed such that resulting emulators are compatible with
downstream coupling into operational climate simulators. We implement a range
of deterministic and stochastic regression baselines to highlight the ML
challenges and their scoring. The data

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture
which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the
theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly
understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we
explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\boldsymbol{X})=\langle
\boldsymbol{Xv}, \texttt{softmax}(\boldsymbol{XWp})\rangle$, where
$\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and
$(\boldsymbol{v},\boldsymbol{W},\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We
prove that running gradient descent on $\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently
$\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that
separates $\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly
formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our
results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize
$\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings
$\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader
regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of
attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\boldsymbol{v}$
and $\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions
under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective
hard-margin SVM solutions where $\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features
based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\boldsymbol{p}$
is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we
verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.]]></summary>

learning of single index models, i.e. functions that depend on a 1-dimensional
projection of the input data, is governed by their information exponent.
However, these results are only concerned with isotropic data, while in
practice the input often contains additional structure which can implicitly
guide the algorithm. In this work, we investigate the effect of a spiked
covariance structure and reveal several interesting phenomena. First, we show
that in the anisotropic setting, the commonly used spherical gradient dynamics
may fail to recover the true direction, even when the spike is perfectly
aligned with the target direction. Next, we show that appropriate weight
normalization that is reminiscent of batch normalization can alleviate this
issue. Further, by exploiting the alignment between the (spiked) input
covariance and the target, we obtain improved sample complexity compared to the
isotropic case. In particular, under the spiked model with a suitably large
spike, the sample complexity of gradient-based training can be made independent
of the information exponent while also outperforming lower bounds for
rotationally invariant kernel methods.]]></summary>

scientific and engineering disciplines. However, traditional numerical solvers
are limited by the choice of step sizes when estimating integration, resulting
in a trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency. To address this

(NeurVec), which can compensate for integration errors and enable larger time

dynamical system benchmarks demonstrate that NeurVec exhibits remarkable
generalization capability on a continuous phase space, even when trained using
limited and discrete data. NeurVec significantly accelerates traditional
solvers, achieving speeds tens to hundreds of times faster while maintaining
high levels of accuracy and stability. Moreover, NeurVec's simple-yet-effective

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the last decades, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has been intensively
studied by the Machine Learning community. Despite its versatility and
excellent performance, the optimization of large models via SGD still is a
time-consuming task. To reduce training time, it is common to distribute the
training process across multiple devices. Recently, it has been shown that the
convergence of asynchronous SGD (ASGD) will always be faster than mini-batch
SGD. However, despite these improvements in the theoretical bounds, most ASGD
convergence-rate proofs still rely on a centralized parameter server, which is
prone to become a bottleneck when scaling out the gradient computations across
many distributed processes.

In this paper, we present a novel convergence-rate analysis for decentralized
and asynchronous SGD (DASGD) which does not require partial synchronization
among nodes nor restrictive network topologies. Specifically, we provide a
bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sigma\epsilon^{-2}) +
\mathcal{O}(QS_{avg}\epsilon^{-3/2}) + \mathcal{O}(S_{avg}\epsilon^{-1})$ for
the convergence rate of DASGD, where $S_{avg}$ is the average staleness between
models, $Q$ is a constant that bounds the norm of the gradients, and $\epsilon$
is a (small) error that is allowed within the bound. Furthermore, when
gradients are not bounded, we prove the convergence rate of DASGD to be
$\mathcal{O}(\sigma\epsilon^{-2}) +
\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\hat{S}_{avg}\hat{S}_{max}}\epsilon^{-1})$, with
$\hat{S}_{max}$ and $\hat{S}_{avg}$ representing a loose version of the average
and maximum staleness, respectively. Our convergence proof holds for a fixed
stepsize and any non-convex, homogeneous, and L-smooth objective function. We
anticipate that our results will be of high relevance for the adoption of DASGD
by a broad community of researchers and developers.]]></summary>

diverse range of activation functions. An activation function set $\mathscr{A}$
is defined to encompass the majority of commonly used activation functions,

\mathscr{A}$, a $\mathtt{ReLU}$ network of width $N$ and depth $L$ can be
approximated to arbitrary precision by a $\varrho$-activated network of width
$4N$ and depth $2L$ on any bounded set. This finding enables the extension of

to hallucinations, i.e., generating content that deviates from facts seen
during pretraining. We propose a simple decoding strategy for reducing
hallucinations with pretrained LLMs that does not require conditioning on
retrieved external knowledge nor additional fine-tuning. Our approach obtains
the next-token distribution by contrasting the differences in logits obtained
from projecting the later layers versus earlier layers to the vocabulary space,
exploiting the fact that factual knowledge in an LLMs has generally been shown
to be localized to particular transformer layers. We find that this Decoding by
Contrasting Layers (DoLa) approach is able to better surface factual knowledge
and reduce the generation of incorrect facts. DoLa consistently improves the
truthfulness across multiple choices tasks and open-ended generation tasks, for
example improving the performance of LLaMA family models on TruthfulQA by
12-17% absolute points, demonstrating its potential in making LLMs reliably
generate truthful facts.]]></summary>

(NNs) has become a central task in deep learning theory. However, implicit
regularization is itself not completely defined and well understood. In this
work, we attempt to mathematically define and study implicit regularization.
Importantly, we explore the limitations of a common approach to characterizing
implicit regularization using data-independent functions. We propose two
dynamical mechanisms, i.e., Two-point and One-point Overlapping mechanisms,
based on which we provide two recipes for producing classes of
one-hidden-neuron NNs that provably cannot be fully characterized by a type of

further emphasize the profound data dependency of implicit regularization in
general, inspiring us to study in detail the data dependency of NN implicit

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Interpolators are unstable. For example, the mininum $\ell_2$ norm least
square interpolator exhibits unbounded test errors when dealing with noisy
data. In this paper, we study how ensemble stabilizes and thus improves the
generalization performance, measured by the out-of-sample prediction risk, of
an individual interpolator. We focus on bagged linear interpolators, as bagging
is a popular randomization-based ensemble method that can be implemented in
parallel. We introduce the multiplier-bootstrap-based bagged least square
estimator, which can then be formulated as an average of the sketched least
square estimators. The proposed multiplier bootstrap encompasses the classical
bootstrap with replacement as a special case, along with a more intriguing
variant which we call the Bernoulli bootstrap.

Focusing on the proportional regime where the sample size scales
proportionally with the feature dimensionality, we investigate the
out-of-sample prediction risks of the sketched and bagged least square
estimators in both underparametrized and overparameterized regimes. Our results
reveal the statistical roles of sketching and bagging. In particular, sketching
modifies the aspect ratio and shifts the interpolation threshold of the minimum
$\ell_2$ norm estimator. However, the risk of the sketched estimator continues
to be unbounded around the interpolation threshold due to excessive variance.
In stark contrast, bagging effectively mitigates this variance, leading to a
bounded limiting out-of-sample prediction risk. To further understand this
stability improvement property, we establish that bagging acts as a form of
implicit regularization, substantiated by the equivalence of the bagged
estimator with its explicitly regularized counterpart. We also discuss several
extensions.]]></summary>

relate DML to feasibility problem of finite chance constraints. We show that

worst case generalization performance of the proxy-based methods can be
characterized by the radius of the smallest ball around a class proxy to cover
the entire domain of the corresponding class samples, suggesting multiple
proxies per class helps performance. To provide a scalable algorithm as well as
exploiting more proxies, we consider the chance constraints implied by the
minimizers of proxy-based DML instances and reformulate DML as finding a
feasible point in intersection of such constraints, resulting in a problem to
be approximately solved by iterative projections. Simply put, we repeatedly
train a regularized proxy-based loss and re-initialize the proxies with the
embeddings of the deliberately selected new samples. We applied our method with
4 well-accepted DML losses and show the effectiveness with extensive

from exploding and vanishing gradient problems. Numerous solutions have been
proposed such as normalisation techniques or limiting activation functions to
linear rectifying units. In this work we follow a different approach which is
particularly applicable to closed-loop learning of forward models where
back-propagation makes exclusive use of the sign of the error signal to prime
the learning, whilst a global relevance signal modulates the rate of learning.
This is inspired by the interaction between local plasticity and a global
neuromodulation. For example, whilst driving on an empty road, one can allow
for slow step-wise optimisation of actions, whereas, at a busy junction, an
error must be corrected at once. Hence, the error is the priming signal and the
intensity of the experience is a modulating factor in the weight change. The
advantages of this Prime and Modulate paradigm is twofold: it is free from
normalisation and it makes use of relevant cues from the environment to enrich
the learning. We present a mathematical derivation of the learning rule in
z-space and demonstrate the real-time performance with a robotic platform. The
results show a significant improvement in the speed of convergence compared to
that of the conventional back-propagation.]]></summary>

(stochastic) gradient descent, the primary algorithm for machine learning. In
practice, we benchmark instances of large machine learning models from 7

branch-and-cut technique to solve the cardinality-constrained MSSC. For the
lower bound routine, we use the semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation
recently proposed by Rujeerapaiboon et al. [SIAM J. Optim. 29(2), 1211-1239,
(2019)]. However, this relaxation can be used in a branch-and-cut method only
for small-size instances. Therefore, we derive a new SDP relaxation that scales
better with the instance size and the number of clusters. In both cases, we
strengthen the bound by adding polyhedral cuts. Benefiting from a tailored
branching strategy which enforces pairwise constraints, we reduce the
complexity of the problems arising in the children nodes. For the upper bound,
instead, we present a local search procedure that exploits the solution of the
SDP relaxation solved at each node. Computational results show that the
proposed algorithm globally solves, for the first time, real-world instances of
size 10 times larger than those solved by state-of-the-art exact methods.]]></summary>

attributed to the areas of Statistics and Machine Learning in order to obtain
the benefits of both approaches. In this article, the statistical technique
lasso for variable selection is represented through a neural network. It is
observed that, although both the statistical approach and its neural version
have the same objective function, they differ due to their optimization. In
particular, the neural version is usually optimized in one-step using a single
validation set, while the statistical counterpart uses a two-step optimization
based on cross-validation. The more elaborated optimization of the statistical
method results in more accurate parameter estimation, especially when the
training set is small. For this reason, a modification of the standard approach
for training neural networks, that mimics the statistical framework, is
proposed. During the development of the above modification, a new optimization
algorithm for identifying the significant variables emerged. Experimental
results, using synthetic and real data sets, show that this new optimization
algorithm achieves better performance than any of the three previous

NeRF or consistently blending a new realistic object into the scene is
challenging, mainly due to the implicit nature of the scene representation. We
present Blended-NeRF, a robust and flexible framework for editing a specific
region of interest in an existing NeRF scene, based on text prompts, along with
a 3D ROI box. Our method leverages a pretrained language-image model to steer
the synthesis towards a user-provided text prompt, along with a 3D MLP model
initialized on an existing NeRF scene to generate the object and blend it into
a specified region in the original scene. We allow local editing by localizing
a 3D ROI box in the input scene, and blend the content synthesized inside the
ROI with the existing scene using a novel volumetric blending technique. To
obtain natural looking and view-consistent results, we leverage existing and
new geometric priors and 3D augmentations for improving the visual fidelity of
the final result. We test our framework both qualitatively and quantitatively
on a variety of real 3D scenes and text prompts, demonstrating realistic
multi-view consistent results with much flexibility and diversity compared to

pre-training has shown a remarkable potential to boost the performance of
fundamental models in 2D vision. However, in 3D vision, the over-reliance on
Transformer-based backbones and the unordered nature of point clouds have
restricted the further development of generative pre-training. In this paper,
we propose a novel 3D-to-2D generative pre-training method that is adaptable to
any point cloud model. We propose to generate view images from different
instructed poses via the cross-attention mechanism as the pre-training scheme.
Generating view images has more precise supervision than its point cloud
counterpart, thus assisting 3D backbones to have a finer comprehension of the
geometrical structure and stereoscopic relations of the point cloud.
Experimental results have proved the superiority of our proposed 3D-to-2D
generative pre-training over previous pre-training methods. Our method is also
effective in boosting the performance of architecture-oriented approaches,
achieving state-of-the-art performance when fine-tuning on ScanObjectNN
classification and ShapeNetPart segmentation tasks. Code is available at

like robotic teleoperation given noisy, high-dimensional command signals (e.g.,
from a brain-computer interface). Recent advances in human-in-the-loop machine
learning enable such systems to improve by interacting with users, but tend to
be limited by the amount of data that they can collect from individual users in
practice. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm to
address this by training an interface to map raw command signals to actions
using a combination of offline pre-training and online fine-tuning. To address
the challenges posed by noisy command signals and sparse rewards, we develop a
novel method for representing and inferring the user's long-term intent for a
given trajectory. We primarily evaluate our method's ability to assist users
who can only communicate through noisy, high-dimensional input channels through
a user study in which 12 participants performed a simulated navigation task by
using their eye gaze to modulate a 128-dimensional command signal from their
webcam. The results show that our method enables successful goal navigation
more often than a baseline directional interface, by learning to denoise user
commands signals and provide shared autonomy assistance. We further evaluate on
a simulated Sawyer pushing task with eye gaze control, and the Lunar Lander
game with simulated user commands, and find that our method improves over
baseline interfaces in these domains as well. Extensive ablation experiments
with simulated user commands empirically motivate each component of our method.]]></summary>

supervision is a promising approach to deal with the need for Segmentation
networks, especially for generating a large number of pixel-wise masks in a
given dataset. However, most state-of-the-art image-level WSSS techniques lack
an understanding of the geometric features embedded in the images since the
network cannot derive any object boundary information from just image-level
labels. We define a boundary here as the line separating an object and its

proposing our novel ReFit framework, which deploys state-of-the-art class
activation maps combined with various post-processing techniques in order to
achieve fine-grained higher-accuracy segmentation masks. To achieve this, we
investigate a state-of-the-art unsupervised segmentation network that can be
used to construct a boundary map, which enables ReFit to predict object
locations with sharper boundaries. By applying our method to WSSS predictions,
we achieved up to 10% improvement over the current state-of-the-art WSSS

do not provide an estimate of the probability density around the samples.
However, it has been noted that maximizing the log-likelihood within an
energy-based setting can lead to an adversarial framework where the
discriminator provides unnormalized density (often called energy). We further
develop this perspective, incorporate importance sampling, and show that 1)
Wasserstein GAN performs a biased estimate of the partition function, and we
propose instead to use an unbiased estimator; and 2) when optimizing for
likelihood, one must maximize generator entropy. This is hypothesized to
provide a better mode coverage. Different from previous works, we explicitly
compute the density of the generated samples. This is the key enabler to
designing an unbiased estimator of the partition function and computation of
the generator entropy term. The generator density is obtained via a new type of
flow network, called one-way flow network, that is less constrained in terms of
architecture, as it does not require a tractable inverse function. Our
experimental results show that our method converges faster, produces comparable
sample quality to GANs with similar architecture, successfully avoids
over-fitting to commonly used datasets and produces smooth low-dimensional
latent representations of the training data.]]></summary>

of LLMs to enhance pipeline-based conversational agents during two phases: 1)
in the design and development phase and 2) during operations. In 1) LLMs can
aid in generating training data, extracting entities and synonyms,
localization, and persona design. In 2) LLMs can assist in contextualization,
intent classification to prevent conversational breakdown and handle
out-of-scope questions, auto-correcting utterances, rephrasing responses,
formulating disambiguation questions, summarization, and enabling closed
question-answering capabilities. We conducted informal experiments with GPT-4
in the private banking domain to demonstrate the scenarios above with a
practical example. Companies may be hesitant to replace their pipeline-based
agents with LLMs entirely due to privacy concerns and the need for deep
integration within their existing ecosystems. A hybrid approach in which LLMs'

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Distribution shifts are all too common in real-world applications of machine
learning. Domain adaptation (DA) aims to address this by providing various
frameworks for adapting models to the deployment data without using labels.
However, the domain shift scenario raises a second more subtle challenge: the
difficulty of performing hyperparameter optimisation (HPO) for these adaptation
algorithms without access to a labelled validation set. The unclear validation
protocol for DA has led to bad practices in the literature, such as performing
HPO using the target test labels when, in real-world scenarios, they are not
available. This has resulted in over-optimism about DA research progress
compared to reality. In this paper, we analyse the state of DA when using good
evaluation practice, by benchmarking a suite of candidate validation criteria
and using them to assess popular adaptation algorithms. We show that there are
challenges across all three branches of domain adaptation methodology including
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA), Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA), and
Test Time Adaptation (TTA). While the results show that realistically
achievable performance is often worse than expected, they also show that using
proper validation splits is beneficial, as well as showing that some previously
unexplored validation metrics provide the best options to date. Altogether, our
improved practices covering data, training, validation and hyperparameter
optimisation form a new rigorous pipeline to improve benchmarking, and hence

the commonly used machine learning methods. Such application is motivated by
the need to test bonobos in their enclosure using touch screen devices without
human assistance. This work introduces a newly acquired dataset based on bonobo
recordings generated semi-automatically. The recordings are weakly labelled and
fed to a macaque detector in order to spatially detect the individual present
in the video. Handcrafted features coupled with different classification
algorithms and deep-learning methods using a ResNet architecture are
investigated for bonobo identification. Performance is compared in terms of
classification accuracy on the splits of the database using different data
separation methods. We demonstrate the importance of data preparation and how a
wrong data separation can lead to false good results. Finally, after a
meaningful separation of the data, the best classification performance is
obtained using a fine-tuned ResNet model and reaches 75% of accuracy.]]></summary>

distribution, diffusion-based generative models learn how to generate the data
by inferring a reverse diffusion chain. However, this approach is slow and
costly because it needs many forward and reverse steps. We propose a faster and
cheaper approach that adds noise not until the data become pure random noise,
but until they reach a hidden noisy data distribution that we can confidently
learn. Then, we use fewer reverse steps to generate data by starting from this
hidden distribution that is made similar to the noisy data. We reveal that the
proposed model can be cast as an adversarial auto-encoder empowered by both the
diffusion process and a learnable implicit prior. Experimental results show
even with a significantly smaller number of reverse diffusion steps, the
proposed truncated diffusion probabilistic models can provide consistent

learning models tends to deteriorate. In practice, new input data tend to come
without target labels. Then, state-of-the-art techniques model input data
distributions or model prediction distributions and try to understand issues
regarding the interactions between learned models and shifting distributions.
We suggest a novel approach that models how explanation characteristics shift
when affected by distribution shifts. We find that the modeling of explanation
shifts can be a better indicator for detecting out-of-distribution model
behaviour than state-of-the-art techniques. We analyze different types of
distribution shifts using synthetic examples and real-world data sets. We
provide an algorithmic method that allows us to inspect the interaction between
data set features and learned models and compare them to the state-of-the-art.

rely on Gaussian process inference. Unfortunately, Gaussian process inference
scales cubically with the number of data points, limiting applicability to

in the presence of computational-statistical gaps. We begin by considering
offline sparse parity learning, a supervised classification problem which
admits a statistical query lower bound for gradient-based training of a
multilayer perceptron. This lower bound can be interpreted as a multi-resource
tradeoff frontier: successful learning can only occur if one is sufficiently
rich (large model), knowledgeable (large dataset), patient (many training
iterations), or lucky (many random guesses). We show, theoretically and
experimentally, that sparse initialization and increasing network width yield
significant improvements in sample efficiency in this setting. Here, width
plays the role of parallel search: it amplifies the probability of finding
"lottery ticket" neurons, which learn sparse features more sample-efficiently.
Finally, we show that the synthetic sparse parity task can be useful as a proxy
for real problems requiring axis-aligned feature learning. We demonstrate
improved sample efficiency on tabular classification benchmarks by using wide,

perform periodic dedicated tasks with soft deadlines. This work focuses on
developing methods to derive efficient power-management methods for periodic
tasks on small devices. We first study the limitations of the existing Linux
built-in methods used in small devices. We illustrate three typical
workload/system patterns that are challenging to manage with Linux's built-in
solutions. We develop a reinforcement-learning-based technique with temporal
encoding to derive an effective DVFS governor even with the presence of the
three system patterns. The derived governor uses only one performance counter,
the same as the built-in Linux mechanism, and does not require an explicit task
model for the workload. We implemented a prototype system on the Nvidia Jetson
Nano Board and experimented with it with six applications, including two
self-designed and four benchmark applications. Under different deadline
constraints, our approach can quickly derive a DVFS governor that can adapt to
performance requirements and outperform the built-in Linux approach in energy
saving. On Mibench workloads, with performance slack ranging from 0.04 s to 0.4
s, the proposed method can save 3% - 11% more energy compared to Ondemand.
AudioReg and FaceReg applications tested have 5%- 14% energy-saving

applications due to their high energy and power density. Their market was
estimated to be up to 48 billion U.S. dollars in 2022. However, the widespread
adoption of Li-ion batteries has resulted in counterfeit cell production, which
can pose safety hazards to users. Counterfeit cells can cause explosions or
fires, and their prevalence in the market makes it difficult for users to
detect fake cells. Indeed, current battery authentication methods can be
susceptible to advanced counterfeiting techniques and are often not adaptable
to various cells and systems. In this paper, we improve the state of the art on
battery authentication by proposing two novel methodologies, DCAuth and
EISthentication, which leverage the internal characteristics of each cell
through Machine Learning models. Our methods automatically authenticate
lithium-ion battery models and architectures using data from their regular
usage without the need for any external device. They are also resilient to the
most common and critical counterfeit practices and can scale to several
batteries and devices. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed
methodologies, we analyze time-series data from a total of 20 datasets that we
have processed to extract meaningful features for our analysis. Our methods
achieve high accuracy in battery authentication for both architectures (up to
0.99) and models (up to 0.96). Moreover, our methods offer comparable
identification performances. By using our proposed methodologies, manufacturers
can ensure that devices only use legitimate batteries, guaranteeing the
operational state of any system and safety measures for the users.]]></summary>

events over time. We ask a relatively basic question: how might we compare
these forecasters, either online or post-hoc, while avoiding unverifiable
assumptions on how the forecasts and outcomes were generated? In this paper, we
present a rigorous answer to this question by designing novel sequential
inference procedures for estimating the time-varying difference in forecast
scores. To do this, we employ confidence sequences (CS), which are sequences of
confidence intervals that can be continuously monitored and are valid at
arbitrary data-dependent stopping times ("anytime-valid"). The widths of our
CSs are adaptive to the underlying variance of the score differences.
Underlying their construction is a game-theoretic statistical framework, in
which we further identify e-processes and p-processes for sequentially testing
a weak null hypothesis -- whether one forecaster outperforms another on average
(rather than always). Our methods do not make distributional assumptions on the
forecasts or outcomes; our main theorems apply to any bounded scores, and we
later provide alternative methods for unbounded scores. We empirically validate
our approaches by comparing real-world baseball and weather forecasters.]]></summary>

the ranking matches the observations? This problem, known as rank aggregation,
has found many applications in sports, recommendation systems, and other web
applications. As it is generally NP-hard to find a global ranking that
minimizes the mismatch (known as the Kemeny optimization), we focus on the
Erd\"os-R\'enyi outliers (ERO) model for this ranking problem. Here, each
pairwise comparison is a corrupted copy of the true score difference. We
investigate spectral ranking algorithms that are based on unnormalized and
normalized data matrices. The key is to understand their performance in
recovering the underlying scores of each item from the observed data. This
reduces to deriving an entry-wise perturbation error bound between the top
eigenvectors of the unnormalized/normalized data matrix and its population
counterpart. By using the leave-one-out technique, we provide a sharper
$\ell_{\infty}$-norm perturbation bound of the eigenvectors and also derive an
error bound on the maximum displacement for each item, with only $\Omega(n\log

square interpolator exhibits unbounded test errors when dealing with noisy
data. In this paper, we study how ensemble stabilizes and thus improves the
generalization performance, measured by the out-of-sample prediction risk, of
an individual interpolator. We focus on bagged linear interpolators, as bagging
is a popular randomization-based ensemble method that can be implemented in
parallel. We introduce the multiplier-bootstrap-based bagged least square
estimator, which can then be formulated as an average of the sketched least
square estimators. The proposed multiplier bootstrap encompasses the classical
bootstrap with replacement as a special case, along with a more intriguing
variant which we call the Bernoulli bootstrap.

Focusing on the proportional regime where the sample size scales
proportionally with the feature dimensionality, we investigate the
out-of-sample prediction risks of the sketched and bagged least square
estimators in both underparametrized and overparameterized regimes. Our results
reveal the statistical roles of sketching and bagging. In particular, sketching
modifies the aspect ratio and shifts the interpolation threshold of the minimum
$\ell_2$ norm estimator. However, the risk of the sketched estimator continues
to be unbounded around the interpolation threshold due to excessive variance.
In stark contrast, bagging effectively mitigates this variance, leading to a
bounded limiting out-of-sample prediction risk. To further understand this
stability improvement property, we establish that bagging acts as a form of
implicit regularization, substantiated by the equivalence of the bagged
estimator with its explicitly regularized counterpart. We also discuss several
extensions.]]></summary>

(KG) that incorporates the dimension of time. Reasoning on TKGs is a crucial
task that aims to predict future facts based on historical occurrences. The key
challenge lies in uncovering structural dependencies within historical
subgraphs and temporal patterns. Most existing approaches model TKGs relying on
entity modeling, as nodes in the graph play a crucial role in knowledge
representation. However, the real-world scenario often involves an extensive
number of entities, with new entities emerging over time. This makes it
challenging for entity-dependent methods to cope with extensive volumes of
entities, and effectively handling newly emerging entities also becomes a
significant challenge. Therefore, we propose Temporal Inductive Path Neural

However, learning the value function via bootstrapping often leads to unstable
training due to fast-changing target values. Target Networks are employed to
stabilize training by using an additional set of lagging parameters to estimate
the target values. Despite the popularity of Target Networks, their effect on
the optimization is still misunderstood. In this work, we show that they act as
an implicit regularizer which can be beneficial in some cases, but also have
disadvantages such as being inflexible and can result in instabilities, even
when vanilla TD(0) converges. To overcome these issues, we propose an explicit
Functional Regularization alternative that is flexible and a convex regularizer
in function space and we theoretically study its convergence. We conduct an
experimental study across a range of environments, discount factors, and
off-policiness data collections to investigate the effectiveness of the
regularization induced by Target Networks and Functional Regularization in
terms of performance, accuracy, and stability. Our findings emphasize that
Functional Regularization can be used as a drop-in replacement for Target
Networks and result in performance improvement. Furthermore, adjusting both the
regularization weight and the network update period in Functional
Regularization can result in further performance improvements compared to
solely adjusting the network update period as typically done with Target
Networks. Our approach also enhances the ability to networks to recover
accurate $Q$-values.]]></summary>

pose a significant risk to vision, highlighting the importance of precise
segmentation of retinal vessels for the tracking and diagnosis of progression.
However, existing vessel segmentation methods that heavily rely on
encoder-decoder structures struggle to capture contextual information about
retinal vessel configurations, leading to challenges in reconciling semantic
disparities between encoder and decoder features. To address this, we propose a
novel feature enhancement segmentation network (FES-Net) that achieves accurate
pixel-wise segmentation without requiring additional image enhancement steps.
FES-Net directly processes the input image and utilizes four prompt
convolutional blocks (PCBs) during downsampling, complemented by a shallow
upsampling approach to generate a binary mask for each class. We evaluate the
performance of FES-Net on four publicly available state-of-the-art datasets:
DRIVE, STARE, CHASE, and HRF. The evaluation results clearly demonstrate the
superior performance of FES-Net compared to other competitive approaches

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The minimum sum-of-squares clustering (MSSC), or k-means type clustering, has
been recently extended to exploit prior knowledge on the cardinality of each
cluster. Such knowledge is used to increase performance as well as solution
quality. In this paper, we propose a global optimization approach based on the
branch-and-cut technique to solve the cardinality-constrained MSSC. For the
lower bound routine, we use the semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation
recently proposed by Rujeerapaiboon et al. [SIAM J. Optim. 29(2), 1211-1239,
(2019)]. However, this relaxation can be used in a branch-and-cut method only
for small-size instances. Therefore, we derive a new SDP relaxation that scales
better with the instance size and the number of clusters. In both cases, we
strengthen the bound by adding polyhedral cuts. Benefiting from a tailored
branching strategy which enforces pairwise constraints, we reduce the
complexity of the problems arising in the children nodes. For the upper bound,
instead, we present a local search procedure that exploits the solution of the
SDP relaxation solved at each node. Computational results show that the
proposed algorithm globally solves, for the first time, real-world instances of
size 10 times larger than those solved by state-of-the-art exact methods.]]></summary>

value. Those risk values can be robustly estimated via using the remarkable
Catoni's method (Catoni, 2012). Thanks to the structure of Catoni-type

diffusion map that captures the latent evolutionary dynamics in low-dimensional

early warning signals capable of detecting the tipping point during the state

The framework is validated to be accurate and effective through numerical

the second coordinate holds meaningful information for critical transition in

gap between SSL and Supervised Learning at a fraction of the number of labels.
However, recent performance improvements have often come \textit{at the cost of
significantly increased training computation}. To address this, we propose
Curriculum Batch Size (CBS), \textit{an unlabeled batch size curriculum which
exploits the natural training dynamics of deep neural networks.} A small
unlabeled batch size is used in the beginning of training and is gradually
increased to the end of training. A fixed curriculum is used regardless of
dataset, model or number of epochs, and reduced training computations is
demonstrated on all settings. We apply CBS, strong labeled augmentation,
Curriculum Pseudo Labeling (CPL) \citep{FlexMatch} to FixMatch \citep{FixMatch}
and term the new SSL algorithm Fast FixMatch. We perform an ablation study to
show that strong labeled augmentation and/or CPL do not significantly reduce
training computations, but, in synergy with CBS, they achieve optimal
performance. Fast FixMatch also achieves substantially higher data utilization
compared to previous state-of-the-art. Fast FixMatch achieves between
$2.1\times$ - $3.4\times$ reduced training computations on CIFAR-10 with all
but 40, 250 and 4000 labels removed, compared to vanilla FixMatch, while
attaining the same cited state-of-the-art error rate \citep{FixMatch}. Similar
results are achieved for CIFAR-100, SVHN and STL-10. Finally, Fast MixMatch
achieves between $2.6\times$ - $3.3\times$ reduced training computations in
federated SSL tasks and online/streaming learning SSL tasks, which further
demonstrate the generializbility of Fast MixMatch to different scenarios and

for similar trends occurring around similar times and is easily interpretable
for researchers in applied domains. This is particularly useful for
applications where time-series have a sequence of meaningful local trends that
are ordered, such as in epidemics (a surge to an increase to a peak to a
decrease). We propose a novel measure, DTW+S, which creates an interpretable
"closeness-preserving" matrix representation of the time-series, where each
column represents local trends, and then it applies Dynamic Time Warping to
compute distances between these matrices. We present a theoretical analysis
that supports the choice of this representation. We demonstrate the utility of
DTW+S in ensemble building and clustering of epidemic curves. We also

for fast and accurate estimation of post-physical synthesis circuit delay and

GraPhSyM provides accurate visibility of final design metrics to early EDA
stages, such as logic synthesis, without running the slow physical synthesis
flow, enabling global co-optimization across stages. Additionally, the swift
and precise feedback provided by GraPhSyM is instrumental for
machine-learning-based EDA optimization frameworks. Given a gate-level netlist
of a circuit represented as a graph, GraPhSyM utilizes graph structure,
connectivity, and electrical property features to predict the impact of
physical synthesis transformations such as buffer insertion and gate sizing.
When trained on a dataset of 6000 prefix adder designs synthesized at an
aggressive delay target, GraPhSyM can accurately predict the post-synthesis
delay (98.3%) and area (96.1%) metrics of unseen adders with a fast 0.22s
inference time. Furthermore, we illustrate the compositionality of GraPhSyM by
employing the model trained on a fixed delay target to accurately anticipate
post-synthesis metrics at a variety of unseen delay targets. Lastly, we report
promising generalization capabilities of the GraPhSyM model when it is
evaluated on circuits different from the adders it was exclusively trained on.
The results show the potential for GraPhSyM to serve as a powerful tool for

agent rapidly adapt to various stationary reward functions randomly sampled
from a fixed distribution. In such situations, the successor representation
(SR) is a popular framework which supports rapid policy evaluation by
decoupling a policy's expected discounted, cumulative state occupancies from a
specific reward function. However, in the natural world, sequential tasks are
rarely independent, and instead reflect shifting priorities based on the
availability and subjective perception of rewarding stimuli. Reflecting this
disjunction, in this paper we study the phenomenon of diminishing marginal
utility and introduce a novel state representation, the $\lambda$
representation ($\lambda$R) which, surprisingly, is required for policy
evaluation in this setting and which generalizes the SR as well as several
other state representations from the literature. We establish the $\lambda$R's

toward the development of therapeutics for complex diseases such as Alzheimer's
disease (AD). However, most machine learning approaches developed for
prediction of disease progression are either single-task or single-modality
models, which can not be directly adopted to our setting involving multi-task
learning with high dimensional images. Moreover, most of those approaches are
trained on a single dataset (i.e. cohort), which can not be generalized to
other cohorts. We propose a novel multimodal multi-task deep learning model to
predict AD progression by analyzing longitudinal clinical and neuroimaging data
from multiple cohorts. Our proposed model integrates high dimensional MRI
features from a 3D convolutional neural network with other data modalities,
including clinical and demographic information, to predict the future
trajectory of patients. Our model employs an adversarial loss to alleviate the
study-specific imaging bias, in particular the inter-study domain shifts. In
addition, a Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) optimization technique is
applied to further improve model generalization. The proposed model is trained
and tested on various datasets in order to evaluate and validate the results.
Our results showed that 1) our model yields significant improvement over the
baseline models, and 2) models using extracted neuroimaging features from 3D
convolutional neural network outperform the same models when applied to
MRI-derived volumetric features.]]></summary>

the interaction between an attacker and a defender as a partially observed
stochastic game. To solve the game we follow an approach where attack and

toward an equilibrium. Solutions proposed in previous work prove the
feasibility of this approach for small infrastructures but do not scale to
realistic scenarios due to the exponential growth in computational complexity
with the infrastructure size. We address this problem by introducing a method
that recursively decomposes the game into subgames which can be solved in
parallel. Applying optimal stopping theory we show that the best response
strategies in these subgames exhibit threshold structures, which allows us to
compute them efficiently. To solve the decomposed game we introduce an
algorithm called Decompositional Fictitious Self-Play (DFSP), which learns Nash
equilibria through stochastic approximation. We evaluate the learned strategies
in an emulation environment where real intrusions and response actions can be
executed. The results show that the learned strategies approximate an

both the perception and production of emotions. The subjectivity of emotions
poses significant challenges in developing accurate and robust computational
models. This thesis examines critical facets of emotion recognition, beginning
with the collection of diverse datasets that account for psychological factors
in emotion production.

To handle the challenge of non-representative training data, this work
collects the Multimodal Stressed Emotion dataset, which introduces controlled
stressors during data collection to better represent real-world influences on
emotion production. To address issues with label subjectivity, this research
comprehensively analyzes how data augmentation techniques and annotation
schemes impact emotion perception and annotator labels. It further handles
natural confounding variables and variations by employing adversarial networks
to isolate key factors like stress from learned emotion representations during
model training. For tackling concerns about leakage of sensitive demographic
variables, this work leverages adversarial learning to strip sensitive
demographic information from multimodal encodings. Additionally, it proposes
optimized sociological evaluation metrics aligned with cost-effective,
real-world needs for model testing.

This research advances robust, practical emotion recognition through
multifaceted studies of challenges in datasets, labels, modeling, demographic
and membership variable encoding in representations, and evaluation. The
groundwork has been laid for cost-effective, generalizable emotion recognition
models that are less likely to encode sensitive demographic information.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Survival analysis is a valuable tool for estimating the time until specific
events, such as death or cancer recurrence, based on baseline observations.
This is particularly useful in healthcare to prognostically predict clinically
important events based on patient data. However, existing approaches often have
limitations; some focus only on ranking patients by survivability, neglecting
to estimate the actual event time, while others treat the problem as a
classification task, ignoring the inherent time-ordered structure of the
events. Furthermore, the effective utilization of censored samples - training
data points where the exact event time is unknown - is essential for improving
the predictive accuracy of the model. In this paper, we introduce CenTime, a
novel approach to survival analysis that directly estimates the time to event.
Our method features an innovative event-conditional censoring mechanism that
performs robustly even when uncensored data is scarce. We demonstrate that our
approach forms a consistent estimator for the event model parameters, even in
the absence of uncensored data. Furthermore, CenTime is easily integrated with
deep learning models with no restrictions on batch size or the number of
uncensored samples. We compare our approach with standard survival analysis
methods, including the Cox proportional-hazard model and DeepHit. Our results
indicate that CenTime offers state-of-the-art performance in predicting
time-to-death while maintaining comparable ranking performance. Our
implementation is publicly available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Causal inference plays a vital role in diverse domains like epidemiology,
healthcare, and economics. De-confounding and counterfactual prediction in
observational data has emerged as a prominent concern in causal inference
research. While existing models tackle observed confounders, the presence of
unobserved confounders remains a significant challenge, distorting causal
inference and impacting counterfactual outcome accuracy. To address this, we
propose a novel variational learning model of unobserved confounders for
counterfactual inference (VLUCI), which generates the posterior distribution of
unobserved confounders. VLUCI relaxes the unconfoundedness assumption often
overlooked by most causal inference methods. By disentangling observed and
unobserved confounders, VLUCI constructs a doubly variational inference model
to approximate the distribution of unobserved confounders, which are used for
inferring more accurate counterfactual outcomes. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate VLUCI's superior performance
in inferring unobserved confounders. It is compatible with state-of-the-art
counterfactual inference models, significantly improving inference accuracy at
both group and individual levels. Additionally, VLUCI provides confidence
intervals for counterfactual outcomes, aiding decision-making in risk-sensitive
domains. We further clarify the considerations when applying VLUCI to cases
where unobserved confounders don't strictly conform to our model assumptions
using the public IHDP dataset as an example, highlighting the practical
advantages of VLUCI.]]></summary>

Handling non-diffuse effects, such as global illumination or cast shadows, has
long been a challenge in face relighting. Prior work often assumes Lambertian
surfaces, simplified lighting models or involves estimating 3D shape, albedo,
or a shadow map. This estimation, however, is error-prone and requires many
training examples with lighting ground truth to generalize well. Our work
bypasses the need for accurate estimation of intrinsic components and can be
trained solely on 2D images without any light stage data, multi-view images, or
lighting ground truth. Our key idea is to leverage a conditional diffusion
implicit model (DDIM) for decoding a disentangled light encoding along with
other encodings related to 3D shape and facial identity inferred from
off-the-shelf estimators. We also propose a novel conditioning technique that
eases the modeling of the complex interaction between light and geometry by
using a rendered shading reference to spatially modulate the DDIM. We achieve
state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmark Multi-PIE and can
photorealistically relight in-the-wild images. Please visit our page:

gathering of a person's initial family history, normally via in-person
interviews or with the use of a platform such as ancestry.com, as this can
provide a strong foundation upon which a genealogist may build. However, the
ability to conduct these interviews can often be hindered by both geographical
constraints and the technical proficiency of the interviewee, as the
interviewee in these types of interviews is most often an elderly person with a
lower than average level of technical proficiency. With this in mind, this
study presents what we believe, based on prior research, to be the first
chatbot geared entirely towards the gathering of family histories, and explores
the viability of utilising such a chatbot by comparing the performance and
usability of such a method with the aforementioned alternatives. With a
chatbot-based approach, we show that, though the average time taken to conduct
an interview may be longer than if the user had used ancestry.com or
participated in an in-person interview, the number of mistakes made and the
level of confusion from the user regarding the UI and process required is lower
than the other two methods. Note that the final metric regarding the user's
confusion is not applicable for the in-person interview sessions due to its
lack of a UI. With refinement, we believe this use of a chatbot could be a
valuable tool for genealogists, especially when dealing with interviewees who
are based in other countries where it is not possible to conduct an in-person
interview.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The utility of reinforcement learning is limited by the alignment of reward
functions with the interests of human stakeholders. One promising method for
alignment is to learn the reward function from human-generated preferences
between pairs of trajectory segments, a type of reinforcement learning from
human feedback (RLHF). These human preferences are typically assumed to be
informed solely by partial return, the sum of rewards along each segment. We
find this assumption to be flawed and propose modeling human preferences
instead as informed by each segment's regret, a measure of a segment's
deviation from optimal decision-making. Given infinitely many preferences
generated according to regret, we prove that we can identify a reward function
equivalent to the reward function that generated those preferences, and we
prove that the previous partial return model lacks this identifiability
property in multiple contexts. We empirically show that our proposed regret
preference model outperforms the partial return preference model with finite
training data in otherwise the same setting. Additionally, we find that our
proposed regret preference model better predicts real human preferences and
also learns reward functions from these preferences that lead to policies that

pre-trained on large, static datasets. These general-purpose models only
capture the knowledge within their pre-training datasets, which are tiny,
out-of-date snapshots of the Internet -- where billions of images are uploaded
each day. We suggest an alternate approach: rather than hoping our static
datasets transfer to our desired tasks after large-scale pre-training, we
propose dynamically utilizing the Internet to quickly train a small-scale model
that does extremely well on the task at hand. Our approach, called Internet
Explorer, explores the web in a self-supervised manner to progressively find
relevant examples that improve performance on a desired target dataset. It
cycles between searching for images on the Internet with text queries,
self-supervised training on downloaded images, determining which images were
useful, and prioritizing what to search for next. We evaluate Internet Explorer
across several datasets and show that it outperforms or matches CLIP oracle
performance by using just a single GPU desktop to actively query the Internet
for 30--40 hours. Results, visualizations, and videos at

of differential privacy (DP). Our main result is that $\tilde{O}(k^2 d^4

mixture of $k$ Gaussians up to total variation distance $\alpha$ while
satisfying $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP. This is the first finite sample
complexity upper bound for the problem that does not make any structural
assumptions on the GMMs.

To solve the problem, we devise a new framework which may be useful for other
tasks. On a high level, we show that if a class of distributions (such as
Gaussians) is (1) list decodable and (2) admits a "locally small'' cover
[BKSW19] with respect to total variation distance, then the class of its
mixtures is privately learnable. The proof circumvents a known barrier
indicating that, unlike Gaussians, GMMs do not admit a locally small cover

learning of single index models, i.e. functions that depend on a 1-dimensional
projection of the input data, is governed by their information exponent.
However, these results are only concerned with isotropic data, while in
practice the input often contains additional structure which can implicitly
guide the algorithm. In this work, we investigate the effect of a spiked
covariance structure and reveal several interesting phenomena. First, we show
that in the anisotropic setting, the commonly used spherical gradient dynamics
may fail to recover the true direction, even when the spike is perfectly
aligned with the target direction. Next, we show that appropriate weight
normalization that is reminiscent of batch normalization can alleviate this
issue. Further, by exploiting the alignment between the (spiked) input
covariance and the target, we obtain improved sample complexity compared to the
isotropic case. In particular, under the spiked model with a suitably large
spike, the sample complexity of gradient-based training can be made independent
of the information exponent while also outperforming lower bounds for
rotationally invariant kernel methods.]]></summary>

of a limited capacity model (student) by pushing its responses to match a
powerful model's (teacher). Albeit useful especially in the penultimate layer
and beyond, its action on student's feature transform is rather implicit,
limiting its practice in the intermediate layers. To explicitly embed the
teacher's knowledge in feature transform, we propose a learnable KD layer for
the student which improves KD with two distinct abilities: i) learning how to
leverage the teacher's knowledge, enabling to discard nuisance information, and
ii) feeding forward the transferred knowledge deeper. Thus, the student enjoys
the teacher's knowledge during the inference besides training. Formally, we
repurpose 1x1-BN-ReLU-1x1 convolution block to assign a semantic vector to each
local region according to the template (supervised by the teacher) that the
corresponding region of the student matches. To facilitate template learning in
the intermediate layers, we propose a novel form of supervision based on the
teacher's decisions. Through rigorous experimentation, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach on 3 popular classification benchmarks. Code is

theoretical calculations on estimator bias and numerical illustrations using
real data sets are presented to compare its performance with established
algorithms in different missing data scenarios (Missing Completely at Random

outperforms its peers in MCAR settings, especially when data is only missing
out-of-sample, while lacking behind in IM settings. A hybrid model, the
TrinaryMIA tree, which combines the Trinary tree and the Missing In Attributes

offline sparse parity learning, a supervised classification problem which

tradeoff frontier: successful learning can only occur if one is sufficiently
rich (large model), knowledgeable (large dataset), patient (many training
iterations), or lucky (many random guesses). We show, theoretically and
experimentally, that sparse initialization and increasing network width yield
significant improvements in sample efficiency in this setting. Here, width
plays the role of parallel search: it amplifies the probability of finding
"lottery ticket" neurons, which learn sparse features more sample-efficiently.
Finally, we show that the synthetic sparse parity task can be useful as a proxy
for real problems requiring axis-aligned feature learning. We demonstrate
improved sample efficiency on tabular classification benchmarks by using wide,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We introduce the $ARMOR_D$ methods as novel approaches to enhancing the
adversarial robustness of deep learning models. These methods are based on a
new class of optimal-transport-regularized divergences, constructed via an
infimal convolution between an information divergence and an optimal-transport
(OT) cost. We use these as tools to enhance adversarial robustness by
maximizing the expected loss over a neighborhood of distributions, a technique
known as distributionally robust optimization. Viewed as a tool for
constructing adversarial samples, our method allows samples to be both
transported, according to the OT cost, and re-weighted, according to the
information divergence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on
malware detection and image recognition applications and find that, to our
knowledge, it outperforms existing methods at enhancing the robustness against
adversarial attacks. $ARMOR_D$ yields the robustified accuracy of $98.29\%$
against $FGSM$ and $98.18\%$ against $PGD^{40}$ on the MNIST dataset, reducing
the error rate by more than $19.7\%$ and $37.2\%$ respectively compared to
prior methods. Similarly, in malware detection, a discrete (binary) data
domain, $ARMOR_D$ improves the robustified accuracy under $rFGSM^{50}$ attack
compared to the previous best-performing adversarial training methods by
$37.0\%$ while lowering false negative and false positive rates by $51.1\%$ and
$57.53\%$, respectively.]]></summary>

learning system using a seemingly inconsequential modification to a piece of
input data. Paradoxically, empirical evidence indicates that even systems which
are robust to large random perturbations of the input data remain susceptible
to small, easily constructed, adversarial perturbations of their inputs. Here,
we show that this may be seen as a fundamental feature of classifiers working
with high dimensional input data. We introduce a simple generic and
generalisable framework for which key behaviours observed in practical systems
arise with high probability -- notably the simultaneous susceptibility of the
(otherwise accurate) model to easily constructed adversarial attacks, and
robustness to random perturbations of the input data. We confirm that the same
phenomena are directly observed in practical neural networks trained on
standard image classification problems, where even large additive random noise
fails to trigger the adversarial instability of the network. A surprising
takeaway is that even small margins separating a classifier's decision surface
from training and testing data can hide adversarial susceptibility from being
detected using randomly sampled perturbations. Counterintuitively, using
additive noise during training or testing is therefore inefficient for
eradicating or detecting adversarial examples, and more demanding adversarial
training is required.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Time series classification is an important data mining task that has received
a lot of interest in the past two decades. Due to the label scarcity in
practice, semi-supervised time series classification with only a few labeled
samples has become popular. Recently, Similarity-aware Time Series
Classification (SimTSC) is proposed to address this problem by using a graph
neural network classification model on the graph generated from pairwise
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance of batch data. It shows excellent accuracy
and outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models in several few-label
settings. However, since SimTSC relies on pairwise DTW distances, the quadratic
complexity of DTW limits its usability to only reasonably sized datasets. To
address this challenge, we propose a new efficient semi-supervised time series
classification technique, LB-SimTSC, with a new graph construction module.
Instead of using DTW, we propose to utilize a lower bound of DTW, LB_Keogh, to
approximate the dissimilarity between instances in linear time, while retaining
the relative proximity relationships one would have obtained via computing DTW.
We construct the pairwise distance matrix using LB_Keogh and build a graph for
the graph neural network. We apply this approach to the ten largest datasets
from the well-known UCR time series classification archive. The results
demonstrate that this approach can be up to 104x faster than SimTSC when
constructing the graph on large datasets without significantly decreasing
classification accuracy.]]></summary>

for existing drugs-has been increasingly explored in the computational science
literature using biomedical databases. However, the technological potential of
drug repositioning candidates has often been overlooked. This study presents a
novel protocol to comprehensively analyse various sources such as
pharmaceutical patents and biomedical databases, and identify drug
repositioning candidates with both technological potential and scientific
evidence. To this end, first, we constructed a scientific biomedical knowledge
graph (s-BKG) comprising relationships between drugs, diseases, and genes
derived from biomedical databases. Our protocol involves identifying drugs that
exhibit limited association with the target disease but are closely located in
the s-BKG, as potential drug candidates. We constructed a patent-informed
biomedical knowledge graph (p-BKG) by adding pharmaceutical patent information.
Finally, we developed a graph embedding protocol to ascertain the structure of
the p-BKG, thereby calculating the relevance scores of those candidates with
target disease-related patents to evaluate their technological potential. Our
case study on Alzheimer's disease demonstrates its efficacy and feasibility,
while the quantitative outcomes and systematic methods are expected to bridge

mixture of $k$ Gaussians up to total variation distance $\alpha$ while
satisfying $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP. This is the first finite sample

assumptions on the GMMs.

To solve the problem, we devise a new framework which may be useful for other
tasks. On a high level, we show that if a class of distributions (such as
Gaussians) is (1) list decodable and (2) admits a "locally small'' cover
[BKSW19] with respect to total variation distance, then the class of its

the mediocre performance of conventional federated learning (FL) over
heterogeneous data. Unlike conventional FL which trains a single global
consensus model, personalized FL allows different models for different clients.
However, existing personalized FL algorithms only implicitly transfer the
collaborative knowledge across the federation by embedding the knowledge into
the aggregated model or regularization. We observed that this implicit
knowledge transfer fails to maximize the potential of each client's empirical
risk toward other clients. Based on our observation, in this work, we propose
Personalized Global Federated Learning (PGFed), a novel personalized FL
framework that enables each client to personalize its own global objective by
explicitly and adaptively aggregating the empirical risks of itself and other
clients. To avoid massive (O(N^2)) communication overhead and potential privacy
leakage while achieving this, each client's risk is estimated through a
first-order approximation for other clients' adaptive risk aggregation. On top
of PGFed, we develop a momentum upgrade, dubbed PGFedMo, to more efficiently
utilize clients' empirical risks. Our extensive experiments on four datasets
under different federated settings show consistent improvements of PGFed over
previous state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at

dynamical system. Given observation data on a short-term period satisfying some
unknown slow-fast stochastic system, we propose a novel algorithm including a
neural network called Auto-SDE to learn invariant slow manifold. Our approach
captures the evolutionary nature of a series of time-dependent autoencoder
neural networks with the loss constructed from a discretized stochastic
differential equation. Our algorithm is also proved to be accurate, stable and
effective through numerical experiments under various evaluation metrics.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Labeling neural network submodules with human-legible descriptions is useful
for many downstream tasks: such descriptions can surface failures, guide
interventions, and perhaps even explain important model behaviors. To date,
most mechanistic descriptions of trained networks have involved small models,
narrowly delimited phenomena, and large amounts of human labor. Labeling all
human-interpretable sub-computations in models of increasing size and
complexity will almost certainly require tools that can generate and validate
descriptions automatically. Recently, techniques that use learned models
in-the-loop for labeling have begun to gain traction, but methods for
evaluating their efficacy are limited and ad-hoc. How should we validate and
compare open-ended labeling tools? This paper introduces FIND (Function
INterpretation and Description), a benchmark suite for evaluating the building
blocks of automated interpretability methods. FIND contains functions that
resemble components of trained neural networks, and accompanying descriptions
of the kind we seek to generate. The functions are procedurally constructed
across textual and numeric domains, and involve a range of real-world
complexities, including noise, composition, approximation, and bias. We
evaluate new and existing methods that use language models (LMs) to produce
code-based and language descriptions of function behavior. We find that an
off-the-shelf LM augmented with only black-box access to functions can
sometimes infer their structure, acting as a scientist by forming hypotheses,
proposing experiments, and updating descriptions in light of new data. However,
LM-based descriptions tend to capture global function behavior and miss local
corruptions. These results show that FIND will be useful for characterizing the
performance of more sophisticated interpretability methods before they are
applied to real-world models.]]></summary>

high-dimensional observation data are essential in many real world
applications, such as gene mutation, brain diseases, natural disasters,

warning signals, we develop a novel approach: the directed anisotropic
diffusion map that captures the latent evolutionary dynamics in low-dimensional
manifold. Applying the methodology to authentic electroencephalogram (EEG)
data, we successfully find the appropriate effective coordinates, and derive
early warning signals capable of detecting the tipping point during the state
transition. Our method bridges the latent dynamics with the original dataset.
The framework is validated to be accurate and effective through numerical

the second coordinate holds meaningful information for critical transition in

limited in their ability to support longer sequence lengths, which is a key
requirement for many tasks that require inference over an input context. To
address this, we have trained XGen, a series of 7B parameter models on up to 8K
sequence length for up to 1.5T tokens. We have also finetuned the XGen models
on public-domain instructional data, creating their instruction-tuned
counterparts (XGen-Inst). We open-source our models for both research
advancements and commercial applications. Our evaluation on standard benchmarks
shows that XGen models achieve comparable or better results when compared with

modern media and entertainment sectors, gaming and Augmented/Virtual Reality
industries. Many methods have been proposed to recreate the HDR counterparts of
input Low Dynamic Range (LDR) images/videos given a single exposure or
multi-exposure LDRs. The state-of-the-art methods focus primarily on the
preservation of the reconstruction's structural similarity and the pixel-wise
accuracy. However, these conventional approaches do not emphasize preserving
the artistic intent of the images in terms of human visual perception, which is
an essential element in media, entertainment and gaming. In this paper, we
attempt to study and fill this gap. We propose an architecture called
ArtHDR-Net based on a Convolutional Neural Network that uses multi-exposed LDR
features as input. Experimental results show that ArtHDR-Net can achieve
state-of-the-art performance in terms of the HDR-VDP-2 score (i.e., mean

leverages the information from multiple tasks during training to improve model
performance. In medical imaging, MTL has shown great potential to solve various
tasks. However, existing MTL architectures in medical imaging are limited in
sharing information across tasks, reducing the potential performance
improvements of MTL. In this study, we introduce a novel attention-based MTL
framework to better leverage inter-task interactions for various tasks from
pixel-level to image-level predictions. Specifically, we propose a Cross-Task

incorporate information by interacting across tasks. We validated CTAN on four
medical imaging datasets that span different domains and tasks including:
radiation treatment planning prediction using planning CT images of two
different target cancers (Prostate, OpenKBP); pigmented skin lesion
segmentation and diagnosis using dermatoscopic images (HAM10000); and COVID-19
diagnosis and severity prediction using chest CT scans (STOIC). Our study
demonstrates the effectiveness of CTAN in improving the accuracy of medical
imaging tasks. Compared to standard single-task learning (STL), CTAN
demonstrated a 4.67% improvement in performance and outperformed both widely
used MTL baselines: hard parameter sharing (HPS) with an average performance

animal diseases by analyzing electronic medical records (EMRs), such as notes
and veterinary records. However, learning representations to capture entities
and relations with literal information in KGs is challenging as the KGs show
heterogeneous properties and various types of literal information. Meanwhile,
the existing methods mostly aim to preserve graph structures surrounding target
nodes without considering different types of literals, which could also carry
significant information. In this paper, we propose a knowledge graph embedding
model for the efficient diagnosis of animal diseases, which could learn various
types of literal information and graph structure and fuse them into unified
representations, namely LiteralKG. Specifically, we construct a knowledge graph
that is built from EMRs along with literal information collected from various
animal hospitals. We then fuse different types of entities and node feature
information into unified vector representations through gate networks. Finally,
we propose a self-supervised learning task to learn graph structure in pretext
tasks and then towards various downstream tasks. Experimental results on link
prediction tasks demonstrate that our model outperforms the baselines that
consist of state-of-the-art models. The source code is available at

by receiving cancer messages from different medical entities (e.g., medical
labs, and hospitals) in Norway. Such messages are validated by an automated
cancer registry system: GURI. Its correct operation is crucial since it lays
the foundation for cancer research and provides critical cancer-related
statistics to its stakeholders. Constructing a cyber-cyber digital twin (CCDT)
for GURI can facilitate various experiments and advanced analyses of the
operational state of GURI without requiring intensive interactions with the
real system. However, GURI constantly evolves due to novel medical diagnostics
and treatment, technological advances, etc. Accordingly, CCDT should evolve as
well to synchronize with GURI. A key challenge of achieving such
synchronization is that evolving CCDT needs abundant data labelled by the new
GURI. To tackle this challenge, we propose EvoCLINICAL, which considers the
CCDT developed for the previous version of GURI as the pretrained model and
fine-tunes it with the dataset labelled by querying a new GURI version.
EvoCLINICAL employs a genetic algorithm to select an optimal subset of cancer
messages from a candidate dataset and query GURI with it. We evaluate
EvoCLINICAL on three evolution processes. The precision, recall, and F1 score
are all greater than 91%, demonstrating the effectiveness of EvoCLINICAL.
Furthermore, we replace the active learning part of EvoCLINICAL with random
selection to study the contribution of transfer learning to the overall
performance of EvoCLINICAL. Results show that employing active learning in

Differential privacy (DP) is a rigorous mathematical definition of privacy. DP algorithms are randomized to protect user data by ensuring that the probability of any particular output is nearly unchanged when a data point is added or removed. Therefore, the output of a DP algorithm does not disclose the presence of any one data point. There has been significant progress in both foundational research and adoption of differential privacy with contributions such as the Privacy Sandbox and Google Open Source Library.


ML and data analytics algorithms can often be described as performing multiple basic computation steps on the same dataset. When each such step is differentially private, so is the output, but with …]]></summary>

IaC is useful because it applies the same rigor of application code development to infrastructure provisioning. Instead of manual point and click in a cloud console which can be unrepeatable or error-prone, you just store and change all infrastructure configurations as code in source control .
 This example uses Pulumi which allows you to write the IaC in Python.

 Thanks to the people who pointed out that mistake.
 --- original post ---
 This is something I'm curious about. I've seen a few people declaring that they're not using open source LLMs because they're GPU-poor, because the models aren't good enough, because the uis/frontends are hard to get started with, etc., and I've been wondering how much these comments and posts reflect the opinions and needs of the community as a whole. So, here's a poll. Answer away if you feel like it. 
 I'm sharing this on a few other subs too (for the sake of greater information gathering) so please don't vote more than once.
 If your reasoning is not on here, feel free to comment your thoughts. If more than one option describes you, please select the one that describes you the most.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Everyone, 
 I'm currently exploring the idea of a solution tailored for ML engineers and technologists. While I have a background in recruiting, I've often found myself dissatisfied with the typical recruitment process. It seems that many recruiters don't always appreciate the importance of working with candidates or understand the impact on people's livelihoods and careers. 
 What I'm proposing is the creation of a career representation firm specifically designed for purpose-driven technologists specializing in data, product, and hardware careers. This firm would advocate for the career interests of the most passionate ML engineers. 
 Our representation would encompass: 
 - Strategic Career Development: Crafting a strategic approach to help engineers secure opportunities aligned with their desired projects and professional development. 
 - Impact Matching: Identifying and connecting engineers with projects and teams where their technical skills, career goals, and personal interests can have the greatest positive impact, ensuring that your work aligns with your values and aspirations. 
 - Industry Leadership: Positioning you as an industry leader by marketing your expertise and securing speaking engagements at conferences and other events, enhancing your professional visibility and reputation. 
 In return for this representation, engineers would commit to a 3% fee deducted from their salary, which would support the services provided by the firm. 
 Would you be interested in participating in such a service? If not, would you consider recommending it to someone you know? If you are in favor of this idea, what makes you believe it would be advantageous for others even if it might not be your preference? Do you think you could personally benefit from this type of career representation? 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tech startups are running sexually explicit ads for apps promoting not-safe-for-work experiences on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.
 
These ads feature digitally created potential 'girlfriends' with large breasts and tight clothing, and some even use popular children's TV characters to promote 'NSFW pics' apps.
 
NBC News found 35 app developers running sexually explicit ads on Meta-owned apps, and 14 app developers running similar ads on TikTok.
 
The marketing push is part of an AI gold rush, capitalizing on the surge of interest in AI and benefiting from a double standard that hurts real human sex workers.
 
Researchers believe that the gender-based slant in these ads reflects social media platforms allowing sex-related ads only if the intended audience is men.
 
Meta and TikTok have stepped up their removal of sexually explicit AI ads after NBC News contacted them, but questions remain about how the ads got through their filters in the first place.
 
Similar ads also appear in the Apple and Google app stores, although the extent of advertising there is unknown.

 so I've been researching a little about transformers and meanwhile I had to understand sinusoidal positional embedding. I have found two implementations for this, after testing both approaches I found they compute different embeddings for the same position/timestep with the same embedding dimensions... shouldn't it be equal if the position and embedding dimensions are the same?
 This is getting me confused, because now I don't know which implementation should I consider... Do you have any suggestions to where I can look?

 There is online each chapter of the series summarized separately. So in the WebApp I could ask questions about the content. In addition, I can indicate which chapter I am reading, so that it is ensured not to spoil the user.
 I want to avoid to train a model. I would prefer to use one of the existing open-source models, like llama. A first, primitive idea: give the LLM all the summaries and the user's question. But this would mean to give all summaries as input every time. Not only that this approach would not be elegant, the restriction in the input size (number of words) would make this possibly even impossible.
 Feel free to share your ideas how i could solve this :)

 I was suddenly inspired to make a WH Gladius bot.
 Background: I recently got into the game, it seems very interesting to me personally, but alas, there are not enough guides on it for you to learn how to play at a high level. I don’t intend to spend hundreds of hours to master the base, so I decided to try something like RARL so that this thing would learn, and I could analyze its moves, change the conditions and thus start playing at an intermediate level faster.
 However, a superficial analysis revealed that the game does not have an API at all. Let's say I could grab some stats using Cheat Engine and OllyDbg, but I have no idea how to fit it into the gym. Or does gym as env need to pass a link to the client from the machine so that it only restarts it?
 In general, if anyone has done something similar, I ask for a link to a guide or a similar example.
 All the best

I managed to find some details about this model, including details about its topology and tokenizer, and I was even able to peek in and see several of its top predictions while typing!

 Hopefully this can give some insight into some of the trade-offs that Apple went through to put a model on every iPhone and MacBook — it’s small, it has a pretty narrow scope, and it’s not very capable on its own. Let me know what you think!

 I'm now trying to understand what methodology/models make sense. First of all, should I be looking at creating masks, or do bounding boxes suffice? My idea was that masks are better, since bounding boxes overlap with each other and can miss that an object has moved slightly, Or am I wrong and are masks just an extra hassle?

 We've been talking to many companies who are claiming they're working on agents but when you look under the hood, they are really just chains.
 I just listened to the Latent Space pod with Harrison Chase (Founder of Langchain) and I really liked how he thinks about chains vs agents.
 Chains: sequence of tasks in a more rigid order, where you have more control, more predictability.
 Agents: handling the edge-cases, the long-tail of things that can happen.
 And the most important thing is that it's not an OR question but an AND one: you can use them in the same application by starting with chains -> figuring our the edge-cases -> using agents to deal with them.

So I already have the voice I want to use (edited with uvr5 and it sounds really great, without any echo or noise on the background), I trained it on aivc so that I can generate this voice verbalizing the text content I need. I used high quality - it took like 40min to generate each phrase - and it is ok, but still a little robotic. So I installed RVC and trained a model with the original voice (edited with the uvr5) just like I did the training on aivc. So I loaded the trained model on the inference tab and I selected the audio to be processed - the generated audio files from aivc. Even selecting the harvest mode, the output was worse than the generated files from aivc. I even tried to record my own voice speaking the text but it does not sound good. My trained model on rvc has 500 epochs, and it may be a very good model to use, yet idk what I’m doing wrong. Maybe I’m misusing rvc, so what I need is to improve the realism of my aivc(or tortoise) generated voices, simple as that, is rvc the best option to do this? If yes, how? Any help please would be much appreciated thanks!

 Specifically, I am seeking innovative papers on weight manipulation in physics-informed neural networks.
 For instance papers like:
  
Weight initialization algorithm for physics-informed neural networks using finite differences
 Transfer Learning with Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Efficient Simulation of Branched Flows
  
Note that I am referring to the actual weights of the neural network and not the weights of the loss terms.
 I have to add that ideas from transfer learning are welcome too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi ML community, I have been working on benchmarking publicly available LLMs these past couple of weeks. More precisely, I am interested on the finetuning piece since a lot of businesses are starting to entertain the idea of self-hosting LLMs trained on their proprietary data rather than relying on third party APIs. To this point, I am tracking the following 4 pillars of evaluation that businesses are typically look into: - Performance - Time to train an LLM - Cost to train an LLM - Inference (throughput / latency / cost per token)
 For each LLM, my aim is to benchmark them for popular tasks, i.e., classification and summarization. Moreover, I would like to compare them against each other.
 So far, I have benchmarked Flan-T5-Large, Falcon-7B and RedPajama and have found them to be very efficient in low-data situations, i.e., when there are very few annotated samples. Llama2-7B/13B and Writer’s Palmyra are in the pipeline.
 But there’s so many LLMs out there! In case this work interests you, would be great to join forces.
 GitHub repo attached — feedback is always welcome :)

 Happy hacking!

Turbulence is ubiquitous in environmental and engineering fluid flows, and is encountered routinely in everyday life.

However, despite its importance, our current understanding and our ability to reliably predict such flows remains limited. This is mainly attributed to the highly chaotic nature a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let me give you a quick intro. My engineering experience primarily revolved around data processing, analytics, and distributed systems. Nonetheless, I had a desire to learn about ML, and imho the best way to learn is to work on a practical project. So, that's precisely what I did. A few months ago, I embarked on an exciting journey with a friend, and together, we've created http://github.com/huggingbench/huggingbench.
 Now, after three months, I find myself seeking validation for some of my assumptions from the broader community. If you'd like to learn more about our motivations and the path we've taken check out the blog post https://medium.com/@niksa.jakovljevic/introducing-huggingbench-a-path-to-optimized-model-serving-a17cecc8d3ec.
 What I'd like to gather from individuals with machine learning models in production is their level of investment in optimizing inference. Is this a commonplace practice? I acknowledge that it can vary on a case-by-case basis, but I'm still hopeful of identifying prevailing trends. After conversing with a few companies, I've come to the impression that only the truly large players (those spending six figures or more on inference per month) place significant emphasis on inference optimization, which is entirely understandable. Nevertheless, I sense that there are numerous low hanging fruits that could result in substantial cost savings, even for typical startups.
 Could it be that the entire machine learning field is still in its infancy, and many engineers may not be fully considering or prioritizing such optimizations? Perhaps businesses are not giving as much attention to cost considerations? Alternatively, there might be technical challenges I'm not yet aware of. In any case, I would greatly appreciate hearing your insights on the subject of inference optimization.

 I find it quite hard though to find out what's exactly the underlying technology breakthroughs that have allowed for these new applications. I mean, neural networks and similar machine learning techniques are already decades old.
 What technology led to the current AI boom? What would you say are the biggest conceptual improvements since? Or is it all just faster and bigger computers running 2000's tech?

 EntitySeg dataset
 Dense image segmentation tasks (e.g., semantic, panoptic) are useful for image editing, but existing methods can hardly generalize well in an in-the-wild setting where there are unrestricted image domains, classes, and image resolution and quality variations. Motivated by these observations, we construct a new entity segmentation dataset, with a strong focus on high-quality dense segmentation in the wild. The dataset contains images spanning diverse image domains and entities, along with plentiful high-resolution images and high-quality mask annotations for training and testing.
 We have now released the dataset at https://github.com/adobe-research/EntitySeg-Dataset

 So, I've been messing around with ML and I must say, the hardware requirements can be a real buzzkill... I mean, not everyone's got a huge GPU lying around or the money to rent a dedicated cloud instance.
 What are your hacks for pulling off decent model training without selling a kidney?
 Here's what I'm curious about:
  
CPU: Is anyone else training models on their CPU? How's that working out for you? What are some workarounds you've tried to make it less painful?
 Cloud: Who's been dabbling in cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure? Are they worth the pennies or complicated to set up?
 Big Dataset: How do you handle a massive dataset with a standard storage space?
  
Let's help each other get those models trained without going broke! :D

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the LOw-Memory Optimization paper one of the main ideas towards reducing memory usage in training LLMs is to replace a fancy optimizer like Adam with simple SGD. The reason is that Adam maintains "the optimizer state", which accounts for about 75% of the memory used. In contrast, SGD does not store any intermediate state, as they say on page one. So far, so good.

 On page six they have pie charts and a table showing memory usage for Adam, SGD, and LOMO. Here's where I got confused. The pie chart for SGD shows that the optimizer state accounts for nearly 50% of the memory used (weight, gradients and activations are shown separately). It's a major WTF moment: WHAT OPTIMIZER STATE? Can anybody understand and explain this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Medicine's field transformation is being driven by artificial intelligence (AI). However, an important debatable question arises: Will AI ever have a place in this field, or will it remain exclusive to doctors and medical pros?
 Opponents of automated AI diagnosis and treatment contend that machines cannot be relied upon to preserve patient health and lives. Bugs in AI algorithms might cause incorrect diagnoses and treatment prescriptions, leaving them cautious. Individual differences, the doubt is whether AI can truly empathize with patients.
 By contrast, advocates of AI in medicine contend that the technology can considerably improve diagnosis and treatment accuracy. Faster and more accurate than humans, machines can analyze large amounts of data. Not only does it identify rare and complex diseases, but it also saves time and resources. By incorporating AI, clinicians receive additional tips and signals to make more judicious choices.
 Where medical specialists are in short supply, AI can prove especially valuable. This approach can help with shortages in health systems.
 And what do you think?

I did my thesis on Parkinson disease binary classification on 3D structural brain mri, and the dataset has significantly small amount of data(around 80 samples); but due to high resolution and complex data structure I was able achieve around 70% accuracy.
 But now at 2023 using deep neural network only isnot enough to publish in a good journal. Currently I am learning about GAN and attention mechanism, but completely noob on this area. For my journal to get published, I have planned on applying some key operations. But I am not sure if they would work or not. So needed some advice on this regard.
  
Applying tranfer learning: as my dataset has very small amount of data. I was thinking if its possible to pre train a CNN Architecture with some other structural mri data of a different disease and then apply to my dataset? ( for example: brain tumor dataset has the same type of three dimensional data structure, but has comparatively good amount of data)
 
Applying attention mechanism: how should I approach on learning about attention mechanism? 
 
 Any other advices will be appreciated, thank you!

 To stay on top of the latest advancements in AI, look here first.
 (Chart showing how much different types of jobs can expect to be influenced by technology)
 Concerns about Generative AI
  
While the Generative AI impact is significant, other forms of automation are set to cause more widespread job displacement.
 The most impacted group will be middle-class, college-educated, white-collar workers, specifically those earning above $60,000 annually.
  
Creative professionals stand to benefit
  
Interestingly, workers in creative industries will likely utilize generative AI tools in their jobs rather than being replaced. This includes editors, writers, authors, poets, and lyricists.
 However, the use of such tools as ChatGPT may result in inconsistent outputs and even "coherent nonsense", leading to potential performance issues.

 I have ~10,000 documents that are "scams" because of some specific reason (all are verified); now I want to check if a new document is similar to any of the documents in the corpus of 10k scam documents. 
 Right now I've implemented a winnowing solution which normalizes text, breaks it up into windows, and then calculates the intersection between a document and each document in the corpus. HOWEVER, this method is pretty computationally expensive (for this many documents a single comparison cycle can take upwards of 3-4 minutes especially when windows are NOT precomputed). 
 How might I approach this problem? Because my data is pretty well structured, supervised learning might be a good approach but so might be setting up recursive chunking for the 10k document corpus and then using LLMs to access if this current legal document has any similarity, but I would love to hear your thoughts!

 Github: https://github.com/modelscope/modelscope-agent
 Abstract:
  
Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities to comprehend human intentions, engage in reasoning, and design planning-like behavior. To further unleash the power of LLMs to accomplish complex tasks, there is a growing trend to build agent framework that equips LLMs, such as ChatGPT, with tool-use abilities to connect with massive external APIs. In this work, we introduce ModelScope-Agent, a general and customizable agent framework for real-world applications, based on open-source LLMs as controllers. It provides a user-friendly system library, with customizable engine design to support model training on multiple open-source LLMs, while also enabling seamless integration with both model APIs and common APIs in a unified way. To equip the LLMs with tool-use abilities, a comprehensive framework has been proposed spanning over tool-use data collection, tool retrieval, tool registration, memory control, customized model training, and evaluation for practical real-world applications. Finally, we showcase ModelScopeGPT, a real-world intelligent assistant of ModelScope Community based on the ModelScope-Agent framework, which is able to connect open-source LLMs with more than 1000 public AI models and localized community knowledge in ModelScope.

 Some time ago I wanted to try out to train a neural network in the same way a human would with a dog, one command at the time, and in a reasonable number of iterations.
 What I thought it would be a simple exercise became (for me) a non-trivial project, so I decided to publish it here https://github.com/giteliot/lucioai
 I just wanted to share it with you, any feedback is highly appreciated.

Uber https://www.uber.com/en-CA/blog/deepeta-how-uber-predicts-arrival-times/
 Stripe https://stripe.com/blog/how-we-built-it-stripe-radar
 Most CTR papers coming from google are also NN based (like https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05310)
 Meta mentions NNs in their recommender system (also kind of a large scale tabular problem there) https://engineering.fb.com/2023/08/09/ml-applications/scaling-instagram-explore-recommendations-system
 Lyft forecasting https://medium.com/this-week-in-machine-learning-ai/causal-models-in-practice-at-lyft-with-sean-taylor-1e62efd62385
  
What's your intuition on DL vs GBDT on (very)large-scale tabular datasets? Have you heard of other such examples (or the reverse)? 
 Are there any particularly interesting open large tabular datasets on which I could test this? I guess datasets should also be wide/hard/with large intrinsic dimention (whatever that means) so there is something to learn with scale (the above examples sure feel good in this way).

Time series forecasting is critical to various real-world applications, from demand forecasting to pandemic spread prediction. In multivariate time series forecasting (forecasting multiple variants at the same time), one can split existing methods into two categories: univariate models and multivariate models. Univariate models focus on inter-series interactions or temporal patterns that encompass trends and seasonal patterns on a time series with a single variable. Examples of such trends and seasonal patterns might be the way mortgage rates increase due to inflation, and how traffic peaks during rush hour. In addition to inter-series patterns, multivariate models process intr…]]></summary>

 To stay on top of the latest advancements in AI, look here first.

 Musk's AI Integration Plan
  
Musk is contemplating merging Neuralink and Tesla, alongside his xAI startup, to create a comprehensive artificial intelligence model.
 Leveraging the text data from Twitter and real-world images from Tesla's Full Self-Driving network, he intends to develop AI chatbots and physical robots capable of real-world navigation.
  
Reasoning Behind the Merge
  
A concern that AI could potentially render humans obsolete led Musk to found xAI for AI safety.
 Musk is targeting to create an AI that can generate computer software and a politically unbiased chatbot rival to ChatGPT.
  
Twitter and Tesla as AI Datasets
  
Despite criticism, Musk's acquisition of Twitter offers access to vast user data for AI training.
 In addition, the Autopilot and Full-Self Driving systems of Tesla, with billions of collected camera images, serve as valuable resources to build physical robot AI.

 We hope that this helps engineers and other folks in the community to improve their fine-tuning.
 Here's what you can expect from the post:
 We compare full-parameter fine-tuning with LoRA and answer questions around the strengths and weaknesses of the two techniques. We train the Llama 2 models on three real-world use cases and demonstrate that using LoRA involves a trade-off between serving efficiency and model quality, which varies according to the specific task at hand. Additionally, we offer insights into how to stabilize training with LoRA through intelligent prompting techniques. We further show that adopting a lower learning rate can enhance the reliability of the resulting model checkpoints.

 Assume I have data for forex / stocks day trading, where my data/columns are:
 1) price of last 50 ticks (a tick is the price at that moment in time, the smallest movement possibly that you can get for that currency)
 2) If we should be in a trade (and direction of trade. where 1 = trade going up. 2 = trade going down. 0 = we should not be in a trade).
 I have tried classification (I generalized the tick price by changing it to pct_change() ) but accuracy is low.
 would it be possible to reverse engineer through reinforcement learning given these data? I am actually more interested in the trade exiting only (so if trade is currently has value of 1 then it became 0 or 2, it means we should exit existing trade). 
 any guide on how to go about this? Yes I know it will be hard. but if humans can teach a robot to walk, maybe hopefully an agent can be taught to learn to exit a trade based on historucal data?
 I have done preliminary readings, and is PPO the best way to go? or DQN? assuming I will use stable baseline3. I am also open to using other Python libraries.
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi ML Community!
 I'm working on a card game similar to Hearthstone or Magic: The Gathering, i.e. a game where two players battle with decks of cards coming from a large collection (for instance, there are around 4000 cards in Hearthstone).
 Actions are limited to three things:
  
Play a card (potentially on a target)
 Use a card on a target
 End the turn
  
I'm looking at building AI for it, and am investigating using machine learning for it. I know very little on the subject (I am a game engineer with a reasonable experience of cloud / AWS stuff), but it seems to me that it might be a good fit: features would be the state of the board (i.e. all the cards in play or in hand or in deck), the turn, and whether the current player has won that game or not (eventually), and label would be the action taken (that turn).
 I was looking at SageMaker, hoping that it would streamline and allow me to try something relatively easily, but I immediately found it complicated and quite unclear.
 I would be very grateful if anyone could point me at resources describing at a high level what a full ML pipeline could look like (i.e. what software can injest this kind of data, what software can provide inference, etc.). For instance, would it be saner to "just" get started with Spark on EMR for this kind of problem domain?
 I hope I'm not too wide off the mark with those questions, and thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've just finished pre-processing the danbooru dataset, which if you don't know, is a 5 million anime image dataset. Each image is tagged by humans such as ['1girl', 'thigh_highs', 'blue eyes'], however, many images are missing tags due to there being so many. I've filtered the tags (classes) down to the 15k most common. Although the top classes have 100k or more examples, many rare classes only have a few hundred tags (long tail problem?). 
 This is my first time training on such a large dataset, and I'm planning on using Convnext due to close to SOTA accuracy and fast training speed. Perhaps vit or a transformer architecture may benefit from such a large dataset? However, vit trains way slower even on my 4090. 
 What are some tips and tricks for training on such a large noisy dastaset? Existing models such as deepdanbooru work well on common classes, but struggles on rare classes in my testing. 
 I assume class unbalance will be a huge problem, as the 100k classes will dominate the loss compared to the rarer classes. Perhaps focal loss or higher sampling ratio for rare classes?
 For missing labels, I'm planning on using psuedolabeling (self distillation) to fix the missing labels. What is the best practice when generating psuedolabels? 
 ​
 Any tips or experiences with training on large unbalanced noisy datasets you could contribute would be greatly appreciated!

 I have a project I would need help with. We need to build a MVP (minimum viable product) of a combination of two models.
 A model that recommend the best channel to use performing a task. And then after that a model to recommend the best time today to perform that task in given channel.
 We have a set of features already defined. Some are in the data and some are generated from the data.
 Looking for someone who could work on this as a freelancer.
 Our preferred environment would be AWS SageMaker, but honestly not a necessity at this point as this is a MVP.
 Due to the reason I want to keep this "secret" for a while, I will not disclose all the details in this post.
 End product that I am waiting for includes (but not restricted to): - Model Training script that evaluates if the new model is more accurate as the previous model (some level of version control) - Model prediction API that will accept the data and prepare it for the models, run the prediction, return the result with accuracy.

On the surface it sounds similar to teaching the robot to walk, but it's not. We can train the robot to make it walk easily these days. But I'm not sure how to teach it to minic an action that we perform. Because each time a new action can be given to the robot and it has to minic that action (it's sort of like a supervised data that the robot has to memorize) Is there a way to do it? is it some branch of machine learning that I'm not aware?
 The robot is a humanoid simulation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Martian Lawyers Club (MLC) has raised $2.2 million in a pre-seed round to develop AI-based game personalization technology.
 
Unlike other companies that focus on generating game assets, MLC is focused on the systems that form the core of a game.
 
The company aims to create games that feel like a conversation, where players provide input and the game responds in a way that wasn't pre-defined by the developer.
 
MLC plans to provide an SDK that allows developers to design the game experience without having to create every interaction from scratch.
 
Developers will have access to a sandbox experience where they can design the game, and the SDK will also have guardrails to ensure the generative AI system stays within boundaries.
 
MLC is currently working on its first game, a collectible card game, to test out its SDK.
 
The company is the first spin-off from INSAIT, an AI-centric tech institute, and has received funding from Fly Ventures, System.One, and Amar Shah.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all !
 Reading through articles online and reading through sub reddit I have seen some people use LLMs (mainly through openAI) for nlp specific tasks (NER, Text classification, etc.). I was a bit surprised as smaller (~100 million) size models already like RoBERTa exist for such cases.
 Not much content online about this beside this recent paper : https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.10092.pdf
 Highly recommend reading it, here are a few take aways:
  
Most LLM benchmarks today focus on capabilities like understanding, reasoning and Q&A. They often overlook performance on specific nlp tasks like text classification, NER, etc.
 Llama 2 (70b) required fine-tuning to beat GPT 3.5 in some tasks. Both were still overall outperformed by RoBERTa.
 In certain cases GPT4 did better. However smaller open models provide more advantages in terms of speed, cost and transparency.
 The difference of speed/latency (often more important than accuracy in production) and the cost differences between LLMs and "Smaller" models is mind blowing in my view (see screenshots)
  
​
 Cost, speed and throughput comparaison
 How good the models do on various tasks/datasets
 Note: Not saying benchmarks are a source of truth, just found the analysis interesting, always take benchmarks with a grain of salt. 
 If you're using LLMs for anything else beside text generation, I'm curious to know more about your experience so far :) cheers!

A short while ago I was laid off for reasons unrelated to AI. The way I see it, this is an excellent opportunity to make a career pivot. I have an intermediate understanding of JavaScript, React, Node and Linux. I have a good understanding of other technologies and languages too but specialize in web-dev. not saying web-dev will be done by AI but my very specialized niche will be gone way before I am ready to retire.
  
 Can anyone recommend any good online courses? If you could even recommend a good article or two? I really don't know where to start. There are so many different buzz words floating around right now and it feels like it would be easy to waste a bunch of time learning AI related stuff that is outdated or leading to a deadend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Problem: I have a quite complex model that is written in C that takes parameters as an input and estimates a curve as an output. I would like to optimize the parameters by comparing the output with the real measurements using ML methods such as stochastic gradient descent.
 ​
 Question: Is there any possible way to use white box optimizers to optimize the parameters of my C-model without adapting the model itself? Is there a framework that I could use?
 ​
 What I tried: I tried using frameworks such as tensorflow or pytorch and tried to include the compiled C-model in Python. However, gradient tracking does not work when using C functions. I tried doing the optimization in C++ by using libtorch. I realized that for gradient tracking it is essential to only use torch methods. I cannot adapt the C functions to torch functions. I don't want to use black box optimizers since they require good knowledge of the parameters that I will not have.

 What’s the current way to go about this? I was reading about Teslas Hydra network that looks to be more of a foundation model. However, newer methods like latent diffusion models operate on a latent space generated by more advanced auto encoders such as VQ-VAE. 
 I couldn’t find any papers going into this direction and would be curious to hear your thoughts!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey fellow Redditors,
 I've been wondering about a question lately about the inner workings of large language models like GPT-3.5 and I'm hoping some of you knowledgeable folks can shed some light on this. My curiosity centers around how these models manage to perform translation tasks as an emergent property of next token prediction.
 So, here's my question: Does the training data for models like GPT-3.5 contain text explicitly linking between languages, such as a dictionary, or do they learn translation by assigning similarity between words in different languages based on mathematical metrics like cosine distance?So in that sense, being indepedently trained on several textbooks of different languages (not on the same topic), they would be able to link languages simply by their arithmetic properties? I hope that's making sense.
 For instance, if you look at words like "queen" in English and "rainha" in Portuguese, they share a certain similarity that could be quantified using mathematical similarity metrics. I'm wondering if through this similar vector assignment, the models learn what means what.
 I'm more leaning towards the latter, but I'm too lazy to pursue this empirically.As a follow up question, does this mean that if we are able to predict whale conversation, we would be able to translate it to English as well?
 Thanks in advance for any input you can provide! 🤓

 Does each row in weights and bias considered as a separate agent?
 Are the initial few 100’s of rewards according to timestamp be considered as baseline behaviour? Thankful in advance.

However, I've encountered some issues. After adding the discriminator network, the discriminator's loss function stabilizes at around 0.3, and I'm unsure if this value is too high. Additionally, it is strange that the value loss of my value network can reach values between 80 and 90. I want to know if anyone else has experienced a similar situation and what might be the reasons behind these issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent survey by GitLab reveals a growing trend among organizations implementing AI in their software development processes, deeming it essential to stay competitive.
 To stay on top of the latest advancements in AI, look here first.
 GitLab Survey
 AI becomes crucial for software development
  
GitLab's report reveals that most respondents (83%) consider AI essential for their software development, regardless of their position, job level, or years of experience.
 Most organizations have deemed AI adoption successful, with 90% stating confidence in using AI tools daily.
  
Areas of AI application and concerns about its integration
  
AI's application in software development extends beyond simply generating codes, focusing more on natural language chatbots, automated test generation, and tracking machine learning model experiments.
 However, despite the growing adoption, concerns about AI-generated codes lacking copyright protection (48%) and potentially introducing vulnerabilities (39%) are rising.
 The rising fear of AI replacing existing roles is evident, with 57% predicting that their jobs might be threatened within five years.
  
The need for training and the real-world implications of AI integration
  
As AI permeates workplaces, nearly 81% believe they require more training.
 Interestingly, those with more AI experience were less likely to link it with productivity gains and faster cycle times, highlighting the importance of human verification in AI-generated codes for ensuring error-free, secure, and copyright-compliant production.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I’m an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer. I want to be a practitioner. Building, deploying, and evaluating models to solve problems.
 Ideally I want to land a job in Tech as an MLE. I struggle at times to stay committed to building side projects, studying ML algos, etc.
 I have a background in hardware specific C++ SWE stuff for 3.5 yrs, but not much in the way of ML and web backend. I do have a decent amount of python coding from other experiences and it’s my preferred language.
 Would anyone be interested in forming a discord to talk about what we are doing to prepare, practice interview each other, stay accountable to each other, etc?
 Had a few people show interest in r/ArtificialInteligence already
 If so comment below! Let’s do this!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Insilico Medicine, an AI-driven biotech company, has announced its AI-designed COVID-19 drug is entering Phase I clinical trials. Promising to deliver lasting results against all variants, this could become the first viable alternative to Paxlovid.
 To stay on top of such cutting-edge advancements in AI, look here first.
 Insilico's breakthrough medicine, ISM3312
  
Generated using Artificial Intelligence, ISM3312 may offer the superior solution to the constraints of current oral medication, Paxlovid.
 Insilico’s new drug could address the limitations of Paxlovid, including unpleasant side effects and drug resistance due to constant COVID mutation.
 Preclinical studies reveal the drug’s potential in reducing the viral load in lung tissue and mitigating lung inflammation.
  
Development powered by AI
  
Identified via AI-driven platform PandaOmics, the drug effectively targets crucial proteins in the coronavirus.
 Using Chemistry42, a generative chemistry platform, Insilico generated new molecules built to suppress this protein, creating ISM3312.
 Given the success, the company patented ISM3312, which is currently undergoing Phase I Clinical trials, with results expected by end 2023.
  
The Implications
  
Dr. Harvey Castro, an emergency medicine physician, encourages doctors to remain cautious but also recognizes the promise of AI-generated drugs like ISM3312.
 With the trials in progress, the medical community is closely monitoring it as it could redefine the treatment course for COVID and other similar viruses.
 Insilico's venture exhibits AI's potential in accelerating effective drug discovery, prompting the need for consistent tracking of AI's transformation of healthcare and other fields.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! Last year we launched a tool to make it easier to deploy ML models into production behind REST APIs.
 Our first prototype was focused on small models built with Scikit-Learn and XGBoost, but pretty quickly we got a lot of requests to support bigger, more complex models built on Tensorflow, Pytorch and Transformers.
 From detecting model dependencies to building out auto-scaling compute, it's been a lot of fun working through the challenges to make this product scale.
 We've built a few tutorials to showcase deploying some interesting and complex models to REST Endpoints. The latest one we released is a tutorial showing how to deploy a Grounding DINO model to a Rest API Endpoint for open-set object detection with prompts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I know that embeddings work by finding words that are used in similar contexts or found around some input word. This allows us to find similar words based on proximity to other words and in a way, map a relationship between an input word and other words.
 But I assume children learn what words mean and the intuition behind them, by hearing the word and associating it with visuals or a specific scenario in front of them which helps them to add context to that word and how it is used.
 If we were to emulate how children learn words, could we or is there an architecture that allows us to take an input word, find images with the input word in there (Object detection) and then extract the context from the images (other objects and their position and relation to the input word) then convert that context to phrases and query those phrases the next time that a word is inputted to see other phrases or words that are similar to the input word based on whether or not they appear in the images of the input word.
 Not sure if it makes sense or if it is even useful compared to embeddings but I was thinking about how we could emulate how children learn words to see if we could draw influence from that. Just wondering if there’s a similar approach to this where we use context from images to find similar words and phrases to some input.

Usually my first thought when I try to augment my ML models is input data preprocessing. In case of NER stop word removal and removal of punctuation, numbers and one-character words came to mind - they are hardly ever named entities so I woulndt loose many training examples. However, NER does in fact require context to work, so removing stuff could prove harmfull in the end? I am kind of torn. Should I do it? Are there better data augmentation approaches? I would be really thankfull for any kind of hint

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I used to do some basic machine learning a few years ago (7+), but then went into what now became data engineering, because of the lack of opportunities in ML.
 This year I'm trying to up my game and maybe switch back to ML, which I've always been following and tinkering with, but I want to learn all the necessary skills at least at a basic level, in order to find an ML job.
 I'm learning on my own but now I'm looking for resources regarding MLOps and found ml.school and I'm curious if anyone has any opinons about it or if there is anyone here who has went over the course?
 Thanks in advance for any help or info!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this post, we introduce a novel method to perform content moderation on image data with multi-modal pre-training and a large language model (LLM). With multi-modal pre-training, we can directly query the image content based on a set of questions of interest and the model will be able to answer these questions. This enables users to chat with the image to confirm if it contains any inappropriate content that violates the organization’s policies. We use the powerful generating capability of LLMs to generate the final decision including safe/unsafe labels and category type. In addition, by designing a prompt, we can make an LLM generate the defined output format, such as JSON format. The designed prompt template allows the LLM to determine if the image violates the moderation policy, identify the category of violation, explain why, and provide the output in a structured JSON format.]]></summary>

 Segment Anything and other auto-segmentation tools simply do not work on our dataset. So, I do not want a tool that is user friendly because it uses AI.

 My initial idea was to only maintain the header of the packets and to discard the data payload. But even in this case the dataset remains huge and the number of entries is crazy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 I am training an agent via PPO. The environment is a node removal ('n' number of actions which are nodes on the graph) with evaluation after each node removed. the state is represented by a trained graph attention network in the environment with the average of the node embeddings on the graph representing the state of dimension size 'n'. The embedding of the a node that has been removed is subtracted from overall graph embedding representation to represent the 'removal' of that node. 
 However, I want to absolutely be certain, that given a state representation, in a new unseen graph, the agent will not select a node that is absent from that graph. In the event that the state representation may not be granular enough and might cause the agent to think that a node on the graph is present when it is not, are there ways to mitigate this? Two ideas I have are:
  
mask actions for nodes that are not present (this is already done after node removal to prevent the agent from selecting the same node again), but is this valid to do in an unseen graph if I a priori mask nodes that are not present in the action space
 Inject a second input to the policy network such as a one-hot encoding of nodes that have already been selected as an input in addition to the state representation of the graph, so that it models finer dependencies between the state and action taken. However is this valid? 
  
Any thoughts are appreciated! thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been running hyperparameter optimization for an LGBM multi-classifier model with randomized search with 10fold stratified cv as well as oversampling on each fold using SMOTE as follows:
 # Create a pipeline with SMOTE oversampling smote_pipeline = make_pipeline(SMOTE(random_state=42), lgbm_clf) # Initialize 10-fold stratified cross-validation cv = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=10, shuffle=True, random_state=42) # Initialize RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning using the pipeline random_search = RandomizedSearchCV( estimator=smote_pipeline, param_distributions=param_dist_with_prefix, n_iter=n_iter, scoring=f1_macro_scorer, n_jobs=n_cores, pre_dispatch=n_cores, cv=cv, random_state=42 
 I wanted do incorporate early stopping based on the validation set from the nth iteration of cv. However this does not seem possible using the current API if I am correct.
 If I wanted to use a predefined validation set the code would be sth like this but I want to perform validation using 10 fold-cv validation set only:.
 mode l= lgb.LGBMClassifier() clf = RandomizedSearchCV( model, parameters, fit_params={ 'early_stopping_rounds':20, 'eval_set':[(X,y)] }, cv=cv ) 
 My questions are:
 1- Does it make sense to use early stopping during randomized search?
 2- Do you know a way I could do it?
 3- If not, is it a good idea to use randomized search without early stopping and train a new model with early stopping using the best parameters resulting from randomized search?
 Bonus Question: Does it make sense to run randomized search with f1_macro scoring from sklearn instead of multilogloss in case of imbalanced classes?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am currently working on predicting 2D deformations of objects. These objects are available as 2D contours in my code. I am splitting these contours into 1000 points with an equal distance in the direction of the x axis. I have about 70 data entries. 
 The following picture shows one of these objects:
 Comparison before and after
 The red data series contains the points before and the blue series contains the points after the deformation.
 My model should take in a series of coordinates before the deformation. Using this information the model should predict the coordinates after the deformation. 
 I have tried using the LSTM Model from keras. Unfortunately I wasn't able to produce useful results. The way I structured my data is the following:
 [
 [
 [x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], ... 1000 coordinate pairs
 ], [
 [x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...
 ],
 .... 70 entries
 ] 
 The structure for the input and the output series is the same. 
 When trying to train the model I have a very low loss and low validation loss as well:
 Overview during training of model
 The test loss is also quite similar:
 Overview test loss
 However when looking into the predictions I get results like these:
 Visualized prediction after training
 The prediction is not close to what it should be like. Also the prediction seems to not change even when changing the input. 
 ​
 Do you have an idea about why my ML model does not work? Are there examples on this topic available? Should I change my approach in any way?
 Thank you in advance! Any help is appreciated!
 ​
 If you need my jupyter-notebook, it would be great if somebody could tell me, how to link files on Reddit :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks! I wanted to advertise Equinox -- my now-surprisingly-popular ( :D ) JAX library for numerical models. These days that often means "neural networks", but I like to emphasise that this also includes ODEs/SDEs/linear solves, etc.
 Here's the GitHub link: https://github.com/patrick-kidger/equinox
 For those already using JAX, then Equinox is interesting because (a) it ships with a NN library, and (b) this is built around the idea that "everything is a pytree", which makes things easy to reason about and easy to compose. Furthermore (c) Equinox offers advanced tools like true runtime errors, out-of-place pytree surgery, and checkpointed while loops, and AFAIK in the JAX ecosystem these are unique to Equinox.
 For those most familiar with PyTorch: for many use cases (sciML in particular), JAX has a much stronger compiler, more advanced autodiff, etc. And whilst JAX itself is akin to the torch.* namespace, libraries like Equinox are then akin to the torch.nn.* namespace.
 Because of its speed and features, right now JAX+Equinox is my favourite approach to numerical computing. So I'd love for some more people to try it. What do you think?

 -How does resource provisioning work with it? Is it able to automatically select the machines that best suits the resource requirements or does it require the user to select where to run the job? Is it able to scale vertically/horizontally?

 I think we all agree that having a flexible configuration is crucial to successful ML experimentation.

So why did I decide to write yet another library?
 First off, I can say that I never really liked the way huggingface handles configs. All options are on a single level with tons of dependencies between them, some only taking effect if a combination of others is given. General approach to configs asid…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learning a skill, for me, was never about securing knowledge that privileged me over everyone else who did not put the work in. While often, it did feel like drinking Kool-Aid, buying in to these groups like yoga and climbing, I knew I was not there to rub elbows, but to discover the how behind it. Some leaders of some groups did create a barrier of entry, a necessary proving point, but I have always seen these loops to jump through as a challenge - once completed - a spy. Every skill you have learned has prepared you not to be better at that skill, but to learn a new skill with more ease. It is uncomfortable to learn something new, like drinking from a fire hydrant, but the more sips you take from that blasting surge of water, the more you realize it is all part of the process. We get blasted, we sip, we get overwhelmed, we come back. Just because there is a tool that regulates the blasting, that holds our hand through the overwhelm, does not mean all our hard work has been for nothing. In fact, it means we are more prepared, more primed, to receive all of the beauty and knowledge coming our way. Now, friends, we become CURATORS. :) xo

Technically, is this a way for a computer to input language of a person and then convert it into machine code (0s and 1s)? Or, is this a way to turn human language into some computer language like Python, and then turn into machine code as a second step?
 I am assuming that NLP has only just recently become widely used (like in Chat GPT). Was it a huge jump to go from a machine understanding a computer programming language like Python to a machine understanding ordinary human language? Why was it so much more difficult to train computers to understand the later?

 Abstract:
  
Neuromodulators in the brain act globally at many forms of synaptic plasticity, represented as metaplasticity, which is rarely considered by existing spiking (SNNs) and nonspiking artificial neural networks (ANNs). Here, we report an efficient brain-inspired computing algorithm for SNNs and ANNs, referred to here as neuromodulation-assisted credit assignment (NACA), which uses expectation signals to induce defined levels of neuromodulators to selective synapses, whereby the long-term synaptic potentiation and depression are modified in a nonlinear manner depending on the neuromodulator level. The NACA algorithm achieved high recognition accuracy with substantially reduced computational cost in learning spatial and temporal classification tasks. Notably, NACA was also verified as efficient for learning five different class continuous learning tasks with varying degrees of complexity, exhibiting a markedly mitigated catastrophic forgetting at low computational cost. Mapping synaptic weight changes showed that these benefits could be explained by the sparse and targeted synaptic modifications attributed to expectation-based global neuromodulation.

However, not all tokens are equally important, especially for longer documents. 
 CoLT5, a long-input Transformer model that builds on this intuition by employing conditional computation, devoting more resources to important tokens in both feedforward and attention layers. CoLT5 can effectively and tractably make use of extremely long inputs, showing strong gains up to 64k input length.
 In this video, we walk through the ColT5 paper and explain what is T5, longT5, UL2 and PEGASUS, then discuss how ColT5 has advantage over previous methods for few-shot and 1-shot tasks.

 Abstract:
  
Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) have been shown to effectively encode positional information in transformer-based language models. However, these models fail to generalize past the sequence length they were trained on. We present YaRN (Yet another RoPE extensioN method), a compute-efficient method to extend the context window of such models, requiring 10x less tokens and 2.5x less training steps than previous methods. Using YaRN, we show that LLaMA models can effectively utilize and extrapolate to context lengths much longer than their original pre-training would allow, while also surpassing previous the state-of-the-art at context window extension. In addition, we demonstrate that YaRN exhibits the capability to extrapolate beyond the limited context of a fine-tuning dataset. We publish the checkpoints of Llama 2 7B/13B fine-tuned using YaRN with 64k and 128k context windows at https://github.com/jquesnelle/yarn .

 What is your experience regarding image sequences from videos in the training datasets? 
 My intuition is, that the added information to the dataset from one video isn't proportional to the number of frames. The network probably can't learn much more from 30 frames with little variation in comparison to a single image (at least if you use augmentations). What do you think about this? Or do you even know any research in the direction of this question?

This is often the most important reason for using a policy-based learning method. ". Is he referring to some kind of Bayesian technique? I'd highly appreciate some examples here.

 I'm a screenwriter that's curious about ML/AI tech and its applications to my industry. I'm wondering what the current best product is for writers and editors. Specifically, I'm curious if there's a product that can "edit" longform text - say, to trim a screenplay down from 140 pages to 120, while retaining style, plot, and narrative intent. Are there any products like that? Forgive me if this is too basic; I've only dabbled in ChatGPT and MidJourney to see what the fuss is about. Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My question is more focused on the pre-processing side, rather than the training side of things.
 I have a local RAG Q&A pipeline set up for personal documents (local regulations, technical manuals, stuff like that), and I'm looking for ways to improve it. 
 All the documents I'm working with are consistently structured, with nested bullets of varying depth making up most of the structure. So far I've been manually writing/tweaking a python script I wrote to recursively extract the nested bullets and duplicate their hierarchy parents' content for each of the inner-most bullets, that way each bullet has all the contextual content it needs to be valuable in a vacuum. 
 So something like: (a) 1. A. B.
 Would turn into: (a) + 1. + A. (a) + 1. + B.
 This works well in the sense that my LLM does a wonderful job answering my questions and citing the right sources, but the lion's share of my work goes into the tweaking of my parser scripts, or creating new ones entirely. I've played around with semantic segmentation via embedding models, but it doesn't really work here since I'm trying to retain the nested structure of the document for citation accuracy.
 Does anyone have any ideas for ots solutions that address this kind of thing? I can't be the only person who has run into this type of problem, but I've been having a really hard time finding relevant libraries/software that can even get me 80% of the way there.
 Also, I'm totally happy to hear what you guys have done and how's it's worked out/what walls you've hit!
 Edit: I suppose I should have included my current attempt as well, so it's doesn't look like I'm treating this subreddit like Google lol

 I have questions about data contracts!
 Schema evolution, where the schema of the destination evolves based on incoming data is nice for ingesting transactional data.
 However, there are scenarios where we might not want this automatic evolution. For example, when other parts of our infrastructure require a fixed schema or when we want to store only data that conforms to the current schema. This is where a data contract comes into play.
 Our plan is to implement a straightforward version of this concept initially. We're considering introducing settings on the pipeline to control schema evolution, and here are some modes we're thinking about:

 Tired of working hard on cleaning and parsing its responses to trigger a flow?
 Struggling to strip unhelpful prefixes (such as "Sure! " or "I am just a language model!")?
 Having to wait on retries in cases of unexpected outputs?
 Getting random responses on the same query?
 Need a "quick and dirty" text classifier? Don't have enough training data?

 The short of the paper is they show that an AI algorithm that can only learn via sampling from human action is unable to tractably simulate human behavior. I have seen papers like this one by u/alcanthro questioning the validity of the result, but I want to point out two objections to the paper that stand even if the result is true.
 ​
 1 - It only seems to apply for AIs trained to mimic humans via sampling human behavior: 
 The paper assumes the AI is trained via an arbitrary machine learning algo M that samples from possible human behaviors in given situations. This matches pretty well to how a lot of LLMs are pretrained (guess the next token), but doesn't seem to apply to any sort of reinforcement learning, since in those situations you are not training the …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This was a small project I was working upon which adds a recurrent prior to attention-based models. 
 This allows integrating an adaptive-computation mechanism, leading to much better length-extrapolation capabilities (compared to vanilla transformers). On some tasks, I'm able to OOD extrapolate to quite an appreciable extent!
 Its also (relatively) quite parallelizable with slightly different training regimes - thus, hopefully being scalable as well. Being lightweight, it might be useful for inferencing as it saves on memory (trading off compute instead).
 It's interesting to think that MHSA might contain an implicit inductive bias that prevents extrapolation. Replacing that with other variants helps a lot - I go in detail in the writeup!

 I could not find an associated codebase with that paper. If I wanted to create a similar UI like theirs anything you would recommend?
 More specifically, if I want to replicate the paper in 3 months full time (as a student with some experience in ML), what would be the best approach to the UI part of the paper. What if deployment is a concern? I was intially thinking of simple python frameworks like PySimpleGui, or maybe something more comprehensive like PyQt. I am rather unfamiliar with more common web frontend frameworks, but if there are suggestions that make such a Graph/Diagram based User interface easy to implement, I am open to them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How MoEs (sparsely gated ones) are trained appear to be rather opaque from looking at literature (e.g. GLAM and similar papers). 
 From my intuition it would make sense that it works either by:
 Each expert being trained on a subset of data (the data they are supposed to have expertise in) to predict a token given a previous token, or to predict a token given a contextual embedding. This would mean the expert MLPs are frozen, and the only thing concerning the experts that we train with the transformer is the gating mechanism. 
 or
 The experts are trained in the same training loop as the transformer (e.g. backprop over the whole network), but that each of the experts are only trained on a subset of the data corresponding to their expertise (e.g. as we perform the training loop and we run upon data from our math dataset, then we backprop through the math expert mlp)

 Could anyone help me resolve my confusion and point me in the right direction for how these are trained? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scammers are now using AI to create realistic voice deepfakes, aiming to trick people into transferring money. By mimicking real customer voices, this new type of voice fraud attempts to exploit bank security systems and deceive call center agents.
 To make sure you're updated about the latest AI trends, look here first.
 Increasing prevalence and sophistication of voice frauds
  
A rise in AI-generated voice frauds has been noted this year, with one major case featuring an investor in Florida whose voice was synthetically duplicated to deceive his bank.
 Voice authentication vendor Nuance detected its first successful deepfake attack on a financial services client late last year.
 These scams are facilitated by the wide availability of voice samples online, coupled with the growth of AI capabilities and hackers' access to stolen bank account details.
  
Defending against evolving AI threats
  
Currently, only a small percentage of fraud calls to large financial companies are AI-generated. Most attacks have targeted credit card service call centers.
 Fraudsters are advancing their techniques, now able to convert speech to a specific target's voice in real-time using advanced AI systems like Microsoft's VALL-E.
 With most of these security measures focusing on call centers and automated systems, individual calls to high-ranking officials remain a vulnerability.

 In my university, there are not a lot of companies visiting for campus placement this year so I decided to go on the offcampus job hunt. I'm a final year student (in masters but bachelors was unrelated to CS) and no work experience. 
 I have further personal goals for which I'd need a steady and good income. I decided if I could get a remote job it would be really beneficial for me as my living costs would be saved and I'll be paid much more than what India offers freshers(since I'll be paid in dollars or euros). 
 However, I need advice in various domains: 1. Should I focus on one of ML/DL/ Data science or multiple ? 2. Any resources that could help me learn ? 3. Projects that help me stand out from the crowd? 4. Where can I start looking for remote work(websites, etc)? 5. Any other personal advice is appreciated!

 abstract.
 This paper investigates the rational thinking capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-round argumentative debates by exploring the impact of fallacious arguments on their logical reasoning performance. More specifically, we present Logic Competence Measurement Benchmark (LOGICOM), a diagnostic benchmark to assess the robustness of LLMs against logical fallacies. LOGICOM involves two agents: a persuader and a debater engaging in a multi-round debate on a controversial topic, where the persuader tries to convince the debater of the correctness of its claim. First, LOGICOM assesses the potential of LLMs to change their opinions through reasoning. Then, it evaluates the debater’s performance in logical reasoning by contrasting the scenario where the persuader employs logical fallacies against one where logical reasoning is used. We use this benchmark to evaluate the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 using a dataset containing controversial topics, claims, and reasons supporting them. Our findings indicate that both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can adjust their opinion through reasoning. However, when presented with logical fallacies, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are erroneously convinced 41% and 69% more often, respectively, compared to when logical reasoning is used. Finally, we introduce a new dataset containing over 5k pairs of logical vs. fallacious arguments. The source code and dataset of this work are made publicly available.
 GPT3.5 vulnerable to false information generated by itself!

 "That groupby statement isn't doing what you think it's doing."
 "When you created your target variable by labeling people with this ratio >= 30%, you accidentally failed to capture a ton of actual responders, because the floating-point arithmetic used to derive this column is calculating people with actual values of 0.30 as 0.2999999999999998."

 This broader use model encourages further innovation and practical application in the computer vision community, driving progress in the AI industry.
  
FACET for enhanced AI fairness
  
Given the inherent difficulty and risks in ensuring fairness in computer vision, Meta introduced FACET.
 FACET has been developed to benchmark fairness across computer vision models performing tasks such as detection or classification, considering a wide array of demographic attributes.
 This revolutionary tool enables a better understanding of potential biases in AI models, helping to address fairness and robustness concerns.
  
Wider implications
  
Preliminary studies indicate performance disparities across some demographic groups within computer vision models. FACET allows researchers to track these divergences and monitor the implementation of corrective measures.
 Meta actively encourages researchers to use FACET for fairness benchmarking in other visual/multimodal tasks. For instance, the DINOv2 model's performance was analyzed with FACET — facilitating insights into potential biases.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction to the problem
 I will provide you with link to github code so you can see both input dataset, how my onehot encoding and decoding works and implementation of VAE, with current reconstruction_loss and kl_loss fuctions that make my loss function.
 dataset - amp.csv
 onehotencoding -- tools.py
 main code -- VAE-onehot-testing.ipynb
 https://github.com/aronta/Master-thesis-Generating-de-novo-peptides-using-variational-autoencoder-model/blob/main/VAE-onehot-testing.ipynb
 Firstly, just to explain dataset. I have sequences of peptides represented with onehot encoded sequences which I am using as input for my model. Current VAE model, both encoder and deocder are based on LSTM layer as a main way for this VAE to learn connections between inputed sequences and to make sense of it all.
 Main Issue
 Issue is that the latent space im getting doesn't look good no matter what i do. (pictures of plots are on link). So i have tried scalling kl loss (and also warming it up -- because many papers say its a good way) but it doesn't change the end result. Maybe there is problem in the implementation of the VAE, i am realy not sure.
 The main goal would be (like in all VAE implementations) generating new sequences from latent spaces that make sense, opposed to the current outputs that im getting.
 My guess
 There is a problem with optimizing loss function, but i could be completely wrong (maybe the model is wrong for the input I have, or onehotencoding isn't even a good way to represent data entering LSTM layer).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, I'm trying to compute the percentage of each language appearing in a document. My current use cases including two known languages and a set of documents which have the two languages mixed in (code switching, due to translation error). I'm training an ML model to make the output monolingual (leaned towards a designated language), so I need a reliable measure to estimate whether the ML model is making progress or not. Currently, I use lingua with the `compute_language_confidence_values()` function but the prediction is quite poor.
 For example, given a piece of text in Japanese and English:
 from lingua import Language, LanguageDetectorBuilder languages = [Language.ENGLISH, Language.JAPANESE] detector = LanguageDetectorBuilder.from_languages(*languages).build() detector.compute_language_confidence_values("わかりません hey do you understand me hey oh really") >>> [ConfidenceValue(language=Language.ENGLISH, value=1.0), ConfidenceValue(language=Language.JAPANESE, value=0.0)] 
 So it's not quite correct (should be 0.8-0.2 or something similar), does anyone have any advice ? Or are there better softwares out there ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a machine learning engineer and researcher. I got fed up with how difficult it is to understand why neural networks behave the way they do, so i wrote a library to help with it.
 Comgra (computation graph analysis) is a library you can use with pytorch to extract all the tensor data you care about and visualize it graphically in a browser.
 This allows for a much more detailed analysis of what is happening than the usual approach of using tensorboard. You can go investigate tensors as training proceeds, drill down into individual neurons, inspect single data sets that are of special interest to you, track gradients, compare statistics between different training runs, and more.
 This tool has saved me a ton of time in my research by letting me check my hypotheses much more quickly than normal and by helping me understand how the different parts of my network really interact.
 I hope this tool can save other people just as much time as it did me. I'm also open for suggestions on how to improve it further: Since I'm already gathering and visualizing a lot of network information, adding more automated analysis would not be much extra work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linear regression is a statistical technique for estimating the relationship between two variables. A simple example of linear regression is to predict the height of someone based on the square root of the person’s weight (that’s what BMI is based on). To do this, we need to find the slope and intercept of the line. […]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My husband Jeremy and I never intended to homeschool, and yet we have now, unexpectedly, committed to homeschooling long-term. Prior to the pandemic, we both worked full-time in careers that we loved and found meaningful, and we sent our daughter to a full-day Montessori school. Although I struggled with significant health issues, I felt unbelievably lucky and fulfilled in both my family life and my professional life. The pandemic upended my careful balance. Every family is different, with different needs, circumstances, and constraints, and what works for one may not work for others. My intention here is primarily to share the journey of my own (very privileged) family.
