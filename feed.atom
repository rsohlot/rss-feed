        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Modeling the interaction between proteins and ligands and accurately
predicting their binding structures is a critical yet challenging task in drug
discovery. Recent advancements in deep learning have shown promise in
addressing this challenge, with sampling-based and regression-based methods
emerging as two prominent approaches. However, these methods have notable
limitations. Sampling-based methods often suffer from low efficiency due to the
need for generating multiple candidate structures for selection. On the other
hand, regression-based methods offer fast predictions but may experience
decreased accuracy. Additionally, the variation in protein sizes often requires
external modules for selecting suitable binding pockets, further impacting
efficiency. In this work, we propose $\mathbf{FABind}$, an end-to-end model
that combines pocket prediction and docking to achieve accurate and fast
protein-ligand binding. $\mathbf{FABind}$ incorporates a unique ligand-informed
pocket prediction module, which is also leveraged for docking pose estimation.
The model further enhances the docking process by incrementally integrating the
predicted pocket to optimize protein-ligand binding, reducing discrepancies
between training and inference. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets, our proposed $\mathbf{FABind}$ demonstrates strong advantages in
terms of effectiveness and efficiency compared to existing methods. Our code is
available at $\href{https://github.com/QizhiPei/FABind}{Github}$.]]></summary>

solutions that are able to accelerate existing solvers while maintaining their

minimum number of edges. We propose the GRASP algorithm: Graph Attention
Accelerated Shortest Path Attack, an ML aided optimization algorithm that
achieves run times up to 10x faster, while maintaining the quality of solution

containing the combinatorial solution, thus effectively reducing the input

in the temporal knowledge graph (tKG) domain, where conventional carefully
designed embedding-based and rule-based models dominate. The question remains
open of whether pre-trained LLMs can understand structured temporal relational
data and replace them as the foundation model for temporal relational
forecasting. Therefore, we bring temporal knowledge forecasting into the
generative setting. However, challenges occur in the huge chasms between
complex temporal graph data structure and sequential natural expressions LLMs
can handle, and between the enormous data sizes of tKGs and heavy computation
costs of finetuning LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
retrieval augmented generation framework that performs generative forecasting
on tKGs named GenTKG, which combines a temporal logical rule-based retrieval
strategy and lightweight parameter-efficient instruction tuning. Extensive
experiments have shown that GenTKG outperforms conventional methods of temporal
relational forecasting under low computation resources. GenTKG also highlights
remarkable transferability with exceeding performance on unseen datasets
without re-training. Our work reveals the huge potential of LLMs in the tKG

small-scale problem instances, the LEHD model can generate nearly optimal
solutions for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Capacitated Vehicle

solve real-world TSPLib and CVRPLib problems. These results confirm our

independent Gaussian distributions can be tuned to criticality, which prevents
the exponential growth or decay of signals propagating through the network.
However, such networks still exhibit fluctuations that grow linearly with the
depth of the network, which may impair the training of networks with width
comparable to depth. We show analytically that rectangular networks with tanh
activations and weights initialized from the ensemble of orthogonal matrices
have corresponding preactivation fluctuations which are independent of depth,
to leading order in inverse width. Moreover, we demonstrate numerically that,
at initialization, all correlators involving the neural tangent kernel (NTK)
and its descendants at leading order in inverse width -- which govern the
evolution of observables during training -- saturate at a depth of $\sim 20$,
rather than growing without bound as in the case of Gaussian initializations.
We speculate that this structure preserves finite-width feature learning while
reducing overall noise, thus improving both generalization and training speed.
We provide some experimental justification by relating empirical measurements
of the NTK to the superior performance of deep nonlinear orthogonal networks
trained under full-batch gradient descent on the MNIST and CIFAR-10
classification tasks.]]></summary>

solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs), have shown
considerable promise for future scientific computing. However, the mainstream
of training neural operators is still data-driven, which needs an expensive
ground-truth dataset from various sources (e.g., solving PDEs' samples with the
conventional solvers, real-world experiments) in addition to training stage
costs. From a computational perspective, marrying operator learning and
specific domain knowledge to solve PDEs is an essential step in reducing
dataset costs and label-free learning. We propose a novel paradigm that
provides a unified framework of training neural operators and solving PDEs with
the variational form, which we refer to as the variational operator learning
(VOL). Ritz and Galerkin approach with finite element discretization are
developed for VOL to achieve matrix-free approximation of system functional and
residual, then direct minimization and iterative update are proposed as two
optimization strategies for VOL. Various types of experiments based on
reasonable benchmarks about variable heat source, Darcy flow, and variable
stiffness elasticity are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of VOL.
With a label-free training set and a 5-label-only shift set, VOL learns
solution operators with its test errors decreasing in a power law with respect
to the amount of unlabeled data. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is
the first study that integrates the perspectives of the weak form and efficient
iterative methods for solving sparse linear systems into the end-to-end
operator learning task.]]></summary>

the existing ML models with 3D geometries in terms of both accuracy and
efficiency. Moreover, it enables to sample various TS conformations, because it
learned the distribution of TS geometries for diverse reactions in training.
Thus, TSDiff was able to find more favorable reaction pathways with lower
barrier heights than those in the reference database. These results demonstrate
that TSDiff shows promising potential for an efficient and reliable TS

and demonstrated impressive capabilities in various tasks. Unfortunately, they
are prone to hallucinations, where the model exposes incorrect or false
information in its responses, which renders diligent evaluation approaches
mandatory. While LLM performance in specific knowledge fields is often
evaluated based on question and answer (Q&A) datasets, such evaluations usually
report only a single accuracy number for the dataset, which often covers an
entire field. This field-based evaluation, is problematic with respect to
transparency and model improvement. A stratified evaluation could instead
reveal subfields, where hallucinations are more likely to occur and thus help
to better assess LLMs' risks and guide their further development. To support
such stratified evaluations, we propose LLMMaps as a novel visualization
technique that enables users to evaluate LLMs' performance with respect to Q&A
datasets. LLMMaps provide detailed insights into LLMs' knowledge capabilities
in different subfields, by transforming Q&A datasets as well as LLM responses
into an internal knowledge structure. An extension for comparative
visualization furthermore, allows for the detailed comparison of multiple LLMs.
To assess LLMMaps we use them to conduct a comparative analysis of several
state-of-the-art LLMs, such as BLOOM, GPT-2, GPT-3, ChatGPT and LLaMa-13B, as
well as two qualitative user evaluations. All necessary source code and data

directly represent tasks through an abstract but versatile graph structure and
handle inputs of different sizes. This opens up the possibility for scaling and
extrapolation to larger graphs, one of the most important advantages of an
algorithm. However, this raises two core questions i) How can we enable nodes
to gather the required information in a given graph ($\textit{information
exchange}$), even if is far away and ii) How can we design an execution
framework which enables this information exchange for extrapolation to larger
graph sizes ($\textit{algorithmic alignment for extrapolation}$). We propose a
new execution framework that is inspired by the design principles of
distributed algorithms: Flood and Echo Net. It propagates messages through the
entire graph in a wave like activation pattern, which naturally generalizes to
larger instances. Through its sparse but parallel activations it is provably
more efficient in terms of message complexity. We study the proposed model and
provide both empirical evidence and theoretical insights in terms of its
expressiveness, efficiency, information exchange and ability to extrapolate.]]></summary>

made a paradigm shift in the realm of artificial intelligence (AI) towards
generative AI-based systems. In unison, from data communication and networking
perspective, AI and machine learning (AI/ML) algorithms are envisioned to be
pervasively incorporated into the future generations of wireless communications
systems, highlighting the need for novel AI-native solutions for the emergent
communication scenarios. In this article, we outline the applications of
generative AI in wireless communication systems to lay the foundations for
research in this field. Diffusion-based generative models, as the new
state-of-the-art paradigm of generative models, are introduced, and their
applications in wireless communication systems are discussed. Two case studies
are also presented to showcase how diffusion models can be exploited for the
development of resilient AI-native communication systems. Specifically, we
propose denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) for a wireless
communication scheme with non-ideal transceivers, where 30% improvement is
achieved in terms of bit error rate. As the second application, DDPMs are
employed at the transmitter to shape the constellation symbols, highlighting a
robust out-of-distribution performance. Finally, future directions and open
issues for the development of generative AI-based wireless systems are
discussed to promote future research endeavors towards wireless generative AI
(WiGenAI).]]></summary>

learning performance in classification tasks. Specifically, we redefine the
cross-entropy loss to effectively address class-level noise conditions,
including the challenging problem of class imbalance. Our approach introduces
aggregation operators, leveraging the power of fuzzy logic to improve
classification accuracy. The rationale behind our proposed method lies in the
iterative up-weighting of class-level components within the loss function,
focusing on those with larger errors. To achieve this, we employ the ordered
weighted average (OWA) operator and combine it with an adaptive scheme for
gradient-based learning. Through extensive experimentation, our method
outperforms other commonly used loss functions, such as the standard
cross-entropy or focal loss, across various binary and multiclass
classification tasks. Furthermore, we explore the influence of hyperparameters
associated with the OWA operators and present a default configuration that
performs well across different experimental settings.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most packages for the analysis of fMRI-based functional connectivity (FC) and
genomic data are used with a programming language interface, lacking an
easy-to-navigate GUI frontend. This exacerbates two problems found in these
types of data: demographic confounds and quality control in the face of high
dimensionality of features. The reason is that it is too slow and cumbersome to
use a programming interface to create all the necessary visualizations required
to identify all correlations, confounding effects, or quality control problems
in a dataset. To remedy this situation, we have developed ImageNomer, a data
visualization and analysis tool that allows inspection of both subject-level
and cohort-level demographic, genomic, and imaging features. The software is
Python-based, runs in a self-contained Docker image, and contains a
browser-based GUI frontend. We demonstrate the usefulness of ImageNomer by
identifying an unexpected race confound when predicting achievement scores in
the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) dataset. In the past, many
studies have attempted to use FC to identify achievement-related features in
fMRI. Using ImageNomer, we find a clear potential for confounding effects of
race. Using correlation analysis in the ImageNomer software, we show that FCs
correlated with Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT) score are in fact more
highly correlated with race. Investigating further, we find that whereas both
FC and SNP (genomic) features can account for 10-15\% of WRAT score variation,
this predictive ability disappears when controlling for race. In this work, we
demonstrate the advantage of our ImageNomer GUI tool in data exploration and
confound detection. Additionally, this work identifies race as a strong
confound in FC data and casts doubt on the possibility of finding unbiased
achievement-related features in fMRI and SNP data of healthy adolescents.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been extremely successful in
generating samples, from seemingly high dimensional probability measures.
However, these methods struggle to capture the temporal dependence of joint
probability distributions induced by time-series data. Furthermore, long
time-series data streams hugely increase the dimension of the target space,
which may render generative modelling infeasible. To overcome these challenges,
motivated by the autoregressive models in econometric, we are interested in the
conditional distribution of future time series given the past information. We
propose the generic conditional Sig-WGAN framework by integrating
Wasserstein-GANs (WGANs) with mathematically principled and efficient path
feature extraction called the signature of a path. The signature of a path is a
graded sequence of statistics that provides a universal description for a
stream of data, and its expected value characterises the law of the time-series
model. In particular, we develop the conditional Sig-$W_1$ metric, that
captures the conditional joint law of time series models, and use it as a
discriminator. The signature feature space enables the explicit representation
of the proposed discriminators which alleviates the need for expensive
training. We validate our method on both synthetic and empirical dataset and
observe that our method consistently and significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art benchmarks with respect to measures of similarity and
predictive ability.]]></summary>

suffer from the so-called optimizer's curse that causes an over-optimistic
evaluation of the solution performance. We argue that a special type of
distributionallly robust optimization (DRO) formulation offers theoretical
advantages in correcting for this optimizer's curse compared to simple
``margin'' adjustments to SAA and other DRO approaches: It attains a
statistical bound on the out-of-sample performance, for a wide class of
objective functions and distributions, that is nearly tightest in terms of
exponential decay rate. This DRO uses an ambiguity set based on a Kullback
Leibler (KL) divergence smoothed by the Wasserstein or L\'evy-Prokhorov (LP)
distance via a suitable distance optimization. Computationally, we also show
that such a DRO, and its generalized versions using smoothed $f$-divergence,
are not harder than DRO problems based on $f$-divergence or Wasserstein
distances, rendering our DRO formulations both statistically optimal and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is the relationship between model architecture and the ability to
perform in-context learning? In this empirical study, we take the first steps
towards answering this question. In particular, we evaluate fifteen model
architectures across a suite of synthetic in-context learning tasks. The
selected architectures represent a broad range of paradigms, including
recurrent and convolution-based neural networks, transformers, and emerging
attention alternatives. We discover that all considered architectures can
perform in-context learning under certain conditions. However, contemporary
architectures are found to be the best performing, especially as task
complexity grows. Additionally, our follow-up experiments delve into various
factors that influence in-context learning. We observe varied sensitivities
among architectures with respect to hyperparameter settings. Our study of
training dynamics reveals that certain architectures exhibit a smooth,
progressive learning trajectory, while others demonstrate periods of stagnation
followed by abrupt mastery of the task. Finally, and somewhat surprisingly, we
find that several emerging attention alternatives are more robust in-context
learners than transformers; since such approaches have constant-sized memory
footprints at inference time, this result opens the future possibility of
scaling up in-context learning to vastly larger numbers of in-context examples.]]></summary>

generalizes the factor models typically used in panel data settings. We propose
an estimator, Network Synthetic Interventions (NSI), and show that it
consistently estimates the mean outcomes for a unit under an arbitrary set of
counterfactual treatments for the network. We further establish that the
estimator is asymptotically normal. We furnish two validity tests for whether
the NSI estimator reliably generalizes to produce accurate counterfactual
estimates. We provide a novel graph-based experiment design that guarantees the
NSI estimator produces accurate counterfactual estimates, and also analyze the
sample complexity of the proposed design. We conclude with simulations that
corroborate our theoretical findings.]]></summary>

a video of an ongoing procedural activity, we predict a plausible next
procedure step described in rich natural language. While most previous work
focus on the problem of data scarcity in procedural video datasets, another
core challenge of future anticipation is how to account for multiple plausible
future realizations in natural settings. This problem has been largely
overlooked in previous work. To address this challenge, we frame future step
prediction as modelling the distribution of all possible candidates for the
next step. Specifically, we design a generative model that takes a series of
video clips as input, and generates multiple plausible and diverse candidates
(in natural language) for the next step. Following previous work, we side-step
the video annotation scarcity by pretraining our model on a large text-based
corpus of procedural activities, and then transfer the model to the video
domain. Our experiments, both in textual and video domains, show that our model
captures diversity in the next step prediction and generates multiple plausible
future predictions. Moreover, our model establishes new state-of-the-art
results on YouCookII, where it outperforms existing baselines on the next step
anticipation. Finally, we also show that our model can successfully transfer
from text to the video domain zero-shot, ie, without fine-tuning or adaptation,

relationships between objects, enabling various Web applications. Daily
influxes of unlabeled graph data on the Web offer immense potential for these
applications. Graph self-supervised algorithms have achieved significant
success in acquiring generic knowledge from abundant unlabeled graph data.
These pre-trained models can be applied to various downstream Web applications,
saving training time and improving downstream (target) performance. However,
different graphs, even across seemingly similar domains, can differ
significantly in terms of attribute semantics, posing difficulties, if not
infeasibility, for transferring the pre-trained models to downstream tasks.
Concretely speaking, for example, the additional task-specific node information
in downstream tasks (specificity) is usually deliberately omitted so that the
pre-trained representation (transferability) can be leveraged. The trade-off as
such is termed as "transferability-specificity dilemma" in this work. To
address this challenge, we introduce an innovative deployment module coined as
GraphControl, motivated by ControlNet, to realize better graph domain transfer
learning. Specifically, by leveraging universal structural pre-trained models
and GraphControl, we align the input space across various graphs and
incorporate unique characteristics of target data as conditional inputs. These
conditions will be progressively integrated into the model during fine-tuning
or prompt tuning through ControlNet, facilitating personalized deployment.
Extensive experiments show that our method significantly enhances the
adaptability of pre-trained models on target attributed datasets, achieving
1.4-3x performance gain. Furthermore, it outperforms training-from-scratch
methods on target data with a comparable margin and exhibits faster
convergence.]]></summary>

size and computational requirements make their deployment on
resource-constrained devices and time-sensitive tasks impractical. Model
distillation, the process of creating smaller, faster models that maintain the
performance of larger models, is a promising direction towards the solution.
This paper investigates the distillation of visual representations in large
teacher vision-language models into lightweight student models using a small-
or mid-scale dataset. Notably, this study focuses on open-vocabulary
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, a challenging problem that has been
overlooked in previous model distillation literature. We propose two principles
from vision and language modality perspectives to enhance student's OOD
generalization: (1) by better imitating teacher's visual representation space,
and carefully promoting better coherence in vision-language alignment with the
teacher; (2) by enriching the teacher's language representations with
informative and finegrained semantic attributes to effectively distinguish
between different labels. We propose several metrics and conduct extensive
experiments to investigate their techniques. The results demonstrate
significant improvements in zero-shot and few-shot student performance on
open-vocabulary out-of-distribution classification, highlighting the
effectiveness of our proposed approaches. Poster:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Humans often acquire new skills through observation and imitation. For
robotic agents, learning from the plethora of unlabeled video demonstration
data available on the Internet necessitates imitating the expert without access
to its action, presenting a challenge known as Imitation Learning from
Observations (ILfO). A common approach to tackle ILfO problems is to convert
them into inverse reinforcement learning problems, utilizing a proxy reward
computed from the agent's and the expert's observations. Nonetheless, we
identify that tasks characterized by a progress dependency property pose
significant challenges for such approaches; in these tasks, the agent needs to
initially learn the expert's preceding behaviors before mastering the
subsequent ones. Our investigation reveals that the main cause is that the
reward signals assigned to later steps hinder the learning of initial
behaviors. To address this challenge, we present a novel ILfO framework that
enables the agent to master earlier behaviors before advancing to later ones.
We introduce an Automatic Discount Scheduling (ADS) mechanism that adaptively
alters the discount factor in reinforcement learning during the training phase,
prioritizing earlier rewards initially and gradually engaging later rewards
only when the earlier behaviors have been mastered. Our experiments, conducted
on nine Meta-World tasks, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across all tasks, including those that are unsolvable
by them.]]></summary>

various voices to convey diverse information. Compared to traditional
text-to-speech (TTS) methods relying on speech prompts (reference speech) for
voice variability, using text prompts (descriptions) is more user-friendly
since speech prompts can be hard to find or may not exist at all. TTS
approaches based on the text prompt face two main challenges: 1) the
one-to-many problem, where not all details about voice variability can be
described in the text prompt, and 2) the limited availability of text prompt
datasets, where vendors and large cost of data labeling are required to write
text prompts for speech. In this work, we introduce PromptTTS 2 to address
these challenges with a variation network to provide variability information of
voice not captured by text prompts, and a prompt generation pipeline to utilize
the large language models (LLM) to compose high quality text prompts.
Specifically, the variation network predicts the representation extracted from
the reference speech (which contains full information about voice variability)
based on the text prompt representation. For the prompt generation pipeline, it
generates text prompts for speech with a speech language understanding model to
recognize voice attributes (e.g., gender, speed) from speech and a large
language model to formulate text prompts based on the recognition results.
Experiments on a large-scale (44K hours) speech dataset demonstrate that
compared to the previous works, PromptTTS 2 generates voices more consistent
with text prompts and supports the sampling of diverse voice variability,
thereby offering users more choices on voice generation. Additionally, the
prompt generation pipeline produces high-quality text prompts, eliminating the
large labeling cost. The demo page of PromptTTS 2 is available online.]]></summary>

with mixed boundary conditions. The Poisson equation is ubiquitous in
scientific computing: it governs a wide array of physical phenomena, arises as
a subproblem in many numerical algorithms, and serves as a model problem for
the broader class of elliptic PDEs. The most popular Poisson discretizations
yield large sparse linear systems. At high resolution, and for
performance-critical applications, iterative solvers can be advantageous for
these -- but only when paired with powerful preconditioners. The core of our
solver is a neural network trained to approximate the inverse of a discrete
structured-grid Laplace operator for a domain of arbitrary shape and with mixed
boundary conditions. The structure of this problem motivates a novel network
architecture that we demonstrate is highly effective as a preconditioner even
for boundary conditions outside the training set. We show that on challenging

outperforms state-of-the-art solvers like algebraic multigrid as well as some

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The past decade has witnessed significant advances in time series modeling
with deep learning. While achieving state-of-the-art results, the
best-performing architectures vary highly across applications and domains.
Meanwhile, for natural language processing, the Generative Pre-trained
Transformer (GPT) has demonstrated impressive performance via training one
general-purpose model across various textual datasets. It is intriguing to
explore whether GPT-type architectures can be effective for time series,
capturing the intrinsic dynamic attributes and leading to significant accuracy
improvements. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, TEMPO, that can
effectively learn time series representations. We focus on utilizing two
essential inductive biases of the time series task for pre-trained models: (i)
decomposition of the complex interaction between trend, seasonal and residual
components; and (ii) introducing the selection-based prompts to facilitate
distribution adaptation in non-stationary time series. TEMPO expands the
capability for dynamically modeling real-world temporal phenomena from data
within diverse domains. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of
TEMPO over state-of-the-art methods on a number of time series benchmark
datasets. This performance gain is observed not only in standard supervised
learning settings but also in scenarios involving previously unseen datasets as
well as in scenarios with multi-modal inputs. This compelling finding
highlights TEMPO's potential to constitute a foundational model-building
framework.]]></summary>

for these time series are required to be coherent, that is, to satisfy the
constraints given by the hierarchy. The most popular technique to enforce
coherence is called reconciliation, which adjusts the base forecasts computed
for each time series. However, recent works on probabilistic reconciliation
present several limitations. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on
conditioning to reconcile any type of forecast distribution. We then introduce
a new algorithm, called Bottom-Up Importance Sampling, to efficiently sample
from the reconciled distribution. It can be used for any base forecast
distribution: discrete, continuous, or in the form of samples, providing a
major speedup compared to the current methods. Experiments on several temporal
hierarchies show a significant improvement over base probabilistic forecasts.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lion (Evolved Sign Momentum), a new optimizer discovered through program
search, has shown promising results in training large AI models. It performs
comparably or favorably to AdamW but with greater memory efficiency. As we can
expect from the results of a random search program, Lion incorporates elements
from several existing algorithms, including signed momentum, decoupled weight
decay, Polak, and Nesterov momentum, but does not fit into any existing
category of theoretically grounded optimizers. Thus, even though Lion appears
to perform well as a general-purpose optimizer for a wide range of tasks, its
theoretical basis remains uncertain. This lack of theoretical clarity limits
opportunities to further enhance and expand Lion's efficacy.

This work aims to demystify Lion. Based on both continuous-time and
discrete-time analysis, we demonstrate that Lion is a theoretically novel and
principled approach for minimizing a general loss function $f(x)$ while
enforcing a bound constraint $\|x\|_\infty \leq 1/\lambda$. Lion achieves this
through the incorporation of decoupled weight decay, where $\lambda$ represents
the weight decay coefficient. Our analysis is made possible by the development
of a new Lyapunov function for the Lion updates. It applies to a broader family
of Lion-$\kappa$ algorithms, where the $\text{sign}(\cdot)$ operator in Lion is
replaced by the subgradient of a convex function $\kappa$, leading to the
solution of a general composite optimization problem of $\min_x f(x) +
\kappa^*(x)$. Our findings provide valuable insights into the dynamics of Lion
and pave the way for further improvements and extensions of Lion-related
algorithms.]]></summary>

collaborative model training without direct data sharing. However, the vast
disparity in local data distributions among clients, often termed the
non-Independent Identically Distributed (non-IID) challenge, poses a
significant hurdle to FL's generalization efficacy. The scenario becomes even
more complex when not all clients participate in the training process, a common
occurrence due to unstable network connections or limited computational
capacities. This can greatly complicate the assessment of the trained models'
generalization abilities. While a plethora of recent studies has centered on
the generalization gap pertaining to unseen data from participating clients
with diverse distributions, the divergence between the training distributions
of participating clients and the testing distributions of non-participating
ones has been largely overlooked. In response, our paper unveils an
information-theoretic generalization framework for FL. Specifically, it
quantifies generalization errors by evaluating the information entropy of local
distributions and discerning discrepancies across these distributions. Inspired
by our deduced generalization bounds, we introduce a weighted aggregation
approach and a duo of client selection strategies. These innovations aim to
bolster FL's generalization prowess by encompassing a more varied set of client
data distributions. Our extensive empirical evaluations reaffirm the potency of
our proposed methods, aligning seamlessly with our theoretical construct.]]></summary>

independent learners process data privately. Its goal is to create a robust and
accurate model by aggregating and retraining local models over multiple rounds.
However, FL faces challenges regarding data heterogeneity and model aggregation
effectiveness. In order to simulate real-world data, researchers use methods
for data partitioning that transform a dataset designated for centralized
learning into a group of sub-datasets suitable for distributed machine learning
with different data heterogeneity. In this paper, we study the currently
popular data partitioning techniques and visualize their main disadvantages:
the lack of precision in the data diversity, which leads to unreliable
heterogeneity indexes, and the inability to incrementally challenge the FL
algorithms. To resolve this problem, we propose a method that leverages entropy
and symmetry to construct 'the most challenging' and controllable data
distributions with gradual difficulty. We introduce a metric to measure data
heterogeneity among the learning agents and a transformation technique that
divides any dataset into splits with precise data diversity. Through a
comparative study, we demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
FL data partitioning approaches, showcasing its potential to challenge model
aggregation algorithms. Experimental results indicate that our approach
gradually challenges the FL strategies, and the models trained on FedSym

capabilities of LLMs, we selected agriculture exams and benchmark datasets from
three of the largest agriculture producer countries: Brazil, India, and the
USA. Our analysis highlights GPT-4's ability to achieve a passing score on
exams to earn credits for renewing agronomist certifications, answering 93% of
the questions correctly and outperforming earlier general-purpose models, which
achieved 88% accuracy. On one of our experiments, GPT-4 obtained the highest

GPT-4 could potentially pass on major graduate education admission tests or
even earn credits for renewing agronomy certificates. We also explore the

continuous function, i.e., a coordinate-based neural network, to represent
multiple data instances by modulating its weights or intermediate features

modulation is limited due to its inability to localize and capture fine-grained

transformer encoder with a locality-aware INR decoder. The transformer encoder
predicts a set of latent tokens from a data instance to encode local
information into each latent token. The locality-aware INR decoder extracts a
modulation vector by selectively aggregating the latent tokens via
cross-attention for a coordinate input and then predicts the output by
progressively decoding with coarse-to-fine modulation through multiple
frequency bandwidths. The selective token aggregation and the multi-band
feature modulation enable us to learn locality-aware representation in spatial

previous generalizable INRs and validates the usefulness of the locality-aware

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The proliferation of large AI models trained on uncurated, often sensitive
web-scraped data has raised significant privacy concerns. One of the concerns
is that adversaries can extract information about the training data using
privacy attacks. Unfortunately, the task of removing specific information from
the models without sacrificing performance is not straightforward and has
proven to be challenging. We propose a rather easy yet effective defense based
on backdoor attacks to remove private information such as names of individuals
from models, and focus in this work on text encoders. Specifically, through
strategic insertion of backdoors, we align the embeddings of sensitive phrases
with those of neutral terms-"a person" instead of the person's name. Our
empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our backdoor-based defense
on CLIP by assessing its performance using a specialized privacy attack for
zero-shot classifiers. Our approach provides not only a new "dual-use"
perspective on backdoor attacks, but also presents a promising avenue to
enhance the privacy of individuals within models trained on uncurated
web-scraped data.]]></summary>

we also utilize a different line search criteria to guarantee monotone

search models for software development efficiency and effectiveness. It pulls
together positive code snippets while pushing negative samples away given
search queries. Among contrastive learning, InfoNCE is the most widely used
loss function due to its better performance. However, the following problems in
negative samples of InfoNCE may deteriorate its representation learning: 1) The
existence of false negative samples in large code corpora due to duplications.
2). The failure to explicitly differentiate between the potential relevance of
negative samples. As an example, a bubble sorting algorithm example is less
``negative'' than a file saving function for the quick sorting algorithm query.
In this paper, we tackle the above problems by proposing a simple yet effective
Soft-InfoNCE loss that inserts weight terms into InfoNCE. In our proposed loss
function, we apply three methods to estimate the weights of negative pairs and
show that the vanilla InfoNCE loss is a special case of Soft-InfoNCE.
Theoretically, we analyze the effects of Soft-InfoNCE on controlling the
distribution of learnt code representations and on deducing a more precise
mutual information estimation. We furthermore discuss the superiority of
proposed loss functions with other design alternatives. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of Soft-InfoNCE and weights estimation methods
under state-of-the-art code search models on a large-scale public dataset
consisting of six programming languages. Source code is available at

dissemination is crucial for supporting critical operations across domains like
disaster response, autonomous vehicles, and sensor networks. This paper
introduces a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach as a
significant step forward in achieving more decentralized, efficient, and
collaborative solutions. We propose a Partially Observable Stochastic Game
(POSG) formulation for information dissemination empowering each agent to
decide on message forwarding independently, based on their one-hop
neighborhood. This constitutes a significant paradigm shift from traditional
heuristics based on Multi-Point Relay (MPR) selection. Our approach harnesses
Graph Convolutional Reinforcement Learning, employing Graph Attention Networks
(GAT) with dynamic attention to capture essential network features. We propose
two approaches, L-DGN and HL-DGN, which differ in the information that is
exchanged among agents. We evaluate the performance of our decentralized
approaches, by comparing them with a widely-used MPR heuristic, and we show
that our trained policies are able to efficiently cover the network while
bypassing the MPR set selection process. Our approach is a first step toward
supporting the resilience of real-world broadcast communication infrastructures

solve inverse problem of images, and it is easy to implement. However, these
techniques often generate heavy artifacts in image reconstruction. One of the
most popular refinement methods is to fine-tune the regularization parameter to
alleviate such artifacts, but it may not always be sufficient or applicable due
to increased computational costs. In this work, we propose a deep geometric
incremental learning framework based on the second Nesterov proximal gradient
optimization. The proposed end-to-end network not only has the powerful
learning ability for high-/low-frequency image features, but also can
theoretically guarantee that geometric texture details will be reconstructed
from preliminary linear reconstruction. Furthermore, it can avoid the risk of
intermediate reconstruction results falling outside the geometric decomposition
domains and achieve fast convergence. Our reconstruction framework is
decomposed into four modules including general linear reconstruction, cascade
geometric incremental restoration, Nesterov acceleration, and post-processing.
In the image restoration step, a cascade geometric incremental learning module
is designed to compensate for missing texture information from different
geometric spectral decomposition domains. Inspired by the overlap-tile
strategy, we also develop a post-processing module to remove the block effect
in patch-wise-based natural image reconstruction. All parameters in the
proposed model are learnable, an adaptive initialization technique of physical
parameters is also employed to make model flexibility and ensure converging
smoothly. We compare the reconstruction performance of the proposed method with
existing state-of-the-art methods to demonstrate its superiority. Our source

range of tasks (especially in the fields of natural language processing and
computer vision), primarily attributed to their ability to comprehend
instructions and access extensive, high-quality data. This not only showcases
their current effectiveness but also sets a promising trajectory towards the
development of artificial general intelligence. Unfortunately, due to multiple
constraints, the raw data of the model used for large model training are often
inaccessible, so the use of end-to-end models for downstream tasks has become a
new research trend, which we call Learn From Model (LFM) in this article. LFM
focuses on the research, modification, and design of FM based on the model
interface, so as to better understand the model structure and weights (in a
black box environment), and to generalize the model to downstream tasks. The
study of LFM techniques can be broadly categorized into five major areas: model
tuning, model distillation, model reuse, meta learning and model editing. Each
category encompasses a repertoire of methods and strategies that aim to enhance
the capabilities and performance of FM. This paper gives a comprehensive review
of the current methods based on FM from the perspective of LFM, in order to
help readers better understand the current research status and ideas. To
conclude, we summarize the survey by highlighting several critical areas for
future exploration and addressing open issues that require further attention

candidates. However, if evaluation times vary significantly, many worker nodes
(i.e.,\ compute clients) are idle much of the time, waiting for the next
generation to be created. Evolutionary neural architecture search (ENAS), a
class of EAs that optimizes the architecture and hyperparameters of deep neural
networks, is particularly vulnerable to this issue. This paper proposes a
generic asynchronous evaluation strategy (AES) that is then adapted to work
with ENAS. AES increases throughput by maintaining a queue of up to $K$
individuals ready to be sent to the workers for evaluation and proceeding to
the next generation as soon as $M<<K$ individuals have been evaluated. A
suitable value for $M$ is determined experimentally, balancing diversity and
efficiency. To showcase the generality and power of AES, it was first evaluated
in eight-line sorting network design (a single-population optimization task
with limited evaluation-time variability), achieving an over two-fold speedup.
Next, it was evaluated in 11-bit multiplexer design (a single-population
discovery task with extended variability), where a 14-fold speedup was
observed. It was then scaled up to ENAS for image captioning (a
multi-population open-ended-optimization task), resulting in an over two-fold
speedup. In all problems, a multifold performance improvement was observed,
suggesting that AES is a promising method for parallelizing the evolution of
complex systems with long and variable evaluation times, such as those in ENAS.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prompt tuning (PT), where a small amount of trainable soft (continuous)
prompt vectors is affixed to the input of language models (LM), has shown
promising results across various tasks and models for parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT). PT stands out from other PEFT approaches because it
maintains competitive performance with fewer trainable parameters and does not
drastically scale up its parameters as the model size expands. However, PT
introduces additional soft prompt tokens, leading to longer input sequences,
which significantly impacts training and inference time and memory usage due to
the Transformer's quadratic complexity. Particularly concerning for Large
Language Models (LLMs) that face heavy daily querying. To address this issue,
we propose Decomposed Prompt Tuning (DePT), which decomposes the soft prompt
into a shorter soft prompt and a pair of low-rank matrices that are then
optimised with two different learning rates. This allows DePT to achieve better
performance while saving over 20% memory and time costs compared to vanilla PT
and its variants, without changing trainable parameter sizes. Through extensive
experiments on 23 natural language processing (NLP) and vision-language (VL)
tasks, we demonstrate that DePT outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT approaches,
including the full fine-tuning baseline in some scenarios. Additionally, we

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In practice, deep neural networks are often able to easily interpolate their
training data. To understand this phenomenon, many works have aimed to quantify
the memorization capacity of a neural network architecture: the largest number
of points such that the architecture can interpolate any placement of these
points with any assignment of labels. For real-world data, however, one
intuitively expects the presence of a benign structure so that interpolation
already occurs at a smaller network size than suggested by memorization
capacity. In this paper, we investigate interpolation by adopting an
instance-specific viewpoint. We introduce a simple randomized algorithm that,
given a fixed finite dataset with two classes, with high probability constructs
an interpolating three-layer neural network in polynomial time. The required
number of parameters is linked to geometric properties of the two classes and
their mutual arrangement. As a result, we obtain guarantees that are
independent of the number of samples and hence move beyond worst-case
memorization capacity bounds. We illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm
in non-pathological situations with extensive numerical experiments and link
the insights back to the theoretical results.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent empirical observation (Li et al., 2022b) of activation sparsity in
MLP blocks offers an opportunity to drastically reduce computation costs for
free. Although having attributed it to training dynamics, existing theoretical
explanations of activation sparsity are restricted to shallow networks, small
training steps and special training, despite its emergence in deep models
standardly trained for a large number of steps. To fill these gaps, we propose
the notion of gradient sparsity as one source of activation sparsity and a
theoretical explanation based on it that sees sparsity a necessary step to
adversarial robustness w.r.t. hidden features and parameters, which is
approximately the flatness of minima for well-learned models. The theory
applies to standardly trained LayerNorm-ed MLPs, and further to Transformers or
other architectures trained with weight noises. Eliminating other sources of
flatness except for sparsity, we discover the phenomenon that the ratio between
the largest and smallest non-zero singular values of weight matrices is small.
When discussing the emergence of this spectral concentration, we use random
matrix theory (RMT) as a powerful tool to analyze stochastic gradient noises.
Validational experiments are conducted to verify our gradient-sparsity-based
explanation. We propose two plug-and-play modules for both training and
finetuning for sparsity. Experiments on ImageNet-1k and C4 demonstrate their
50% sparsity improvements, indicating further potential cost reduction in both
training and inference.]]></summary>

representations exhibiting better continual and transfer learning. This
mechanism -- the repeated resetting of weights in the last layer, which we
nickname "zapping" -- was originally designed for a meta-continual-learning
procedure, yet we show it is surprisingly applicable in many settings beyond
both meta-learning and continual learning. In our experiments, we wish to
transfer a pre-trained image classifier to a new set of classes, in a few
shots. We show that our zapping procedure results in improved transfer accuracy
and/or more rapid adaptation in both standard fine-tuning and continual
learning settings, while being simple to implement and computationally
efficient. In many cases, we achieve performance on par with state of the art
meta-learning without needing the expensive higher-order gradients, by using a
combination of zapping and sequential learning. An intuitive explanation for
the effectiveness of this zapping procedure is that representations trained
with repeated zapping learn features that are capable of rapidly adapting to
newly initialized classifiers. Such an approach may be considered a
computationally cheaper type of, or alternative to, meta-learning rapidly
adaptable features with higher-order gradients. This adds to recent work on the
usefulness of resetting neural network parameters during training, and invites
further investigation of this mechanism.]]></summary>

of VQ-VAEs with a simple scheme termed finite scalar quantization (FSQ), where
we project the VAE representation down to a few dimensions (typically less than
10). Each dimension is quantized to a small set of fixed values, leading to an
(implicit) codebook given by the product of these sets. By appropriately
choosing the number of dimensions and values each dimension can take, we obtain
the same codebook size as in VQ. On top of such discrete representations, we
can train the same models that have been trained on VQ-VAE representations. For
example, autoregressive and masked transformer models for image generation,
multimodal generation, and dense prediction computer vision tasks. Concretely,
we employ FSQ with MaskGIT for image generation, and with UViM for depth
estimation, colorization, and panoptic segmentation. Despite the much simpler
design of FSQ, we obtain competitive performance in all these tasks. We
emphasize that FSQ does not suffer from codebook collapse and does not need the
complex machinery employed in VQ (commitment losses, codebook reseeding, code
splitting, entropy penalties, etc.) to learn expressive discrete

Despite recent success, most diffusion models are restricted in that they only
allow linear transformation of the data distribution. In contrast, broader
family of transformations can potentially help train generative distributions
more efficiently, simplifying the reverse process and closing the gap between
the true negative log-likelihood and the variational approximation. In this
paper, we present Neural Diffusion Models (NDMs), a generalization of
conventional diffusion models that enables defining and learning time-dependent
non-linear transformations of data. We show how to optimise NDMs using a
variational bound in a simulation-free setting. Moreover, we derive a
time-continuous formulation of NDMs, which allows fast and reliable inference
using off-the-shelf numerical ODE and SDE solvers. Finally, we demonstrate the
utility of NDMs with learnable transformations through experiments on standard

ImageNet and CelebA-HQ. NDMs outperform conventional diffusion models in terms

algorithms so far for solving large-scale incomplete information games.
However, we believe that there are two problems with CFR: First, matrix
multiplication is required in CFR iteration, and the time complexity of one
iteration is too high; Secondly, the game characteristics in the real world are
different. Just using one CFR algorithm will not be perfectly suitable for all
game problems.

For these two problems, this paper proposes a new algorithm called Pure CFR
(PCFR) based on CFR. PCFR can be seen as a combination of CFR and Fictitious
Play (FP), inheriting the concept of counterfactual regret (value) from CFR,
and using the best response strategy instead of the regret matching strategy
for the next iteration. This algorithm has three advantages. First, PCFR can be
combined with any CFR variant. The resulting Pure MCCFR (PMCCFR) can
significantly reduce the time and space complexity of one iteration. Secondly,
our experiments show that the convergence speed of the PMCCFR is 2$\sim$3 times
that of the MCCFR. Finally, there is a type of game that is very suitable for
PCFR, we call this type of game clear-game, which is characterized by a high
proportion of dominated strategies. Experiments show that in clear-game, the
convergence rate of PMCCFR is two orders of magnitude higher than that of
MCCFR.]]></summary>

need for principled methods for defending networks against malicious actors.
Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach for
mitigating these attacks. However, while DRL has shown much potential for
cyber-defence, numerous challenges must be overcome before DRL can be applied
to autonomous cyber-operations (ACO) at scale. Principled methods are required
for environments that confront learners with very high-dimensional state
spaces, large multi-discrete action spaces, and adversarial learning. Recent
works have reported success in solving these problems individually. There have
also been impressive engineering efforts towards solving all three for
real-time strategy games. However, applying DRL to the full ACO problem remains
an open challenge. Here, we survey the relevant DRL literature and
conceptualize an idealised ACO-DRL agent. We provide: i.) A summary of the
domain properties that define the ACO problem; ii.) A comprehensive evaluation
of the extent to which domains used for benchmarking DRL approaches are
comparable to ACO; iii.) An overview of state-of-the-art approaches for scaling
DRL to domains that confront learners with the curse of dimensionality, and;
iv.) A survey and critique of current methods for limiting the exploitability
of agents within adversarial settings from the perspective of ACO. We conclude
with open research questions that we hope will motivate future directions for

samples with hard labels are known, via which the maximum likelihood estimator
attains the minimax rate $\sqrt{{|{\mathcal S}||{\mathcal A}|}/{n}}$. The
second level has the teacher probabilities of sampled labels available in
addition, which turns out to boost the convergence rate lower bound to
${{|{\mathcal S}||{\mathcal A}|}/{n}}$. However, under this second data
acquisition protocol, minimizing a naive adaptation of the cross-entropy loss
results in an asymptotically biased student. We overcome this limitation and
achieve the fundamental limit by using a novel empirical variant of the squared
error logit loss. The third level further equips the student with the soft
labels (complete logits) on ${\mathcal A}$ given every sampled input, thereby
provably enables the student to enjoy a rate ${|{\mathcal S}|}/{n}$ free of
$|{\mathcal A}|$. We find any Kullback-Leibler divergence minimizer to be
optimal in the last case. Numerical simulations distinguish the four learners
and corroborate our theory.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Discovering achievements with a hierarchical structure in procedurally
generated environments presents a significant challenge. This requires an agent
to possess a broad range of abilities, including generalization and long-term
reasoning. Many prior methods have been built upon model-based or hierarchical
approaches, with the belief that an explicit module for long-term planning
would be advantageous for learning hierarchical dependencies. However, these
methods demand an excessive number of environment interactions or large model
sizes, limiting their practicality. In this work, we demonstrate that proximal
policy optimization (PPO), a simple yet versatile model-free algorithm,
outperforms previous methods when optimized with recent implementation
practices. Moreover, we find that the PPO agent can predict the next
achievement to be unlocked to some extent, albeit with limited confidence.
Based on this observation, we introduce a novel contrastive learning method,
called achievement distillation, which strengthens the agent's ability to
predict the next achievement. Our method exhibits a strong capacity for
discovering hierarchical achievements and shows state-of-the-art performance on
the challenging Crafter environment in a sample-efficient manner while
utilizing fewer model parameters.]]></summary>

their surging performance and has further led to the emergence of sophisticated
reasoning capabilities in foundation models. Such scaling generally requires
training large models from scratch with random initialization, failing to

already resource-intensive to obtain. To tackle this inefficiency, we present
$\textbf{L}$ossl$\textbf{E}$ss $\textbf{MO}$del Expansio$\textbf{N}$ (LEMON), a

learning rate scheduler tailored explicitly for the scaled models,
substantially reducing the training time compared to training from scratch.
Notably, LEMON is versatile, ensuring compatibility with various network

garnered significant importance in recent years due to the vast number of
applications for this type of data. Circular data is a classic example, but so
is data in the space of covariance matrices, data on the Grassmannian manifold
obtained as a result of principal component analysis, among many others. In
this work we investigate prediction sets for regression scenarios when the
response variable, denoted by $Y$, resides in a manifold, and the covariable,
denoted by X, lies in Euclidean space. This extends the concepts delineated in
[Lei and Wasserman, 2014] to this novel context. Aligning with traditional
principles in conformal inference, these prediction sets are distribution-free,
indicating that no specific assumptions are imposed on the joint distribution
of $(X, Y)$, and they maintain a non-parametric character. We prove the
asymptotic almost sure convergence of the empirical version of these regions on
the manifold to their population counterparts. The efficiency of this method is
shown through a comprehensive simulation study and an analysis involving
real-world data.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Offline policy learning is aimed at learning decision-making policies using
existing datasets of trajectories without collecting additional data. The
primary motivation for using reinforcement learning (RL) instead of supervised
learning techniques such as behavior cloning is to find a policy that achieves
a higher average return than the trajectories constituting the dataset.
However, we empirically find that when a dataset is dominated by suboptimal
trajectories, state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms do not substantially
improve over the average return of trajectories in the dataset. We argue this
is due to an assumption made by current offline RL algorithms of staying close
to the trajectories in the dataset. If the dataset primarily consists of
sub-optimal trajectories, this assumption forces the policy to mimic the
suboptimal actions. We overcome this issue by proposing a sampling strategy
that enables the policy to only be constrained to ``good data" rather than all
actions in the dataset (i.e., uniform sampling). We present a realization of
the sampling strategy and an algorithm that can be used as a plug-and-play
module in standard offline RL algorithms. Our evaluation demonstrates
significant performance gains in 72 imbalanced datasets, D4RL dataset, and
across three different offline RL algorithms. Code is available at

general-purpose skills that aim to reach diverse goals. In particular, offline
GCRL only requires purely pre-collected datasets to perform training tasks
without additional interactions with the environment. Although offline GCRL has
become increasingly prevalent and many previous works have demonstrated its
empirical success, the theoretical understanding of efficient offline GCRL
algorithms is not well established, especially when the state space is huge and
the offline dataset only covers the policy we aim to learn. In this paper, we
provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of an existing empirically successful
offline GCRL algorithm. We prove that under slight modification, this algorithm
enjoys an $\widetilde{O}(\text{poly}(1/\epsilon))$ sample complexity (where
$\epsilon$ is the desired suboptimality of the learned policy) with general
function approximation thanks to the property of (semi-)strong convexity of the
objective functions. We only require nearly minimal assumptions on the dataset
(single-policy concentrability) and the function class (realizability).
Moreover, this algorithm consists of two uninterleaved optimization steps,
which we refer to as $V$-learning and policy learning, and is computationally
stable since it does not involve minimax optimization. We also empirically
validate our theory by showing that the modified algorithm outperforms the
previous algorithm in various real-world environments. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first algorithm that is both provably efficient with
general function approximation and single-policy concentrability, and
empirically successful without requiring solving minimax optimization problems.]]></summary>

study the internal representations of transformer-based backdoored language
models and determine early-layer MLP modules as most important for the backdoor
mechanism in combination with the initial embedding projection. We use this
knowledge to remove, insert, and modify backdoor mechanisms with engineered
replacements that reduce the MLP module outputs to essentials for the backdoor
mechanism. To this end, we introduce PCP ablation, where we replace transformer
modules with low-rank matrices based on the principal components of their
activations. We demonstrate our results on backdoored toy, backdoored large,
and non-backdoored open-source models. We show that we can improve the backdoor
robustness of large language models by locally constraining individual modules
during fine-tuning on potentially poisonous data sets.

policies from observed actions; however, existing models fall short by forcing
a tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability. This tradeoff limits
data-driven interpretations of human decision-making process. e.g. to audit
medical decisions for biases and suboptimal practices, we require models of
decision processes which provide concise descriptions of complex behaviors.
Fundamentally, existing approaches are burdened by this tradeoff because they
represent the underlying decision process as a universal policy, when in fact
human decisions are dynamic and can change drastically with contextual
information. Thus, we propose Contextualized Policy Recovery (CPR), which
re-frames the problem of modeling complex decision processes as a multi-task
learning problem in which complex decision policies are comprised of
context-specific policies. CPR models each context-specific policy as a linear
observation-to-action mapping, and generates new decision models
$\textit{on-demand}$ as contexts are updated with new observations. CPR is
compatible with fully offline and partially observable decision environments,
and can be tailored to incorporate any recurrent black-box model or
interpretable decision model. We assess CPR through studies on simulated and
real data, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the canonical tasks of
predicting antibiotic prescription in intensive care units ($+22\%$ AUROC vs.
previous SOTA) and predicting MRI prescription for Alzheimer's patients
($+7.7\%$ AUROC vs. previous SOTA). With this improvement in predictive
performance, CPR closes the accuracy gap between interpretable and black-box

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are considered cutting-edge technology with
highly cost-effective and flexible usage scenarios. Although many papers have
reviewed the application of UAVs in agriculture, the review of the application
for tree detection is still insufficient. This paper focuses on tree detection
methods applied to UAV data collected by UAVs. There are two kinds of data, the
point cloud and the images, which are acquired by the Light Detection and
Ranging (LiDAR) sensor and camera, respectively. Among the detection methods
using point-cloud data, this paper mainly classifies these methods according to
LiDAR and Digital Aerial Photography (DAP). For the detection methods using
images directly, this paper reviews these methods by whether or not to use the
Deep Learning (DL) method. Our review concludes and analyses the comparison and
combination between the application of LiDAR-based and DAP-based point cloud
data. The performance, relative merits, and application fields of the methods
are also introduced. Meanwhile, this review counts the number of tree detection
studies using different methods in recent years. From our statics, the
detection task using DL methods on the image has become a mainstream trend as
the number of DL-based detection researches increases to 45% of the total
number of tree detection studies up to 2022. As a result, this review could
help and guide researchers who want to carry out tree detection on specific
forests and for farmers to use UAVs in managing agriculture production.]]></summary>

is the conditional median. This work shows that the only prior distribution on
$X$ that induces linearity in the conditional median is Gaussian.

Along the way, several other results are presented. In particular, it is
demonstrated that if the conditional distribution $P_{X|Y=y}$ is symmetric for
all $y$, then $X$ must follow a Gaussian distribution. Additionally, we
consider other $L^p$ losses and observe the following phenomenon: for $p \in
[1,2]$, Gaussian is the only prior distribution that induces a linear optimal
Bayesian estimator, and for $p \in (2,\infty)$, infinitely many prior
distributions on $X$ can induce linearity. Finally, extensions are provided to
encompass noise models leading to conditional distributions from certain

Maximization under fairness/partition constraint. Given a set of points $P$ in
a metric space partitioned into $m$ groups, and given $k_1,\ldots,k_m$, the
goal of this problem is to pick $k_i$ points from each group $i$ such that the
overall diversity of the $k=\sum_i k_i$ picked points is maximized. We consider
two natural diversity measures: sum-of-pairwise distances and
sum-of-nearest-neighbor distances, and show improved core-set construction
algorithms with respect to these measures. More precisely, we show the first
constant factor core-set w.r.t. sum-of-pairwise distances whose size is
independent of the size of the dataset and the aspect ratio. Second, we show
the first core-set w.r.t. the sum-of-nearest-neighbor distances. Finally, we
run several experiments showing the effectiveness of our core-set approach. In
particular, we apply constrained diversity maximization to summarize a set of
timed messages that takes into account the messages' recency. Specifically, the
summary should include more recent messages compared to older ones. This is a
real task in one of the largest communication platforms, affecting the
experience of hundreds of millions daily active users. By utilizing our
core-set method for this task, we achieve a 100x speed-up while losing the

(MetaBBO-RL) has showcased the power of leveraging RL at the meta-level to
mitigate manual fine-tuning of low-level black-box optimizers. However, this

introduce MetaBox, the first benchmark platform expressly tailored for

extensive library of 19 baseline methods, including both traditional black-box
optimizers and recent MetaBBO-RL methods. Besides, MetaBox introduces three
standardized performance metrics, enabling a more thorough assessment of the
methods. In a bid to illustrate the utility of MetaBox for facilitating
rigorous evaluation and in-depth analysis, we carry out a wide-ranging

algorithms for the generative modeling of temporal densities, we propose a
cheap alternative which requires minimal hyperparameter tuning and scales
favorably to high dimensional problems. In particular, we use a
projection-based optimal transport solver [Meng et al., 2019] to join
successive samples and subsequently use transport splines [Chewi et al., 2020]
to interpolate the evolving density. When the sampling frequency is
sufficiently high, the optimal maps are close to the identity and are thus
computationally efficient to compute. Moreover, the training process is highly
parallelizable as all optimal maps are independent and can thus be learned
simultaneously. Finally, the approach is based solely on numerical linear
algebra rather than minimizing a nonconvex objective function, allowing us to
easily analyze and control the algorithm. We present several numerical
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the
efficiency of our method. In particular, these experiments show that the
proposed approach is highly competitive compared with state-of-the-art
normalizing flows conditioned on time across a wide range of dimensionalities.]]></summary>

odds model (N$^3$POM) for ordinal regression. N$^3$POM is different from
conventional approaches to ordinal regression with non-proportional models in
several ways: (1) N$^3$POM is designed to directly handle continuous responses,
whereas standard methods typically treat de facto ordered continuous variables
as discrete, (2) instead of estimating response-dependent finite coefficients
of linear models from discrete responses as is done in conventional approaches,
we train a non-linear neural network to serve as a coefficient function. Thanks
to the neural network, N$^3$POM offers flexibility while preserving the
interpretability of conventional ordinal regression. We establish a sufficient
condition under which the predicted conditional cumulative probability locally
satisfies the monotonicity constraint over a user-specified region in the
covariate space. Additionally, we provide a monotonicity-preserving stochastic
(MPS) algorithm for effectively training the neural network. We apply N$^3$POM

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Training machine learning models robust to distribution shifts is critical
for real-world applications. Some robust training algorithms (e.g., Group DRO)
specialize to group shifts and require group information on all training
points. Other methods (e.g., CVaR DRO) that do not need group annotations can
be overly conservative, since they naively upweight high loss points which may
form a contrived set that does not correspond to any meaningful group in the
real world (e.g., when the high loss points are randomly mislabeled training
points). In this work, we address limitations in prior approaches by assuming a
more nuanced form of group shift: conditioned on the label, we assume that the
true group function (indicator over group) is simple. For example, we may
expect that group shifts occur along low bitrate features (e.g., image
background, lighting). Thus, we aim to learn a model that maintains high
accuracy on simple group functions realized by these low bitrate features, that
need not spend valuable model capacity achieving high accuracy on contrived
groups of examples. Based on this, we consider the two-player game formulation
of DRO where the adversary's capacity is bitrate-constrained. Our resulting
practical algorithm, Bitrate-Constrained DRO (BR-DRO), does not require group
information on training samples yet matches the performance of Group DRO on
datasets that have training group annotations and that of CVaR DRO on
long-tailed distributions. Our theoretical analysis reveals that in some
settings BR-DRO objective can provably yield statistically efficient and less
conservative solutions than unconstrained CVaR DRO.]]></summary>

models by identifying salient portions of input data. This is particularly
valuable in scenarios where limited training samples are accessible due to
challenges in data collection and labeling. Drawing inspiration from human

accurate and dependable if it is exposed to essential segments of raw data
rather than the entire input dataset, akin to human perception. However, the
task of selecting these informative data segments, referred to as hard
attention finding, presents a formidable challenge. In situations with few
training samples, existing studies struggle to locate such informative regions
due to the large number of training parameters that cannot be effectively
learned from the available limited samples. In this study, we introduce a novel
and practical framework for achieving explainable hard attention finding,
specifically tailored for few-shot learning scenarios, called FewXAT. Our

capacity of manufacturing systems. To solve the scheduling optimization problem
related to the flow control with the aim of improving productivity, existing
methods depend on a heuristic design by domain human experts. Therefore, the
methods require correction, monitoring, and verification by using real
equipment. As system designs increase in complexity, the monitoring time
increases, which decreases the probability of arriving at the optimal design.
As an alternative approach to the heuristic design of flow control systems, the
use of deep reinforcement learning to solve the scheduling optimization problem
has been considered. Although the existing research on reinforcement learning
has yielded excellent performance in some areas, the applicability of the
results to actual FAB such as display and semiconductor manufacturing processes
is not evident so far. To this end, we propose a method to implement a physical
simulation environment and devise a feasible flow control system design using a
transfer robot in display manufacturing through reinforcement learning. We
present a model and parameter setting to build a virtual environment for
different display transfer robots, and training methods of reinforcement
learning on the environment to obtain an optimal scheduling of glass flow
control systems. Its feasibility was verified by using different types of

space of generative models while preserving the underlying structure of the
data. The latent space can be equipped it with a Riemannian metric, pulled back
from the data manifold. With this metric, we can systematically navigate the
space relying on geodesics defined as the shortest curves between two points.
Generative models are often stochastic, causing the data space, the Riemannian
metric, and the geodesics, to be stochastic as well. Stochastic objects are at
best impractical, and at worst impossible, to manipulate. A common solution is
to approximate the stochastic pullback metric by its expectation. But the
geodesics derived from this expected Riemannian metric do not correspond to the
expected length-minimising curves. In this work, we propose another metric
whose geodesics explicitly minimise the expected length of the pullback metric.
We show this metric defines a Finsler metric, and we compare it with the
expected Riemannian metric. In high dimensions, we prove that both metrics
converge to each other at a rate of $O\left(\frac{1}{D}\right)$. This
convergence implies that the established expected Riemannian metric is an
accurate approximation of the theoretically more grounded Finsler metric. This

results have shown that learning in general POMDPs could be intractable, where
the main challenge lies in the lack of latent state information. A key
fundamental question here is how much online state information (OSI) is
sufficient to achieve tractability. In this paper, we establish a lower bound
that reveals a surprising hardness result: unless we have full OSI, we need an
exponentially scaling sample complexity to obtain an $\epsilon$-optimal policy
solution for POMDPs. Nonetheless, inspired by the key insights in our lower
bound design, we find that there exist important tractable classes of POMDPs
even with only partial OSI. In particular, for two novel classes of POMDPs with

user friendly for applications. This works extends the increasing amount of
research connecting Gaussian Processes and Kernels to Neural Networks. The
Kernel and Gaussian Process closed forms are derived for a variety of
architectures, namely the standard Graph Neural Network, the Graph Neural
Network with Skip-Concatenate Connections and the Graph Attention Neural
Network. All architectures are evaluated on a variety of datasets on the task
of transductive Node Regression and Classification. Additionally, a Spectral
Sparsification method known as Effective Resistance is used to improve runtime
and memory requirements. Extending the setting to inductive graph learning
tasks (Graph Regression/ Classification) is straightforward and is briefly

requires either quadratic memory or an exponential number of samples [FOCS'16,
JACM'19]. A line of work that followed extended this result to a large class of
learning problems. Until recently, all these results considered learning in the
streaming model, where each sample is drawn independently, and the learner is
allowed a single pass over the stream of samples. Garg, Raz, and Tal [CCC'19]
considered a stronger model, allowing multiple passes over the stream. In the
$2$-pass model, they showed that learning parities of size $n$ requires either
a memory of size $n^{1.5}$ or at least $2^{\sqrt{n}}$ samples. (Their result
also generalizes to other learning problems.)

In this work, for any constant $q$, we prove tight memory-sample lower bounds
for any parity learning algorithm that makes $q$ passes over the stream of
samples. We show that such a learner requires either $\Omega(n^{2})$ memory
size or at least $2^{\Omega(n)}$ samples. Beyond establishing a tight lower
bound, this is the first non-trivial lower bound for $q$-pass learning for any
$q\ge 3$. Similar to prior work, our results extend to any learning problem
with many nearly-orthogonal concepts.

We complement the lower bound with an upper bound, showing that parity
learning with $q$ passes can be done efficiently with $O(n^2/\log q)$ memory.]]></summary>

involves polynomial approximation of unsupported non-linear activation
functions. However, existing approaches have three main limitations: 1)
Inflexibility: The polynomial approximation and associated homomorphic
evaluation architecture are customized manually for each CNN architecture and
do not generalize to other networks. 2) Suboptimal Approximation: Each
activation function is approximated instead of the function represented by the
CNN. 3) Restricted Design: Either high-degree or low-degree polynomial
approximations are used. The former retains high accuracy but slows down
inference due to bootstrapping operations, while the latter accelerates
ciphertext inference but compromises accuracy. To address these limitations, we
present AutoFHE, which automatically adapts standard CNNs for secure inference
under RNS-CKKS. The key idea is to adopt layerwise mixed-degree polynomial
activation functions, which are optimized jointly with the homomorphic
evaluation architecture in terms of the placement of bootstrapping operations.
The problem is modeled within a multi-objective optimization framework to
maximize accuracy and minimize the number of bootstrapping operations. AutoFHE
can be applied flexibly on any CNN architecture, and it provides diverse
solutions that span the trade-off between accuracy and latency. Experimental
evaluation over RNS-CKKS encrypted CIFAR datasets shows that AutoFHE
accelerates secure inference by $1.32\times$ to $1.8\times$ compared to methods
employing high-degree polynomials. It also improves accuracy by up to 2.56%
compared to methods using low-degree polynomials. Lastly, AutoFHE accelerates
inference and improves accuracy by $103\times$ and 3.46%, respectively,

under uncertainty. One of the major dilemmas in Reinforcement Learning (RL)
where an autonomous agent has to balance two contrasting needs in making its
decisions is: exploiting the current knowledge of the environment to maximize
the cumulative reward as well as exploring actions that allow improving the
knowledge of the environment, hopefully leading to higher reward values
(exploration-exploitation trade-off). Concurrently, another relevant issue
regards the full observability of the states, which may not be assumed in all
applications. Such as when only 2D images are considered as input in a RL
approach used for finding the optimal action within a 3D simulation
environment. In this work, we address these issues by deploying and testing
several techniques to balance exploration and exploitation trade-off on
partially observable systems for predicting steering wheels in autonomous
driving scenario. More precisely, the final aim is to investigate the effects
of using both stochastic and deterministic multi-armed bandit strategies
coupled with a Deep Recurrent Q-Network. Additionally, we adapted and evaluated
the impact of an innovative method to improve the learning phase of the
underlying Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network. We aim to show that adaptive
stochastic methods for exploration better approximate the trade-off between
exploration and exploitation as, in general, Softmax and Max-Boltzmann

Therefore, developing a principled framework for fast deterministic/stochastic
sampling for a broader class of diffusion models is a promising direction. We
propose two complementary frameworks for accelerating sample generation in
pre-trained models: Conjugate Integrators and Splitting Integrators. Conjugate
integrators generalize DDIM, mapping the reverse diffusion dynamics to a more
amenable space for sampling. In contrast, splitting-based integrators, commonly
used in molecular dynamics, reduce the numerical simulation error by cleverly
alternating between numerical updates involving the data and auxiliary

performance for diffusion models in augmented spaces. Applied to Phase Space

enables the robot to respond to the external forces from the human. These

Learning scenarios. These can address different main tasks (i.e., in the
setting of Multi-Task Learning), but also main and secondary tasks such as loss
minimization versus sparsity. The usual approach is a simple weighting of the
criteria, which formally only works in the convex setting. In this paper, we
present a Multi-Objective Optimization algorithm using a modified Weighted
Chebyshev scalarization for training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with respect
to several tasks. By employing this scalarization technique, the algorithm can
identify all optimal solutions of the original problem while reducing its
complexity to a sequence of single-objective problems. The simplified problems
are then solved using an Augmented Lagrangian method, enabling the use of
popular optimization techniques such as Adam and Stochastic Gradient Descent,
while efficaciously handling constraints. Our work aims to address the

particular focus on Deep Multi-Task models, which are typically designed with a
very large number of weights to perform equally well on multiple tasks. Through

data being acquired only once for each task. Catastrophic forgetting is a major
challenge to continual learning. To reduce forgetting, some existing
rehearsal-based methods use episodic memory to replay samples of previous
tasks. However, in the process of knowledge integration when learning a new
task, this strategy also suffers from catastrophic forgetting due to an
imbalance between old and new knowledge. To address this problem, we propose a
novel replay strategy called Manifold Expansion Replay (MaER). We argue that
expanding the implicit manifold of the knowledge representation in the episodic
memory helps to improve the robustness and expressiveness of the model. To this
end, we propose a greedy strategy to keep increasing the diameter of the
implicit manifold represented by the knowledge in the buffer during memory
management. In addition, we introduce Wasserstein distance instead of cross
entropy as distillation loss to preserve previous knowledge. With extensive
experimental validation on MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet, we show
that the proposed method significantly improves the accuracy in continual

LLMs, and external tools, while also underestimating the importance of natural
language feedback from users. These oversights contribute to discrepancies
between research benchmark evaluations and real-world use cases. We introduce
MINT, a benchmark that evaluates LLMs' ability to solve tasks with multi-turn
interactions by (1) using tools and (2) leveraging natural language feedback.
To ensure reproducibility, we provide an evaluation framework where LLMs can
access tools by executing Python code and receive users' natural language
feedback simulated by GPT-4. We repurpose a diverse set of established
evaluation datasets focusing on reasoning, coding, and decision-making and
carefully curate them into a compact subset for efficient evaluation. Our
analysis of 20 open- and closed-source LLMs offers intriguing findings. (a)
LLMs generally benefit from tools and language feedback, with performance gains
(absolute, same below) of 1-8% for each turn of tool use and 2-17% with natural
language feedback. (b) Better single-turn performance does not guarantee better
multi-turn performance. (c) Surprisingly, on the LLMs evaluated, supervised
instruction-finetuning (SIFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback
(RLHF) generally hurt multi-turn capabilities. We expect MINT can help measure
progress and incentivize research in improving LLMs' capabilities in multi-turn
interactions, especially for open-source communities where multi-turn human
evaluation can be less accessible compared to commercial LLMs with a larger
user base.]]></summary>

3D modeling tools. Deep generative models of 3D shapes often feature continuous
latent spaces that can, in principle, be used to explore potential variations
starting from a set of input shapes. In practice, doing so can be problematic:
latent spaces are high dimensional and hard to visualize, contain shapes that
are not relevant to the input shapes, and linear paths through them often lead
to sub-optimal shape transitions. Furthermore, one would ideally be able to
explore variations in the original high-quality meshes used to train the
generative model, not its lower-quality output geometry. In this paper, we
present a method to explore variations among a given set of landmark shapes by
constructing a mapping from an easily-navigable 2D exploration space to a
subspace of a pre-trained generative model. We first describe how to find a
mapping that spans the set of input landmark shapes and exhibits smooth
variations between them. We then show how to turn the variations in this
subspace into deformation fields, to transfer those variations to high-quality
meshes for the landmark shapes. Our results show that our method can produce
visually-pleasing and easily-navigable 2D exploration spaces for several
different shape categories, especially as compared to prior work on learning
deformation spaces for 3D shapes.]]></summary>

decision-making systems is an essential area of research due to its potential
to reduce the risk of applications in real-world systems. However, in
responsibility-sensitive settings such as healthcare, decision accountability
is of paramount importance, yet has not been adequately addressed by the
literature. This paper introduces the Accountable Offline Controller (AOC) that
employs the offline dataset as the Decision Corpus and performs accountable
control based on a tailored selection of examples, referred to as the Corpus
Subset. ABC operates effectively in low-data scenarios, can be extended to the
strictly offline imitation setting, and displays qualities of both conservation
and adaptability. We assess ABC's performance in both simulated and real-world
healthcare scenarios, emphasizing its capability to manage offline control
tasks with high levels of performance while maintaining accountability.

outcomes across various tasks. However, the current design landscape of the
forward diffusion process remains largely untapped and often relies on physical

introduce Phase Space Langevin Diffusion (PSLD), which relies on score-based
modeling within an augmented space enriched by auxiliary variables akin to
physical phase space. Empirical results exhibit the superior sample quality and
improved speed-quality trade-off of PSLD compared to various competing
approaches on established image synthesis benchmarks. Remarkably, PSLD achieves
sample quality akin to state-of-the-art SGMs (FID: 2.10 for unconditional
CIFAR-10 generation). Lastly, we demonstrate the applicability of PSLD in
conditional synthesis using pre-trained score networks, offering an appealing
alternative as an SGM backbone for future advancements. Code and model

identify unique features that reflect the accuracy of the learned reward model.
To quantify this, we construct a scenario where the tuned LLM learns
token-reward mappings to maximize reward. This is the first application of
sparse autoencoders for interpreting learned rewards and broadly inspecting

considerably slow because it necessitates tens to hundreds of iterative

efficient deterministic inference policy from critic models and pretrained
diffusion behavior models, leveraging the latter to directly regularize the
policy gradient with the behavior distribution's score function during
optimization. Our method enjoys powerful generative capabilities of diffusion
modeling while completely circumventing the computationally intensive and

Extensive results on D4RL tasks show that our method boosts action sampling

are known, and that they are the same for all arms. This naturally leads to
suboptimal performance and higher regret due to variance overestimation. On the
other hand, underestimated reward variances may lead to linear regret due to
committing early to a suboptimal arm. This motivated prior works on
variance-adaptive frequentist algorithms, which have strong instance-dependent
regret bounds but cannot incorporate prior knowledge on reward variances. We
lay foundations for the Bayesian setting, which incorporates prior knowledge.
This results in lower regret in practice, due to using the prior in the
algorithm design, and also improved regret guarantees. Specifically, we study
Gaussian bandits with {unknown heterogeneous reward variances}, and develop a
Thompson sampling algorithm with prior-dependent Bayes regret bounds. We
achieve lower regret with lower reward variances and more informative priors on
them, which is precisely why we pay only for what is uncertain. This is the
first result of its kind. Finally, we corroborate our theory with extensive
experiments, which show the superiority of our variance-adaptive Bayesian
algorithm over prior frequentist approaches. We also show that our approach is

training points on the trained model, has garnered increased attention of late,
driven by the need to comply with privacy regulations like the Right to be
Forgotten. Although unlearning is particularly relevant for LLMs in light of
the copyright issues they raise, achieving precise unlearning is
computationally infeasible for very large models. To this end, recent work has
proposed several algorithms which approximate the removal of training data
without retraining the model. These algorithms crucially rely on access to the
model parameters in order to update them, an assumption that may not hold in
practice due to computational constraints or when the LLM is accessed via API.
In this work, we propose a new class of unlearning methods for LLMs we call
''In-Context Unlearning'', providing inputs in context and without having to
update model parameters. To unlearn a particular training instance, we provide
the instance alongside a flipped label and additional correctly labelled
instances which are prepended as inputs to the LLM at inference time. Our
experimental results demonstrate that these contexts effectively remove
specific information from the training set while maintaining performance levels
that are competitive with (or in some cases exceed) state-of-the-art unlearning

their success in various applications. In this paper, we hypothesize that
relying heavily on simple co-occurrence statistics of the pre-training corpora
is one of the main factors that cause factual errors. Our results reveal that
LLMs are vulnerable to the co-occurrence bias, defined as preferring frequently
co-occurred words over the correct answer. Consequently, LLMs struggle to
recall facts whose subject and object rarely co-occur in the pre-training
dataset although they are seen during finetuning. We show that co-occurrence
bias remains despite scaling up model sizes or finetuning. Therefore, we
suggest finetuning on a debiased dataset to mitigate the bias by filtering out
biased samples whose subject-object co-occurrence count is high. Although
debiased finetuning allows LLMs to memorize rare facts in the training set, it
is not effective in recalling rare facts unseen during finetuning. Further
research in mitigation will help build reliable language models by preventing
potential errors. The code is available at

demonstrated strong performance on many tasks over tabular data. Researchers
and practitioners are keen to leverage these models in many new application
contexts; but limited understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of these
models, and the table representations they generate, makes the process of
finding a suitable model for a given task reliant on trial and error. There is
an urgent need to gain a comprehensive understanding of these models to
minimize inefficiency and failures in downstream usage.

To address this need, we propose Observatory, a formal framework to
systematically analyze embedding representations of relational tables.
Motivated both by invariants of the relational data model and by statistical
considerations regarding data distributions, we define eight primitive
properties, and corresponding measures to quantitatively characterize table
embeddings for these properties. Based on these properties, we define an
extensible framework to evaluate language and table embedding models. We
collect and synthesize a suite of datasets and use Observatory to analyze seven
such models. Our analysis provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses
of learned representations over tables. We find, for example, that some models
are sensitive to table structure such as column order, that functional
dependencies are rarely reflected in embeddings, and that specialized table
embedding models have relatively lower sample fidelity. Such insights help
researchers and practitioners better anticipate model behaviors and select
appropriate models for their downstream tasks, while guiding researchers in the
development of new models.]]></summary>

to overfit. Understanding why this happens is theoretically and practically
important. One recent approach looks at the infinitely wide limits of such
networks and their corresponding kernels. However, these theoretical tools
cannot fully explain finite networks as the empirical kernel changes
significantly during gradient-descent-based training in contrast to infinite
networks. In this work, we derive an iterative linearised training method as a
novel empirical tool to further investigate this distinction, allowing us to
control for sparse (i.e. infrequent) feature updates and quantify the frequency
of feature learning needed to achieve comparable performance. We justify
iterative linearisation as an interpolation between a finite analog of the
infinite width regime, which does not learn features, and standard gradient
descent training, which does. Informally, we also show that it is analogous to
a damped version of the Gauss-Newton algorithm -- a second-order method. We
show that in a variety of cases, iterative linearised training surprisingly
performs on par with standard training, noting in particular how much less
frequent feature learning is required to achieve comparable performance. We
also show that feature learning is essential for good performance. Since such
feature learning inevitably causes changes in the NTK kernel, we provide direct
negative evidence for the NTK theory, which states the NTK kernel remains
constant during training.]]></summary>

data points with particular values of interest in a broader range of data where
many target values are zero. Zero-inflated data can be found in diverse
scenarios, such as lumpy and intermittent demands, power consumption for home
appliances being turned on and off, impurities measurement in distillation
processes, and even airport shuttle demand prediction. The presence of zeroes
affects the models' learning and may result in poor performance. Furthermore,
zeroes also distort the metrics used to compute the model's prediction quality.
This paper showcases two real-world use cases (home appliances classification
and airport shuttle demand prediction) where a hierarchical model applied in
the context of zero-inflated data leads to excellent results. In particular,
for home appliances classification, the weighted average of Precision, Recall,
F1, and AUC ROC was increased by 27%, 34%, 49%, and 27%, respectively.
Furthermore, it is estimated that the proposed approach is also four times more
energy efficient than the SOTA approach against which it was compared to.
Two-fold models performed best in all cases when predicting airport shuttle
demand, and the difference against other models has been proven to be
statistically significant.]]></summary>

from scanned documents. Today, the state-of-the-art is achieved by exploiting
deep neural networks. However, the cost of this performance is paid at the
price of system vulnerability. For instance, in backdoor attacks, attackers
compromise the training phase by inserting a backdoor in the victim's model
that will be activated at testing time by specific patterns while leaving the
overall model performance intact. This work proposes a backdoor attack for OCR
resulting in the injection of non-readable characters from malicious input
images. This simple but effective attack exposes the state-of-the-art OCR
weakness, making the extracted text correct to human eyes but simultaneously
unusable for the NLP application that uses OCR as a preprocessing step.
Experimental results show that the attacked models successfully output
non-readable characters for around 90% of the poisoned instances without
harming their performance for the remaining instances.]]></summary>

success of deep neural networks. It is rigorously known that in two-layer
fully-connected neural networks under certain conditions, one step of gradient
descent on the first layer followed by ridge regression on the second layer can
lead to feature learning; characterized by the appearance of a separated
rank-one component -- spike -- in the spectrum of the feature matrix. However,
with a constant gradient descent step size, this spike only carries information
from the linear component of the target function and therefore learning
non-linear components is impossible. We show that with a learning rate that
grows with the sample size, such training in fact introduces multiple rank-one
components, each corresponding to a specific polynomial feature. We further
prove that the limiting large-dimensional and large sample training and test
errors of the updated neural networks are fully characterized by these spikes.
By precisely analyzing the improvement in the loss, we demonstrate that these

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in NLP, but their demands hinder their
widespread deployment. While Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) offers a
solution, its extensive training costs make Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) a
more practical approach for LLMs. In existing studies, activation outliers in
particular channels are identified as the bottleneck to PTQ accuracy. They
propose to transform the magnitudes from activations to weights, which however
offers limited alleviation or suffers from unstable gradients, resulting in a
severe performance drop at low-bitwidth. In this paper, we propose QLLM, an
accurate and efficient low-bitwidth PTQ method designed for LLMs. QLLM
introduces an adaptive channel reassembly technique that reallocates the
magnitude of outliers to other channels, thereby mitigating their impact on the
quantization range. This is achieved by channel disassembly and channel
assembly, which first breaks down the outlier channels into several
sub-channels to ensure a more balanced distribution of activation magnitudes.
Then similar channels are merged to maintain the original channel number for
efficiency. Additionally, an adaptive strategy is designed to autonomously
determine the optimal number of sub-channels for channel disassembly. To
further compensate for the performance loss caused by quantization, we propose
an efficient tuning method that only learns a small number of low-rank weights
while freezing the pre-trained quantized model. After training, these low-rank
parameters can be fused into the frozen weights without affecting inference.
Extensive experiments on LLaMA-1 and LLaMA-2 show that QLLM can obtain accurate
quantized models efficiently. For example, QLLM quantizes the 4-bit LLaMA-2-70B
within 10 hours on a single A100-80G GPU, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art method by 7.89% on the average accuracy across five zero-shot

networks due to catastrophic forgetting (CF) of previously learned tasks.
Several techniques such as weight regularization, experience rehearsal, and
parameter isolation have been proposed to alleviate CF. Despite their relative
success, these research directions have predominantly remained orthogonal and
suffer from several shortcomings, while missing out on the advantages of
competing strategies. On the contrary, the brain continually learns,
accommodates, and transfers knowledge across tasks by simultaneously leveraging
several neurophysiological processes, including neurogenesis, active
forgetting, neuromodulation, metaplasticity, experience rehearsal, and
context-dependent gating, rarely resulting in CF. Inspired by how the brain
exploits multiple mechanisms concurrently, we propose TriRE, a novel CL
paradigm that encompasses retaining the most prominent neurons for each task,
revising and solidifying the extracted knowledge of current and past tasks, and
actively promoting less active neurons for subsequent tasks through rewinding
and relearning. Across CL settings, TriRE significantly reduces task

offers a small size of labeled examples, unlabeled graphs have been collected
from various sources and at a large scale. A conventional approach is training
a model with the unlabeled graphs on self-supervised tasks and then fine-tuning
the model on the prediction tasks. However, the self-supervised task knowledge
could not be aligned or sometimes conflicted with what the predictions needed.
In this paper, we propose to extract the knowledge underlying the large set of
unlabeled graphs as a specific set of useful data points to augment each
property prediction model. We use a diffusion model to fully utilize the
unlabeled graphs and design two new objectives to guide the model's denoising
process with each task's labeled data to generate task-specific graph examples
and their labels. Experiments demonstrate that our data-centric approach
performs significantly better than fifteen existing various methods on fifteen
tasks. The performance improvement brought by unlabeled data is visible as the
generated labeled examples unlike the self-supervised learning.]]></summary>

characteristic heavy-tail distributions. Examples include copies of books sold,
auction prices of art pieces, demand for commodities in warehouses, etc. By
learning heavy-tailed distributions, "big and rare" instances (e.g., the
best-sellers) will have accurate predictions. Most existing approaches are not
dedicated to learning heavy-tailed distribution; thus, they heavily
under-predict such instances. To tackle this problem, we introduce Learning to
Place (L2P), which exploits the pairwise relationships between instances for
learning. In its training phase, L2P learns a pairwise preference classifier:
is instance A > instance B? In its placing phase, L2P obtains a prediction by
placing the new instance among the known instances. Based on its placement, the
new instance is then assigned a value for its outcome variable. Experiments on
real data show that L2P outperforms competing approaches in terms of accuracy
and ability to reproduce heavy-tailed outcome distribution. In addition, L2P
provides an interpretable model by placing each predicted instance in relation
to its comparable neighbors. Interpretable models are highly desirable when
lives and treasure are at stake.]]></summary>

been widely equipped with multi-stage architectures, which are divided into
several cascaded modules, including matching, pre-ranking, ranking and

real-world applications, especially when these environments involve complex

design of tree-search RL methods into distinct sub-modules. By incorporating
more appropriate exploration and optimization strategies, we can significantly
enhance these sub-modules and construct powerful LightZero agents to tackle

within the private training dataset of machine learning models, leading to
serious privacy violations and other sophisticated threats. Many practical
black-box MIAs require query access to the data distribution (the same
distribution where the private data is drawn) to train shadow models. By doing
so, the adversary obtains models trained "with" or "without" samples drawn from
the distribution, and analyzes the characteristics of the samples under
consideration. The adversary is often required to train more than hundreds of
shadow models to extract the signals needed for MIAs; this becomes the
computational overhead of MIAs. In this paper, we propose that by strategically
choosing the samples, MI adversaries can maximize their attack success while
minimizing the number of shadow models. First, our motivational experiments
suggest memorization as the key property explaining disparate sample
vulnerability to MIAs. We formalize this through a theoretical bound that
connects MI advantage with memorization. Second, we show sample complexity
bounds that connect the number of shadow models needed for MIAs with
memorization. Lastly, we confirm our theoretical arguments with comprehensive
experiments; by utilizing samples with high memorization scores, the adversary
can (a) significantly improve its efficacy regardless of the MIA used, and (b)
reduce the number of shadow models by nearly two orders of magnitude compared
to state-of-the-art approaches.]]></summary>

years ago, how to precisely model the propagation of an RF signal in an
electrically large and complex environment remains a long-standing problem. The
difficulty is in the complex interactions between the RF signal and the
obstacles (e.g., reflection, diffraction, etc.). Inspired by the great success
of using a neural network to describe the optical field in computer vision, we
propose a neural radio-frequency radiance field, NeRF$^\textbf{2}$, which
represents a continuous volumetric scene function that makes sense of an RF
signal's propagation. Particularly, after training with a few signal
measurements, NeRF$^\textbf{2}$ can tell how/what signal is received at any
position when it knows the position of a transmitter. As a physical-layer
neural network, NeRF$^\textbf{2}$ can take advantage of the learned statistic
model plus the physical model of ray tracing to generate a synthetic dataset
that meets the training demands of application-layer artificial neural networks
(ANNs). Thus, we can boost the performance of ANNs by the proposed
turbo-learning, which mixes the true and synthetic datasets to intensify the
training. Our experiment results show that turbo-learning can enhance
performance with an approximate 50% increase. We also demonstrate the power of
NeRF$^\textbf{2}$ in the field of indoor localization and 5G MIMO.]]></summary>

challenges for unsupervised domain adaptation like small inter-class
discriminability, that existing approaches relying on domain invariance alone
cannot handle sufficiently well. In this work we propose MemSAC, which exploits
sample level similarity across source and target domains to achieve
discriminative transfer, along with architectures that scale to a large number
of categories. For this purpose, we first introduce a memory augmented approach
to efficiently extract pairwise similarity relations between labeled source and
unlabeled target domain instances, suited to handle an arbitrary number of
classes. Next, we propose and theoretically justify a novel variant of the
contrastive loss to promote local consistency among within-class cross domain
samples while enforcing separation between classes, thus preserving
discriminative transfer from source to target. We validate the advantages of

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper studies the fundamental problem of learning multi-layer generator
models. The multi-layer generator model builds multiple layers of latent
variables as a prior model on top of the generator, which benefits learning
complex data distribution and hierarchical representations. However, such a
prior model usually focuses on modeling inter-layer relations between latent
variables by assuming non-informative (conditional) Gaussian distributions,
which can be limited in model expressivity. To tackle this issue and learn more
expressive prior models, we propose an energy-based model (EBM) on the joint
latent space over all layers of latent variables with the multi-layer generator
as its backbone. Such joint latent space EBM prior model captures the
intra-layer contextual relations at each layer through layer-wise energy terms,
and latent variables across different layers are jointly corrected. We develop
a joint training scheme via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which involves
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling for both prior and posterior
distributions of the latent variables from different layers. To ensure
efficient inference and learning, we further propose a variational training
scheme where an inference model is used to amortize the costly posterior MCMC
sampling. Our experiments demonstrate that the learned model can be expressive
in generating high-quality images and capturing hierarchical features for
better outlier detection.]]></summary>

uses binary vectors with high dimensions and the majority rule. This approach
has the potential to be energy-efficient and hence deemed suitable for
resource-limited platforms due to its simplicity and massive parallelism.
However, in order to achieve high accuracy, HDC sometimes uses hypervectors
with tens of thousands of dimensions. This potentially negates its efficiency
advantage. In this paper, we examine the necessity of such high dimensions and
conduct a detailed theoretical analysis of the relationship between hypervector
dimensions and accuracy. Our results demonstrate that as the dimension of the
hypervectors increases, the worst-case/average-case HDC prediction accuracy
with the majority rule decreases. Building on this insight, we develop HDC
models that use binary hypervectors with dimensions orders of magnitude lower
than those of state-of-the-art HDC models while maintaining equivalent or even
improved accuracy and efficiency. For instance, on the MNIST dataset, we
achieve 91.12% HDC accuracy in image classification with a dimension of only
64. Our methods perform operations that are only 0.35% of other HDC models with
dimensions of 10,000. Furthermore, we evaluate our methods on ISOLET, UCI-HAR,

single-agent metrics (marginal metrics), such as minimum Average Displacement
Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), which fail to capture joint
performance of multiple interacting agents. Only focusing on marginal metrics
can lead to unnatural predictions, such as colliding trajectories or diverging
trajectories for people who are clearly walking together as a group.
Consequently, methods optimized for marginal metrics lead to overly-optimistic
estimations of performance, which is detrimental to progress in trajectory
forecasting research. In response to the limitations of marginal metrics, we
present the first comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
trajectory forecasting methods with respect to multi-agent metrics (joint
metrics): JADE, JFDE, and collision rate. We demonstrate the importance of
joint metrics as opposed to marginal metrics with quantitative evidence and
qualitative examples drawn from the ETH / UCY and Stanford Drone datasets. We
introduce a new loss function incorporating joint metrics that, when applied to
a SOTA trajectory forecasting method, achieves a 7\% improvement in JADE / JFDE
on the ETH / UCY datasets with respect to the previous SOTA. Our results also
indicate that optimizing for joint metrics naturally leads to an improvement in
interaction modeling, as evidenced by a 16\% decrease in mean collision rate on
the ETH / UCY datasets with respect to the previous SOTA. Code is available at

increasing demand for video content as a major IP traffic across the Internet
highlights the importance of caching and prefetching optimization algorithms.
Prefetching aims to make data available in the cache before the requester
places its request to reduce access time and improve the Quality of Experience
on the user side. Prefetching is well investigated in operating systems,
compiler instructions, in-memory cache, local storage systems, high-speed
networks, and cloud systems. Traditional prefetching techniques are well
adapted to a particular access pattern, but fail to adapt to sudden variations
or randomization in workloads. This paper explores the use of reinforcement
learning to tackle the changes in user access patterns and automatically adapt
over time. To this end, we propose, DeePref, a Deep Reinforcement Learning
agent for online video content prefetching in Content Delivery Networks.
DeePref is a prefetcher implemented on edge networks and is agnostic to
hardware design, operating systems, and applications. Our results show that
DeePref DRQN, using a real-world dataset, achieves a 17% increase in
prefetching accuracy and a 28% increase in prefetching coverage on average
compared to baseline approaches that use video content popularity as a building
block to statically or dynamically make prefetching decisions. We also study
the possibility of transfer learning of statistical models from one edge
network into another, where unseen user requests from unknown distribution are
observed. In terms of transfer learning, the increase in prefetching accuracy
and prefetching coverage are [$30%$, $10%$], respectively. Our source code will

transportation systems. The complex and dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies
make the traffic flow prediction quite challenging. Although existing
spatial-temporal graph neural networks hold prominent, they often encounter
challenges such as (1) ignoring the fixed graph that limits the predictive
performance of the model, (2) insufficiently capturing complex spatial-temporal
dependencies simultaneously, and (3) lacking attention to spatial-temporal

Spatial-Temporal Recurrent Network for traffic flow prediction, namely MSSTRN,
which consists of two different recurrent neural networks: the single-step gate
recurrent unit and the multi-step gate recurrent unit to fully capture the
complex spatial-temporal information in the traffic data under different time
windows. Moreover, we propose a spatial-temporal synchronous attention
mechanism that integrates adaptive position graph convolutions into the
self-attention mechanism to achieve synchronous capture of spatial-temporal

$x\in S^{n-1}$ within an $\epsilon$ error (in $\ell_2$) from minimal number of
linear measurements that are quantized to just their signs, i.e., from
measurements of the form $y = \mathrm{Sign}(\langle a, x\rangle).$ In this
paper, we study a noisy version where a fraction of the measurements can be
flipped, potentially by an adversary. In particular, we analyze the Binary
Iterative Hard Thresholding (BIHT) algorithm, a proximal gradient descent on a
properly defined loss function used for 1-bit compressed sensing, in this noisy
setting. It is known from recent results that, with
$\tilde{O}(\frac{k}{\epsilon})$ noiseless measurements, BIHT provides an
estimate within $\epsilon$ error. This result is optimal and universal, meaning
one set of measurements work for all sparse vectors. In this paper, we show
that BIHT also provides better results than all known methods for the noisy
setting. We show that when up to $\tau$-fraction of the sign measurements are
incorrect (adversarial error), with the same number of measurements as before,
BIHT agnostically provides an estimate of $x$ within an
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon+\tau)$ error, maintaining the universality of measurements.
This establishes stability of iterative hard thresholding in the presence of
measurement error. To obtain the result, we use the restricted approximate

$f$ that is noisy and costly to evaluate, by exploiting an acquisition function
that must be maximized at each optimization step. Even if provably
asymptotically optimal BO algorithms are efficient at optimizing
low-dimensional functions, scaling them to high-dimensional spaces remains an
open problem, often tackled by assuming an additive structure for $f$. By doing
so, BO algorithms typically introduce additional restrictive assumptions on the
additive structure that reduce their applicability domain. This paper contains
two main contributions: (i) we relax the restrictive assumptions on the
additive structure of $f$, at the expense of weakening the maximization
guarantees of the acquisition function, and (ii) we address the
over-exploration problem for decentralized BO algorithms. To these ends, we
propose DumBO, an asymptotically optimal decentralized BO algorithm that
achieves very competitive performance against state-of-the-art BO algorithms,
especially when the additive structure of $f$ comprises high-dimensional
factors.]]></summary>

forecasting models have gained popularity as they can utilize hidden feature
patterns in time series to improve forecasting performance. Nevertheless, the
majority of current deep forecasting models are opaque, hence making it
challenging to interpret the results. While counterfactual explanations have
been extensively employed as a post-hoc approach for explaining classification
models, their application to forecasting models still remains underexplored. In
this paper, we formulate the novel problem of counterfactual generation for
time series forecasting, and propose an algorithm, called ForecastCF, that
solves the problem by applying gradient-based perturbations to the original
time series. ForecastCF guides the perturbations by applying constraints to the
forecasted values to obtain desired prediction outcomes. We experimentally
evaluate ForecastCF using four state-of-the-art deep model architectures and
compare to two baselines. Our results show that ForecastCF outperforms the
baseline in terms of counterfactual validity and data manifold closeness.
Overall, our findings suggest that ForecastCF can generate meaningful and
relevant counterfactual explanations for various forecasting tasks.]]></summary>

that aims to preserve the semantics of objects such as documents and items
inside their IDs. Previous studies typically adopt a two-stage pipeline to
learn semantic IDs by first procuring embeddings using off-the-shelf text
encoders and then deriving IDs based on the embeddings. However, each step
introduces potential information loss and there is usually an inherent mismatch
between the distribution of embeddings within the latent space produced by text
encoders and the anticipated distribution required for semantic indexing.
Nevertheless, it is non-trivial to design a method that can learn the
document's semantic representations and its hierarchical structure
simultaneously, given that semantic IDs are discrete and sequentially
structured, and the semantic supervision is deficient. In this paper, we
introduce LMINDEXER, a self-supervised framework to learn semantic IDs with a
generative language model. We tackle the challenge of sequential discrete ID by
introducing a semantic indexer capable of generating neural sequential discrete
representations with progressive training and contrastive learning. In response
to the semantic supervision deficiency, we propose to train the model with a
self-supervised document reconstruction objective. The learned semantic indexer
can facilitate various downstream tasks, such as recommendation and retrieval.
We conduct experiments on three tasks including recommendation, product search,
and document retrieval on five datasets from various domains, where LMINDEXER
outperforms competitive baselines significantly and consistently.]]></summary>

denoising model. Furthermore, pointwise estimates can be easily estimated as
well, allowing us to ask questions about the relationships between specific

these new relations to measure the compositional understanding of diffusion

this challenge, we propose ZEST -- a ZSL (zero-shot learning) framework based

of i) a self-attention based network feature extractor, termed SANE, for
extracting latent space representations of IoT traffic, ii) a generative model
that trains a decoder using latent features to generate pseudo data, and iii) a
supervised model that is trained on the generated pseudo data for classifying
devices. We carry out extensive experiments on real IoT traffic data; our

evaluate facial clefts is the scarcity of large datasets of high-quality,
ethics board-approved patient images. In response, we have built a deep
learning-based cleft lip generator designed to produce an almost unlimited
number of artificial images exhibiting high-fidelity facsimiles of cleft lip
with wide variation. We undertook a transfer learning protocol testing
different versions of StyleGAN-ADA (a generative adversarial network image
generator incorporating adaptive data augmentation (ADA)) as the base model.
Training images depicting a variety of cleft deformities were pre-processed to
adjust for rotation, scaling, color adjustment and background blurring. The ADA
modification of the primary algorithm permitted construction of our new
generative model while requiring input of a relatively small number of training
images. Adversarial training was carried out using 514 unique frontal
photographs of cleft-affected faces to adapt a pre-trained model based on
70,000 normal faces. The Frechet Inception Distance (FID) was used to measure
the similarity of the newly generated facial images to the cleft training
dataset, while Perceptual Path Length (PPL) and the novel Divergence Index of
Severity Histograms (DISH) measures were also used to assess the performance of
the image generator that we dub CleftGAN. We found that StyleGAN3 with
translation invariance (StyleGAN3-t) performed optimally as a base model.
Generated images achieved a low FID reflecting a close similarity to our
training input dataset of genuine cleft images. Low PPL and DISH measures
reflected a smooth and semantically valid interpolation of images through the
transfer learning process and a similar distribution of severity in the
training and generated images, respectively.]]></summary>

research; many energy management systems and design processes rely on accurate
battery models for efficiency optimization. The standard methodology for
battery modelling is traditional design of experiments (DoE), where the battery
dynamics are excited with many different current profiles and the measured
outputs are used to estimate the system dynamics. However, although it is
possible to obtain useful models with the traditional approach, the process is
time consuming and expensive because of the need to sweep many different
current-profile configurations. In the present work, a novel DoE approach is
developed based on deep reinforcement learning, which alters the configuration
of the experiments on the fly based on the statistics of past experiments.
Instead of sticking to a library of predefined current profiles, the proposed
approach modifies the current profiles dynamically by updating the output space
covered by past measurements, hence only the current profiles that are
informative for future experiments are applied. Simulations and real
experiments are used to show that the proposed approach gives models that are
as accurate as those obtained with traditional DoE but by using 85\% less
resources.]]></summary>

model uses a three-level hierarchical contrastive loss based ResNet152

used a subset of the ImageNet (ILSVRC-12) dataset that contains only the animal

problems, such as checking if two nodes in a graph are connected or simulating
finite-state machines, that are provably unsolvable by standard transformers
that answer immediately after reading their input. However, in practice,
transformers' reasoning can be improved by allowing them to use a "chain of
thought" or "scratchpad", i.e., generate and condition on a sequence of
intermediate tokens before answering. Motivated by this, we ask: Does such
intermediate generation fundamentally extend the computational power of a
decoder-only transformer? We show that the answer is yes, but the amount of
increase depends crucially on the amount of intermediate generation. For
instance, we find that transformer decoders with a logarithmic number of
decoding steps (w.r.t. the input length) push the limits of standard
transformers only slightly, while a linear number of decoding steps adds a
clear new ability (under standard complexity conjectures): recognizing all
regular languages. Our results also imply that linear steps keep transformer
decoders within context-sensitive languages, and polynomial steps make them
recognize exactly the class of polynomial-time solvable problems -- the first
exact characterization of a type of transformers in terms of standard
complexity classes. Together, our results provide a nuanced framework for
understanding how the length of a transformer's chain of thought or scratchpad
impacts its reasoning power.]]></summary>

approximate the response of complex dynamical systems driven by time-varying
exogenous excitations over extended time periods. Our approach, namely manifold
nonlinear autoregressive modelling with exogenous input (mNARX), involves
constructing a problem-specific exogenous input manifold that is optimal for
constructing autoregressive surrogates. The manifold, which forms the core of
mNARX, is constructed incrementally by incorporating the physics of the system,
as well as prior expert- and domain- knowledge. Because mNARX decomposes the
full problem into a series of smaller sub-problems, each with a lower
complexity than the original, it scales well with the complexity of the
problem, both in terms of training and evaluation costs of the final surrogate.
Furthermore, mNARX synergizes well with traditional dimensionality reduction
techniques, making it highly suitable for modelling dynamical systems with
high-dimensional exogenous inputs, a class of problems that is typically
challenging to solve. Since domain knowledge is particularly abundant in
physical systems, such as those found in civil and mechanical engineering,
mNARX is well suited for these applications. We demonstrate that mNARX
outperforms traditional autoregressive surrogates in predicting the response of
a classical coupled spring-mass system excited by a one-dimensional random
excitation. Additionally, we show that mNARX is well suited for emulating very
high-dimensional time- and state-dependent systems, even when affected by
active controllers, by surrogating the dynamics of a realistic
aero-servo-elastic onshore wind turbine simulator. In general, our results
demonstrate that mNARX offers promising prospects for modelling complex
dynamical systems, in terms of accuracy and efficiency.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep learning vulnerability detection has shown promising results in recent
years. However, an important challenge that still blocks it from being very
useful in practice is that the model is not robust under perturbation and it
cannot generalize well over the out-of-distribution (OOD) data, e.g., applying
a trained model to unseen projects in real world. We hypothesize that this is
because the model learned non-robust features, e.g., variable names, that have
spurious correlations with labels. When the perturbed and OOD datasets no
longer have the same spurious features, the model prediction fails. To address
the challenge, in this paper, we introduced causality into deep learning
vulnerability detection. Our approach CausalVul consists of two phases. First,
we designed novel perturbations to discover spurious features that the model
may use to make predictions. Second, we applied the causal learning algorithms,
specifically, do-calculus, on top of existing deep learning models to
systematically remove the use of spurious features and thus promote causal
based prediction. Our results show that CausalVul consistently improved the
model accuracy, robustness and OOD performance for all the state-of-the-art
models and datasets we experimented. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work that introduces do calculus based causal learning to software
engineering models and shows it's indeed useful for improving the model
accuracy, robustness and generalization. Our replication package is located at

errors in models trained on a fixed data budget. Moreover, a model can be
trained on a lower compute budget without compromising performance if a dataset
can be stripped of its redundancies. Coreset selection (or data pruning) seeks
to select a subset of the training data so as to maximize the performance of
models trained on this subset, also referred to as coreset. There are two
dominant approaches: (1) geometry-based data selection for maximizing data
diversity in the coreset, and (2) functions that assign difficulty scores to
samples based on training dynamics. Optimizing for data diversity leads to a
coreset that is biased towards easier samples, whereas, selection by difficulty
ranking omits easy samples that are necessary for the training of deep learning
models. This demonstrates that data diversity and importance scores are two
complementary factors that need to be jointly considered during coreset
selection. We represent a dataset as an undirected graph and propose a novel
pruning algorithm, D2 Pruning, that uses forward and reverse message passing
over this dataset graph for coreset selection. D2 Pruning updates the
difficulty scores of each example by incorporating the difficulty of its
neighboring examples in the dataset graph. Then, these updated difficulty
scores direct a graph-based sampling method to select a coreset that
encapsulates both diverse and difficult regions of the dataset space. We
evaluate supervised and self-supervised versions of our method on various
vision and language datasets. Results show that D2 Pruning improves coreset
selection over previous state-of-the-art methods for up to 70% pruning rates.
Additionally, we find that using D2 Pruning for filtering large multimodal
datasets leads to increased diversity in the dataset and improved
generalization of pretrained models.]]></summary>

robust training method AdvMacerwhich combines adversarial training and
robustness certification maximization for randomized smoothing. We show that
AdvMacer can improve the robustness performance of randomized smoothing
classifiers compared to SOTA baselines, while being 3x faster to train than
MACER baseline. The second approach introduces a post-processing method EsbRS
which greatly improves the robustness certificate based on building model

node information such as texts, images, or labels has popularized methods that
require the costly operation of processing the entire graph. Yet, little effort
has been made to the development of fast local methods (i.e. without accessing
the entire graph) that extract useful information from such data. To that end,
we propose a study of local graph clustering using noisy node labels as a proxy
for additional node information. In this setting, nodes receive initial binary
labels based on cluster affiliation: 1 if they belong to the target cluster and
0 otherwise. Subsequently, a fraction of these labels is flipped. We
investigate the benefits of incorporating noisy labels for local graph
clustering. By constructing a weighted graph with such labels, we study the
performance of graph diffusion-based local clustering method on both the
original and the weighted graphs. From a theoretical perspective, we consider
recovering an unknown target cluster with a single seed node in a random graph
with independent noisy node labels. We provide sufficient conditions on the
label noise under which, with high probability, using diffusion in the weighted
graph yields a more accurate recovery of the target cluster. This approach
proves more effective than using the given labels alone or using diffusion in
the label-free original graph. Empirically, we show that reliable node labels
can be obtained with just a few samples from an attributed graph. Moreover,
utilizing these labels via diffusion in the weighted graph leads to
significantly better local clustering performance across several real-world
datasets, improving F1 scores by up to 13%.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We propose to use a simulation driven inverse inference approach to model the
dynamics of tree branches under manipulation. Learning branch dynamics and
gaining the ability to manipulate deformable vegetation can help with
occlusion-prone tasks, such as fruit picking in dense foliage, as well as
moving overhanging vines and branches for navigation in dense vegetation. The
underlying deformable tree geometry is encapsulated as coarse spring
abstractions executed on parallel, non-differentiable simulators. The implicit
statistical model defined by the simulator, reference trajectories obtained by
actively probing the ground truth, and the Bayesian formalism, together guide
the spring parameter posterior density estimation. Our non-parametric inference
algorithm, based on Stein Variational Gradient Descent, incorporates
biologically motivated assumptions into the inference process as neural network
driven learnt joint priors; moreover, it leverages the finite difference scheme
for gradient approximations. Real and simulated experiments confirm that our
model can predict deformation trajectories, quantify the estimation
uncertainty, and it can perform better when base-lined against other inference
algorithms, particularly from the Monte Carlo family. The model displays strong
robustness properties in the presence of heteroscedastic sensor noise;
furthermore, it can generalise to unseen grasp locations.]]></summary>

be noticed and recognized, so that the window for clinical intervention could
be ignored. An effective prognostic model is expected to assist doctors in
making right diagnosis and designing personalized treatment plan, so to
promptly prevent unfavorable outcomes. However, in the early stage of a
disease, limited data collection and clinical experiences, plus the concern out
of privacy and ethics, may result in restricted data availability for
reference, to the extent that even data labels are difficult to mark correctly.
In addition, Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data of different diseases or of
different sources of the same disease can prove to be having serious
cross-dataset feature misalignment problems, greatly mutilating the efficiency
of deep learning models. This article introduces a transfer learning method to
build a transition model from source dataset to target dataset. By way of
constraining the distribution shift of features generated in disparate domains,
domain-invariant features that are exclusively relative to downstream tasks are
captured, so to cultivate a unified domain-invariant encoder across various
task domains to achieve better feature representation. Experimental results of
several target tasks demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms competing
baseline methods and has higher rate of training convergence, especially in
dealing with limited data amount. A multitude of experiences have proven the
efficacy of our method to provide more accurate predictions concerning newly
emergent pandemics and other diseases.]]></summary>

advancement over the existing Decision Transformer (DT) and its variants.
Although DT purports to generate an optimal trajectory, empirical evidence
suggests it struggles with trajectory stitching, a process involving the
generation of an optimal or near-optimal trajectory from the best parts of a
set of sub-optimal trajectories. The proposed EDT differentiates itself by
facilitating trajectory stitching during action inference at test time,
achieved by adjusting the history length maintained in DT. Further, the EDT
optimizes the trajectory by retaining a longer history when the previous
trajectory is optimal and a shorter one when it is sub-optimal, enabling it to
"stitch" with a more optimal trajectory. Extensive experimentation demonstrates
EDT's ability to bridge the performance gap between DT-based and Q
Learning-based approaches. In particular, the EDT outperforms Q Learning-based
methods in a multi-task regime on the D4RL locomotion benchmark and Atari
games. Videos are available at: https://kristery.github.io/edt/]]></summary>

focused on situations with a known hypothesis class or model; however in
practice, some amount of model selection is usually involved, often appearing
under the umbrella term of hyperparameter-tuning: for example, one may think of
the problem of tuning for the right neural network architecture towards a
target task, while leveraging data from a related source task.

Now, in addition to the usual tradeoffs on approximation vs estimation errors
involved in model selection, this problem brings in a new complexity term,
namely, the transfer distance between source and target distributions, which is
known to vary with the choice of hypothesis class.

We present a first study of this problem, focusing on classification; in
particular, the analysis reveals some remarkable phenomena: adaptive rates,
i.e., those achievable with no distributional information, can be arbitrarily
slower than oracle rates, i.e., when given knowledge on distances.]]></summary>

intricacies. Data-driven multiscale modeling has emerged as a promising
approach to tackle challenges associated with complex systems. On the other
hand, self-similarity is prevalent in complex systems, hinting that large-scale
complex systems can be modeled at a reduced cost. In this paper, we introduce a
multiscale neural network framework that incorporates self-similarity as prior
knowledge, facilitating the modeling of self-similar dynamical systems. For
deterministic dynamics, our framework can discern whether the dynamics are
self-similar. For uncertain dynamics, it can compare and determine which
parameter set is closer to self-similarity. The framework allows us to extract
scale-invariant kernels from the dynamics for modeling at any scale. Moreover,
our method can identify the power law exponents in self-similar systems.
Preliminary tests on the Ising model yielded critical exponents consistent with
theoretical expectations, providing valuable insights for addressing critical
phase transitions in non-equilibrium systems.]]></summary>

models having diverse text representation modalities including 2
segmentation-based models (\texttt{BERT}, \texttt{mBERT}), 1 image-based model

propose a scoring Language Quotient (LQ) metric capable of providing a weighted
representation of both zero-shot and few-shot evaluation combined. Utilizing
this metric, we perform experiments comprising 19 source languages and 133
target languages on three tasks (POS tagging, Dependency parsing, and NER). Our
analysis reveals that image-based models excel in cross-lingual transfer when
languages are closely related and share visually similar scripts. However, for
tasks biased toward word meaning (POS, NER), segmentation-based models prove to
be superior. Furthermore, in dependency parsing tasks where word relationships
play a crucial role, models with their character-level focus, outperform
others. Finally, we propose a recommendation scheme based on our findings to

aggregate level labels are available for groups of instances, called bags,
during training, and the aim is to get the best performance at the
instance-level on the test data. This setting arises in domains like
advertising and medicine due to privacy considerations. We propose a novel
algorithmic framework for this problem that iteratively performs two main
steps. For the first step (Pseudo Labeling) in every iteration, we define a
Gibbs distribution over binary instance labels that incorporates a) covariate
information through the constraint that instances with similar covariates
should have similar labels and b) the bag level aggregated label. We then use
Belief Propagation (BP) to marginalize the Gibbs distribution to obtain pseudo
labels. In the second step (Embedding Refinement), we use the pseudo labels to
provide supervision for a learner that yields a better embedding. Further, we
iterate on the two steps again by using the second step's embeddings as new
covariates for the next iteration. In the final iteration, a classifier is
trained using the pseudo labels. Our algorithm displays strong gains against
several SOTA baselines (up to 15%) for the LLP Binary Classification problem on
various dataset types - tabular and Image. We achieve these improvements with
minimal computational overhead above standard supervised learning due to Belief
Propagation, for large bag sizes, even for a million samples.]]></summary>

(PIML) inversion of geophysical data. The unifying equation is given by the
joint objective function $\epsilon$:

\begin{eqnarray} \epsilon^{||-PIML}&=&\lambda_1 \overbrace{||{\bf
W}^{ML}({\bf H}_{{\bf w}} {\bf d}^{obs}-{\bf m})||^2}^{NN} + \lambda_2
\overbrace{{||{\bf W}^{FWI}({\bf L} {\bf m}-{\bf d}^{obs})||^2}}^{FWI} ~+

\end{eqnarray}where the optimal model ${\bf m}^*$ and weights $\bf w^*$
minimize $\epsilon$. Here, The matrix weights are given by the boldface symbol
$\bf W$, and full waveform inversion (FWI) is typically computed using a
finite-difference solution of the wave equation, where $\bf L$ represents the
forward modeling operation of the wave equation as a function of the model $\bf
m$. Also, a fully-connected neural network (NN) is used to compute the model
${\bf H_w}{\bf d}^{obs} \approx \bf m$ from the observed input data ${\bf
d}^{obs}$. The selection of weights $\lambda_i$ and the NN operations determine
one of four different PIML algorithms.

PIML offers potential advantages over standard FWI through its enhanced
ability to avoid local minima and the option to locally train the inversion
operator, minimizing the requirement for extensive training data for global
applicability. However, the effectiveness of PIML relies on the similarity
between the test and trained data. Nevertheless, a possible strategy to
overcome this limitation involves initial pretraining of a PIML architecture
with data from a broader region, followed by fine-tuning for specific data-a
method reminiscent of the way large language models are pretrained and adapted

interacting with external devices using brain signals. Despite advancements,
electroencephalogram (EEG)-based Motor Imagery (MI) tasks face challenges like
amplitude and phase variability, and complex spatial correlations, with a need
for smaller model size and faster inference. This study introduces the LGL-BCI
framework, employing a Geometric Deep Learning Framework for EEG processing in
non-Euclidean metric spaces, particularly the Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD)
Manifold space. LGL-BCI offers robust EEG data representation and captures
spatial correlations. We propose an EEG channel selection solution via a
feature decomposition algorithm to reduce SPD matrix dimensionality, with a
lossless transformation boosting inference speed. Extensive experiments show
LGL-BCI's superior accuracy and efficiency compared to current solutions,
highlighting geometric deep learning's potential in MI-BCI applications. The
efficiency, assessed on two public EEG datasets and two real-world EEG devices,
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art solution in accuracy ($82.54\%$
versus $62.22\%$) with fewer parameters (64.9M compared to 183.7M).]]></summary>

phrases given a source document, while keyphrase extraction (KE) aims to
identify them from the text. Because the search space is much smaller in KE, it
is often combined with KG to predict keyphrases that may or may not exist in
the corresponding document. However, current unified approaches adopt sequence
labeling and maximization-based generation that primarily operate at a token
level, falling short in observing and scoring keyphrases as a whole. In this
work, we propose SimCKP, a simple contrastive learning framework that consists
of two stages: 1) An extractor-generator that extracts keyphrases by learning
context-aware phrase-level representations in a contrastive manner while also
generating keyphrases that do not appear in the document; 2) A reranker that
adapts scores for each generated phrase by likewise aligning their
representations with the corresponding document. Experimental results on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Existing literature on adversarial Machine Learning (ML) focuses either on
showing attacks that break every ML model, or defenses that withstand most
attacks. Unfortunately, little consideration is given to the actual feasibility
of the attack or the defense. Moreover, adversarial samples are often crafted
in the "feature-space", making the corresponding evaluations of questionable
value. Simply put, the current situation does not allow to estimate the actual
threat posed by adversarial attacks, leading to a lack of secure ML systems.

We aim to clarify such confusion in this paper. By considering the
application of ML for Phishing Website Detection (PWD), we formalize the
"evasion-space" in which an adversarial perturbation can be introduced to fool
a ML-PWD -- demonstrating that even perturbations in the "feature-space" are
useful. Then, we propose a realistic threat model describing evasion attacks
against ML-PWD that are cheap to stage, and hence intrinsically more attractive
for real phishers. After that, we perform the first statistically validated
assessment of state-of-the-art ML-PWD against 12 evasion attacks. Our
evaluation shows (i) the true efficacy of evasion attempts that are more likely
to occur; and (ii) the impact of perturbations crafted in different
evasion-spaces. Our realistic evasion attempts induce a statistically
significant degradation (3-10% at p<0.05), and their cheap cost makes them a
subtle threat. Notably, however, some ML-PWD are immune to our most realistic
attacks (p=0.22).

Finally, as an additional contribution of this journal publication, we are
the first to consider the intriguing case wherein an attacker introduces
perturbations in multiple evasion-spaces at the same time. These new results
show that simultaneously applying perturbations in the problem- and
feature-space can cause a drop in the detection rate from 0.95 to 0.]]></summary>

Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs). We are interested in algorithms
that are model-free, have low regret, and identify an optimal policy with a
high probability. Existing model-free algorithms for online CMDPs with
sublinear regret and constraint violation do not provide any convergence
guarantee to an optimal policy and provide only average performance guarantees
when a policy is uniformly sampled at random from all previously used policies.
In this paper, we develop a new algorithm, named
Pruning-Refinement-Identification (PRI), based on a fundamental structural
property of CMDPs we discover, called limited stochasticity. The property says
for a CMDP with $N$ constraints, there exists an optimal policy with at most
$N$ stochastic decisions.

The proposed algorithm first identifies at which step and in which state a
stochastic decision has to be taken and then fine-tunes the distributions of
these stochastic decisions. PRI achieves trio objectives: (i) PRI is a
model-free algorithm; and (ii) it outputs a near-optimal policy with a high
probability at the end of learning; and (iii) in the tabular setting, PRI
guarantees $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{K})$ regret and constraint violation,
which significantly improves the best existing regret bound
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(K^{\frac{4}{5}})$ under a model-free algorithm, where $K$
is the total number of episodes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the success of large-scale pretraining in NLP, there is an increasing
trend of applying it to the domain of life sciences. In particular, pretraining
methods based on DNA sequences have garnered growing attention due to their
potential to capture generic information about genes. However, existing
pretraining methods for DNA sequences largely rely on direct adoptions of BERT
pretraining from NLP, lacking a comprehensive understanding and a specifically
tailored approach. To address this research gap, we first conducted a series of
exploratory experiments and gained several insightful observations: 1) In the
fine-tuning phase of downstream tasks, when using K-mer overlapping
tokenization instead of K-mer non-overlapping tokenization, both overlapping
and non-overlapping pretraining weights show consistent performance
improvement.2) During the pre-training process, using K-mer overlapping
tokenization quickly produces clear K-mer embeddings and reduces the loss to a
very low level, while using K-mer non-overlapping tokenization results in less
distinct embeddings and continuously decreases the loss. 3) Using overlapping
tokenization causes the self-attention in the intermediate layers of
pre-trained models to tend to overly focus on certain tokens, reflecting that
these layers are not adequately optimized. In summary, overlapping tokenization
can benefit the fine-tuning of downstream tasks but leads to inadequate
pretraining with fast convergence. To unleash the pretraining potential, we
introduce a novel approach called RandomMask, which gradually increases the
task difficulty of BERT-like pretraining by continuously expanding its mask
boundary, forcing the model to learn more knowledge. RandomMask is simple but
effective, achieving top-tier performance across 26 datasets of 28 datasets
spanning 7 downstream tasks.]]></summary>

for autonomous driving. Existing benchmarks rely on datasets, which are biased
towards more common scenarios, such as cruising, and distance-based metrics
that are computed by averaging over all scenarios. Following such a regiment
provides a little insight into the properties of the models both in terms of
how well they can handle different scenarios and how admissible and diverse
their outputs are. There exist a number of complementary metrics designed to
measure the admissibility and diversity of trajectories, however, they suffer
from biases, such as length of trajectories.

In this paper, we propose a new benChmarking paRadIgm for evaluaTing
trajEctoRy predIction Approaches (CRITERIA). Particularly, we propose 1) a
method for extracting driving scenarios at varying levels of specificity
according to the structure of the roads, models' performance, and data
properties for fine-grained ranking of prediction models; 2) A set of new
bias-free metrics for measuring diversity, by incorporating the characteristics
of a given scenario, and admissibility, by considering the structure of roads
and kinematic compliancy, motivated by real-world driving constraints. 3) Using
the proposed benchmark, we conduct extensive experimentation on a
representative set of the prediction models using the large scale Argoverse
dataset. We show that the proposed benchmark can produce a more accurate
ranking of the models and serve as a means of characterizing their behavior. We
further present ablation studies to highlight contributions of different

expensive and limited interactions is challenging and poses a need for
effective exploration. Motivated by complex navigation tasks that require
real-world training (when cheap simulators are not available), we consider an

exploration strategy. It may leverage a series of training environments to
improve its policy before it is evaluated in a test environment drawn from the
same environment distribution. Most existing approaches focus on fixed
exploration strategies, while the few that view exploration as a

efficiently searches over a class of dynamic subgoal-based exploration
strategies. The algorithm adjusts a variety of levers -- the locations of the
subgoals, the length of each episode, and the number of replications per trial
-- in order to overcome the challenges of sparse rewards, expensive

items $m$ for sale to $n$ strategic bidders, whose valuations are drawn
independently from high-dimensional, unknown prior distributions. It is
well-known that optimal and even approximately-optimal mechanisms for this
setting are notoriously difficult to characterize or compute, and, even when
they can be found, are often rife with various counter-intuitive properties. In
this paper, following a model introduced recently by Cai and
Daskalakis~\cite{cai2022recommender}, we consider the case that bidders' prior
distributions can be well-approximated by a topic model. We design an active
learning component, responsible for interacting with the bidders and outputting
low-dimensional approximations of their types, and a mechanism design
component, responsible for robustifying mechanisms for the low-dimensional
model to work for the approximate types of the former component. On the active
learning front, we cast our problem in the framework of Randomized Linear
Algebra (RLA) for regression problems, allowing us to import several
breakthrough results from that line of research, and adapt them to our setting.
On the mechanism design front, we remove many restrictive assumptions of prior
work on the type of access needed to the underlying distributions and the
associated mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to
formulate connections between mechanism design, and RLA for active learning of
regression problems, opening the door for further applications of randomized
linear algebra primitives to mechanism design.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Current techniques for Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection predominantly rely
on quantifying predictive uncertainty and incorporating model regularization
during the training phase, using either real or synthetic OoD samples. However,
methods that utilize real OoD samples lack exploration and are prone to overfit
the OoD samples at hand. Whereas synthetic samples are often generated based on
features extracted from training data, rendering them less effective when the
training and OoD data are highly overlapped in the feature space. In this work,
we propose a Wasserstein-score-based generative adversarial training scheme to
enhance OoD detection accuracy, which, for the first time, performs data
augmentation and exploration simultaneously under the supervision of limited
OoD samples. Specifically, the generator explores OoD spaces and generates
synthetic OoD samples using feedback from the discriminator, while the
discriminator exploits both the observed and synthesized samples for OoD
detection using a predefined Wasserstein score. We provide theoretical
guarantees that the optimal solutions of our generative scheme are
statistically achievable through adversarial training in empirical settings. We
then demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art
techniques on various computer vision datasets and exhibits superior
generalizability to unseen OoD data.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given an image and an associated textual question, the purpose of
Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA) is to provide a correct
answer to the question with the aid of external knowledge bases. Prior KB-VQA
models are usually formulated as a retriever-classifier framework, where a
pre-trained retriever extracts textual or visual information from knowledge
graphs and then makes a prediction among the candidates. Despite promising
progress, there are two drawbacks with existing models. Firstly, modeling
question-answering as multi-class classification limits the answer space to a
preset corpus and lacks the ability of flexible reasoning. Secondly, the
classifier merely consider "what is the answer" without "how to get the
answer", which cannot ground the answer to explicit reasoning paths. In this
paper, we confront the challenge of \emph{explainable open-set} KB-VQA, where
the system is required to answer questions with entities at wild and retain an
explainable reasoning path. To resolve the aforementioned issues, we propose a
new retriever-ranker paradigm of KB-VQA, Graph pATH rankER (GATHER for
brevity). Specifically, it contains graph constructing, pruning, and path-level
ranking, which not only retrieves accurate answers but also provides inference
paths that explain the reasoning process. To comprehensively evaluate our
model, we reformulate the benchmark dataset OK-VQA with manually corrected
entity-level annotations and release it as ConceptVQA. Extensive experiments on
real-world questions demonstrate that our framework is not only able to perform
open-set question answering across the whole knowledge base but provide
explicit reasoning path.]]></summary>

uncertainty estimation when the label distribution is imbalanced. In this
paper, we propose a probabilistic deep learning model, dubbed variational
imbalanced regression (VIR), which not only performs well in imbalanced
regression but naturally produces reasonable uncertainty estimation as a
byproduct. Different from typical variational autoencoders assuming I.I.D.
representations (a data point's representation is not directly affected by
other data points), our VIR borrows data with similar regression labels to
compute the latent representation's variational distribution; furthermore,
different from deterministic regression models producing point estimates, VIR
predicts the entire normal-inverse-gamma distributions and modulates the
associated conjugate distributions to impose probabilistic reweighting on the
imbalanced data, thereby providing better uncertainty estimation. Experiments
in several real-world datasets show that our VIR can outperform
state-of-the-art imbalanced regression models in terms of both accuracy and
uncertainty estimation. Code will soon be available at

as a serious threat to national security. Climate intervention methods, such as
stratospheric aerosol injection, have been proposed as mitigation strategies,
but the downstream effects of such actions on a complex climate system are not
well understood. The development of algorithmic techniques for quantifying
relationships between source and impact variables related to a climate event
(i.e., a climate pathway) would help inform policy decisions. Data-driven deep
learning models have become powerful tools for modeling highly nonlinear
relationships and may provide a route to characterize climate variable
relationships. In this paper, we explore the use of an echo state network (ESN)
for characterizing climate pathways. ESNs are a computationally efficient
neural network variation designed for temporal data, and recent work proposes
ESNs as a useful tool for forecasting spatio-temporal climate data. Like other
neural networks, ESNs are non-interpretable black-box models, which poses a
hurdle for understanding variable relationships. We address this issue by
developing feature importance methods for ESNs in the context of
spatio-temporal data to quantify variable relationships captured by the model.
We conduct a simulation study to assess and compare the feature importance
techniques, and we demonstrate the approach on reanalysis climate data. In the
climate application, we select a time period that includes the 1991 volcanic
eruption of Mount Pinatubo. This event was a significant stratospheric aerosol
injection, which we use as a proxy for an artificial stratospheric aerosol
injection. Using the proposed approach, we are able to characterize
relationships between pathway variables associated with this event.]]></summary>

topological analysis pipelines in a distributed-memory model. While several
recent papers introduced topology-based approaches for distributed-memory
environments, these were reporting experiments obtained with tailored,
mono-algorithm implementations. In contrast, we describe in this paper a
general-purpose, generic framework for topological analysis pipelines, i.e. a
sequence of topological algorithms interacting together, possibly on distinct
numbers of processes. Specifically, we instantiated our framework with the MPI
model, within the Topology ToolKit (TTK). While developing this framework, we
faced several algorithmic and software engineering challenges, which we
document in this paper. We provide a taxonomy for the distributed-memory
topological algorithms supported by TTK, depending on their communication needs
and provide examples of hybrid MPI+thread parallelizations. Detailed
performance analyses show that parallel efficiencies range from $20\%$ to
$80\%$ (depending on the algorithms), and that the MPI-specific preconditioning
introduced by our framework induces a negligible computation time overhead. We
illustrate the new distributed-memory capabilities of TTK with an example of
advanced analysis pipeline, combining multiple algorithms, run on the largest
publicly available dataset we have found (120 billion vertices) on a standard
cluster with 64 nodes (for a total of 1,536 cores). Finally, we provide a
roadmap for the completion of TTK's MPI extension, along with generic
recommendations for each algorithm communication category.]]></summary>

of the source and target data are substantially different. Despite its
practical importance in various learning problems, most of the existing methods
only focus on some specific learning tasks and are not well validated
theoretically and numerically. To tackle this problem, we propose a unified
analysis of general nonparametric methods in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space
(RKHS) under covariate shift. Our theoretical results are established for a
general loss belonging to a rich loss function family, which includes many
commonly used methods as special cases, such as mean regression, quantile
regression, likelihood-based classification, and margin-based classification.
Two types of covariate shift problems are the focus of this paper and the sharp
convergence rates are established for a general loss function to provide a
unified theoretical analysis, which concurs with the optimal results in
literature where the squared loss is used. Extensive numerical studies on
synthetic and real examples confirm our theoretical findings and further
illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.]]></summary>

metabolomics, which can lead to biased and incomplete analyses. The integration
of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data with metabolomics data has emerged as a
promising approach to enhance the accuracy of data imputation in metabolomics
studies. Method: In this study, we propose a novel method that leverages the
information from WGS data and reference metabolites to impute unknown
metabolites. Our approach utilizes a multi-view variational autoencoder to
jointly model the burden score, polygenetic risk score (PGS), and linkage
disequilibrium (LD) pruned single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for feature
extraction and missing metabolomics data imputation. By learning the latent
representations of both omics data, our method can effectively impute missing
metabolomics values based on genomic information. Results: We evaluate the
performance of our method on empirical metabolomics datasets with missing
values and demonstrate its superiority compared to conventional imputation
techniques. Using 35 template metabolites derived burden scores, PGS and
LD-pruned SNPs, the proposed methods achieved r2-scores > 0.01 for 71.55% of
metabolites. Conclusion: The integration of WGS data in metabolomics imputation
not only improves data completeness but also enhances downstream analyses,
paving the way for more comprehensive and accurate investigations of metabolic
pathways and disease associations. Our findings offer valuable insights into
the potential benefits of utilizing WGS data for metabolomics data imputation
and underscore the importance of leveraging multi-modal data integration in
precision medicine research.]]></summary>

Class-balanced train, validation, and test sets contained 3,392, 1,114, and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Image-level weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) reduces the
usually vast data annotation cost by surrogate segmentation masks during
training. The typical approach involves training an image classification
network using global average pooling (GAP) on convolutional feature maps. This
enables the estimation of object locations based on class activation maps
(CAMs), which identify the importance of image regions. The CAMs are then used
to generate pseudo-labels, in the form of segmentation masks, to supervise a
segmentation model in the absence of pixel-level ground truth. Our work is
based on two techniques for improving CAMs; importance sampling, which is a
substitute for GAP, and the feature similarity loss, which utilizes a heuristic
that object contours almost always align with color edges in images. However,
both are based on the multinomial posterior with softmax, and implicitly assume
that classes are mutually exclusive, which turns out suboptimal in our
experiments. Thus, we reformulate both techniques based on binomial posteriors
of multiple independent binary problems. This has two benefits; their
performance is improved and they become more general, resulting in an add-on
method that can boost virtually any WSSS method. This is demonstrated on a wide
variety of baselines on the PASCAL VOC dataset, improving the region similarity
and contour quality of all implemented state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on
the MS COCO dataset show that our proposed add-on is well-suited for
large-scale settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/arvijj/hfpl.]]></summary>

learning problems. Much work has been done on extending decision tree learning
algorithms with differential privacy, a system that guarantees the privacy of
samples within the training data. However, current state-of-the-art algorithms
for this purpose sacrifice much utility for a small privacy benefit. These
solutions create random decision nodes that reduce decision tree accuracy or
spend an excessive share of the privacy budget on labeling leaves. Moreover,
many works do not support continuous features or leak information about them.
We propose a new method called PrivaTree based on private histograms that
chooses good splits while consuming a small privacy budget. The resulting trees
provide a significantly better privacy-utility trade-off and accept mixed
numerical and categorical data without leaking information about numerical
features. Finally, while it is notoriously hard to give robustness guarantees
against data poisoning attacks, we demonstrate bounds for the expected accuracy
and success rates of backdoor attacks against differentially-private learners.
By leveraging the better privacy-utility trade-off of PrivaTree we are able to
train decision trees with significantly better robustness against backdoor
attacks compared to regular decision trees and with meaningful theoretical
guarantees.]]></summary>

under uncertainty. One of the major dilemmas in Reinforcement Learning (RL)
where an autonomous agent has to balance two contrasting needs in making its
decisions is: exploiting the current knowledge of the environment to maximize
the cumulative reward as well as exploring actions that allow improving the
knowledge of the environment, hopefully leading to higher reward values
(exploration-exploitation trade-off). Concurrently, another relevant issue
regards the full observability of the states, which may not be assumed in all
applications. Such as when only 2D images are considered as input in a RL
approach used for finding the optimal action within a 3D simulation
environment. In this work, we address these issues by deploying and testing
several techniques to balance exploration and exploitation trade-off on
partially observable systems for predicting steering wheels in autonomous
driving scenario. More precisely, the final aim is to investigate the effects
of using both stochastic and deterministic multi-armed bandit strategies
coupled with a Deep Recurrent Q-Network. Additionally, we adapted and evaluated
the impact of an innovative method to improve the learning phase of the
underlying Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network. We aim to show that adaptive
stochastic methods for exploration better approximate the trade-off between
exploration and exploitation as, in general, Softmax and Max-Boltzmann
strategies are able to outperform epsilon-greedy techniques.]]></summary>

deep neural networks, current UDA models are opaque and cannot provide
promising explanations, limiting their applications in the scenarios that
require safe and controllable model decisions. At present, a surge of work
focuses on designing deep interpretable methods with adequate data annotations
and only a few methods consider the distributional shift problem. Most existing
interpretable UDA methods are post-hoc ones, which cannot facilitate the model
learning process for performance enhancement. In this paper, we propose an
inherently interpretable method, named Transferable Conceptual Prototype
Learning (TCPL), which could simultaneously interpret and improve the processes
of knowledge transfer and decision-making in UDA. To achieve this goal, we
design a hierarchically prototypical module that transfers categorical basic
concepts from the source domain to the target domain and learns domain-shared
prototypes for explaining the underlying reasoning process. With the learned
transferable prototypes, a self-predictive consistent pseudo-label strategy
that fuses confidence, predictions, and prototype information, is designed for
selecting suitable target samples for pseudo annotations and gradually
narrowing down the domain gap. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed
method can not only provide effective and intuitive explanations but also

sub-problem that contains the solution space. We evaluate the performance of
Graph-SCP on synthetic weighted and unweighted SCP instances with diverse

a canonical benchmark for SCP. We show that Graph-SCP reduces the problem size
by 30-70% and achieves run time speedups up to~25x when compared to commercial
solvers (Gurobi). Given a desired optimality threshold, Graph-SCP will improve
upon it or even achieve 100% optimality. This is in contrast to fast greedy
solutions that significantly compromise solution quality to achieve guaranteed
polynomial run time. Graph-SCP can generalize to larger problem sizes and can
be used with other conventional or ML-augmented CO solvers to lead to potential

molten states. Our graph latent variables when biased in well-tempered
metadynamics consistently show transitions between states and achieve accurate
free energy calculations in agreement with experiments, both of which are
indicators of dependable sampling. This underscores the strength and promise of
our graph neural net variables for improved sampling. The protocol shown here
should be applicable for other systems and with other sampling methods.]]></summary>

processes (MDPs) under the linear $q^\pi$-realizability assumption, where it is
assumed that the action-values of all policies can be expressed as linear
functions of state-action features. This class is known to be more general than
linear MDPs, where the transition kernel and the reward function are assumed to
be linear functions of the feature vectors. As our first contribution, we show
that the difference between the two classes is the presence of states in
linearly $q^\pi$-realizable MDPs where for any policy, all the actions have
approximately equal values, and skipping over these states by following an
arbitrarily fixed policy in those states transforms the problem to a linear
MDP. Based on this observation, we derive a novel (computationally inefficient)
learning algorithm for linearly $q^\pi$-realizable MDPs that simultaneously
learns what states should be skipped over and runs another learning algorithm
on the linear MDP hidden in the problem. The method returns an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy after $\text{polylog}(H, d)/\epsilon^2$ interactions
with the MDP, where $H$ is the time horizon and $d$ is the dimension of the
feature vectors, giving the first polynomial-sample-complexity online RL
algorithm for this setting. The results are proved for the misspecified case,
where the sample complexity is shown to degrade gracefully with the
misspecification error.]]></summary>

series forecasting as next-token prediction in text. Developing this approach,
we find that large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 can
surprisingly zero-shot extrapolate time series at a level comparable to or
exceeding the performance of purpose-built time series models trained on the
downstream tasks. To facilitate this performance, we propose procedures for
effectively tokenizing time series data and converting discrete distributions
over tokens into highly flexible densities over continuous values. We argue the
success of LLMs for time series stems from their ability to naturally represent
multimodal distributions, in conjunction with biases for simplicity, and
repetition, which align with the salient features in many time series, such as
repeated seasonal trends. We also show how LLMs can naturally handle missing
data without imputation through non-numerical text, accommodate textual side
information, and answer questions to help explain predictions. While we find
that increasing model size generally improves performance on time series, we
show GPT-4 can perform worse than GPT-3 because of how it tokenizes numbers,
and poor uncertainty calibration, which is likely the result of alignment
interventions such as RLHF.]]></summary>

(ASVs), mainly when used in confined spaces, to carry out surveys that require
the ASV to keep its position or in collaboration with other vehicles where the
relative position has an impact over the mission. However, this maneuver can
become challenging for classic feedback controllers due to the need for an
accurate model of the ASV dynamics and the environmental disturbances. This
work proposes a Model Predictive Controller using Neural Network Simulation
Error Minimization (NNSEM-MPC) to accurately predict the dynamics of the ASV
under wind disturbances. The performance of the proposed scheme under wind
disturbances is tested and compared against other controllers in simulation,
using the Robotics Operating System (ROS) and the multipurpose simulation
environment Gazebo. A set of six tests were conducted by combining two wind
speeds (3 m/s and 6 m/s) and three wind directions (0$^\circ$, 90$^\circ$, and
180$^\circ$). The simulation results clearly show the advantage of the
NNSEM-MPC over the following methods: backstepping controller, sliding mode
controller, simplified dynamics MPC (SD-MPC), neural ordinary differential
equation MPC (NODE-MPC), and knowledge-based NODE MPC (KNODE-MPC). The proposed
NNSEM-MPC approach performs better than the rest in 4 out of the 6 test
conditions, and it is the second best in the 2 remaining test cases, reducing
the mean position and heading error by at least 31\% and 46\% respectively
across all the test cases. In terms of execution speed, the proposed NNSEM-MPC
is at least 36\% faster than the rest of the MPC controllers. The field
experiments on two different ASV platforms showed that ASVs can effectively
keep the station utilizing the proposed method, with a position error as low as
$1.68$ m and a heading error as low as $6.14^{\circ}$ within time windows of at
least $150$s.]]></summary>

policies for both task-oriented navigation (i.e., reaching a goal that the
robot has located), and task-agnostic exploration (i.e., searching for a goal
in a novel setting). Typically, these roles are handled by separate models, for
example by using subgoal proposals, planning, or separate navigation
strategies. In this paper, we describe how we can train a single unified
diffusion policy to handle both goal-directed navigation and goal-agnostic
exploration, with the latter providing the ability to search novel
environments, and the former providing the ability to reach a user-specified
goal once it has been located. We show that this unified policy results in
better overall performance when navigating to visually indicated goals in novel
environments, as compared to approaches that use subgoal proposals from
generative models, or prior methods based on latent variable models. We
instantiate our method by using a large-scale Transformer-based policy trained
on data from multiple ground robots, with a diffusion model decoder to flexibly
handle both goal-conditioned and goal-agnostic navigation. Our experiments,
conducted on a real-world mobile robot platform, show effective navigation in
unseen environments in comparison with five alternative methods, and
demonstrate significant improvements in performance and lower collision rates,
despite utilizing smaller models than state-of-the-art approaches. For more

recommended by theory. We close much of this theory/practice gap, and as a
consequence are able to derive new problem-adaptive learning rate schedules.
Our key technical contribution is a refined analysis of learning rate schedules
for a wide class of optimization algorithms (including SGD). In contrast to
most prior works that study the convergence of the average iterate, we study
the last iterate, which is what most people use in practice. When considering
only worst-case analysis, our theory predicts that the best choice is the
linear decay schedule: a popular choice in practice that sets the stepsize
proportionally to $1 - t/T$, where $t$ is the current iteration and $T$ is the
total number of steps. To go beyond this worst-case analysis, we use the
observed gradient norms to derive schedules refined for any particular task.
These refined schedules exhibit learning rate warm-up and rapid learning rate
annealing near the end of training. Ours is the first systematic approach to
automatically yield both of these properties. We perform the most comprehensive
evaluation of learning rate schedules to date, evaluating across 10 diverse
deep learning problems, a series of LLMs, and a suite of logistic regression
problems. We validate that overall, the linear-decay schedule matches or
outperforms all commonly used default schedules including cosine annealing, and
that our schedule refinement method gives further improvements.]]></summary>

independent Gaussian distributions can be tuned to criticality, which prevents
the exponential growth or decay of signals propagating through the network.
However, such networks still exhibit fluctuations that grow linearly with the
depth of the network, which may impair the training of networks with width
comparable to depth. We show analytically that rectangular networks with tanh
activations and weights initialized from the ensemble of orthogonal matrices
have corresponding preactivation fluctuations which are independent of depth,
to leading order in inverse width. Moreover, we demonstrate numerically that,
at initialization, all correlators involving the neural tangent kernel (NTK)
and its descendants at leading order in inverse width -- which govern the
evolution of observables during training -- saturate at a depth of $\sim 20$,
rather than growing without bound as in the case of Gaussian initializations.
We speculate that this structure preserves finite-width feature learning while
reducing overall noise, thus improving both generalization and training speed.
We provide some experimental justification by relating empirical measurements
of the NTK to the superior performance of deep nonlinear orthogonal networks
trained under full-batch gradient descent on the MNIST and CIFAR-10
classification tasks.]]></summary>

express which tokens are important for a prediction. Unfortunately, such
explanations are often wrong despite being persuasive. Therefore, it is
essential to measure their faithfulness. One such metric is if tokens are truly
important, then masking them should result in worse model performance. However,
token masking introduces out-of-distribution issues and existing solutions are
computationally expensive and employ proxy-models. Furthermore, other metrics
are very limited in scope. In this work, we propose an inherently faithfulness
measurable model that addresses these challenges. This is achieved by using a
novel fine-tuning method that incorporates masking, such that masking tokens
become in-distribution by design. This differs from existing approaches, which
are completely model-agnostic but are inapplicable in practice. We demonstrate
the generality of our approach by applying it to various tasks and validate it
using statistical in-distribution tests. Additionally, because masking is
in-distribution, importance measures which themselves use masking become more
faithful, thus our model becomes more explainable.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Self-supervised representation learning~(SSRL) has advanced considerably by
exploiting the transformation invariance assumption under artificially designed
data augmentations. While augmentation-based SSRL algorithms push the
boundaries of performance in computer vision and natural language processing,
they are often not directly applicable to other data modalities, and can
conflict with application-specific data augmentation constraints. This paper
presents an SSRL approach that can be applied to any data modality and network
architecture because it does not rely on augmentations or masking.
Specifically, we show that high-quality data representations can be learned by
reconstructing random data projections. We evaluate the proposed approach on a
wide range of representation learning tasks that span diverse modalities and
real-world applications. We show that it outperforms multiple state-of-the-art
SSRL baselines. Due to its wide applicability and strong empirical results, we
argue that learning from randomness is a fruitful research direction worthy of
attention and further study.]]></summary>

(DNNs), having a significant impact on their performance. An activation
function in a DNN is typically a smooth, nonlinear function that transforms an
input signal into an output signal for the subsequent layer. In this paper, we
propose the Parametric Leaky Tanh (PLTanh), a novel hybrid activation function
designed to combine the strengths of both the Tanh and Leaky ReLU (LReLU)
activation functions. PLTanh is differentiable at all points and addresses the
'dying ReLU' problem by ensuring a non-zero gradient for negative inputs,
consistent with the behavior of LReLU. By integrating the unique advantages of
these two diverse activation functions, PLTanh facilitates the learning of more
intricate nonlinear relationships within the network. This paper presents an
empirical evaluation of PLTanh against established activation functions, namely
ReLU, LReLU, and ALReLU utilizing five diverse datasets.]]></summary>

strategies for conveying predictive information through visual forecasting: (1)
sequences of bounding boxes, and (2) augmented paths. To validate the proposed
visual forecasting strategies, we initiate evaluations in simulated

real-world scenarios to assess both practicality and effectiveness. The results

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Interpretable policy learning seeks to estimate intelligible decision
policies from observed actions; however, existing models fall short by forcing
a tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability. This tradeoff limits
data-driven interpretations of human decision-making process. e.g. to audit
medical decisions for biases and suboptimal practices, we require models of
decision processes which provide concise descriptions of complex behaviors.
Fundamentally, existing approaches are burdened by this tradeoff because they
represent the underlying decision process as a universal policy, when in fact
human decisions are dynamic and can change drastically with contextual
information. Thus, we propose Contextualized Policy Recovery (CPR), which
re-frames the problem of modeling complex decision processes as a multi-task
learning problem in which complex decision policies are comprised of
context-specific policies. CPR models each context-specific policy as a linear
observation-to-action mapping, and generates new decision models
$\textit{on-demand}$ as contexts are updated with new observations. CPR is
compatible with fully offline and partially observable decision environments,
and can be tailored to incorporate any recurrent black-box model or
interpretable decision model. We assess CPR through studies on simulated and
real data, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the canonical tasks of
predicting antibiotic prescription in intensive care units ($+22\%$ AUROC vs.
previous SOTA) and predicting MRI prescription for Alzheimer's patients
($+7.7\%$ AUROC vs. previous SOTA). With this improvement in predictive
performance, CPR closes the accuracy gap between interpretable and black-box
methods for policy learning, allowing high-resolution exploration and analysis
of context-specific decision models.]]></summary>

to overfit. Understanding why this happens is theoretically and practically
important. One recent approach looks at the infinitely wide limits of such
networks and their corresponding kernels. However, these theoretical tools
cannot fully explain finite networks as the empirical kernel changes
significantly during gradient-descent-based training in contrast to infinite
networks. In this work, we derive an iterative linearised training method as a
novel empirical tool to further investigate this distinction, allowing us to
control for sparse (i.e. infrequent) feature updates and quantify the frequency
of feature learning needed to achieve comparable performance. We justify
iterative linearisation as an interpolation between a finite analog of the
infinite width regime, which does not learn features, and standard gradient
descent training, which does. Informally, we also show that it is analogous to
a damped version of the Gauss-Newton algorithm -- a second-order method. We
show that in a variety of cases, iterative linearised training surprisingly
performs on par with standard training, noting in particular how much less
frequent feature learning is required to achieve comparable performance. We
also show that feature learning is essential for good performance. Since such
feature learning inevitably causes changes in the NTK kernel, we provide direct
negative evidence for the NTK theory, which states the NTK kernel remains
constant during training.]]></summary>

the problem of tuning for the right neural network architecture towards a
target task, while leveraging data from a related source task.

Now, in addition to the usual tradeoffs on approximation vs estimation errors
involved in model selection, this problem brings in a new complexity term,
namely, the transfer distance between source and target distributions, which is
known to vary with the choice of hypothesis class.

We present a first study of this problem, focusing on classification; in
particular, the analysis reveals some remarkable phenomena: adaptive rates,
i.e., those achievable with no distributional information, can be arbitrarily

success of deep neural networks. It is rigorously known that in two-layer
fully-connected neural networks under certain conditions, one step of gradient
descent on the first layer followed by ridge regression on the second layer can
lead to feature learning; characterized by the appearance of a separated
rank-one component -- spike -- in the spectrum of the feature matrix. However,
with a constant gradient descent step size, this spike only carries information
from the linear component of the target function and therefore learning
non-linear components is impossible. We show that with a learning rate that
grows with the sample size, such training in fact introduces multiple rank-one
components, each corresponding to a specific polynomial feature. We further
prove that the limiting large-dimensional and large sample training and test
errors of the updated neural networks are fully characterized by these spikes.
By precisely analyzing the improvement in the loss, we demonstrate that these
non-linear features can enhance learning.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learning rate schedules used in practice bear little resemblance to those
recommended by theory. We close much of this theory/practice gap, and as a
consequence are able to derive new problem-adaptive learning rate schedules.
Our key technical contribution is a refined analysis of learning rate schedules
for a wide class of optimization algorithms (including SGD). In contrast to
most prior works that study the convergence of the average iterate, we study
the last iterate, which is what most people use in practice. When considering
only worst-case analysis, our theory predicts that the best choice is the
linear decay schedule: a popular choice in practice that sets the stepsize
proportionally to $1 - t/T$, where $t$ is the current iteration and $T$ is the
total number of steps. To go beyond this worst-case analysis, we use the
observed gradient norms to derive schedules refined for any particular task.
These refined schedules exhibit learning rate warm-up and rapid learning rate
annealing near the end of training. Ours is the first systematic approach to
automatically yield both of these properties. We perform the most comprehensive
evaluation of learning rate schedules to date, evaluating across 10 diverse
deep learning problems, a series of LLMs, and a suite of logistic regression
problems. We validate that overall, the linear-decay schedule matches or
outperforms all commonly used default schedules including cosine annealing, and
that our schedule refinement method gives further improvements.]]></summary>

Optimization for (multi-layer) fully connected neural networks with a single
output node. In the first part, we examine cases with no hidden nodes,
specifically focusing on Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). We investigate the
well-specific model where the random noise possesses a zero mean, and the link
function is both bounded and Lipschitz continuous. We propose several
algorithms and our analysis demonstrates the feasibility of achieving an excess
population risk that remains invariant to the data dimension. We also delve
into the scenario involving the ReLU link function, and our findings mirror
those of the bounded link function. We conclude this section by contrasting
well-specified and misspecified models, using ReLU regression as a
representative example.

In the second part of the paper, we extend our ideas to two-layer neural
networks with sigmoid or ReLU activation functions in the well-specified model.
In the third part, we study the theoretical guarantees of DP-SGD in Abadi et
al. (2016) for fully connected multi-layer neural networks. By utilizing recent
advances in Neural Tangent Kernel theory, we provide the first excess
population risk when both the sample size and the width of the network are
sufficiently large. Additionally, we discuss the role of some parameters in
DP-SGD regarding their utility, both theoretically and empirically.]]></summary>

generating samples, from seemingly high dimensional probability measures.
However, these methods struggle to capture the temporal dependence of joint
probability distributions induced by time-series data. Furthermore, long
time-series data streams hugely increase the dimension of the target space,
which may render generative modelling infeasible. To overcome these challenges,
motivated by the autoregressive models in econometric, we are interested in the
conditional distribution of future time series given the past information. We
propose the generic conditional Sig-WGAN framework by integrating
Wasserstein-GANs (WGANs) with mathematically principled and efficient path
feature extraction called the signature of a path. The signature of a path is a
graded sequence of statistics that provides a universal description for a
stream of data, and its expected value characterises the law of the time-series
model. In particular, we develop the conditional Sig-$W_1$ metric, that
captures the conditional joint law of time series models, and use it as a
discriminator. The signature feature space enables the explicit representation
of the proposed discriminators which alleviates the need for expensive
training. We validate our method on both synthetic and empirical dataset and
observe that our method consistently and significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art benchmarks with respect to measures of similarity and
predictive ability.]]></summary>

whereas standard methods typically treat de facto ordered continuous variables
as discrete, (2) instead of estimating response-dependent finite coefficients
of linear models from discrete responses as is done in conventional approaches,
we train a non-linear neural network to serve as a coefficient function. Thanks
to the neural network, N$^3$POM offers flexibility while preserving the
interpretability of conventional ordinal regression. We establish a sufficient
condition under which the predicted conditional cumulative probability locally
satisfies the monotonicity constraint over a user-specified region in the
covariate space. Additionally, we provide a monotonicity-preserving stochastic

byproduct. Different from typical variational autoencoders assuming I.I.D.
representations (a data point's representation is not directly affected by
other data points), our VIR borrows data with similar regression labels to
compute the latent representation's variational distribution; furthermore,
different from deterministic regression models producing point estimates, VIR
predicts the entire normal-inverse-gamma distributions and modulates the
associated conjugate distributions to impose probabilistic reweighting on the
imbalanced data, thereby providing better uncertainty estimation. Experiments
in several real-world datasets show that our VIR can outperform
state-of-the-art imbalanced regression models in terms of both accuracy and

$x\in S^{n-1}$ within an $\epsilon$ error (in $\ell_2$) from minimal number of
linear measurements that are quantized to just their signs, i.e., from
measurements of the form $y = \mathrm{Sign}(\langle a, x\rangle).$ In this
paper, we study a noisy version where a fraction of the measurements can be
flipped, potentially by an adversary. In particular, we analyze the Binary
Iterative Hard Thresholding (BIHT) algorithm, a proximal gradient descent on a
properly defined loss function used for 1-bit compressed sensing, in this noisy
setting. It is known from recent results that, with
$\tilde{O}(\frac{k}{\epsilon})$ noiseless measurements, BIHT provides an
estimate within $\epsilon$ error. This result is optimal and universal, meaning
one set of measurements work for all sparse vectors. In this paper, we show
that BIHT also provides better results than all known methods for the noisy
setting. We show that when up to $\tau$-fraction of the sign measurements are
incorrect (adversarial error), with the same number of measurements as before,
BIHT agnostically provides an estimate of $x$ within an
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon+\tau)$ error, maintaining the universality of measurements.
This establishes stability of iterative hard thresholding in the presence of
measurement error. To obtain the result, we use the restricted approximate
invertibility of Gaussian matrices, as well as a tight analysis of the
high-dimensional geometry of the adversarially corrupted measurements.]]></summary>

training data. To understand this phenomenon, many works have aimed to quantify
the memorization capacity of a neural network architecture: the largest number
of points such that the architecture can interpolate any placement of these
points with any assignment of labels. For real-world data, however, one
intuitively expects the presence of a benign structure so that interpolation
already occurs at a smaller network size than suggested by memorization
capacity. In this paper, we investigate interpolation by adopting an
instance-specific viewpoint. We introduce a simple randomized algorithm that,
given a fixed finite dataset with two classes, with high probability constructs
an interpolating three-layer neural network in polynomial time. The required
number of parameters is linked to geometric properties of the two classes and
their mutual arrangement. As a result, we obtain guarantees that are
independent of the number of samples and hence move beyond worst-case
memorization capacity bounds. We illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm

the unobservable joint distribution between potential outcomes. Stratification
on pretreatment covariates can yield sharper partial identification bounds;
however, unless the covariates are discrete with relatively small support, this
approach typically requires consistent estimation of the conditional
distributions of the potential outcomes given the covariates. Thus, existing
approaches may fail under model misspecification or if consistency assumptions
are violated. In this study, we propose a unified and model-agnostic
inferential approach for a wide class of partially identified estimands, based
on duality theory for optimal transport problems. In randomized experiments,
our approach can wrap around any estimates of the conditional distributions and
provide uniformly valid inference, even if the initial estimates are
arbitrarily inaccurate. Also, our approach is doubly robust in observational
studies. Notably, this property allows analysts to use the multiplier bootstrap
to select covariates and models without sacrificing validity even if the true
model is not included. Furthermore, if the conditional distributions are
estimated at semiparametric rates, our approach matches the performance of an
oracle with perfect knowledge of the outcome model. Finally, we propose an
efficient computational framework, enabling implementation on many practical

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Motivated by the computational difficulties incurred by popular deep learning
algorithms for the generative modeling of temporal densities, we propose a
cheap alternative which requires minimal hyperparameter tuning and scales
favorably to high dimensional problems. In particular, we use a
projection-based optimal transport solver [Meng et al., 2019] to join
successive samples and subsequently use transport splines [Chewi et al., 2020]
to interpolate the evolving density. When the sampling frequency is
sufficiently high, the optimal maps are close to the identity and are thus
computationally efficient to compute. Moreover, the training process is highly
parallelizable as all optimal maps are independent and can thus be learned
simultaneously. Finally, the approach is based solely on numerical linear
algebra rather than minimizing a nonconvex objective function, allowing us to
easily analyze and control the algorithm. We present several numerical
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the
efficiency of our method. In particular, these experiments show that the
proposed approach is highly competitive compared with state-of-the-art
normalizing flows conditioned on time across a wide range of dimensionalities.]]></summary>

processes (MDPs) under the linear $q^\pi$-realizability assumption, where it is
assumed that the action-values of all policies can be expressed as linear
functions of state-action features. This class is known to be more general than
linear MDPs, where the transition kernel and the reward function are assumed to
be linear functions of the feature vectors. As our first contribution, we show
that the difference between the two classes is the presence of states in
linearly $q^\pi$-realizable MDPs where for any policy, all the actions have
approximately equal values, and skipping over these states by following an
arbitrarily fixed policy in those states transforms the problem to a linear
MDP. Based on this observation, we derive a novel (computationally inefficient)
learning algorithm for linearly $q^\pi$-realizable MDPs that simultaneously
learns what states should be skipped over and runs another learning algorithm
on the linear MDP hidden in the problem. The method returns an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy after $\text{polylog}(H, d)/\epsilon^2$ interactions
with the MDP, where $H$ is the time horizon and $d$ is the dimension of the
feature vectors, giving the first polynomial-sample-complexity online RL
algorithm for this setting. The results are proved for the misspecified case,
where the sample complexity is shown to degrade gracefully with the
misspecification error.]]></summary>

garnered significant importance in recent years due to the vast number of
applications for this type of data. Circular data is a classic example, but so
is data in the space of covariance matrices, data on the Grassmannian manifold
obtained as a result of principal component analysis, among many others. In
this work we investigate prediction sets for regression scenarios when the
response variable, denoted by $Y$, resides in a manifold, and the covariable,
denoted by X, lies in Euclidean space. This extends the concepts delineated in
[Lei and Wasserman, 2014] to this novel context. Aligning with traditional
principles in conformal inference, these prediction sets are distribution-free,
indicating that no specific assumptions are imposed on the joint distribution
of $(X, Y)$, and they maintain a non-parametric character. We prove the
asymptotic almost sure convergence of the empirical version of these regions on
the manifold to their population counterparts. The efficiency of this method is
shown through a comprehensive simulation study and an analysis involving
real-world data.]]></summary>

node information such as texts, images, or labels has popularized methods that
require the costly operation of processing the entire graph. Yet, little effort
has been made to the development of fast local methods (i.e. without accessing
the entire graph) that extract useful information from such data. To that end,
we propose a study of local graph clustering using noisy node labels as a proxy
for additional node information. In this setting, nodes receive initial binary
labels based on cluster affiliation: 1 if they belong to the target cluster and
0 otherwise. Subsequently, a fraction of these labels is flipped. We
investigate the benefits of incorporating noisy labels for local graph
clustering. By constructing a weighted graph with such labels, we study the
performance of graph diffusion-based local clustering method on both the
original and the weighted graphs. From a theoretical perspective, we consider
recovering an unknown target cluster with a single seed node in a random graph
with independent noisy node labels. We provide sufficient conditions on the
label noise under which, with high probability, using diffusion in the weighted
graph yields a more accurate recovery of the target cluster. This approach
proves more effective than using the given labels alone or using diffusion in
the label-free original graph. Empirically, we show that reliable node labels
can be obtained with just a few samples from an attributed graph. Moreover,
utilizing these labels via diffusion in the weighted graph leads to
significantly better local clustering performance across several real-world
datasets, improving F1 scores by up to 13%.]]></summary>

common and has the potential to deepen our understanding of many complex
diseases by analyzing these different views simultaneously. Equally important,
many of these complex diseases show evidence of subgroup heterogeneity (e.g.,
by sex or race). HIP (Heterogeneity in Integration and Prediction) is among the
first methods proposed to integrate multiple data views while also accounting
for subgroup heterogeneity to identify common and subgroup-specific markers of
a particular disease. However, HIP is applicable to continuous outcomes and
requires programming expertise by the user. Here we propose extensions to HIP
that accommodate multi-class, Poisson, and Zero-Inflated Poisson outcomes while
retaining the benefits of HIP. Additionally, we introduce an R Shiny

with the Python implementation of HIP to allow more researchers to use the
method anywhere and on any device. We applied HIP to identify genes and
proteins common and specific to males and females that are associated with
exacerbation frequency. Although some of the identified genes and proteins show
evidence of a relationship with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in

search, has shown promising results in training large AI models. It performs
comparably or favorably to AdamW but with greater memory efficiency. As we can
expect from the results of a random search program, Lion incorporates elements
from several existing algorithms, including signed momentum, decoupled weight
decay, Polak, and Nesterov momentum, but does not fit into any existing
category of theoretically grounded optimizers. Thus, even though Lion appears
to perform well as a general-purpose optimizer for a wide range of tasks, its
theoretical basis remains uncertain. This lack of theoretical clarity limits
opportunities to further enhance and expand Lion's efficacy.

This work aims to demystify Lion. Based on both continuous-time and
discrete-time analysis, we demonstrate that Lion is a theoretically novel and
principled approach for minimizing a general loss function $f(x)$ while
enforcing a bound constraint $\|x\|_\infty \leq 1/\lambda$. Lion achieves this
through the incorporation of decoupled weight decay, where $\lambda$ represents
the weight decay coefficient. Our analysis is made possible by the development
of a new Lyapunov function for the Lion updates. It applies to a broader family
of Lion-$\kappa$ algorithms, where the $\text{sign}(\cdot)$ operator in Lion is
replaced by the subgradient of a convex function $\kappa$, leading to the
solution of a general composite optimization problem of $\min_x f(x) +
\kappa^*(x)$. Our findings provide valuable insights into the dynamics of Lion
and pave the way for further improvements and extensions of Lion-related
algorithms.]]></summary>

datasets have demonstrated remarkable in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL)
capabilities, where they can make good decisions when prompted with interaction
trajectories from unseen environments. However, when and how transformers can
be trained to perform ICRL have not been theoretically well-understood. In
particular, it is unclear which reinforcement-learning algorithms transformers
can perform in context, and how distribution mismatch in offline training data
affects the learned algorithms. This paper provides a theoretical framework
that analyzes supervised pretraining for ICRL. This includes two recently
proposed training methods -- algorithm distillation and decision-pretrained
transformers. First, assuming model realizability, we prove the
supervised-pretrained transformer will imitate the conditional expectation of
the expert algorithm given the observed trajectory. The generalization error
will scale with model capacity and a distribution divergence factor between the
expert and offline algorithms. Second, we show transformers with ReLU attention
can efficiently approximate near-optimal online reinforcement learning
algorithms like LinUCB and Thompson sampling for stochastic linear bandits, and
UCB-VI for tabular Markov decision processes. This provides the first
quantitative analysis of the ICRL capabilities of transformers pretrained from

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper studies two fundamental problems in regularized Graphon Mean-Field
Games (GMFGs). First, we establish the existence of a Nash Equilibrium (NE) of
any $\lambda$-regularized GMFG (for $\lambda\geq 0$). This result relies on
weaker conditions than those in previous works for analyzing both unregularized
GMFGs ($\lambda=0$) and $\lambda$-regularized MFGs, which are special cases of
GMFGs. Second, we propose provably efficient algorithms to learn the NE in
weakly monotone GMFGs, motivated by Lasry and Lions [2007]. Previous literature
either only analyzed continuous-time algorithms or required extra conditions to
analyze discrete-time algorithms. In contrast, we design a discrete-time
algorithm and derive its convergence rate solely under weakly monotone
conditions. Furthermore, we develop and analyze the action-value function
estimation procedure during the online learning process, which is absent from
algorithms for monotone GMFGs. This serves as a sub-module in our optimization
algorithm. The efficiency of the designed algorithm is corroborated by
empirical evaluations.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Diffusion models suffer from slow sample generation at inference time.
Therefore, developing a principled framework for fast deterministic/stochastic
sampling for a broader class of diffusion models is a promising direction. We
propose two complementary frameworks for accelerating sample generation in
pre-trained models: Conjugate Integrators and Splitting Integrators. Conjugate
integrators generalize DDIM, mapping the reverse diffusion dynamics to a more
amenable space for sampling. In contrast, splitting-based integrators, commonly
used in molecular dynamics, reduce the numerical simulation error by cleverly
alternating between numerical updates involving the data and auxiliary
variables. After extensively studying these methods empirically and
theoretically, we present a hybrid method that leads to the best-reported
performance for diffusion models in augmented spaces. Applied to Phase Space
Langevin Diffusion [Pandey & Mandt, 2023] on CIFAR-10, our deterministic and
stochastic samplers achieve FID scores of 2.11 and 2.36 in only 100 network
function evaluations (NFE) as compared to 2.57 and 2.63 for the best-performing
baselines, respectively. Our code and model checkpoints will be made publicly
available at \url{https://github.com/mandt-lab/PSLD}.]]></summary>

prior. We establish a statistical task complexity bound for the attention model
pretraining, showing that effective pretraining only requires a small number of

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many real-world prediction tasks have outcome variables that have
characteristic heavy-tail distributions. Examples include copies of books sold,
auction prices of art pieces, demand for commodities in warehouses, etc. By
learning heavy-tailed distributions, "big and rare" instances (e.g., the
best-sellers) will have accurate predictions. Most existing approaches are not
dedicated to learning heavy-tailed distribution; thus, they heavily
under-predict such instances. To tackle this problem, we introduce Learning to
Place (L2P), which exploits the pairwise relationships between instances for
learning. In its training phase, L2P learns a pairwise preference classifier:
is instance A > instance B? In its placing phase, L2P obtains a prediction by
placing the new instance among the known instances. Based on its placement, the
new instance is then assigned a value for its outcome variable. Experiments on
real data show that L2P outperforms competing approaches in terms of accuracy
and ability to reproduce heavy-tailed outcome distribution. In addition, L2P
provides an interpretable model by placing each predicted instance in relation
to its comparable neighbors. Interpretable models are highly desirable when
lives and treasure are at stake.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Across a wide array of disciplines, many researchers use machine learning
(ML) algorithms to identify a subgroup of individuals, called exceptional
responders, who are likely to be helped by a treatment the most. A common
approach consists of two steps. One first estimates the conditional average
treatment effect or its proxy using an ML algorithm. They then determine the
cutoff of the resulting treatment prioritization score to select those
predicted to benefit most from the treatment. Unfortunately, these estimated
treatment prioritization scores are often biased and noisy. Furthermore,
utilizing the same data to both choose a cutoff value and estimate the average
treatment effect among the selected individuals suffer from a multiple testing
problem. To address these challenges, we develop a uniform confidence band for
experimentally evaluating the sorted average treatment effect (GATES) among the
individuals whose treatment prioritization score is at least as high as any
given quantile value, regardless of how the quantile is chosen. This provides a
statistical guarantee that the GATES for the selected subgroup exceeds a
certain threshold. The validity of the proposed methodology depends solely on
randomization of treatment and random sampling of units without requiring
modeling assumptions or resampling methods. This widens its applicability
including a wide range of other causal quantities. A simulation study shows
that the empirical coverage of the proposed uniform confidence bands is close
to the nominal coverage when the sample is as small as 100. We analyze a
clinical trial of late-stage prostate cancer and find a relatively large
proportion of exceptional responders with a statistical performance guarantee.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Covariate shift occurs prevalently in practice, where the input distributions
of the source and target data are substantially different. Despite its
practical importance in various learning problems, most of the existing methods
only focus on some specific learning tasks and are not well validated
theoretically and numerically. To tackle this problem, we propose a unified
analysis of general nonparametric methods in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space
(RKHS) under covariate shift. Our theoretical results are established for a
general loss belonging to a rich loss function family, which includes many
commonly used methods as special cases, such as mean regression, quantile
regression, likelihood-based classification, and margin-based classification.
Two types of covariate shift problems are the focus of this paper and the sharp
convergence rates are established for a general loss function to provide a
unified theoretical analysis, which concurs with the optimal results in
literature where the squared loss is used. Extensive numerical studies on
synthetic and real examples confirm our theoretical findings and further
illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We characterize the statistical efficiency of knowledge transfer through $n$
samples from a teacher to a probabilistic student classifier with input space
$\mathcal S$ over labels $\mathcal A$. We show that privileged information at
three progressive levels accelerates the transfer. At the first level, only
samples with hard labels are known, via which the maximum likelihood estimator
attains the minimax rate $\sqrt{{|{\mathcal S}||{\mathcal A}|}/{n}}$. The
second level has the teacher probabilities of sampled labels available in
addition, which turns out to boost the convergence rate lower bound to
${{|{\mathcal S}||{\mathcal A}|}/{n}}$. However, under this second data
acquisition protocol, minimizing a naive adaptation of the cross-entropy loss
results in an asymptotically biased student. We overcome this limitation and
achieve the fundamental limit by using a novel empirical variant of the squared
error logit loss. The third level further equips the student with the soft
labels (complete logits) on ${\mathcal A}$ given every sampled input, thereby
provably enables the student to enjoy a rate ${|{\mathcal S}|}/{n}$ free of
$|{\mathcal A}|$. We find any Kullback-Leibler divergence minimizer to be
optimal in the last case. Numerical simulations distinguish the four learners
and corroborate our theory.]]></summary>

Prompting large language models (LLMs) has become an efficient learning paradigm for adapting LLMs to a new task by conditioning on human-designed instructions. The remarkable in-context learning (ICL) ability of LLMs also leads to efficient few-shot learners that can generalize from few-shot input-label pairs. However, the predictions of LLMs are highly sensitive and even biased to the choice of templates, label spaces (such as yes/no, true/false, correct/incorrect), and demonstration examples, resulting in unexpected performance degradation and barriers for pursuing robust LLM applications. To address this problem, calibration methods have been developed to mitigate the effects of t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) could lead to a significant increase in global electricity consumption, according to a peer-reviewed analysis published in Joule.
 
The analysis estimates that if current trends continue, AI could drive the demand for electricity in data centers to consume at least 85.4 terawatt-hours annually, which is more than what many small countries use in a year.
 
AI is energy-intensive, with both the training and inference phases requiring a significant amount of energy.
 
The size of AI models, such as large language models, and the location of data centers also contribute to energy usage.
 
Factors such as cooling requirements and the type of hardware used can impact energy consumption.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Guys,
 ​
 I am currently spearheading a project for a client in the insurance industry, with a primary objective being the digitalization of thousands of hardcopy contracts. The ultimate goal is to automatically extract particular information from these newly digital documents, namely "date", "insurance premium", "insurance type", and "contractor's name". However, I anticipate a level of variability in terms of exact terminology used, particularly with regards to "insurance premium" and "insurance type". (There is no handwritten text)
 ​
 I am keen on sharing the methodology I intend to apply for this project and invite your invaluable feedback and suggestions:
 ​
 - Firstly, I'll execute the scanning/digitalization of the documents manually.
 - Post this, I plan to utilize Tesseract in combination with Python for the extraction of text from the preprocessed images.
 - I am considering using libraries such as NLTK or spaCy to preprocess this text (this will involve steps like lower casing, removing punctuations, etc.)
 - Finally, I plan to train a custom model for Named Entity Recognition (NER), to accommodate the potential semantic variations in entity labeling which are specific to entities like "insurance premium" and "insurance type".
 ​
 I would be immensely grateful if I could gain your insights on the above-proposed pipeline - Are there any glaring pitfalls I need to avoid or perhaps some improvements that I could incorporate? Your expert advice can certainly help ensure the success of this venture.
 ​
 Many thanks in anticipation for your time and valuable inputs!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 I’m studying the concepts of machine learning. However, I am stuck because I still don’t see how introducing a penalty using lasso regression can drive some parameter coefficients to zero. When doing the calculations, I only get the final value (ordinary least squares + penalty) and don’t directly see a coefficient value being reduced. 
 I've looked at many materials and resources trying to explain this, but I still can't see how it's done. I think the important thing for me is seeing it going to zero or, at the very least, seeing it during calculation. Is there anyone that can help explain this better? Or, If you know of a formula that I can derive that, during the derivation process, shows a coefficient being reduced or set to zero, that would also help.
 Also, any good resources on the topic would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's conversational bots like Claude and GPT can chat impressively but aren't great at complex planning or executing technical tasks. To overcome this, new research from HKU builds open-source AI agents that blend natural language and coding skills. They're called Lemur and Lemur-Chat.
 The researchers think achieving versatile real-world agents requires models that integrate both fluid natural language abilities and precise programming language control. Humans combine plain speech for higher-level goals with languages like Python when we need to plan intricately and execute exactly. AI needs both capacities too.
 But most existing models specialize in pure language or pure code. There's a separation that is limiting.
 The team created Lemur by pretraining the open-source Llama-2 on a massive mixed corpus with 10x more natural language than code. This improved its programming abilities while retaining conversational strength. Further instruction tuning optimized Lemur-Chat for following free-form directions in language.
 Experiments found Lemur surpassed specialized coding-only models like Codex in overall benchmarks. Lemur-Chat then exceeded Lemur by 15% after instruction tuning.
 More importantly, Lemur-Chat won 12/13 new "agent tests" designed to mimic real-world challenges needing both language and programming prowess.
 It beat alternatives at:
  
Using tools like Python and Wikipedia to enhance reasoning
 Debugging code by leveraging error messages
 Improving the most from natural language feedback
 Exploring partially observable environments like cybersecurity and web browsing simulations.
  
Lemur-Chat matched GPT-3.5 in many tests, closing the gap between commercial and open-source agents.
 TLDR: New open-source AI agents combine coding and language skills. Experiments show the combo unlocks more performance across technical challenges.

 [Background] We’ve been working on Evidently since late 2020 and have spoken to 100s of data scientists, ML engineers, and ML platform teams in different industries. In this course, we tried to sum up answers to the frequent questions on the topic. It starts with high-level theoretical modules and goes to complete deployment blueprints. It is approachable for different levels of knowledge, and you can pick only the modules you are interested in. 
 Looking forward to meeting you at the course!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently dealing with an environment, that most of the time (90% of all state transitions) clips the action selected from the agent. Sometimes even down to the point where the action selected by the agent is completly ignored. 
 This causes a lot of problems, because for example the entropy bonus does not works, since the agent learns to select any action, when it doesn't matter anyway but selects the same action (low entropy) when the actions have an effect. 
 Using the PPO algorithm I was thinking of masking the state transitions in the policy updates, according to how much the action was clipped in the environment. And I thought V(s) should be masked, because it can still learn from the state transitions even if the action was effectively ignored by the environment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm training some agents using fairly vanilla PPO on a hand-made environment. These agents learn to perform the task pretty well, but while I was examining their action probabilities during an evaluation episode, I had the idea to turn off deterministic action selection. 
 To my surprise, allowing probabilistic action selection (as opposed to argmax action selection) actually improved performance in some cases. I had always thought that deterministic actions during evaluation was fairly standard, but now am thinking that maybe I missed something and that there are cases where you wouldn't want determinism?
 My question is: how common is it actually to use deterministic actions vs. probabilistic ones at evaluation time, and does anyone know of studies/papers/examples where the authors found probabilistic evaluation to outperform determinism?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone.
 I am aware that there is a plethora of deep generative models out there (e.g. variational autoencoders (VAE), GANs) that can model high-dimensional data as the images of latent variables under a non-linear mapping (typically neural network).
 In more traditional methods such as probabilistic PCA, the latent variables can be marginalised analytically. In Bayesian PCA (BPCA), we can additionally integrate out the linear mapping, from the latent space to the observation space, by adopting the variational lower bound that leads to closed form updates of the parameters. The Gaussian Process Latent Variable (GPLVM) model adopts a non-linear probabilistic mapping (a Gaussian process) that can be marginalised. These two models enjoy to a certain degree analytical solutions concerning the inference of the latent variables and the mapping.
 I have been wondering whether there is any research into more "complex" models (perhaps I should call them deep) that are capable of modelling more complex data distributions than the GPVLM and BPCA, but retain analytical solutions when inferring the posterior of the latent variables (like BPCA) or the mapping (like GPLVM)?
 What I like about the GPLVM and BPCA is that they possess an objective function (i.e. ELBO) that can be analytically optimised, as opposed to the intractable objective of VAEs that necessitates Monte-Carlo averages and stochastic gradient. Could somebody please point me to such examples of more complex generative models that admit analytical inference for working out the posterior of the latent variables or the mapping?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To my knowledge, when using the Q Learning family algorithm, we must know the next state as well as the action spaces in couple with that observation in order to evaluate the reward for the next state with the target network.
 But I have some problem when trying to define this next state in turn turn-based game in which the agent have to make a certain number of actions and then wait for the opponent to do some actions before it can interact with the environment again. We can take Hearthstone as an example that each player have to wait for other to play a number of cards before can take any action.
 Currently, I have two options for this: 
 - Treat the environment right after the agent's turn ended, which will lack the action space.
 - Treat the environment just before the agent's turn begins, which will have all the actions available that it can choose from but this will make the agent's last action very noisy. That state could be a good state if the opponent playing badly or they are very good and make our last decision seem like a very bad choice. 
 Thanks in advance for any suggestions. If my problem is a common task that others have already solved many times, I will be very thankful for that keyword.

Staying after hours, spending long evenings and early mornings, to make each of my students find ease in debugging both easy-peasy and mind-boggling programs – it’s been a joy, truly. Watching those fresh faces, whom I introduced to Python in their first year ( intro to programming lab), now immerse themselves into my computer vision labs, exploring computer vision and deep learning in their third/forth year – it’s incredibly rewarding! And yeah my students kind of like me! after each semester I get tons of emails thanking me and my TAship review is always good.
 But, ugh, do I have enough publications to become faculty? A big fat NO! My efforts have been relentless, and everyone in my department would nod in agreement. But luck and reviewers? Not my best pals, apparently. So yeah, I don’t have a stack of 8 top-tier papers. I’ve managed to scrape together 3, and a few second tiers. My citation count is not that bad somewhere between 200 and 300-ish.
 Now, what’s next for me? Dive into the industry? become a high school teacher? Or perhaps, do a postdoc journey, fingers crossed for a sprinkle more luck and few more papers?
 Edit: This doesn't mean I don't like research, I actually love it too, I have done quite a few internship in quite big companies, most of the time they extend my intership and I even got publication out of one in 5 month. But I just like to teach a lot! strangely I got social anxiety every where other than my classrooms/labs.

Using a queue can make the dictionary large, but it also makes it intractable to update the key encoder by back-propagation (the gradient should propagate to all samples in the queue).
  
First I thought that the main reason that the bp cannot imply on key encoder is that the queue operation is not differentable. But It seems not true. You can compute the gradient of all samples in the queue, then bp should be performed properly. See the code at the bottom.
 So WHAT IS THE REAL REASON THAT THE BP IS INTRACTABLE FOR KEY ENCODER? In my opinion, I think may be because of the large size of the queue (dictionary) which makes the memory explosive.
 python q = nn.Linear(768,128) k = nn.Linear(768,128) bs = 64 ks = 4095 model = nn.ModuleList([q,k]) x = torch.randn(bs, 768) optim = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(),lr=0.01) loss = nn.CrossEntropyLoss() def forward(x): xq = q(x) xk = k(x + 0.1) que = torch.rand(ks,128) pos = torch.einsum("nc,nc->n",xq,xk) neg = torch.einsum("nc,kc->nk",xq,que) out = torch.cat([pos.unsqueeze(-1),neg],dim=1) t = torch.zeros(out.shape[0],dtype=torch.long) l = loss(out,t) return l loss = forward(x) loss.backward() optim.step()

I was thinking of going into academia, so recently I started proposing many ideas to my advisor so that I can mentor some junior students. However my advisor is rejecting every idea I suggest saying it won’t work. I’m feeling very dejected and I feel like I should give up going into academia. I don’t know what I’m expecting from here. Is your advisor like this too?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Artificial intelligence (AI) can provide "machine usefulness" for human workers, augmenting their jobs rather than replacing them.
 
However, there is a concern that AI could lead to job displacement and reinforce economic inequality.
 
MIT economist Daron Acemoglu emphasizes the importance of making AI more useful to humans and ensuring that the economic benefits are shared widely.
 
He suggests that innovations that augment workers' tasks can lead to prosperity for the workforce.
 
Acemoglu also highlights the need for worker power and the careful implementation of technology to achieve shared prosperity and productivity gains.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LLMs' tendency to make up false statements (hallucinate) is a major concern. We need ways to inspect whether they really "know" something is true or not so we can reduce hallucinations.
 In a new paper, researchers found that LLMs contain an internal "truth vector" - an emergent linear structure that represents factual truth values.
 They had the insight to visualize how GPT represents simple true/false sentences. The true ones clustered together, while false ones clustered elsewhere - suggesting some kind of 'truth direction' in its learned representations.
 To test this, they trained linear "probes" on one dataset, and found they could generalize to accurately detect truth values in totally different datasets about other topics.
 They also directly modified the models to add or subtract the identified truth vectors from its processing of statements. This could flip assessments of truth value, showing the vector causally influences reasoning.
 Together, these findings provide evidence that neural networks can create emergent, linear structures that represent factual truth. This finding could eventually help make AI systems less prone to hallucinations and falsehoods.
 TLDR: LLMs can create emergent linear representations of truth. This sheds light on how AI represents abstract concepts and could help us reduce hallucinations.
 Full summary. Paper is here.

If you’ve paid attention to the quantum computing space, you’ve heard the claim that in the future, quantum computers will solve certain problems exponentially more efficiently than classical computers can. They have the potential to transform many industries, from pharmaceuticals to energy.



For the most part, these claims have rested on arguments about the asymptotic scaling of algorithms as the problem size approaches infinity, but this tells us very little about the practical performance of quantum computers for finite-sized problems.

 Looking for some ideas. 
 I'm building out a jupyter book that will be a tutorial on how to use a research platform for data analysis and modelling. My PI has given me free liberty over it.
 I can not think of a good idea to do the analysis and build the model on. It does not need to be complex but should be good enough so that any researcher, student or organization using the platform can get a good idea of how to use it for ML. 
 Any thoughts on a good area to look into? Any recommendations? 
 Note this will be a tutorial and as such an overly complex model is unnecessary. I just can not figure out what to look into so hoping you guys could give thoughts about possible areas in climate, weather and earth science that I could focus on for the tutorial in the jupyter book.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just had a random idea: What if you train a video generating AI, but feed it videos that are reversed? You could show it an image of a crashed car, and it would generate a video of the crash. Show it a broken vase, it would "repair" it. It could one day become like the "reconstruct crime scene" in Detroit: Become Human. What are your thoughts about this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Nature survey of over 1,600 researchers reveals that AI tools are becoming increasingly common in science and are expected to be 'very important' or 'essential' in the next decade.
 
Scientists express concerns about how AI is transforming research, including reliance on pattern recognition without understanding, bias in data, fraud, and irreproducible research.
 
The survey shows that AI tools provide faster ways to process data, speed up computations, and save time and money.
 
Among researchers who use AI, more than one-quarter believe AI tools will become 'essential' to their field in the next decade.
 
Large language models like ChatGPT are mentioned as both impressive and concerning examples of AI tools in science.

Ive looked at a bunch already, and even tried adding the text of the different types in the prompts, bu Ive been getting separated results (like "cat" , "man", "head" wont combine the man and the cat, but rather give me un-morphed results, like a regular man, plus a cat in a suit with no human features. I even get a result with a man standing behind a cat! Ive tried StarryAI, imagecreator, wepik, cant afford midjourney or paid ones right now, some others I cant remember with no mixing...
 Artbreeder's interface, you can keep adding and it will mix them together.
 I made these images and others like them very easy in Artbreeder, but its plan is very limited - I could buy more credits, but I need to wait a few days (new job, not paid yet, broke today... lol):
 ​
 morph between man and donkey
 Morph between angry rapper and gorilla
 SO, if anyone can suggest some free, or almost free (generous newbie credits?) that can do mixes like this - please point me in the right direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 Happy to share a project I've been working on for a while: UI-Act
 https://github.com/TobiasNorlund/UI-Act
 It's an AI model architecture designed to autonomously navigate and interact with computers using the graphical user interface. Think of it as a co-pilot that "sees" your screen and acts on it, just as a human would.
 In essence, it's a custom transformer model taking prompt and screenshots as input, with output heads to predict low-level actions i.e. mouse clicks. In the demo, it has been trained to compute simple expressions in a calculator window, using expert demonstrations/behavior cloning. If scaled up appropriately however, it could provide a basis for a general agent to automate arbitrary tasks on a computer. 
 I would be interested in hearing your thoughts on it, and especially with regards to the trend towards general AI agents and assistants (Windows Copilot / Adept ACT-1 / AutoGPT etc).
 LMs equipped with e.g. function-calling is a trendy approach, that rely on text-based state representations and APIs to take action. In cases where this is unfeasible, UI-based agents might provide a more general alternative. As the agent's interface to the computer is shared with humans, it can be easily taught using expert demonstrations, and require little or no technical expertice.
 Let me know what you think!

 Confidence and trustworthiness of Tsetlin Machines.
 Hi all! Just completed a new chapter in the book An Introduction to Tsetlin Machines:
 https://tsetlinmachine.org
 Happy to receive feedback!
 Abstract: Collaboration can be essential to manage complex projects. One example is building a house. You then need the expertise of carpenters, plumbers, and electricians. Each profession brings unique skills to the table. Similarly, different types of Tsetlin machines can have distinct capabilities. In this chapter, you learn how Tsetlin machines can team up, allowing them to achieve more than they could on their own.
 The effectiveness of a team relies on recognising each member's strengths and limitations. Appreciating where your expertise stops and where your coworkers' expertise begins is crucial for effective collaboration. We first explore how Tsetlin machines can assess their competence in Section 7.1. Using the vote count from Chapter 1, you learn to measure how confident a Tsetlin machine is when it makes its decisions.
 It is possible to be highly confident and still perform poorly. To be trustworthy, confidence must be in line with one's capabilities. Therefore, Section 7.1 also covers how to evaluate trustworthiness.
 Next, in Section 7.2, you discover how to build a team of Tsetlin machines with different skills. By assessing each Tsetlin machine's confidence, you can lean on the confident ones when making decisions. The result is a Tsetlin machine composite - a construction where multiple Tsetlin machines join forces. You can think of it as a composite material, such as epoxy, which reinforces resin with fibres, making it strong, lightweight, and durable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Artificial intelligence (AI) is being used to create professional-looking profile pictures for job hunting websites like LinkedIn.
 
Apps like Remini, Try It On AI, and AI Suit Up use AI-based software to generate slick profile photos that mimic the work of expert photographers.
 
Users upload multiple selfies, and the AI software creates artificial photos with different hairstyles, clothing, and backdrops.
 
While some find the results realistic, others think they look artificial.
 
The AI services are popular because they are cheap or free, making them accessible to those who can't afford professional headshots.
 
However, opinions are divided on whether AI-generated photos are beneficial or detrimental to self-esteem.
 
Some believe that AI-generated photos allow individuals to put their best self forward and potentially increase their chances of being considered for opportunities.
 
Others worry that relying on AI-generated photos may negatively impact self-worth and confidence. Recruiters generally do not consider whether a photo is AI-generated when evaluating job applications.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been looking at DrQ-v2 (https://github.com/facebookresearch/drqv2) recently and it samples from replay in a way that seems odd to me but may have a purpose I don't understand.
 They store experiences in a compressed file by episode, this makes some sense since it means they don't have to store everything in RAM and they delay disk writes until the end of the episode so they don't slow down the sim operation. 
 On sampling, they randomly select an episode then randomly select an experience from the episode, calculating the n-step reward dynamically at sample time instead of at experience storage time. This is then fed to the model by a pytorch DataLoader. This means a _lot_ of disk reads during the optimization step which can't be ideal but I'll put that aside. 
 What is the advantage of doing this selection by episode? It may give a better spread across episodes in each update, but I'm not sure that makes up for the potential downsides of making prioritization and other replay tricks much harder. Any ideas?

 I’m thrilled to share a prototype we've been tirelessly working on.
 We are developing a virtualization environment for applications, specifically tailored to engineers, designers, data scientists, and researchers.
 In a nutshell, our platform enables users to run cloud-hosted desktop apps from any device, making it appear as if the applications are installed on their local machines, while they're actually operating on a remote server.

 Now it seems like Dolly is human generated/curated by over 5k employees (which is great), but wouldn't it be a better approach now to have Llama70b (or maybe Falcon) just generate future variants of 15k rows? I havent been able to figure out why we arent seeing more synthetic datasets like this on HF? Is the bottleneck licensing, compute or just incentive?

 The architecture is a simple encoder decoder architecture.
 I tried MSE as some articles and ML guides say that MSE is good for pixel wise comparison and also tried Categorical Crossentropy but none of them work so great.
 MSE works but produces artefacts like red/green/ blue spots and spatters and at worse times it produces a white image.
 The research on this task includes use of SIDNet[Single Image Dehazing Net], Transmission maps, Dark channel prior algorithm, FFA net, etc trained on the Benchmark datasets (RESIDE,SOTS).
 I aim to create a simple architecture for college project so I chose the Enc-Dec architecture. Any suggestions are appreciated.

Their latest benchmark trains networks two orders of magnitude faster than PyTorch and Tensorflow.

 It's a collaborative effort with the Swift community and Apple's compiler team, using the Swift language as a strongly typed embedded language that performs ahead of time compilation of graph neural nets. The focus is on fusing systems programming and AI engineering into a single native high performance language, to enable typed heterogeneous inference and training.
 The compiler development is open sourced as part of the standard Swift package. Try it yourself at swift.org.

I decided to start from scratch, make incremental changes, and make sure that the model's performance is maintained with each change. Very basic in hindsight, but I guess I was too hasty with coding.
 Anyway, running the full model's training and evaluation with each change is proving to take too long. I'm curious if there's any other way that people implement TDD in the context of machine learning since projects/applications tend to be more time consuming then typical applications.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Top dating apps Tinder, Hinge and Bumble have all stated that they're already investing in AI to make their apps better. They're using it to verify profiles, match people based on bios and interests, and help generate profile descriptions and liven conversations. But what about machine learning on user photos?
 iris Dating uses AI to analyze user input in the form of liking or disliking faces ("swiping" profiles). We all know if we like blondes or brunettes, blue or brown eyes, short or long hair, beard or no beard, etc. But AI can pick up the subtlest features (proportions, distances, curvatures etc.) and build a face map. A matrix of features, if you will. It doesn't just look for a person looking like your favorite celebrity crush. It understands what you're really attracted to.
 From there it's an easy path: if it knows which features attract me, it can predict my level of attraction to a specific individual (specifically, their face). Find the persons with the highest predicted attractiveness (for me, not for everyone), rank them by attraction for me, and we have a potential high mutual attraction match. The two stats I have are that on average women like 55%(!) of the profiles iris picks for them; and that users have 40x higher chances of matching when they've trained the model to understand their taste.
 I know it takes a lot more than a pretty face to make for a great relationship, but it sure doesn't hurt to start with strong physical attraction. Missed connections on Craigslist are about just that: seeing a face you can't forget. Find me more of these "wow" faces and let's go from there.
 What do you think? Is it too early? Too bold? Too niche?

Companies closely monitor the movements of researchers as an indicator of their ability to transition from concept to product.
 
The market is highly competitive, with researchers being offered high salaries and compensation packages.
 
This has led to high turnover and attrition in many companies, causing unsettledness among employees.
 
Despite the challenges, the investment in AI research is expected to drive innovation and push the boundaries of the Transformer architecture.

Also, many byte-level models including this and ByteT5 mention that they can process any text sequence even in a multilingual setting, however how would that be true if we are only using one byte, would we have to move to 2 bytes or use an UNK token, and if we did use 2 bytes that would make our embedding size around 65000 which defeats sort of the point as o…]]></summary>

Someone else maybe felt sick and complains the line at the bathroom was too long. Perhaps another family member also rode the same roller coasters as the first person but instead hated it, so would have a very different description of it than the first. 
 All these anecdotes are submitted to the model. 
 Then, the model can be queried. Such as, 
 “Tell me about the theme park.” 
 or
 “I love roller coasters. Tell me about the theme park.” 
 or
 “I tend to overeat, tell me about the theme park.” (the model wouldn’t hype of the food, maybe it would talk about how much exercise the visitors get by walking around all day.) 
 In this case of a theme park context, the model would have a preconception of a theme park. It would know the general concept, know of several examples or standards that it could compare this theme park against, understand it’s all for fun, etc. 
 This type of model may be available as an API or model already and I just don’t know about it. That’d be fine, please point me towards it. Or, maybe there’s something already available but would need tweaked or customized.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I want to train a neural network to calculate Shapley values based on a given characteristic function.
 Depending on a given characteristic function, calculated through a dedicated algorithm, Shapley values can be any number, positive or negative, without a set range.
 Because of this, I am unsure, for the specific application of calculating Shapley values, what activation function to use in a neural network that would calculate them. The relu function, as well as leaky relu function, either cannot give values that are negative or have trouble giving large negative values, and sigmoid or tanh can only give values in a certain range.
 I am aware that there are other commonly used activation functions, but all the ones I could find had one of these issues, which would make training a network to calculate Shapley values difficult.
 Any advice?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over Feb 12-13 of 2024, the National Science Foundation (NSF) is sponsoring a workshop titled “Integrating LLMs into the Materials Chemistry Curriculum” in Golden, Colorado. We aim to explore and develop innovative ways to incorporate large language models (LLMs, e.g. GPT, ChatGPT, and Bard) into upper division chemistry laboratories and virtual lab experiences. During the workshop, participants will brainstorm and create demonstrations incorporating LLMs into the curriculum.
 The event will bring together folks across academia and the private sector with disciplinary backgrounds that range across chemistry, computer science, materials science, physics, and education. There is no registration fee, and we anticipate being able to cover the majority of participant travel costs thanks to NSF support. Participants early in their career (i.e., graduate students, postdoctoral scholars) are particularly encouraged to apply.
 If you are interested in participating in this workshop, please fill out the Google form (link below).
 Please feel free to distribute this invitation widely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Transformers are great at NLP and computer vision tasks, but I was surprised to learn they still lag behind simple linear models at time series forecasting.
 The issue is how most Transformer architectures treat each timestamp as a token and fuse all the variable data from that moment. This makes two big problems:
  
Variables recorded at slightly different times get blurred together, losing important timing info
 Each token can only see a single moment, no long-term dependencies
  
So Transformers struggle to extract useful patterns and correlations from the data.
 Some researchers from Tsinghua University took a fresh look at this and realized the Transformer components themselves are solid, they just need to flip the architecture for time series data.
 Their "Inverted Transformer" (or iTransformer):
  
Makes each variable's full history into a token, instead of each timestamp
 Uses self-attention over variables to capture relationships
 Processes time dependencies per variable with feedforward layers
  
This simple tweak gives all the benefits we want:
  
State-of-the-art forecasting accuracy, beating both linear models and standard Transformers
 Better generalization to unseen variables
 Increased interpretability
 Ability to leverage longer historical context
  
TLDR: Inverting Transformers to align with time series structure allows them to outperform alternatives in working with time series data.
 Full summary. Paper is here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 for a text work of mine I am trying to do a project based on generating digital twin of networks. My goal is to create a digital twin of a network and then work on it from a cyber security point of view. I will briefly explain what I would like to do.
 I am currently using software for network vulnerability scans (OpenVAS). I use this software to perform network vulnerability scans at the network level, so basically to OpenVAS I pass a network (for example 192.168.xx.xx/24) to automatically identify all the vulnerabilities that are there.
 The next step ( what I'd like to do and that's why I'm asking for your advice) is to create a digital twin of the newly scanned network and then perform a penetration test on this digital twin of the network, without going to stress the actual network.
 Ideally, I would like to pass the output of the OpenVAS vulnerability scans, routing rules, and firewall rules to some tool that will then generate for me the digital twin of the network, which will then be used for offensive cybersecurity, so exploits, privilege escalation, etc.... will be tested on this digital twin without worrying about breaking some kind of service or stressing the real network.
 What I am asking is, do you know of any tool that would do the trick for me? So some tool that allows me to generate a digital twin of a network by providing as input vulnerability scans (xml,json,csv etc...), routing rules, firewall rules, pcap traces etc... 
 Do you have any references or documentation? 
 Are you aware of any open source tools?
 I thank you for your helpfulness!

Has a massive variety of styles like Womba's private discord server does.
 
"Create variants" function like how a Womba discord personal server generator allows you to do.
 
Generates beautiful "digital art" style images like the digital https://www.unstability.ai/ does. (Man those images are pretty) faces are really good most of the time. (It's frusterating as it looks so good but I can't seem to get any group sex poses going on.)
 
Provides a variety of poses such as https://easywithai.com/ai-image-generators/promptchan-ai/ which also allows you to upload you own images for poses, like how I could upload a real life orgy image and as long as it could distinguish the bodies as being separate (not a big pile of limbs) it does pretty good, but lacks severely lacks in facial quality. Like a big booty girl in hyperreal style
 
1080P or higher resolution. (Again Womba is good here, but they are just extreme on their restrictions.) 1080P should be the minimum for any paid service as how can we truely enjoy a full screne image on anything less without it pixeling out?
 
Doesn't cost $150/month (yes I found one that does all this but their premium subscription cost like $150/month (seduced.ai) and it's not even unlimited. I paid $90 for a full year at Womba discord unlimited but again, $150/month is just not worth it. 
 
 If anyone knows of a server that has all these for around $25/month or less, please let me know. If really appreciate it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quick intro
 Lineups are one of the first steps in the VFX pipeline
 Source:
 - orignal footage that was shot on set
 - a reference (quicktime) video from the film edit.
 Task:
 The reference shows modifications to the original footage. They can be :
 - timewarp (either fixed retimes like 200% speed or completely random)
 - transform (moved the image in x/y axis, rotation, scale, etc.)
 So the lineup task is to align the original footage to the reference quicktime.
 What I did so Far:
 Made a simple script in the software Nuke, using some Python and readily available tools to make it work on a simple shot. General logic is compare every frame and the associated one is the frame with the least difference between the two. This works on super simple and straightforward tasks. (can provide more info if needed).
 Issue:
 Some references are more heavily modified. They can have some muzzle flash, basic 3d objects or even some slight error introduced like a distortion applied to the image when none shouldn't so it will never be perfectly aligned. This makes the difference of the full frame higher for some frames, making the lineup wrong. (it will take the wrong frame that has no muzzle flash, because it has less difference...)Some other things to consider is that watermarks are covering the ref and the colors are not perfectly matching, can get them close enough, but there's a difference.
 Conclusion:
 Because of those issues, I'm thinking about using Machine Learning. I have next to no knowledge on the subject. I know there Is a bunch of ways to train a model, but no clue where to start, so here's my question :
 Which learning styles has the best potential to be able to solve this task?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Transformers are great at NLP and computer vision tasks, but I was surprised to learn they still lag behind simple linear models at time series forecasting.
 The issue is how most Transformer architectures treat each timestamp as a token and fuse all the variable data from that moment. This makes two big problems:
  
Variables recorded at slightly different times get blurred together, losing important timing info
 Each token can only see a single moment, no long-term dependencies
  
So Transformers struggle to extract useful patterns and correlations from the data.
 Some researchers from Tsinghua University took a fresh look at this and realized the Transformer components themselves are solid, they just need to flip the architecture for time series data.
 Their "Inverted Transformer" (or iTransformer):
  
Makes each variable's full history into a token, instead of each timestamp
 Uses self-attention over variables to capture relationships
 Processes time dependencies per variable with feedforward layers
  
This simple tweak gives all the benefits we want:
  
State-of-the-art forecasting accuracy, beating both linear models and standard Transformers
 Better generalization to unseen variables
 Increased interpretability
 Ability to leverage longer historical context
  
TLDR: Inverting Transformers to align with time series structure allows them to outperform alternatives in working with time series data.
 Full summary. Paper is here.

It is for testing a custom pipeline, you create a pipeline, you run it on multiple different datasets and get an aggregated metric. For now I'm using a for loop but how do I do it in parallel e.g. on AWS? I googled, but surprisingly haven't found a lot of results. I looked at Apache AirFlow because I'm vaguely familiar with it but so far I couldn't get a definite answer on how it works with multiple GPU's. Second option I found is to use Ray library. Is it worth trying? What should I use to solve this task? Thanks.
 UPD. I'd also consider a PyTorch solution as a backup option.

Hard for me to make a switch given how much I am appreciated. I almost feel spoiled when it comes to flexibility. I have overachiever tendency and the pace is so slow in adopting my ML models.
 I am the “lead”/senior data scientist in an R&D supporting scientists decision making with machine learning. Importantly, I am in a huge multinational consumer product company and I am not in the Data science organization, I bridge between the two and the data science expert on the team.
 I have developed the domain expertise and I have a PhD in an applied computational field with 5 years experience . I am not as challenged with getting deeper into complex stats, I have been really honing the soft skills of communication, influencing etc so getting comfortable in a senior role. Also I have been growing as a ML engineer building my own pipelines and deploying my models on prem server that they bought for me.
 I am not sure how greener it is on the other side, how do senior folks approach deciding when to move on? Any input is much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am relatively new to machine learning, and I am thinking about building an on-chain reputation ML model.
 Here is how far I have gone in my ideation phase, can someone help with some suggestion on how I can approach this issue.
  
Input data could include on-chain activity like number of transactions, value transferred, smart contracts interacted with, tokens held, NFTs owned, etc.
 Additionally, data from off-chain sources could be incorporated like identity verification, credentials, ratings, reviews, social media profiles, etc.
 Supervised learning algorithms like regression or classification models could be used to predict a reputation score. The target variable would be some verified reputation rating.
 Models like linear regression, random forests, or neural networks could work. Choice depends on size of data and complexity needed.
 Model would need to be transparent and parameters verifiable on-chain for validity. So linear models or simple neural networks may be most practical initially.
 The model could be trained off-chain initially but ultimately parameters and logic stored on-chain. Predictions could also be verified on-chain.
 Careful feature selection is important so the model relies on signals that are resistant to manipulation and capture true reputation.
 The model would need continuous updates as new data comes in reflecting latest reputation. This would require clear on-chain governance.
 Issues like privacy, collusion resistance, and censorship resistance would need to be addressed through crypto mechanisms like zero-knowledge proofs.
  
P.S. This is a personal project I want to attempt to level up my ML skills.

 I am a student who is currently studying Bachelor of Science in AI. I have a question regarding improving my coding skills. I am aiming for a research internship and I don't know where to start. I previously took a summer school that taught me a lot about state-of-the-art models such as GANs, Transformers, VAEs, GNNs, etc. I would like to improve my coding skills, specifically problem-solving and writing clean code. I have experience with deep learning in general and data analysis. I am looking for a research internship next summer. Where should I start?
 I plan to review some of the deep learning material in the Deep Learning Specialization before taking the GAN specialization. However, when it comes to coding, I want to think like a software engineer or a great programmer. What do you guys suggest for improving my coding or problem-solving skills? I'm feeling confused with multiple resources and I don't know where to begin.
 I’d really appreciate your help.

 Dataset basics: insider trade details, insider trades over the last month, insider trades over the last week, (…) stock return over the last month (…), 46 columns total. 
 Labels… 0: <-5% return in two weeks 1: >-5% + <5% 2: >5%
 Dates predicted: reported date. Usually 2-3 days behind transaction.
 Also, not positive if results are significant in the first place so that would be a great call out as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Big Tech companies like Microsoft and Google are grappling with the challenge of turning AI products like ChatGPT into a profitable enterprise.
 
The cost of running advanced AI models is proving to be a significant hurdle, with some services driving significant operational losses.
 
Corporate customers are unhappy with the high running costs of AI models.
 
The nature of AI computations, which require new calculations for each query, makes flat-fee models risky.
 
Some companies are trying to dial back costs, while others continue to invest more deeply in AI tech.
 
Microsoft's GitHub Copilot, which assists app developers by generating code, has been operating at a loss despite attracting more than 1.5 million users.
 
One of the reasons AI services are costly is that some companies have been reaching for the most powerful AI models available.
 
Microsoft has been exploring less costly alternatives for its Bing Chat search engine assistant.
 
Advances in AI acceleration hardware may eventually reduce the costs of operating complex models.
 
Experts anticipate a more stringent financial approach in the near future, transitioning from experimental budgets to focusing on profitability.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The environmental impact of the AI revolution is starting to become clear, with generative AI like ChatGPT increasing Google Search's energy use more than tenfold.
 
The worry is that the computing power required for AI could lead to increased energy consumption and carbon footprint of data centers.
 
AI already accounted for 10 to 15 percent of Google's electricity consumption in 2021.
 
Google claims that the energy needed to power AI technology is increasing at a much slower rate than predicted, and they are implementing practices to reduce the carbon footprint of AI workloads.
 
The worst-case scenario of Google Search using as much electricity as Ireland is unlikely, but the potential energy consumption of AI servers could grow significantly if AI's popularity continues to rise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multimodal sentiment analysis combines text, audio and video to understand human emotions. But extra inputs can add irrelevant or conflicting signals. So filtering matters.
 Researchers made a "Adaptive Language-guided Multimodal Transformer" (ALMT) that uses text to guide filtering of visual and audio data. This creates a "hyper-modality" with less noise that complements the text.
 They tested it on datasets like MOSI (YouTube reviews), MOSEI (YouTube clips) and CH-SIMS (Chinese videos). ALMT achieved improved accuracy:
  
MOSI: YouTube movie reviews with 2,199 samples. ALMT achieves state-of-the-art performance on various metrics including 6% higher 7-class accuracy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multimodal sentiment analysis combines text, audio and video to understand human emotions. But extra inputs can add irrelevant or conflicting signals. So filtering matters.
 Researchers made a "Adaptive Language-guided Multimodal Transformer" (ALMT) that uses text to guide filtering of visual and audio data. This creates a "hyper-modality" with less noise that complements the text.
 They tested it on datasets like MOSI (YouTube reviews), MOSEI (YouTube clips) and CH-SIMS (Chinese videos). ALMT achieved improved accuracy:
  
MOSI: YouTube movie reviews with 2,199 samples. ALMT achieves state-of-the-art performance on various metrics including 6% higher 7-class accuracy.
 MOSEI: 22,856 YouTube clips covering sentiment-rich scenarios. ALMT improves multi-class accuracy by 3-5% over previous methods.
 CH-SIMS: Chinese dataset with over 2,000 video samples. ALMT surpasses prior work by 1.4% in binary accuracy.

 So I know Tiktok published a white paper on their purported algorithm, Monolith, but it is unclear if that is what they use in their products or not. Given, recommender systems seem to be core to Bytedance's business, I imagine they wouldn't provide many details.
 Has anyone evaluated Monolith on their own products and seen an improvement? 
 I think the app is impressive and am wondering how it has transferred to other use cases.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! I wanted to advertise my new JAX optimisation library Optimistix!
 Optimistix has high-level APIs for minimisation, least-squares, root-finding, and fixed-point iteration and was written to take care of these kinds of subroutines in Diffrax.
 Here is the GitHub: https://github.com/patrick-kidger/optimistix
 The elevator pitch is Optimistix is really fast, especially to compile. It plays nicely with Optax for first-order gradient-based methods, and takes a lot of design inspiration from Equinox, representing the state of all the solvers as standard JAX PyTrees.
 For those familiar with classical nonlinear unconstrained optimisation, Optimistix does some pretty nifty new things. It introduces new abstractions for modular optimisers, allowing users to mix-and-match different optimisation techniques easily. For example, creating a BFGS optimiser with Levenberg-Marquardt style Tikhnov regularisation takes less than 10 lines of code in Optimistix.
 I'm using Optimistix as a tool for my own research, and continue to work on it as part of my PhD (supervised by Patrick Kidger.) I would love for some more people to try it, so let me know what you think!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 Document layout analysis has been a great tool so far to extract the components of a document (title, paragraph, tables ...). I'm working on long text PDF which are mostly scanned documents.
 One of the process involved after document layout analysis, is to recreate the document structure: creating sections, sub section, sub sub sections and so on. As of today, this task is done by parsing the title and finding out any ordering information (numeric, alphabetical or roman notation):
 1. Title A 1.1 Title B 2. Title C 2.a) Title D 
 This technique works only if a document follows this constraint (numeration). I want to go one step further, where the algorithm could create the document structure with any title ordering information.
 I believe that relying only on parsing cannot do the trick. What could be the options? Given that the only features are: title's text and title's position (x,y) in the document. I was wondering if a model like a seq2seq could fit this problem, or should I stick with an engineering rule based approach.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks, 
 I have observed a strange behavior when implementing a VERY BASIC idea 🙂
 I want to use a fully-connected Neural Network to approximate a sine wave. For that I am sampling 200.000 uniformly distributed points from a wide interval, e.g. [-60,60] and compute the corresponding sin(x) values resulting in the following training data. 
 ​
 Training data
 I glimpse into my setup: 
 Model:
 nn.Linear(1, 16) nn.Sigmoid() Linear(16, 16) nn.Sigmoid() nn.Linear(16, 8) nn.Sigmoid() nn.Linear(8, 4) nn.Sigmoid() nn.Linear(4, 1) (I also pumped up the network to up to 100 hidden neurons on one layer) 
 Number of samples: 200.000 (80% train / 20% test)
 Optimizer: Adam
 Loss: RMSE
 Epochs between 100 - 500
 Learning Rate: 0.02
 Batch Size: 500 - 1000
 ​
 Check out the screenshots below to see the results 😨
 ​
 The predictions are pretty good but the edge areas slow down to a very small value, without any change. This only holds for high-frequency sine waves. If we only consider the train range of [-2*np.pi , 2*np.pi] it works pretty good with small loss.
 ​
 So my questions are: 
 1) Why do we see that behaviour? 
 2) How can we solve it
 ​
 Cheers

I am using them to test a set of MC question from a medical test published after the models knowledge cutoff. However, I cannot be 100% sure the questions were not on the internet beforehand. 
 Is there any established method or testsuit to try to understands weather a given instance has been seen at training time? All I can think is looking at memorization or at perplexity, but I was looking for a more out of the box methodology that people use. It seems to me that the problem is quite general. 
 Thanks!
 Edit: I know LLMs do not just memorize things and learn pattern. However, there is research on trying to understand if a datapoints has been used in training or not. Eg there is research that tries to exploit the fact that seen text has normally lower perplexity than unseen text or other similar infornation. I was wonderibg what the state in this topic is and if something is normally used as a score to have some clues. I do not expect to be able to retrieve the exact same questions lol

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking for methods/frameworks to extract multi-modal embeddings from images and text for similarity search purposes. The problem setup is slightly different from how CLIP style methods are generally used ( where similarity between text and image embeddings obtained through the model are computed to assess how similar a caption is to an image). My intended application is similarity search, where I want to find entries of images and captions pair similar to a piece of the query image and caption encoded together.
 Some approaches I tried: I tried concatenating the textual and visual embeddings obtained from CLIP and ResNET with textual embeddings and using it with cosine similarity, but it had limited utility. My guess is that concatenating two modalities merely without any training would yield very little utility. The next direction could be to train a model to fuse the embeddings obtained, but my dataset size is really small (10 thousand total), so not sure if training a model would be helpful. 
 Are there any approaches that can allow me to combine the multi-modal embeddings for similarity purposes, similar to how pre-trained ResNET or Inception can be used off-the-shelf for retrieving visually similar images? Any pointers/advice would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my ML/AI journey up until now, most training and hands-on labs either use a pre-built dataset or have you build a pretty simple and flat dataset. I am now looking to stretch my exploration into some real-world use cases and find the data I want is way more complex.
 Researching online feels like the meme on learning to draw an owl.
 So I'm looking for some guidance on how to handle my data.
 The data is an array from a rest API that includes all alarms from an application as nested objects. So the data looks like this for a single event:
 data = { "event_data": [ { "root_cause": "Root cause added after API calls" "alarms": [ { "alarm_id": "alarm_id", "alarm_name": "alarm_name", "alarm_type": "alarm_type", "alarm_description": "alarm_description", "alarm_details": { pro1: val1, prop2: val2, etc... }, "actual_alarm_value": { any_random_key: "any_random_value", etc... }, } ], } ] } 
 I need to build a dataset that includes many of these events with the ultimate goal of predicting future events. I plan to test this against various ML models and LLMs.
 Each event would be a single row, and I would flatten out each alarm so each nested property has its own column. Where I need clarification is how to handle the flatting of alarms. If I fully flatten them, it appears like I lose the context of the alarm's parent event. But if I only flatten them to the alarm level, I lose each property having its own row
 Also actual_alarm_value is very random, so my thinking is to use string encoding here.
 I know this is a lot of detail, and I appreciate any and all advice and help in learning how to do this.

 I'm aware you can use the HuggingFace inference API, but it's probably not best for commercial use, in which case the Inference endpoints would be better, but it's quite pricey for a startup with no customers.
 I also know I could use some kind of serverless GPU / inference platform to create my own API.
 But is there just a straight-up REST API for getting text embeddings from a model via SentenceTransformers or other HuggingFace models?

 I'm planning to start learning ML which obviously requires python. But at the same time I wanna start practicing DSA / competitive programming as well. I'm sorta in this dilemma of what to do.
 Since python is a must for ML I'm 100% doing it, but for DSA I am confused whether I should learn DSA in Python or C++. People say C++ is the best and ideally I should do that. But python suits my need more. Obviously I don't mind doing both languages together but it seems a bit redundant.
 P.S: I'm learning DS basics in college via C language so learning the basic concepts isn't an issue.
 What do you suggest?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks, I graduated from a tier 2 college in India with an ECE degree and then started working as an ML engineer in a mid-size startup 2 years ago. (1 year of internship + 1 year of Full time employment at the same company). Now, I am looking to get a Master's Degree in AI/ML/DS in Germany starting Winter 2024. I am a person with interests in Industry skills(Applied AI/ML) rather than the research/academia part as I don't wish to pursue a PhD nor do I want to be stuck in a Math-deep subject that may not be relevant for me in the future. On account of this, I wanted to know which college/degree offers the best balance in-between theory and applied AI/ML/DS.
 Also, people have been telling me that exams are super tough and it is hard to successfully complete an AI/ML/Data Science MS degree in Germany, Is it true? It has been super discouraging for me to hear this and is affecting me mentally to go through the application process.
 PS. CS/Electrical Degrees with good electives for AI/ML/DS are also good enough for me (Just hoping the coursework/grading is not too harsh) Also, it would be great if someone could clarify if an Electronics and Communications student can apply for a CS degree in Germany.
 Sorry for asking too many questions, TIA. :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a small plant engineer who covers manufacturing, process, quality, and new product design. I wear many hats in my job and it's a lot of responsibility.
 One way I've attempted to tame the complexity is by using good reference books. I've accumulated quite the collection through the years. Some print others digital. I've also got a lot of digital notes. And that's a lot of data.
 I've been playing around with sharly.ai (thanks to this sub for recommending) and uploading documents to it and querying them. Its been able to find the information every time it's been available. And more importantly it's provided sources and page numbers. This is important, since I've never been able to find a conversational AI that gives me consistently good answers (including the latest chatgpt), and I always need to read deeper. I also need to backup my work. So in this way it's basically a super index.
 I also bought a tablet for note-taking and basic sketches. The idea is to use the tablet to take notes, hold my library for reading, and interact with sharly.ai. 
 Is this approach good enough, or is there something else I can do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With recent RT-X efforts from Deepmind, it seems the community has been shifting towards the development of a more generalized foundational model, combining with visions and languages, and scaling via imitation learning. 
 I know RL algorithms are expensive to train and hard to scale due to the way the samples are generated, but I am still fascinated by the intelligence behind their philosophies. What do you think the future would look like? Like NLP or CV, having a big foundational model pre-trained via IL, and fine-tune on different tasks via RL? How can we tell if a task is simple enough that we don't need to leverage the power of a foundational model?

 Abstract:
  
While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on a range of decision-making tasks, they rely on simple acting processes and fall short of broad deployment as autonomous agents. We introduce LATS (Language Agent Tree Search), a general framework that synergizes the capabilities of LLMs in planning, acting, and reasoning. Drawing inspiration from Monte Carlo tree search in model-based reinforcement learning, LATS employs LLMs as agents, value functions, and optimizers, repurposing their latent strengths for enhanced decision-making. What is crucial in this method is the use of an environment for external feedback, which offers a more deliberate and adaptive problem-solving mechanism that moves beyond the limitations of existing techniques. Our experimental evaluation across diverse domains, such as programming, HotPotQA, and WebShop, illustrates the applicability of LATS for both reasoning and acting. In particular, LATS achieves 94.4\% for programming on HumanEval with GPT-4 and an average score of 75.9 for web browsing on WebShop with GPT-3.5, demonstrating the effectiveness and generality of our method.

Multi-task learning (MTL) has shown considerable practical benefits, particularly when using pre-trained language models (PLMs). While this is commonly achieved by simultaneously learning n tasks under a joint optimization procedure, recent methods such as AdapterFusion structure the problem into two distinct stages: (i) task learning, where knowledge specific to a task is encapsulated within sets of parameters (e.g., adapters), and (ii) transfer, where this already learned knowledge is lev…]]></summary>

As most people navigate their everyday world, they process visual input from the environment using an eye-level perspective. Unlike robots and self-driving cars, people don't have any "out-of-body" sensors to help guide them. Instead, a person’s sensory input is completely "egocentric", or "from the self." This also applies to new technologies that understand the world around us from a human-like perspective, e.g., robots navigating through unknown buildings, AR glasses that highlight objects, or assistive technology to help people run independently.

 1 I'd like to know if I could train AI to recognize details found it nature / weathering / aging and feed it pictures and it would recognize them (segmenting) so it can spot them but also their positions based on surrounding shapes, and the logical placement resulting. Seems hard.
 2 then feed it some examples of those aging stuff on their own (with proper tags) so it learn to reproduce them and create new ones from scratch.
 3 but then feed it "clean" pics and it would age them according to patterns it could find on the base training set so it can guess where to best place them.
 Pretty sure 2 is trivial enough, 1 seems possible until learning the "logic", but 3?
 Thanks for your insight.

 Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04415
 Abstract: Weight decay is a broadly used technique for training state-of-the-art deep networks, including large language models. Despite its widespread usage, its role remains poorly understood. In this work, we highlight that the role of weight decay in modern deep learning is different from its regularization effect studied in classical learning theory. For overparameterized deep networks, we show how weight decay modifies the optimization dynamics enhancing the ever-present implicit regularization of SGD via the loss stabilization mechanism. In contrast, for underparameterized large language models trained with nearly online SGD, we describe how weight decay balances the bias-variance tradeoff in stochastic optimization leading to lower training loss. Moreover, we show that weight decay also prevents sudden loss divergences for bfloat16 mixed-precision training which is a crucial tool for LLM training. Overall, we present a unifying perspective from ResNets on vision tasks to LLMs: weight decay is never useful as an explicit regularizer but instead changes the training dynamics in a desirable way. Our code is available at this https URL.

The custom chips are designed to compete with NVIDIA's dominance in the AI accelerator market.
 
Microsoft aims to match or surpass the performance of NVIDIA's offerings while reducing the cost of AI infrastructure.
 
The high cost of NVIDIA's GPUs, such as the H100, can reach up to $30,000, making it expensive to build data centers filled with these GPUs.
 
By developing its own chips, Microsoft hopes to decrease its dependence on NVIDIA for AI servers.

 Can I ask everyone here, where do you get your custom training data from?
 My team is training classifier models from scratch, so need thousands of specific query/response examples to train on.
 It's not the kinda data you could randomly scrape or source from a library.
 Are there any platforms that exist where you can pay a bunch of humans to write high volumes of relatively high quality text based training data?

 I am working on a project to train a Reinforcement Learning agent to recover a quadrotor after any of the rotor’s failures. I am using AirSim for my project, but I can’t find a way to adjust the quad-rotor so that only 3 of the four rotors are working. 
 Any suggestions? I appreciate any help you can provide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you have the dataset used to make the pretrained you could always create a new model with the old + new data, but this is often prohibitively expensive or impossible because the dataset is not available.
 Catastrophic forgetting seems to be the big issue, especially if you've already undergone instruction tuning since the model will lose its conversational tone. I've seen papers discussing regularization techniques to avoid that by minimizing the changes to high value attention heads but not sure if that is considered to be the most promising direction.
 I'm aware of LoRAs but I imagine at some point you can't just arbitrarily cram new info into such a low dimensional space.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LLMs are great at basic reasoning when prompted, but still struggle with complex multi-step problems like optimization or planning. Humans tackle new problems by drawing on intuition from similar experiences, which LLMs can't do.
 Researchers propose "Thought Propagation" to have LLMs reason more like humans - by thinking analogically. First, GPT is prompted to suggest related "analogous" problems to the input. Then it solves those. Finally, it aggregates the solutions to directly solve the input problem or extract useful strategies.
 They tested this technique on challenges like finding optimal graph paths, writing coherent stories, and planning for LLM agents. Across different models, it significantly boosted performance over regular prompting:
  
12% better at finding shortest paths
 13% improvement in creative writing (human preference)
 15% higher task completion for LLM agents
  
It also beat chain-of-thought (there is a comparison to CoT and ToT in the paper).
 After 1-2 iterations, adding more layers of analogy didn't help much. Efficiently generating useful analogies is still difficult and that's a limitation.
 I think this is interesting because it shows the value of "meta-cognition" - having models reflect on their own reasoning. More techniques like this could incrementally improve LLMs' reasoning to be more human-like.
 TLDR: Teaching LLMs to reason analogically, using solutions for similar problems as hints, significantly boosts their complex reasoning ability.
 Full summary. Paper is here.

 Having already established a baseline based on random sampling of the majority class; now I am looking to try more complex approaches. I am specifically trying to replicate the 'nearest neighbor of clustering center' approach from Lin et al., 2017.
 The problem is I am working on my desktop and only have 32 Gb of RAM and 2 1Tb NVMe disks at half capacity. I have tried working with only 10% of the data and still the MiniBatchKMeans function of sklearn doesnt have enough space to run: "numpy.core._exceptions._ArrayMemoryError: Unable to allocate 440. GiB for an array with shape (9603174, 6144) and data type float64". 
 Does anyone have a suggestion on how I can move forward? Could cloud services be an option? 
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working on an a web app where people will be able to upload photos and write text. I don't want to have problems with my government or other countries governments in regards with the content that is uploaded to my website. I have searched about measures that can be taken to avoid this from happening. Adding a report button and having moderators are both good starting options.
 I thought that as time passes, more and more content is going to be created by the users so supervising that people are following the rules needs to be automated from the beginning. Applying measures to prevent people from uploading/posting links containing nudity, child porn, beastiality, or whatever users capture with a camera that could lead to legal problems must be a priority and allowing this type of content is not ethical.
 I am a software developer, but I haven't delved into machine learning and ai for most of my career because I haven't to. This seems like the perfect case to learn by doing and time is not a constraint, but I need some guidance.
 I have read superficially about how people train models by providing lots of data, I imagine other websites that use machine learning & ai to remove this type of content don't download media that contains nudity, child pornography, besteality, etc to train their models and make their tests. There must be some pretrained models, maybe, but how would they test this works? I don't know, I am just thinking on my own how other devs are currently handling this.
 I am no looking for upvotes, I don't care for downvotes, I am just looking for guidance, and I would be very happy to hear the opinion of someone with experience.

 Github: https://github.com/ryoungj/toolemu 
 Website: https://toolemu.com/ 
 Abstract:
  
Recent advances in Language Model (LM) agents and tool use, exemplified by applications like ChatGPT Plugins, enable a rich set of capabilities but also amplify potential risks - such as leaking private data or causing financial losses. Identifying these risks is labor-intensive, necessitating implementing the tools, manually setting up the environment for each test scenario, and finding risky cases. As tools and agents become more complex, the high cost of testing these agents will make it increasingly difficult to find high-stakes, long-tailed risks. To address these challenges, we introduce ToolEmu: a framework that uses an LM to emulate tool execution and enables the testing of LM agents against a diverse range of tools and scenarios, without manual instantiation. Alongside the emulator, we develop an LM-based automatic safety evaluator that examines agent failures and quantifies associated risks. We test both the tool emulator and evaluator through human evaluation and find that 68.8% of failures identified with ToolEmu would be valid real-world agent failures. Using our curated initial benchmark consisting of 36 high-stakes tools and 144 test cases, we provide a quantitative risk analysis of current LM agents and identify numerous failures with potentially severe outcomes. Notably, even the safest LM agent exhibits such failures 23.9% of the time according to our evaluator, underscoring the need to develop safer LM agents for real-world deployment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Reddit,
 I am new to reinforcement learning. I have sufficient knowledge on supervised learning, but I am yet to stumble onto a cheat sheet for RL and from what I can tell, my use case is less common. 
 I'm reaching out to the community in hopes of getting guidance and assistance in cutting through the noise of redundant and irrelevant information so I can attempt to built a toy model to validate my use case. I am deeply grateful for any help in advance.
 ​
 From what I can tell, here are the conditions I need to work with for my use case.
  
I'm trying to train a simulator.
 This is a multi-agent problem, perhaps with more than 2 agents. Each agent is responding based on it's own state, the state of the other agent[s], and historical context.
 Both the action space and state space are highly dimensional and highly dynamic based on the dataset and all agents' decisions. I still haven't figured out how the feature engineering will work yet, but I assume (but PLEASE correct my ignorance) I will need a DNN architecture that is more complex than the average deep RL algorithm, and I have considering using CNNs as a component.
 At scale, the datasets can and will be very large, random, and dynamic.
  
​
 Note to reader: I am self-taught. If I stare at technical equations long enough and google for additional resources, I can figure out what I am looking at, but I am very comfortable with technical concepts being shared as if I was a 5 year old.

 Github: https://github.com/hahnyuan/PB-LLM 
 Abstract:
  
This paper explores network binarization, a radical form of quantization, compressing model weights to a single bit, specifically for Large Language Models (LLMs) compression. Due to previous binarization methods collapsing LLMs, we propose a novel approach, Partially-Binarized LLM (PB-LLM), which can achieve extreme low-bit quantization while maintaining the linguistic reasoning capacity of quantized LLMs. Specifically, our exploration first uncovers the ineffectiveness of naive applications of existing binarization algorithms and highlights the imperative role of salient weights in achieving low-bit quantization. Thus, PB-LLM filters a small ratio of salient weights during binarization, allocating them to higher-bit storage, i.e., partially-binarization. PB-LLM is extended to recover the capacities of quantized LMMs, by analyzing from the perspective of post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization aware training (QAT). Under PTQ, combining the concepts from GPTQ, we reconstruct the binarized weight matrix guided by the Hessian matrix and successfully recover the reasoning capacity of PB-LLM in low-bit. Under QAT, we freeze the salient weights during training, explore the derivation of optimal scaling factors crucial for minimizing the quantization error, and propose a scaling mechanism based on this derived scaling strategy for residual binarized weights. Those explorations and the developed methodologies significantly contribute to rejuvenating the performance of low-bit quantized LLMs and present substantial advancements in the field of network binarization for LLMs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I aim to develop a model that utilizes livestream data by employing embeddings for each frame from t0 to tn-1, with the objective of predicting frames from tn to tn+k, after encodoing the frames using a vectorizer and taking an average (np.mean ([], axis=0) to get a resultant for that time period.
 for example list:
 1, [...] 2, [...] 3, [...] 
 the resultant embedding would be [3, np.mean(list, axis=0)]
 I incorporate positional embeddings related to the timescale, such as duration from current time variables, into the array. would this loosely qualify as a "multiscale attention", since it's predicting on multiple scales of time?
 Are there any examples or applications where this methodology has been implemented? references to papers or repos greatly appreciated.

The decision comes after concerns were raised about AI-generated art in a board game expansion.
 
BackerKit's policy will go into effect on October 4th and aims to ensure that all content and assets on the platform are created by humans.
 
The company stated that the policy is in place to address concerns about AI tools using content without proper compensation or permission.
 
AI tools, also known as generative AI, rely on a large body of reference material, often obtained from publicly available sources, and have raised ethical concerns.

 They're typically designed iteratively, which takes time. This is a pain for developing countries without resources to test options. But AI could help auto-generate diverse and valid design options.
 In a new paper, researchers propose using Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to sample varied roundabout layouts. Their approach works by constructing layouts step-by-step, maximizing rewards for realism, diversity, and safety.
 They also use a clever approximation during training. Rather than simulating traffic, they quickly check road intersections to focus the search (This sped up training by 200x).
 The authors tested their generated roundabout designs on simulated road scenarios of different complexity. Their model generated more diverse designs than rule-based or reinforcement learning approaches while maintaining realism and traffic flow.
 Plus, as road connections increased, the model kept discovering novel options without compromising quality.
 I thought this paper was an awesome proof-of-concept for auto-generating better roundabouts with AI, and I especially liked the authors' angle of leveraging this technology to specifically help developing countries. This could help them design higher-quality transportation networks faster and cheaper. (Plus I also like Cities: Skylines but struggle at building roundabouts).
 TLDR: Roundabouts are costly to design. New paper demonstrates how AI can generate diverse, valid roundabout designs quickly to cut costs and raise quality. Helpful for infrastructure in developing countries.

 Bard:
 The question of whether Israel should go to the table with Palestinians to peacefully negotiate a two-state solution or should they continue their military campaign is a complex one with no easy answer. There are strong arguments to be made on both sides.
 Those who believe that Israel should negotiate a two-state solution argue that it is the only way to achieve lasting peace in the region. They point out that the Palestinians have a legitimate right to self-determination and that a two-state solution would respect that right. They also argue that a two-state solution would be in Israel's best interests, as it would provide the country with a secure and stable border.

 The essential challenge is trying to get the model to focus on making predictions for mondays by looking at monday (or actually making predictions for categorical earmarked hours of the day such as midday sales data).
 I keep getting the suggestion to include one hot encoding as a binary mask feature to determine if an hour sales figure is earmarked for the category or the day of the week I want the model to focus on-- in order to get it to ignore the data from the other six days of the week or the other periods of the day.
 In other words I want to hone in on and focus on one period of the week to predict for that period of the week, with extra attention, within time series data. Is this type of binary mask really sufficient for that, or am I overlooking something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent work explores how weight decay controls the effective learning rate for different layers and neurons. This rotational behavior drastically differs between Adam with L2 regularization compared to Adam with decoupled weight decay (AdamW) and seems to be the reason AdamW performs better in practice. It could also explain why normalization methods like weight standardization work so well and irregular rotational behavior could contribute to the need for a learning rate warmup.
 Full Abstract: Weight decay can significantly impact the optimization dynamics of deep neural networks. In certain situations, the effects of weight decay and gradient updates on the magnitude of a parameter vector cancel out on average, forming a state known as equilibrium. This causes the expected rotation of the vector in each update to remain constant along with its magnitude. Importantly, equilibrium can arise independently for the weight vectors of different layers and neurons. These equilibria are highly homogeneous for some optimizer and normalization configurations, effectively balancing the average rotation—a proxy for the effective learning rate—across network components. In this work we explore the equilibrium states of multiple optimizers including AdamW and SGD with momentum, providing insights into interactions between the learning rate, weight decay, initialization, normalization and learning rate schedule. We show how rotational equilibrium can be enforced throughout training, eliminating the chaotic transient phase corresponding to the transition towards equilibrium, thus simplifying the training dynamics. Finally, we show that rotational behavior may play a key role in the effectiveness of AdamW compared to Adam with L2-regularization, the performance of different normalization layers, and the need for learning rate warmup.

 Am I doing something obviously wrong? Is there a way to optimize my training parameters to reduce the epoch duration? I've previously trained something where the GPU usage was constantly at 100% and not fluctuating so much, but I can't remember which settings were different. It was definitely a smaller dataset.
 And follow up: if there are parameters to change, how can I abort the current training and continue it with the modified parameters?
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I tried to construct a simulation env following fetch_pick_and_place. I noticed that the following code is used to initialize the env:
  for _ in range(10): self._mujoco.mj_step(self.model, self.data, nstep=self.n_substeps) 
 Similarly, I followed the above code to initialize my own env with Mujoco menagerie Franka arm but got inaccurate configurations. As I reduced the number of loops, I got configurations closer to the desired configuration.
 Paradoxically, I need to randomize the position of the object in the air and give enough mj_step at the initial stage to make the object fall on the table. If I reduce the number of loops to reduce the number of times mj_step is executed, I can tell from the height value of the object that it doesn't quite fall on the table.
 So, my confusion is why more mj_steps lead to inaccurate simulation results, and how to make the object fall on the table and obtain the most accurate arm configuration.
 Thanks in advance!

 I tried out a few OpenAI models (GPT-3.5, GPT-3.5-instruct, GPT-4), but popularity predictions for augmented texts did not improve (checked with histograms, medians, and Wilcoxon test).
 So now I want to fine-tune an LLM to perform text generation, but guided with my predicted popularity, which basically works as a quality metric. I could not find any resources on this, only on either text generation finetuning (without guiding quality metric) or on classification (no text generation objective). I can also change my quality metric to binary (augmented text is better or not), if this matters.
 How can I do this? Any blogs / tutorials / papers are appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Generative AI wave has led to a surge in demand for GPUs and AI model training.
 
Investors are now questioning the purpose and value of the overbuilt GPU capacity.
 
For every $1 spent on a GPU, approximately $1 needs to be spent on energy costs to run the GPU in a data center.
 
The end user of the GPU needs to generate a margin, which implies that $200B of lifetime revenue would need to be generated by these GPUs to pay back the upfront capital investment.
 
The article highlights the need to determine the true end-customer demand for AI infrastructure and the potential for startups to fill the revenue gap.
 
The focus should shift from infrastructure to creating products that provide real end-customer value and improve people's lives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Research on network binarization techniques tailored for Large Language Models (LLMs). The team has introduced a method called Partial Binarization for LLMs (PB-LLM) which compresses the majority of model parameters down to just a single bit while maintaining its language reasoning capabilities. PB-LLM achieves this by selectively filtering critical weights and allocating more bits for storage, enabling low-bit quantization.
 The researchers have explored methods like Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), named GPTQ-PB, and Quantization Aware Training (QAT) to restore the inference capabilities of LLMs. 
 For those interested in delving deeper, you can find the research paper on Arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00034 and the code implementation on GitHub: https://github.com/hahnyuan/PB-LLM.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To help developers test their RAG systems, we added a RAG experiment class to our open-source library PromptTools. It allows users to easily experiment with different combinations of LLMs and vector DBs, and evaluate the results of their whole pipeline.
 In particular, you can experiment with:
  
Chunking up your documents into different sizes
 Pre-processing those documents in various ways
 Inserting those documents into your vector DBs with various vectorizer and embedding function, and accessing them with different distance functions
  
In our RAG example, we retrieve documents from ChromaDB and pass them into OpenAI’s chat model along with our prompt. We then pass the results into built-in evaluation functions, such as semantic similarity and autoeval, to quantitatively evaluate your result.
 PromptTools is agnostic to what LLMs and vector DBs you use. You can easily iterate over different system architectures forRAG. You can even bring your own fine-tuned models or write a custom integration. In addition, you can write your own evaluation metrics, and independently evaluate the results from the retrieval step as well.
 Our current integrations include:
  
LLM: OpenAI (chat, fine-tuned), Anthropic, Google Vertex/PaLM, Llama (local or via Replicate)
 Vector DB: Chroma, Weaviate, LanceDB, Pinecone, Qdrant
 Framework: LangChain, MindsDB
  
You can get started with RAG in minutes by installing the library and running this example.
 As open-source maintainers, we’re always interested to hear the community’s pain points and requests. Let us know how you are testing your RAG systems and how we can help.

 Github: https://github.com/wzcai99/Pixel-Navigator
 Abstract: Zero-shot object navigation is a challenging task for home-assistance robots. This task emphasizes visual grounding, commonsense inference, and locomotion abilities, where the first two are inherent in foundation models. But for the locomotion part, most works still depend on map-based planning approaches. The gap between RGB space and map space makes it difficult to directly transfer the knowledge from foundation models to navigation tasks. In this work, we propose a Pixel-guided Navigation skill (PixNav), which bridges the gap between the foundation models and the embodied navigation task. It is straightforward for recent foundation models to indicate an object by pixels, and with pixels as the goal specification, our method becomes a versatile navigation policy towards all different kinds of objects. Besides, our PixNav is a pure RGB-based policy that can reduce the cost of home-assistance robots. Experiments demonstrate the robustness of the PixNav which achieves 80+% success rate in the local path-planning task. To perform long-horizon object navigation, we design an LLM-based planner to utilize the commonsense knowledge between objects and rooms to select the best waypoint. Evaluations across both photorealistic indoor simulators and real-world environments validate the effectiveness of our proposed navigation strategy.

 But from a statistical modeling standpoint, I'm really struggling, when I read papers like DDPM, DDIM or Normalizing Flows, I kind of undestand the notation, but I barely understand the statistical modeling, and I wouldn't be able to produce such thing myself
 I want to understand this, which resources should I use ?
 Are books like Bishop and Murphy enough ? Which one is the best ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some of you might already be aware that a junior who submitted their paper to arxiv 30 mins late had their paper desk rejected late in the process. One of the PCs, Juan Pino, spoke up about it and said it was unfortunate, but for fairness reasons they had to enforce the anonymity policy rules. https://x.com/juanmiguelpino/status/1698904035309519124
 Well, what you might not realize is that Longyue Wang, a senior area chair for AACL 23/24, also broke anonymity DURING THE REVIEW PROCESS. https://x.com/wangly0229/status/1692735595179897208
 I emailed the senior area chairs for the track that the paper was submitted to, but guess what? I just found out that the paper was still accepted to the main conference.
 So, whatever "fairness" they were talking about apparently only goes one way: towards punishing the lowly undergrad on their first EMNLP submission, while allowing established researchers from major industry labs to get away with even more egregious actions (actively promoting the work DURING REVIEW; the tweet has 10.6K views ffs).
 They should either accept the paper they desk rejected for violating the anonymity policy, or retract the paper they've accepted since it also broke the anonymity policy (in a way that I think is much more egregious). Otherwise, the notion of fairness they speak of is a joke.

Video and image content appear as if they were seen through this window. To do this, the viewer’s position is determined using a neural network. The viewed content is then moved according to the viewer’s position. This makes it seem like the content is physically behind the smartphone and is viewed through the smartphone’s screen. This effect is especially useful for content captured using an ultra-wide lens.

 I am designing an environment for a robotic task. It's a relatively straightforward task so I started with proprioceptive inputs only. I have a policy working well on a completely flat surface. But once I started to add small bumps to make the surface uneven, neither the policy nor the training strategy worked anymore, even though those bumps are really really small. 
 This is a little confusing since I imagine if this is a task for human, should be able to handle those changes even without exteroceptive inputs. So I am debating should I modify my reward design, pick a more efficient algorithm, or expand the state space directly with exoceptive sensors.

 Any advices would be appreciated!

 Input: time series of product 1, product 2, GDP, PMI
 Output: product 1 (monthly 6-steps ahead), product 2 (monthly 6-steps ahead)
 I have a couple of questions:
  
Feasibility: I've been researching this approach, but I haven't found many tutorials or guides on how to tackle multivariate time series forecasting with a CNN-LSTM architecture. I do find tutorials on CNN-LSTM, but not on how to include additional features as input. Has anyone here attempted something similar or can provide insights on how to proceed?
 Feature Selection: I have access to 20 different features, all of which are time series data. I want to choose the most relevant features for my model. I've considered performing a Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis to select the best features. Does anyone have experience with this or other methods for feature selection in time series forecasting? How to decide the number of features to include? 
  
Any advice or pointers in the right direction would be greatly appreciated!

 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Artificial Intelligence could revolutionize personalized healthcare in a way that significantly enhances our sense of well-being. Think about an AI-driven "Well-being Advisor" that integrates real-time biometric data from wearables, genetic information, and your medical history to create a fully personalized health and well-being plan. This goes beyond counting steps or monitoring heart rate; it would make real-time recommendations for diet, exercise, and stress management, and could even predict and prevent potential health issues before they become serious.
 Moreover, it would adapt based on your feedback and other contextual factors. For instance, if you're stressed because of a work deadline, it could suggest specific breathing exercises, time management techniques, or even a particular type of short workout to boost your focus and reduce stress. This isn't a one-size-fits-all approach; it's tailored wellness backed by data science.
 Furthermore, this AI advisor could interface with your home automation system. Based on your current state, it could adjust the lighting, play music to elevate your mood, or even communicate with your smart fridge to suggest meals that you can make with the ingredients you have—meals that align with your health goals for that specific day.
 This AI-driven approach can add a highly personalized, proactive layer to healthcare and well-being, making wellness an integrated part of your daily life rather than something you think about during a yearly check-up or after you're already sick. It would make the pursuit of well-being a more interactive, data-driven experience.

I know that even Mid Journey doesn't generate good text with its images but I was thinking maybe its bc it was trained just with pictures. Is there an easy way to get legible text and images every time with any model on the site? Do I need to train one? Do I need to train a GAN looking for assistance, thanks.

 I'm asking for your high level thoughts and opinions.
 So I'm doing my research and trying to find a way to train a LLM model to know all the right answers based on XML data. The data is a shop inventory, containing information on shoe models, sizes, is it in stock, description, image links etc.
 How would you approach it? For now the best option i came up with is parsing data, transforming it into predefined set of questions with answers based on the data derived from xml. Doesn't seem smart enough to me.

Would it somehow exist spread out across data centres, or could 1000s of individual AIs be created or would there just be one with a singular pov like we have?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We use the maximum a posteriori estimation principle for learning
representations distributed on the unit sphere. We propose to use the angular
Gaussian distribution, which corresponds to a Gaussian projected on the
unit-sphere and derive the associated loss function. We also consider the von
Mises-Fisher distribution, which is the conditional of a Gaussian in the
unit-sphere. The learned representations are pushed toward fixed directions,
which are the prior means of the Gaussians; allowing for a learning strategy
that is resilient to data drift. This makes it suitable for online continual
learning, which is the problem of training neural networks on a continuous data
stream, where multiple classification tasks are presented sequentially so that
data from past tasks are no longer accessible, and data from the current task
can be seen only once. To address this challenging scenario, we propose a
memory-based representation learning technique equipped with our new loss
functions. Our approach does not require negative data or knowledge of task
boundaries and performs well with smaller batch sizes while being
computationally efficient. We demonstrate with extensive experiments that the
proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods on both
standard evaluation scenarios and realistic scenarios with blurry task
boundaries. For reproducibility, we use the same training pipeline for every
compared method and share the code at https://t.ly/SQTj.]]></summary>

-- updating the discriminator with differentially private stochastic gradient
descent (DPSGD) -- can yield significantly improved results after modifications
to training. Specifically, we propose that existing instantiations of this

inhibits discriminator training, disrupting the balance between the generator

fix -- taking more discriminator steps between generator steps -- restores
parity between the generator and discriminator and improves results.

Additionally, with the goal of restoring parity, we experiment with other
modifications -- namely, large batch sizes and adaptive discriminator update

numerous applications, surpassing human performance in areas such as personal
healthcare and financial systems. The deployment of GCNs in the cloud raises
privacy concerns due to potential adversarial attacks on client data. To
address security concerns, Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML) using
Homomorphic Encryption (HE) secures sensitive client data. However, it
introduces substantial computational overhead in practical applications. To
tackle those challenges, we present LinGCN, a framework designed to reduce
multiplication depth and optimize the performance of HE based GCN inference.
LinGCN is structured around three key elements: (1) A differentiable structural
linearization algorithm, complemented by a parameterized discrete indicator
function, co-trained with model weights to meet the optimization goal. This
strategy promotes fine-grained node-level non-linear location selection,
resulting in a model with minimized multiplication depth. (2) A compact
node-wise polynomial replacement policy with a second-order trainable
activation function, steered towards superior convergence by a two-level
distillation approach from an all-ReLU based teacher model. (3) an enhanced HE
solution that enables finer-grained operator fusion for node-wise activation
functions, further reducing multiplication level consumption in HE-based
inference. Our experiments on the NTU-XVIEW skeleton joint dataset reveal that
LinGCN excels in latency, accuracy, and scalability for homomorphically
encrypted inference, outperforming solutions such as CryptoGCN. Remarkably,
LinGCN achieves a 14.2x latency speedup relative to CryptoGCN, while preserving
an inference accuracy of 75% and notably reducing multiplication depth.]]></summary>

constrained and on-device settings where memory is limited, as it circumvents a
number of problems of end-to-end back-propagation. However, it suffers from a
stagnation problem, whereby early layers overfit and deeper layers stop
increasing the test accuracy after a certain depth. We propose to solve this
issue by introducing a module-wise regularization inspired by the minimizing
movement scheme for gradient flows in distribution space. We call the method
TRGL for Transport Regularized Greedy Learning and study it theoretically,
proving that it leads to greedy modules that are regular and that progressively
solve the task. Experimentally, we show improved accuracy of module-wise
training of various architectures such as ResNets, Transformers and VGG, when
our regularization is added, superior to that of other module-wise training
methods and often to end-to-end training, with as much as 60% less memory

have drawn growing interests in generative modeling. Fueled by its flexibility
in the formulation and strong modeling power of the latent space, recent works
built upon it have made interesting attempts aiming at the interpretability of
text modeling. However, latent space EBMs also inherit some flaws from EBMs in
data space; the degenerate MCMC sampling quality in practice can lead to poor
generation quality and instability in training, especially on data with complex
latent structures. Inspired by the recent efforts that leverage diffusion
recovery likelihood learning as a cure for the sampling issue, we introduce a
novel symbiosis between the diffusion models and latent space EBMs in a
variational learning framework, coined as the latent diffusion energy-based

applications, which allows in-field adaptation and updating, ranging from
accommodating distribution shift, to fine-tuning, and to learning new tasks.
For applications with privacy and low latency requirements, the compute and
memory demands imposed by continual learning can be cost-prohibitive for
resource-constraint edge platforms. Reducing computational precision through
fully quantized training (FQT) simultaneously reduces memory footprint and
increases compute efficiency for both training and inference. However,
aggressive quantization especially integer FQT typically degrades model
accuracy to unacceptable levels. In this paper, we propose a technique that
leverages inexpensive Hadamard transforms to enable low-precision training with
only integer matrix multiplications. We further determine which tensors need
stochastic rounding and propose tiled matrix multiplication to enable low-bit
width accumulators. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique on
several human activity recognition datasets and CIFAR100 in a class incremental
learning setting. We achieve less than 0.5% and 3% accuracy degradation while
we quantize all matrix multiplications inputs down to 4-bits with 8-bit
accumulators.]]></summary>

caused by reliance on spurious cues. Instead of requiring costly changes to
one's data or model training, our method better utilizes the data one already
has by sorting them. Specifically, we rank images within their classes based on
spuriosity (the degree to which common spurious cues are present), proxied via
deep neural features of an interpretable network. With spuriosity rankings, it
is easy to identify minority subpopulations (i.e. low spuriosity images) and
assess model bias as the gap in accuracy between high and low spuriosity
images. One can even efficiently remove a model's bias at little cost to
accuracy by finetuning its classification head on low spuriosity images,
resulting in fairer treatment of samples regardless of spuriosity. We
demonstrate our method on ImageNet, annotating $5000$ class-feature
dependencies ($630$ of which we find to be spurious) and generating a dataset
of $325k$ soft segmentations for these features along the way. Having computed
spuriosity rankings via the identified spurious neural features, we assess
biases for $89$ diverse models and find that class-wise biases are highly
correlated across models. Our results suggest that model bias due to spurious
feature reliance is influenced far more by what the model is trained on than

computer vision, likely due to its broad set of applications ranging from
product fault detection on industrial production lines and impending event
detection in video surveillance to finding lesions in medical scans. Regardless
of the domain, anomaly detection is typically framed as a one-class
classification task, where the learning is conducted on normal examples only.
An entire family of successful anomaly detection methods is based on learning
to reconstruct masked normal inputs (e.g. patches, future frames, etc.) and
exerting the magnitude of the reconstruction error as an indicator for the
abnormality level. Unlike other reconstruction-based methods, we present a
novel self-supervised masked convolutional transformer block (SSMCTB) that
comprises the reconstruction-based functionality at a core architectural level.
The proposed self-supervised block is extremely flexible, enabling information
masking at any layer of a neural network and being compatible with a wide range
of neural architectures. In this work, we extend our previous self-supervised
predictive convolutional attentive block (SSPCAB) with a 3D masked
convolutional layer, a transformer for channel-wise attention, as well as a
novel self-supervised objective based on Huber loss. Furthermore, we show that
our block is applicable to a wider variety of tasks, adding anomaly detection
in medical images and thermal videos to the previously considered tasks based
on RGB images and surveillance videos. We exhibit the generality and
flexibility of SSMCTB by integrating it into multiple state-of-the-art neural
models for anomaly detection, bringing forth empirical results that confirm
considerable performance improvements on five benchmarks. We release our code
and data as open source at: https://github.com/ristea/ssmctb.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A robot self-model is a task-agnostic representation of the robot's physical
morphology that can be used for motion planning tasks in absence of classical
geometric kinematic models. In particular, when the latter are hard to engineer
or the robot's kinematics change unexpectedly, human-free self-modeling is a
necessary feature of truly autonomous agents. In this work, we leverage neural
fields to allow a robot to self-model its kinematics as a neural-implicit query
model learned only from 2D images annotated with camera poses and
configurations. This enables significantly greater applicability than existing
approaches which have been dependent on depth images or geometry knowledge. To
this end, alongside a curricular data sampling strategy, we propose a new
encoder-based neural density field architecture for dynamic object-centric
scenes conditioned on high numbers of degrees of freedom (DOFs). In a 7-DOF
robot test setup, the learned self-model achieves a Chamfer-L2 distance of 2%
of the robot's workspace dimension. We demonstrate the capabilities of this
model on a motion planning task as an exemplary downstream application.]]></summary>

solving sequential decision-making problems. In finite-time horizons such
problems are relevant for instance for optimal stopping or specific supply
chain problems, but also in the training of large language models. In contrast
to infinite horizon MDPs optimal policies are not stationary, policies must be
learned for every single epoch. In practice all parameters are often trained
simultaneously, ignoring the inherent structure suggested by dynamic
programming. This paper introduces a combination of dynamic programming and
policy gradient called dynamic policy gradient, where the parameters are
trained backwards in time. For the tabular softmax parametrisation we carry out
the convergence analysis for simultaneous and dynamic policy gradient towards
global optima, both in the exact and sampled gradient settings without
regularisation. It turns out that the use of dynamic policy gradient training
much better exploits the structure of finite-time problems which is reflected
in improved convergence bounds.]]></summary>

similarity (STS) tasks, which are crucial components in Large Language Model
(LLM) applications. However, a common challenge existing text embedding models
face is the problem of vanishing gradients, primarily due to their reliance on
the cosine function in the optimization objective, which has saturation zones.
To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel angle-optimized text
embedding model called AnglE. The core idea of AnglE is to introduce angle
optimization in a complex space. This novel approach effectively mitigates the
adverse effects of the saturation zone in the cosine function, which can impede
gradient and hinder optimization processes. To set up a comprehensive STS
evaluation, we experimented on existing short-text STS datasets and a newly
collected long-text STS dataset from GitHub Issues. Furthermore, we examine
domain-specific STS scenarios with limited labeled data and explore how AnglE
works with LLM-annotated data. Extensive experiments were conducted on various
tasks including short-text STS, long-text STS, and domain-specific STS tasks.
The results show that AnglE outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) STS models
that ignore the cosine saturation zone. These findings demonstrate the ability
of AnglE to generate high-quality text embeddings and the usefulness of angle
optimization in STS.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Differentiable logics (DL) have recently been proposed as a method of
training neural networks to satisfy logical specifications. A DL consists of a
syntax in which specifications are stated and an interpretation function that
translates expressions in the syntax into loss functions. These loss functions
can then be used during training with standard gradient descent algorithms. The
variety of existing DLs and the differing levels of formality with which they
are treated makes a systematic comparative study of their properties and
implementations difficult. This paper remedies this problem by suggesting a
meta-language for defining DLs that we call the Logic of Differentiable Logics,
or LDL. Syntactically, it generalises the syntax of existing DLs to FOL, and
for the first time introduces the formalism for reasoning about vectors and
learners. Semantically, it introduces a general interpretation function that
can be instantiated to define loss functions arising from different existing
DLs. We use LDL to establish several theoretical properties of existing DLs,
and to conduct their empirical study in neural network verification.]]></summary>

evaluation scores across replicated model training runs -- is affected by
several sources of nondeterminism which can be regarded as measurement noise.
Current tendencies to remove noise in order to enforce reproducibility of
research results neglect inherent nondeterminism at the implementation level
and disregard crucial interaction effects between algorithmic noise factors and
data properties. This limits the scope of conclusions that can be drawn from
such experiments. Instead of removing noise, we propose to incorporate several
sources of variance, including their interaction with data properties, into an
analysis of significance and reliability of machine learning evaluation, with
the aim to draw inferences beyond particular instances of trained models. We
show how to use linear mixed effects models (LMEMs) to analyze performance
evaluation scores, and to conduct statistical inference with a generalized
likelihood ratio test (GLRT). This allows us to incorporate arbitrary sources
of noise like meta-parameter variations into statistical significance testing,
and to assess performance differences conditional on data properties.
Furthermore, a variance component analysis (VCA) enables the analysis of the
contribution of noise sources to overall variance and the computation of a
reliability coefficient by the ratio of substantial to total variance.]]></summary>

patient health risk prediction. However, existing methods usually revolve
around the algorithm design while overlooking the significance of data
engineering. Medical tabular datasets frequently exhibit significant
heterogeneity across different sources, with limited sample sizes per source.
As such, previous predictors are often trained on manually curated small
datasets that struggle to generalize across different tabular datasets during
inference. This paper proposes to scale medical tabular data predictors
(MediTab) to various tabular inputs with varying features. The method uses a
data engine that leverages large language models (LLMs) to consolidate tabular
samples to overcome the barrier across tables with distinct schema. It also
aligns out-domain data with the target task using a "learn, annotate, and
refinement" pipeline. The expanded training data then enables the pre-trained
MediTab to infer for arbitrary tabular input in the domain without fine-tuning,
resulting in significant improvements over supervised baselines: it reaches an
average ranking of 1.57 and 1.00 on 7 patient outcome prediction datasets and 3
trial outcome prediction datasets, respectively. In addition, MediTab exhibits
impressive zero-shot performances: it outperforms supervised XGBoost models by
8.9% and 17.2% on average in two prediction tasks, respectively. The code is

models (LMs) and for stacking them into pipelines that solve complex tasks.
Unfortunately, existing LM pipelines are typically implemented using hard-coded
"prompt templates", i.e. lengthy strings discovered via trial and error. Toward
a more systematic approach for developing and optimizing LM pipelines, we
introduce DSPy, a programming model that abstracts LM pipelines as text
transformation graphs, i.e. imperative computational graphs where LMs are
invoked through declarative modules. DSPy modules are parameterized, meaning
they can learn (by creating and collecting demonstrations) how to apply
compositions of prompting, finetuning, augmentation, and reasoning techniques.
We design a compiler that will optimize any DSPy pipeline to maximize a given
metric. We conduct two case studies, showing that succinct DSPy programs can
express and optimize sophisticated LM pipelines that reason about math word
problems, tackle multi-hop retrieval, answer complex questions, and control
agent loops. Within minutes of compiling, a few lines of DSPy allow GPT-3.5 and
llama2-13b-chat to self-bootstrap pipelines that outperform standard few-shot
prompting (generally by over 25% and 65%, respectively) and pipelines with
expert-created demonstrations (by up to 5-46% and 16-40%, respectively). On top
of that, DSPy programs compiled to open and relatively small LMs like
770M-parameter T5 and llama2-13b-chat are competitive with approaches that rely
on expert-written prompt chains for proprietary GPT-3.5. DSPy is available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multimodal learning models have become increasingly important as they surpass
single-modality approaches on diverse tasks ranging from question-answering to
autonomous driving. Despite the importance of multimodal learning, existing
efforts focus on NLP applications, where the number of modalities is typically
less than four (audio, video, text, images). However, data inputs in other
domains, such as the medical field, may include X-rays, PET scans, MRIs,
genetic screening, clinical notes, and more, creating a need for both efficient
and accurate information fusion. Many state-of-the-art models rely on pairwise
cross-modal attention, which does not scale well for applications with more
than three modalities. For $n$ modalities, computing attention will result in
$n \choose 2$ operations, potentially requiring considerable amounts of
computational resources. To address this, we propose a new domain-neutral
attention mechanism, One-Versus-Others (OvO) attention, that scales linearly
with the number of modalities and requires only $n$ attention operations, thus
offering a significant reduction in computational complexity compared to
existing cross-modal attention algorithms. Using three diverse real-world
datasets as well as an additional simulation experiment, we show that our
method improves performance compared to popular fusion techniques while
decreasing computation costs.]]></summary>

learning model across multiple devices with the help of a central server.
However, data heterogeneity across different devices leads to the client model
drift issue and results in model performance degradation and poor model
fairness. To address the issue, we design Federated learning with global-local
Knowledge Fusion (FedKF) scheme in this paper. The key idea in FedKF is to let
the server return the global knowledge to be fused with the local knowledge in
each training round so that the local model can be regularized towards the
global optima. Therefore, the client model drift issue can be mitigated. In
FedKF, we first propose the active-inactive model aggregation technique that
supports a precise global knowledge representation. Then, we propose a
data-free knowledge distillation (KD) approach to enable each client model to
learn the global knowledge (embedded in the global model) while each client
model can still learn the local knowledge (embedded in the local dataset)
simultaneously, thereby realizing the global-local knowledge fusion process.
The theoretical analysis and intensive experiments demonstrate the superiority
of FedKF over previous solutions.]]></summary>

involves the customization of pre-trained LLMs through further fine-tuning.
Meta's open release of Llama models and OpenAI's APIs for fine-tuning GPT-3.5
Turbo on custom datasets also encourage this practice. But, what are the safety
costs associated with such custom fine-tuning? We note that while existing
safety alignment infrastructures can restrict harmful behaviors of LLMs at
inference time, they do not cover safety risks when fine-tuning privileges are
extended to end-users. Our red teaming studies find that the safety alignment
of LLMs can be compromised by fine-tuning with only a few adversarially
designed training examples. For instance, we jailbreak GPT-3.5 Turbo's safety
guardrails by fine-tuning it on only 10 such examples at a cost of less than
$0.20 via OpenAI's APIs, making the model responsive to nearly any harmful
instructions. Disconcertingly, our research also reveals that, even without
malicious intent, simply fine-tuning with benign and commonly used datasets can
also inadvertently degrade the safety alignment of LLMs, though to a lesser
extent. These findings suggest that fine-tuning aligned LLMs introduces new
safety risks that current safety infrastructures fall short of addressing --
even if a model's initial safety alignment is impeccable, it is not necessarily
to be maintained after custom fine-tuning. We outline and critically analyze
potential mitigations and advocate for further research efforts toward
reinforcing safety protocols for the custom fine-tuning of aligned LLMs.]]></summary>

increasing network depth leads to homogeneous node representations. While
previous work has established that Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)
exponentially lose expressive power, it remains controversial whether the graph
attention mechanism can mitigate oversmoothing. In this work, we provide a
definitive answer to this question through a rigorous mathematical analysis, by
viewing attention-based GNNs as nonlinear time-varying dynamical systems and
incorporating tools and techniques from the theory of products of inhomogeneous
matrices and the joint spectral radius. We establish that, contrary to popular
belief, the graph attention mechanism cannot prevent oversmoothing and loses
expressive power exponentially. The proposed framework extends the existing
results on oversmoothing for symmetric GCNs to a significantly broader class of
GNN models, including random walk GCNs, Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and
(graph) transformers. In particular, our analysis accounts for asymmetric,
state-dependent and time-varying aggregation operators and a wide range of
common nonlinear activation functions, such as ReLU, LeakyReLU, GELU and SiLU.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unsupervised anomaly segmentation aims to detect patterns that are distinct
from any patterns processed during training, commonly called abnormal or
out-of-distribution patterns, without providing any associated manual
segmentations. Since anomalies during deployment can lead to model failure,
detecting the anomaly can enhance the reliability of models, which is valuable
in high-risk domains like medical imaging. This paper introduces Masked
Modality Cycles with Conditional Diffusion (MMCCD), a method that enables
segmentation of anomalies across diverse patterns in multimodal MRI. The method
is based on two fundamental ideas. First, we propose the use of cyclic modality
translation as a mechanism for enabling abnormality detection.
Image-translation models learn tissue-specific modality mappings, which are
characteristic of tissue physiology. Thus, these learned mappings fail to
translate tissues or image patterns that have never been encountered during
training, and the error enables their segmentation. Furthermore, we combine
image translation with a masked conditional diffusion model, which attempts to
`imagine' what tissue exists under a masked area, further exposing unknown
patterns as the generative model fails to recreate them. We evaluate our method
on a proxy task by training on healthy-looking slices of BraTS2021
multi-modality MRIs and testing on slices with tumors. We show that our method
compares favorably to previous unsupervised approaches based on image
reconstruction and denoising with autoencoders and diffusion models.]]></summary>

as conditional branches pose challenges to mathematical optimization methods
that assume a degree of smoothness in the objective function's response
surface. Smooth interpretation (SI) is a form of abstract interpretation that
approximates the convolution of a program's output with a Gaussian kernel, thus
smoothing its output in a principled manner. Here, we combine SI with automatic
differentiation (AD) to efficiently compute gradients of smoothed programs. In
contrast to AD across a regular program execution, these gradients also capture
the effects of alternative control flow paths. The combination of SI with AD
enables the direct gradient-based parameter synthesis for branching programs,
allowing for instance the calibration of simulation models or their combination
with neural network models in machine learning pipelines. We detail the effects
of the approximations made for tractability in SI and propose a novel Monte
Carlo estimator that avoids the underlying assumptions by estimating the
smoothed programs' gradients through a combination of AD and sampling. Using
DiscoGrad, our tool for automatically translating simple C++ programs to a
smooth differentiable form, we perform an extensive evaluation. We compare the
combination of SI with AD and our Monte Carlo estimator to existing
gradient-free and stochastic methods on four non-trivial and originally
discontinuous problems ranging from classical simulation-based optimization to
neural network-driven control. While the optimization progress with the
SI-based estimator depends on the complexity of the programs' control flow, our
Monte Carlo estimator is competitive in all problems, exhibiting the fastest

network surrogate model using multi-fidelity information. Given an inexpensive
low-fidelity and an expensive high-fidelity computational model, we present a
residual multi-fidelity computational framework that formulates the correlation
between models as a residual function, a possibly non-linear mapping between 1)
the shared input space of the models together with the low-fidelity model
output and 2) the discrepancy between the two model outputs. To accomplish
this, we train two neural networks to work in concert. The first network learns
the residual function on a small set of high-fidelity and low-fidelity data.
Once trained, this network is used to generate additional synthetic
high-fidelity data, which is used in the training of a second network. This
second network, once trained, acts as our surrogate for the high-fidelity
quantity of interest. We present three numerical examples to demonstrate the
power of the proposed framework. In particular, we show that dramatic savings
in computational cost may be achieved when the output predictions are desired
to be accurate within small tolerances.]]></summary>

systems is acquiring high-quality images across different patients. The proper
orientation of the robotized probe plays a crucial role in governing the
quality of ultrasound images. To address this challenge, we propose a
sample-efficient method to automatically adjust the orientation of the
ultrasound probe normal to the point of contact on the scanning surface,
thereby improving the acoustic coupling of the probe and resulting image
quality. Our method utilizes Bayesian Optimization (BO) based search on the
scanning surface to efficiently search for the normalized probe orientation. We
formulate a novel objective function for BO that leverages the contact force
measurements and underlying mechanics to identify the normal. We further
incorporate a regularization scheme in BO to handle the noisy objective
function. The performance of the proposed strategy has been assessed through
experiments on urinary bladder phantoms. These phantoms included planar,
tilted, and rough surfaces, and were examined using both linear and convex
probes with varying search space limits. Further, simulation-based studies have
been carried out using 3D human mesh models. The results demonstrate that the
mean ($\pm$SD) absolute angular error averaged over all phantoms and 3D models
is $\boldsymbol{2.4\pm0.7^\circ}$ and $\boldsymbol{2.1\pm1.3^\circ}$,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A prominent theory of affective response to music revolves around the
concepts of surprisal and expectation. In prior work, this idea has been
operationalized in the form of probabilistic models of music which allow for
precise computation of song (or note-by-note) probabilities, conditioned on a
'training set' of prior musical or cultural experiences. To date, however,
these models have been limited to compute exact probabilities through
hand-crafted features or restricted to linear models which are likely not
sufficient to represent the complex conditional distributions present in music.
In this work, we propose to use modern deep probabilistic generative models in
the form of a Diffusion Model to compute an approximate likelihood of a musical
input sequence. Unlike prior work, such a generative model parameterized by
deep neural networks is able to learn complex non-linear features directly from
a training set itself. In doing so, we expect to find that such models are able
to more accurately represent the 'surprisal' of music for human listeners. From
the literature, it is known that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship
between surprisal and the amount human subjects 'like' a given song. In this
work we show that pre-trained diffusion models indeed yield musical surprisal
values which exhibit a negative quadratic relationship with measured subject
'liking' ratings, and that the quality of this relationship is competitive with
state of the art methods such as IDyOM. We therefore present this model a
preliminary step in developing modern deep generative models of music
expectation and subjective likability.]]></summary>

area. In this work, we formulate the versatile safe RL problem and consider two
primary requirements: training efficiency and zero-shot adaptation capability.
To address them, we introduce the Conditioned Constrained Policy Optimization
(CCPO) framework, consisting of two key modules: (1) Versatile Value Estimation
(VVE) for approximating value functions under unseen threshold conditions, and
(2) Conditioned Variational Inference (CVI) for encoding arbitrary constraint
thresholds during policy optimization. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that CCPO outperforms the baselines in terms of safety and task performance
while preserving zero-shot adaptation capabilities to different constraint
thresholds data-efficiently. This makes our approach suitable for real-world

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A key limitation preventing the wider adoption of autonomous agents trained
via deep reinforcement learning (RL) is their limited ability to generalise to
new environments, even when these share similar characteristics with
environments encountered during training. In this work, we investigate how a
non-uniform sampling strategy of individual environment instances, or levels,
affects the zero-shot generalisation (ZSG) ability of RL agents, considering
two failure modes: overfitting and over-generalisation. As a first step, we
measure the mutual information (MI) between the agent's internal representation
and the set of training levels, which we find to be well-correlated to instance
overfitting. In contrast to uniform sampling, adaptive sampling strategies
prioritising levels based on their value loss are more effective at maintaining
lower MI, which provides a novel theoretical justification for this class of
techniques. We then turn our attention to unsupervised environment design (UED)
methods, which adaptively generate new training levels and minimise MI more
effectively than methods sampling from a fixed set. However, we find UED
methods significantly shift the training distribution, resulting in
over-generalisation and worse ZSG performance over the distribution of
interest. To prevent both instance overfitting and over-generalisation, we
introduce self-supervised environment design (SSED). SSED generates levels
using a variational autoencoder, effectively reducing MI while minimising the
shift with the distribution of interest, and leads to statistically significant
improvements in ZSG over fixed-set level sampling strategies and UED methods.]]></summary>

crucial for organizations. Synthetic data generation is one solution, producing

across multiple clients in a federated manner. In this work, we initiate the
study of federated synthetic tabular data generation. Building upon a SOTA
central method known as AIM, we present DistAIM and FLAIM. We show it is
straightforward to distribute AIM, extending a recent approach based on secure
multi-party computation which necessitates additional overhead, making it less
suited to federated scenarios. We then demonstrate that naively federating AIM
can lead to substantial degradation in utility under the presence of
heterogeneity. To mitigate both issues, we propose an augmented FLAIM approach
that maintains a private proxy of heterogeneity. We simulate our methods across
a range of benchmark datasets under different degrees of heterogeneity and show

verifying if a string satisfies the rules requires dynamic programming. We
construct synthetic data and demonstrate that even for difficult (long and

near-perfect accuracy and impressive diversity.

More importantly, we delve into the physical principles behind how
transformers learns CFGs. We discover that the hidden states within the
transformer implicitly and precisely encode the CFG structure (such as putting
tree node information exactly on the subtree boundary), and learn to form
"boundary to boundary" attentions resembling dynamic programming. We also cover
some extension of CFGs as well as the robustness aspect of transformers against

an e-process in the canonical data filtration. These are respectively obtained
by swapping Lai's flat mixture for a Gaussian mixture, and swapping the right
Haar mixture over $\sigma$ with the maximum likelihood estimate under the null,
as done in universal inference. We also analyze the width of resulting

damage an adversary can exact on the network. However, the cascading impact of
such attacks is often overlooked, even though cascades are one of the primary
causes of large-scale blackouts. This paper explores modifications of
transmission line protection settings as candidates for adversarial attacks,
which can remain undetectable as long as the network equilibrium state remains
unaltered. This forms the basis of a black-box function in a Bayesian
optimization procedure, where the objective is to find protection settings that
maximize network degradation due to cascading. Notably, our proposed method is
agnostic to the choice of the cascade simulator and its underlying assumptions.
Numerical experiments reveal that, against conventional wisdom, maximally
misconfiguring the protection settings of all network lines does not cause the
most cascading. More surprisingly, even when the degree of misconfiguration is
limited due to resource constraints, it is still possible to find settings that
produce cascades comparable in severity to instances where there are no

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
performing a range of instruction following tasks in few and zero-shot
settings. However, teaching LLMs to perform tasks on the web presents
fundamental challenges -- combinatorially large open-world tasks and variations
across web interfaces. We tackle these challenges by leveraging LLMs to
decompose web tasks into a collection of sub-tasks, each of which can be solved
by a low-level, closed-loop policy. These policies constitute a shared grammar
across tasks, i.e., new web tasks can be expressed as a composition of these
policies. We propose a novel framework, Hierarchical Policies for Web Actions
using LLMs (HeaP), that learns a set of hierarchical LLM prompts from
demonstrations for planning high-level tasks and executing them via a sequence
of low-level policies. We evaluate HeaP against a range of baselines on a suite
of web tasks, including MiniWoB++, WebArena, a mock airline CRM, as well as
live website interactions, and show that it is able to outperform prior works
using orders of magnitude less data.]]></summary>

activities. Researchers have achieved promising results in leveraging ECGs in
clinical applications with deep learning models. However, the mainstream deep
learning approaches usually neglect the periodic and formative attribute of the
ECG heartbeat waveform. In this work, we propose a novel ECG-Segment based
Learning (ECG-SL) framework to explicitly model the periodic nature of ECG
signals. More specifically, ECG signals are first split into heartbeat
segments, and then structural features are extracted from each of the segments.
Based on the structural features, a temporal model is designed to learn the
temporal information for various clinical tasks. Further, due to the fact that
massive ECG signals are available but the labeled data are very limited, we
also explore self-supervised learning strategy to pre-train the models,
resulting significant improvement for downstream tasks. The proposed method
outperforms the baseline model and shows competitive performances compared with
task-specific methods in three clinical applications: cardiac condition
diagnosis, sleep apnea detection, and arrhythmia classification. Further, we
find that the ECG-SL tends to focus more on each heartbeat's peak and ST range
than ResNet by visualizing the saliency maps.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Peptides are formed by the dehydration condensation of multiple amino acids.
The primary structure of a peptide can be represented either as an amino acid
sequence or as a molecular graph consisting of atoms and chemical bonds.
Previous studies have indicated that deep learning routes specific to
sequential and graphical peptide forms exhibit comparable performance on
downstream tasks. Despite the fact that these models learn representations of
the same modality of peptides, we find that they explain their predictions
differently. Considering sequential and graphical models as two experts making
inferences from different perspectives, we work on fusing expert knowledge to
enrich the learned representations for improving the discriminative
performance. To achieve this, we propose a peptide co-modeling method, RepCon,
which employs a contrastive learning-based framework to enhance the mutual
information of representations from decoupled sequential and graphical
end-to-end models. It considers representations from the sequential encoder and
the graphical encoder for the same peptide sample as a positive pair and learns
to enhance the consistency of representations between positive sample pairs and
to repel representations between negative pairs. Empirical studies of RepCon
and other co-modeling methods are conducted on open-source discriminative
datasets, including aggregation propensity, retention time, antimicrobial
peptide prediction, and family classification from Peptide Database. Our
results demonstrate the superiority of the co-modeling approach over
independent modeling, as well as the superiority of RepCon over other methods
under the co-modeling framework. In addition, the attribution on RepCon further
corroborates the validity of the approach at the level of model explanation.]]></summary>

Our approach uses a state-of-the-art adverse weather detection network to
filter out spray from the LiDAR point cloud, which is then used as input for
the object detector. In this way, the detected objects are less affected by the
adverse weather in the scene, resulting in a more accurate perception of the

radar targets to further filter false positive detections. Tests on real-world

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Owing to the prohibitive costs of generating large amounts of labeled data,
programmatic weak supervision is a growing paradigm within machine learning. In
this setting, users design heuristics that provide noisy labels for subsets of
the data. These weak labels are combined (typically via a graphical model) to
form pseudolabels, which are then used to train a downstream model. In this
work, we question a foundational premise of the typical weakly supervised
learning pipeline: given that the heuristic provides all ``label" information,
why do we need to generate pseudolabels at all? Instead, we propose to directly
transform the heuristics themselves into corresponding loss functions that
penalize differences between our model and the heuristic. By constructing
losses directly from the heuristics, we can incorporate more information than
is used in the standard weakly supervised pipeline, such as how the heuristics
make their decisions, which explicitly informs feature selection during
training. We call our method Losses over Labels (LoL) as it creates losses
directly from heuristics without going through the intermediate step of a
label. We show that LoL improves upon existing weak supervision methods on
several benchmark text and image classification tasks and further demonstrate
that incorporating gradient information leads to better performance on almost
every task.]]></summary>

reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), may not universally suit
diverse human preferences. Recent approaches therefore opt for customization by
collecting multi-dimensional feedback and creating distinct rewards for each
dimension (e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness, honesty). LMs can then be tailored
to different preferences using multi-objective RL (MORL) with different reward
weightings. Yet, RL fine-tuning is unstable and resource-heavy, especially for
MORLHF with diverse and usually conflicting objectives. In this paper, we
present Multi-Objective Direct Preference Optimization (MODPO), an RL-free
algorithm that extends Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for multiple
alignment objectives. Essentially, MODPO trains different LMs to represent
different collective reward models that combine all objectives with specific
weightings. With a simple cross-entropy loss, the LMs optimized against the
MODPO objective are analytically the exact solutions of the original MORLHF
objective. Empirical results in safety alignment and long-form question
answering confirm that MODPO matches or outperforms existing methods,
efficiently producing a Pareto-optimal set of LMs that cater to diverse
preferences with 3 times less computational resources compared with MORLHF.]]></summary>

Feedback (RLHF) to align large language models. Open-source preference datasets
and reward models have enabled wider experimentation beyond generic chat
settings, particularly to make systems more "helpful" for tasks like web
question answering, summarization, and multi-turn dialogue. When optimizing for
helpfulness, RLHF has been consistently observed to drive models to produce
longer outputs. This paper demonstrates that optimizing for response length is
a significant factor behind RLHF's reported improvements in these settings.
First, we study the relationship between reward and length for reward models
trained on three open-source preference datasets for helpfulness. Here, length
correlates strongly with reward, and improvements in reward score are driven in
large part by shifting the distribution over output lengths. We then explore
interventions during both RL and reward model learning to see if we can achieve
the same downstream improvements as RLHF without increasing length. While our
interventions mitigate length increases, they aren't uniformly effective across
settings. Furthermore, we find that even running RLHF with a reward based
solely on length can reproduce most of the downstream improvements over the
initial policy model, showing that reward models in these settings have a long
way to go.]]></summary>

studies. To comprehensively explore their behaviors in FL, we study their
excess risks, including the joint analysis of both optimization and
generalization. We prove that on smooth non-convex objectives, 1) centralized

perspectives of the excess risk and test error in CFL, adopting partial
participation is superior to full participation; and, 3) there is a necessary
requirement for the topology in DFL to avoid performance collapse as the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A broad current application of algorithms is in formal and quantitative
measures of murky concepts -- like merit -- to make decisions. When people
strategically respond to these sorts of evaluations in order to gain favorable
decision outcomes, their behavior can be subjected to moral judgments. They may
be described as 'gaming the system' or 'cheating,' or (in other cases)
investing 'honest effort' or 'improving.' Machine learning literature on
strategic behavior has tried to describe these dynamics by emphasizing the
efforts expended by decision subjects hoping to obtain a more favorable
assessment -- some works offer ways to preempt or prevent such manipulations,
some differentiate 'gaming' from 'improvement' behavior, while others aim to
measure the effort burden or disparate effects of classification systems. We
begin from a different starting point: that the design of an evaluation itself
can be understood as furthering goals held by the evaluator which may be
misaligned with broader societal goals. To develop the idea that evaluation
represents a strategic interaction in which both the evaluator and the subject
of their evaluation are operating out of self-interest, we put forward a model
that represents the process of evaluation using three interacting agents: a
decision subject, an evaluator, and society, representing a bundle of values
and oversight mechanisms. We highlight our model's applicability to a number of
social systems where one or two players strategically undermine the others'
interests to advance their own. Treating evaluators as themselves strategic
allows us to re-cast the scrutiny directed at decision subjects, towards the
incentives that underpin institutional designs of evaluations. The moral
standing of strategic behaviors often depend on the moral standing of the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Data-driven constitutive modeling with neural networks has received increased
interest in recent years due to its ability to easily incorporate physical and
mechanistic constraints and to overcome the challenging and time-consuming task
of formulating phenomenological constitutive laws that can accurately capture
the observed material response. However, even though neural network-based
constitutive laws have been shown to generalize proficiently, the generated
representations are not easily interpretable due to their high number of
trainable parameters. Sparse regression approaches exist that allow to
obtaining interpretable expressions, but the user is tasked with creating a
library of model forms which by construction limits their expressiveness to the
functional forms provided in the libraries. In this work, we propose to train
regularized physics-augmented neural network-based constitutive models
utilizing a smoothed version of $L^{0}$-regularization. This aims to maintain
the trustworthiness inherited by the physical constraints, but also enables
interpretability which has not been possible thus far on any type of machine
learning-based constitutive model where model forms were not assumed a-priory
but were actually discovered. During the training process, the network
simultaneously fits the training data and penalizes the number of active
parameters, while also ensuring constitutive constraints such as thermodynamic
consistency. We show that the method can reliably obtain interpretable and
trustworthy constitutive models for compressible and incompressible
hyperelasticity, yield functions, and hardening models for elastoplasticity,
for synthetic and experimental data.]]></summary>

increases. To tackle both challenges we propose a novel generalized graph
autoencoder architecture, designed to extract powerful and robust node

the graphs and can achieve more accurate alignment compared to classical

impressive results on image super-resolution (SR) tasks. However, due to the
randomness introduced in the reverse process of diffusion models, the
performances of diffusion-based SR models are fluctuating at every time of
sampling, especially for samplers with few resampled steps. This inherent
randomness of diffusion models results in ineffectiveness and instability,
making it challenging for users to guarantee the quality of SR results.
However, our work takes this randomness as an opportunity: fully analyzing and
leveraging it leads to the construction of an effective plug-and-play sampling
method that owns the potential to benefit a series of diffusion-based SR
methods. More in detail, we propose to steadily sample high-quality SR images
from pre-trained diffusion-based SR models by solving diffusion ordinary
differential equations (diffusion ODEs) with optimal boundary conditions (BCs)
and analyze the characteristics between the choices of BCs and their
corresponding SR results. Our analysis shows the route to obtain an
approximately optimal BC via an efficient exploration in the whole space. The
quality of SR results sampled by the proposed method with fewer steps
outperforms the quality of results sampled by current methods with randomness
from the same pre-trained diffusion-based SR model, which means that our
sampling method "boosts" current diffusion-based SR models without any
additional training.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Due to the large-scale availability of data, machine learning (ML) algorithms
are being deployed in distributed topologies, where different nodes collaborate
to train ML models over their individual data by exchanging model-related
information (e.g., gradients) with a central server. However, distributed
learning schemes are notably vulnerable to two threats. First, Byzantine nodes
can single-handedly corrupt the learning by sending incorrect information to
the server, e.g., erroneous gradients. The standard approach to mitigate such
behavior is to use a non-linear robust aggregation method at the server.
Second, the server can violate the privacy of the nodes. Recent attacks have
shown that exchanging (unencrypted) gradients enables a curious server to
recover the totality of the nodes' data. The use of homomorphic encryption
(HE), a gold standard security primitive, has extensively been studied as a
privacy-preserving solution to distributed learning in non-Byzantine scenarios.
However, due to HE's large computational demand especially for high-dimensional
ML models, there has not yet been any attempt to design purely homomorphic
operators for non-linear robust aggregators. In this work, we present SABLE,
the first completely homomorphic and Byzantine robust distributed learning
algorithm. SABLE essentially relies on a novel plaintext encoding method that
enables us to implement the robust aggregator over batching-friendly BGV.
Moreover, this encoding scheme also accelerates state-of-the-art homomorphic
sorting with larger security margins and smaller ciphertext size. We perform
extensive experiments on image classification tasks and show that our algorithm
achieves practical execution times while matching the ML performance of its
non-private counterpart.]]></summary>

and societal importance. Data-driven approaches have emerged as a widely used
solution for addressing this challenge. However, solely relying on data-driven
approaches has limitations in modeling the underlying physics, making accurate
predictions difficult. Coupling AI-based post-processing techniques with
traditional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) methods offers a more effective
solution for improving forecasting accuracy. Despite previous post-processing
efforts, accurately predicting heavy rainfall remains challenging due to the
imbalanced precipitation data across locations and complex relationships
between multiple meteorological variables. To address these limitations, we
introduce the PostRainBench, a comprehensive multi-variable NWP post-processing
benchmark consisting of three datasets for NWP post-processing-based
precipitation forecasting. We propose CAMT, a simple yet effective Channel
Attention Enhanced Multi-task Learning framework with a specially designed
weighted loss function. Its flexible design allows for easy plug-and-play
integration with various backbones. Extensive experimental results on the
proposed benchmark show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by
6.3%, 4.7%, and 26.8% in rain CSI on the three datasets respectively. Most
notably, our model is the first deep learning-based method to outperform
traditional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) approaches in extreme
precipitation conditions. It shows improvements of 15.6%, 17.4%, and 31.8% over
NWP predictions in heavy rain CSI on respective datasets. These results
highlight the potential impact of our model in reducing the severe consequences
of extreme weather events.]]></summary>

framework for solving competitive games, where each agent optimizes policy by
treating others as part of the environment. Despite the empirical successes,
the theoretical properties of SP-based methods are limited to two-player
zero-sum games. However, for mixed cooperative-competitive games where agents
on the same team need to cooperate with each other, we can show a simple
counter-example where SP-based methods cannot converge to a global Nash
equilibrium (NE) with high probability. Alternatively, Policy-Space Response
Oracles (PSRO) is an iterative framework for learning NE, where the best
responses w.r.t. previous policies are learned in each iteration. PSRO can be
directly extended to mixed cooperative-competitive settings by jointly learning
team best responses with all convergence properties unchanged. However, PSRO
requires repeatedly training joint policies from scratch till convergence,
which makes it hard to scale to complex games. In this work, we develop a novel
algorithm, Fictitious Cross-Play (FXP), which inherits the benefits from both
frameworks. FXP simultaneously trains an SP-based main policy and a counter
population of best response policies. The main policy is trained by fictitious
self-play and cross-play against the counter population, while the counter
policies are trained as the best responses to the main policy's past versions.
We validate our method in matrix games and show that FXP converges to global
NEs while SP methods fail. We also conduct experiments in a gridworld domain,
where FXP achieves higher Elo ratings and lower exploitabilities than
baselines, and a more challenging football game, where FXP defeats SOTA models
with over 94% win rate.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi-objective learning (MOL) problems often arise in emerging machine
learning problems when there are multiple learning criteria, data modalities,
or learning tasks. Different from single-objective learning, one of the
critical challenges in MOL is the potential conflict among different objectives
during the iterative optimization process. Recent works have developed various
dynamic weighting algorithms for MOL such as MGDA and its variants, where the
central idea is to find an update direction that avoids conflicts among
objectives. Albeit its appealing intuition, empirical studies show that dynamic
weighting methods may not always outperform static ones. To understand this
theory-practical gap, we focus on a new stochastic variant of MGDA - the
Multi-objective gradient with Double sampling (MoDo) algorithm, and study the
generalization performance of the dynamic weighting-based MoDo and its
interplay with optimization through the lens of algorithm stability. Perhaps
surprisingly, we find that the key rationale behind MGDA -- updating along
conflict-avoidant direction - may hinder dynamic weighting algorithms from
achieving the optimal ${\cal O}(1/\sqrt{n})$ population risk, where $n$ is the
number of training samples. We further demonstrate the impact of the
variability of dynamic weights on the three-way trade-off among optimization,
generalization, and conflict avoidance that is unique in MOL. We showcase the
generality of our theoretical framework by analyzing other existing stochastic
MOL algorithms under the framework. Experiments on various multi-task learning
benchmarks are performed to demonstrate the practical applicability. Code is

relationships is crucial for flexible interaction with the physical world.
However, most existing physical and causal reasoning benchmarks are exclusively
based on synthetically generated events and synthetic natural language
descriptions of causal relationships. This design brings up two issues. First,
there is a lack of diversity in both event types and natural language
descriptions; second, causal relationships based on manually-defined heuristics
are different from human judgments. To address both shortcomings, we present
the CLEVRER-Humans benchmark, a video reasoning dataset for causal judgment of
physical events with human labels. We employ two techniques to improve data
collection efficiency: first, a novel iterative event cloze task to elicit a
new representation of events in videos, which we term Causal Event Graphs
(CEGs); second, a data augmentation technique based on neural language
generative models. We convert the collected CEGs into questions and answers to
be consistent with prior work. Finally, we study a collection of baseline

for a wide range of tasks. However, deploying these models for inference has
been a significant challenge due to their unprecedented resource requirements.
This has forced existing deployment frameworks to use multi-GPU inference
pipelines, which are often complex and costly, or to use smaller and less
performant models. In this work, we demonstrate that the main bottleneck for
generative inference with LLMs is memory bandwidth, rather than compute,
specifically for single batch inference. While quantization has emerged as a
promising solution by representing model weights with reduced precision,
previous efforts have often resulted in notable performance degradation. To
address this, we introduce SqueezeLLM, a post-training quantization framework
that not only enables lossless compression to ultra-low precisions of up to
3-bit, but also achieves higher quantization performance under the same memory
constraint. Our framework incorporates two novel ideas: (i) sensitivity-based
non-uniform quantization, which searches for the optimal bit precision
assignment based on second-order information; and (ii) the Dense-and-Sparse
decomposition that stores outliers and sensitive weight values in an efficient
sparse format. When applied to the LLaMA models, our 3-bit quantization
significantly reduces the perplexity gap from the FP16 baseline by up to 2.1x
as compared to the state-of-the-art methods with the same memory requirement.
Furthermore, when deployed on an A6000 GPU, our quantized models achieve up to
2.3x speedup compared to the baseline. Our code is open-sourced and available
online.]]></summary>

an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, while still sounding benign to a

fine-tuned with respect to perceptibility and robustness. In this work, we
present an integrated algorithm that uses psychoacoustic models and room
impulse responses (RIR) in the generation step. The RIRs are dynamically
created by a neural network during the generation process to simulate a

in over-the-air attacks. We compare the different approaches in three
experiments: in a simulated environment and in a realistic over-the-air
scenario to evaluate the robustness, and in a human study to evaluate the
perceptibility. Our algorithms considering psychoacoustics only or in addition
to the robustness show an improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative condition that
precedes progressive and irreversible dementia; thus, predicting its
progression over time is vital for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Numerous
studies have implemented structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to model
AD progression, focusing on three integral aspects: (i) temporal variability,
(ii) incomplete observations, and (iii) temporal geometric characteristics.
However, deep learning-based approaches regarding data variability and sparsity
have yet to consider inherent geometrical properties sufficiently. The ordinary
differential equation-based geometric modeling method (ODE-RGRU) has recently
emerged as a promising strategy for modeling time-series data by intertwining a
recurrent neural network and an ODE in Riemannian space. Despite its
achievements, ODE-RGRU encounters limitations when extrapolating positive
definite symmetric metrics from incomplete samples, leading to feature reverse
occurrences that are particularly problematic, especially within the clinical
facet. Therefore, this study proposes a novel geometric learning approach that
models longitudinal MRI biomarkers and cognitive scores by combining three
modules: topological space shift, ODE-RGRU, and trajectory estimation. We have
also developed a training algorithm that integrates manifold mapping with
monotonicity constraints to reflect measurement transition irreversibility. We
verify our proposed method's efficacy by predicting clinical labels and
cognitive scores over time in regular and irregular settings. Furthermore, we
thoroughly analyze our proposed framework through an ablation study.]]></summary>

if human decision-makers comply perfectly with algorithmic decisions. However,
perfect compliance with the algorithm is rarely a reality or even a desirable
outcome in human-AI collaboration. Yet, recent studies have shown that
selective compliance with fair algorithms can amplify discrimination relative
to the prior human policy. As a consequence, ensuring equitable outcomes
requires fundamentally different algorithmic design principles that ensure
robustness to the decision-maker's (a priori unknown) compliance pattern. We
define the notion of compliance-robustly fair algorithmic recommendations that
are guaranteed to (weakly) improve fairness in decisions, regardless of the
human's compliance pattern. We propose a simple optimization strategy to
identify the best performance-improving compliance-robustly fair policy.
However, we show that it may be infeasible to design algorithmic
recommendations that are simultaneously fair in isolation, compliance-robustly
fair, and more accurate than the human policy; thus, if our goal is to improve
the equity and accuracy of human-AI collaboration, it may not be desirable to
enforce traditional fairness constraints.]]></summary>

functionalities. Hence, existing work proposes to decompose an already trained
model into modules, i.e., modularizing-after-training, and enable module reuse.
Since trained models are not built for modularization,
modularizing-after-training incurs huge overhead and model accuracy loss. In
this paper, we propose a novel approach that incorporates modularization into
the model training process, i.e., modularizing-while-training (MwT). We train a
model to be structurally modular through two loss functions that optimize
intra-module cohesion and inter-module coupling. We have implemented the
proposed approach for modularizing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models in
this work. The evaluation results on representative models demonstrate that MwT
outperforms the state-of-the-art approach. Specifically, the accuracy loss
caused by MwT is only 1.13 percentage points, which is 1.76 percentage points
less than that of the baseline. The kernel retention rate of the modules
generated by MwT is only 14.58%, with a reduction of 74.31% over the
state-of-the-art approach. Furthermore, the total time cost required for
training and modularizing is only 108 minutes, half of the baseline.]]></summary>

patient positions has the potential to improve the localisation of tumours
during breast cancer treatment. While learning-based registration methods have
recently become the state-of-the-art approach for most medical image

registration due to certain difficulties-the lack of rich texture information
in breast MR images and the need for the deformations to be diffeomophic. In
this work, we propose learning strategies for breast MR image registration that
are amenable to diffeomorphic constraints, together with early experimental

assessment across multiple domains. Among the methods used for gait analysis,
skeleton-based approaches have shown promise due to their robust and
interpretable features. However, these methods often rely on hand-crafted
spatial-temporal graphs that are based on human anatomy disregarding the
particularities of the dataset and task. This paper proposes a novel method to
simplify the spatial-temporal graph representation for gait-based gender
estimation, improving interpretability without losing performance. Our approach
employs two models, an upstream and a downstream model, that can adjust the
adjacency matrix for each walking instance, thereby removing the fixed nature
of the graph. By employing the Straight-Through Gumbel-Softmax trick, our model
is trainable end-to-end. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on
the CASIA-B dataset for gait-based gender estimation. The resulting graphs are
interpretable and differ qualitatively from fixed graphs used in existing
models. Our research contributes to enhancing the explainability and
task-specific adaptability of gait recognition, promoting more efficient and

learning, optimizing models at edge clients without sharing private data.
Simultaneously, foundation models (FMs) have gained traction in the artificial

their substantial size and intensive resource requirements. This is especially
true when considering the resource heterogeneity in edge FL systems. We present
an adaptive framework for Resource-aware Federated Foundation Models (RaFFM) to
address these challenges. RaFFM introduces specialized model compression
algorithms tailored for FL scenarios, such as salient parameter prioritization
and high-performance subnetwork extraction. These algorithms enable dynamic
scaling of given transformer-based FMs to fit heterogeneous resource
constraints at the network edge during both FL's optimization and deployment
stages. Experimental results demonstrate that RaFFM shows significant
superiority in resource utilization efficiency and uses fewer resources to
deploy FMs to FL. Despite the lower resource consumption, target models
optimized by RaFFM achieve performance on par with traditional FL methods
applied to full-sized FMs. This is evident across tasks in both natural

Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) yields widespread robustness improvement
under domain transfer. Instead of focusing on parameters, however, this work
considers the transferability of representations as the optimization target for
out-of-domain generalization in a fine-tuning setup. To encourage the retention
of transferable representations, we consider trust region-based fine-tuning
methods, which exploit task-specific skills without forgetting task-agnostic
representations from pre-training. We unify parameter- and representation-space
smoothing approaches by using trust region bounds to inform SAM-style
regularizers on both of these optimization surfaces. We propose Trust Region
Aware Minimization (TRAM), a fine-tuning algorithm that optimizes for flat
minima and smooth, informative representations without forgetting pre-trained
structure. We find that TRAM outperforms both sharpness-aware and trust
region-based optimization methods on cross-domain language modeling and
cross-lingual transfer, where robustness to domain transfer and representation
generality are critical for success. TRAM establishes a new standard in

and cost of physical experiments, selected mostly through trial-and-error and
intuition that require deep domain expertise. Numerical simulations present an
alternative to physical experiments but are usually infeasible for complex
real-world domains due to the computational requirements of existing numerical
methods. Artificial intelligence (AI) presents a potential paradigm shift by
developing fast data-driven surrogate models. In particular, an AI framework,
known as neural operators, presents a principled framework for learning
mappings between functions defined on continuous domains, e.g., spatiotemporal
processes and partial differential equations (PDE). They can extrapolate and
predict solutions at new locations unseen during training, i.e., perform
zero-shot super-resolution. Neural operators can augment or even replace
existing simulators in many applications, such as computational fluid dynamics,
weather forecasting, and material modeling, while being 4-5 orders of magnitude
faster. Further, neural operators can be integrated with physics and other
domain constraints enforced at finer resolutions to obtain high-fidelity
solutions and good generalization. Since neural operators are differentiable,
they can directly optimize parameters for inverse design and other inverse
problems. We believe that neural operators present a transformative approach to

visual input using the composition of multiple objects. Representation learning
methods have often used unsupervised learning to segment an input image into
individual objects and encode these objects into each latent vector. However,
it is not clear how previous methods have achieved the appropriate segmentation
of individual objects. Additionally, most of the previous methods regularize
the latent vectors using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Therefore, it is not
clear whether VAE regularization contributes to appropriate object
segmentation. To elucidate the mechanism of object segmentation in multi-object
representation learning, we conducted an ablation study on MONet, which is a
typical method. MONet represents multiple objects using pairs that consist of
an attention mask and the latent vector corresponding to the attention mask.
Each latent vector is encoded from the input image and attention mask. Then,
the component image and attention mask are decoded from each latent vector. The
loss function of MONet consists of 1) the sum of reconstruction losses between
the input image and decoded component image, 2) the VAE regularization loss of
the latent vector, and 3) the reconstruction loss of the attention mask to
explicitly encode shape information. We conducted an ablation study on these
three loss functions to investigate the effect on segmentation performance. Our
results showed that the VAE regularization loss did not affect segmentation
performance and the others losses did affect it. Based on this result, we
hypothesize that it is important to maximize the attention mask of the image
region best represented by a single latent vector corresponding to the
attention mask. We confirmed this hypothesis by evaluating a new loss function
with the same mechanism as the hypothesis.]]></summary>

that can adapt to the context of each participating client, while utilizing
knowledge from a shared global model. Yet, often, personalization requires a
fine-tuning step using clients' labeled data in order to achieve good
performance. This may not be feasible in scenarios where incoming clients are
fresh and/or have privacy concerns. It, then, remains open how one can achieve

method leverages the diversity of the clients to train specialized experts on
different subsets of classes, and a gating function to route the input to the
most relevant expert(s). Our gating function harnesses the knowledge of a
pretrained model common expert to enhance its routing decisions on-the-fly. As
a highlight, our approach can improve accuracy up to 18\% in state of the art

our method can handle non-homogeneous data distributions, scale more

tasks. Inspired by that success, deep learning has been explored in magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction. In particular, integrating deep
learning and model-based optimization methods has shown considerable
advantages. However, a large amount of labeled training data is typically
needed for high reconstruction quality, which is challenging for some MRI
applications. In this paper, we propose a novel reconstruction method, named
DURED-Net, that enables interpretable self-supervised learning for MR image
reconstruction by combining a self-supervised denoising network and a
plug-and-play method. We aim to boost the reconstruction performance of
Noise2Noise in MR reconstruction by adding an explicit prior that utilizes
imaging physics. Specifically, the leverage of a denoising network for MRI
reconstruction is achieved using Regularization by Denoising (RED). Experiment
results demonstrate that the proposed method requires a reduced amount of
training data to achieve high reconstruction quality among the state-of-art of
MR reconstruction utilizing the Noise2Noise method.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep learning models based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance
imaging (rs-fMRI) have been widely used to diagnose brain diseases,
particularly autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Existing studies have leveraged
the functional connectivity (FC) of rs-fMRI, achieving notable classification
performance. However, they have significant limitations, including the lack of
adequate information while using linear low-order FC as inputs to the model,
not considering individual characteristics (i.e., different symptoms or varying
stages of severity) among patients with ASD, and the non-explainability of the
decision process. To cover these limitations, we propose a novel
explainability-guided region of interest (ROI) selection (EAG-RS) framework
that identifies non-linear high-order functional associations among brain
regions by leveraging an explainable artificial intelligence technique and
selects class-discriminative regions for brain disease identification. The
proposed framework includes three steps: (i) inter-regional relation learning
to estimate non-linear relations through random seed-based network masking,
(ii) explainable connection-wise relevance score estimation to explore
high-order relations between functional connections, and (iii) non-linear
high-order FC-based diagnosis-informative ROI selection and classifier learning
to identify ASD. We validated the effectiveness of our proposed method by
conducting experiments using the Autism Brain Imaging Database Exchange (ABIDE)
dataset, demonstrating that the proposed method outperforms other comparative
methods in terms of various evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we qualitatively
analyzed the selected ROIs and identified ASD subtypes linked to previous
neuroscientific studies.]]></summary>

lesions in ultrasound images, but a conspicuous research gap concerning
cervical lymph node lesions still remains. The objective of this work is to
diagnose cervical lymph node lesions in ultrasound images by leveraging a deep
learning model. To this end, we first collected 3392 cervical ultrasound images
containing normal lymph nodes, benign lymph node lesions, malignant primary
lymph node lesions, and malignant metastatic lymph node lesions. Given that
ultrasound images are generated by the reflection and scattering of sound waves
across varied bodily tissues, we proposed the Conv-FFT Block. It integrates
convolutional operations with the fast Fourier transform to more astutely model
the images. Building upon this foundation, we designed a novel architecture,
named SFUSNet. SFUSNet not only discerns variances in ultrasound images from
the spatial domain but also adeptly captures micro-structural alterations
across various lesions in the frequency domain. To ascertain the potential of
SFUSNet, we benchmarked it against 12 popular architectures through five-fold
cross-validation. The results show that SFUSNet is the state-of-the-art model
and can achieve 92.89% accuracy. Moreover, its average precision, average
sensitivity and average specificity for four types of lesions achieve 90.46%,

evaluation benchmarks. However, concerns about their performance are raised on
potential data contamination in their considerable volume of training corpus.
Moreover, the static nature and fixed complexity of current benchmarks may
inadequately gauge the advancing capabilities of LLMs. In this paper, we

including mathematics, logical reasoning, and algorithm problems. We evaluate
various LLMs ranging from Flan-T5-large to ChatGPT and GPT4. Experiments
demonstrate that LLMs perform worse in DyVal-generated evaluation samples with
different complexities, emphasizing the significance of dynamic evaluation. We
also analyze the failure cases and results of different prompting methods.
Moreover, DyVal-generated samples are not only evaluation sets, but also
helpful data for fine-tuning to improve the performance of LLMs on existing
benchmarks. We hope that DyVal can shed light on the future evaluation research

from adversarial training and policy evaluation in reinforcement learning to
AUROC maximization. To address the large-scale data challenges across multiple
clients with communication-efficient distributed training, federated learning
(FL) is gaining popularity. Many optimization algorithms for minimax problems
have been developed in the centralized setting (\emph{i.e.} single-machine).
Nonetheless, the algorithm for minimax problems under FL is still
underexplored. In this paper, we study a class of federated nonconvex minimax
optimization problems. We propose FL algorithms (FedSGDA+ and FedSGDA-M) and
reduce existing complexity results for the most common minimax problems. For
nonconvex-concave problems, we propose FedSGDA+ and reduce the communication
complexity to $O(\varepsilon^{-6})$. Under nonconvex-strongly-concave and
nonconvex-PL minimax settings, we prove that FedSGDA-M has the best-known
sample complexity of $O(\kappa^{3} N^{-1}\varepsilon^{-3})$ and the best-known
communication complexity of $O(\kappa^{2}\varepsilon^{-2})$. FedSGDA-M is the
first algorithm to match the best sample complexity $O(\varepsilon^{-3})$
achieved by the single-machine method under the nonconvex-strongly-concave

an approach to this task within a generalization of the stochastic interpolant
framework, leading to efficient learning algorithms built upon dynamical
transport of measure. Our generative models are defined by velocity and score
fields that can be characterized as the minimizers of simple quadratic
objectives, and they are defined on a simplex that generalizes the time
variable in the usual dynamical transport framework. The resulting transport on
the simplex is influenced by all marginals, and we show that multi-way
correspondences can be extracted. The identification of such correspondences
has applications to style transfer, algorithmic fairness, and data
decorruption. In addition, the multimarginal perspective enables an efficient

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this paper, we introduce a new heuristics for global optimization in
scenarios where extensive evaluations of the cost function are expensive,
inaccessible, or even prohibitive. The method, which we call
Landscape-Sketch-and-Step (LSS), combines Machine Learning, Stochastic
Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning techniques, relying on historical
information from previously sampled points to make judicious choices of
parameter values where the cost function should be evaluated at. Unlike
optimization by Replica Exchange Monte Carlo methods, the number of evaluations
of the cost function required in this approach is comparable to that used by
Simulated Annealing, quality that is especially important in contexts like
high-throughput computing or high-performance computing tasks, where
evaluations are either computationally expensive or take a long time to be
performed. The method also differs from standard Surrogate Optimization
techniques, for it does not construct a surrogate model that aims at
approximating or reconstructing the objective function. We illustrate our
method by applying it to low dimensional optimization problems (dimensions 1,
2, 4, and 8) that mimick known difficulties of minimization on rugged energy
landscapes often seen in Condensed Matter Physics, where cost functions are
rugged and plagued with local minima. When compared to classical Simulated
Annealing, the LSS shows an effective acceleration of the optimization process.]]></summary>

level of MeSH descriptors with several related but distinct biomedical concepts
often grouped together and treated as a single topic. This study proposes a new
method for the automated refinement of subject annotations at the level of MeSH
concepts. Methods: Lacking labelled data, we rely on weak supervision based on
concept occurrence in the abstract of an article, which is also enhanced by
dictionary-based heuristics. In addition, we investigate deep learning
approaches, making design choices to tackle the particular challenges of this
task. The new method is evaluated on a large-scale retrospective scenario,
based on concepts that have been promoted to descriptors. Results: In our
experiments concept occurrence was the strongest heuristic achieving a macro-F1
score of about 0.63 across several labels. The proposed method improved it
further by more than 4pp. Conclusion: The results suggest that concept
occurrence is a strong heuristic for refining the coarse-grained labels at the
level of MeSH concepts and the proposed method improves it further.]]></summary>

opaqueness of neural networks presents a challenge in interpreting the logic
behind their findings. Here, we use a eXplainable-AI (XAI) technique called
$inception$ or $deep$ $dreaming$, which has been invented in machine learning
for computer vision. We use this technique to explore what neural networks
learn about quantum optics experiments. Our story begins by training deep
neural networks on the properties of quantum systems. Once trained, we "invert"
the neural network -- effectively asking how it imagines a quantum system with
a specific property, and how it would continuously modify the quantum system to
change a property. We find that the network can shift the initial distribution
of properties of the quantum system, and we can conceptualize the learned
strategies of the neural network. Interestingly, we find that, in the first
layers, the neural network identifies simple properties, while in the deeper
ones, it can identify complex quantum structures and even quantum entanglement.
This is in reminiscence of long-understood properties known in computer vision,
which we now identify in a complex natural science task. Our approach could be
useful in a more interpretable way to develop new advanced AI-based scientific

it challenging to train and deploy RL-policies in real world robots. Even a
robust policy trained in simulation requires a real-world deployment to assess
their performance. This paper proposes a new approach to evaluate the
real-world performance of agent policies prior to deploying them in the real
world. Our approach incorporates a simulator along with real-world offline data
to evaluate the performance of any policy using the framework of Marginalized
Importance Sampling (MIS). Existing MIS methods face two challenges: (1) large
density ratios that deviate from a reasonable range and (2) indirect
supervision, where the ratio needs to be inferred indirectly, thus exacerbating
estimation error. Our approach addresses these challenges by introducing the
target policy's occupancy in the simulator as an intermediate variable and
learning the density ratio as the product of two terms that can be learned
separately. The first term is learned with direct supervision and the second
term has a small magnitude, thus making it computationally efficient. We
analyze the sample complexity as well as error propagation of our two
step-procedure. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate our approach on Sim2Sim
environments such as Cartpole, Reacher, and Half-Cheetah. Our results show that
our method generalizes well across a variety of Sim2Sim gap, target policies
and offline data collection policies. We also demonstrate the performance of
our algorithm on a Sim2Real task of validating the performance of a 7 DoF
robotic arm using offline data along with the Gazebo simulator.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like generic multi-task learning, continual learning has the nature of
multi-objective optimization, and therefore faces a trade-off between the
performance of different tasks. That is, to optimize for the current task
distribution, it may need to compromise performance on some previous tasks.
This means that there exist multiple models that are Pareto-optimal at
different times, each addressing a distinct task performance trade-off.
Researchers have discussed how to train particular models to address specific
trade-off preferences. However, existing algorithms require training overheads
proportional to the number of preferences -- a large burden when there are
multiple, possibly infinitely many, preferences. As a response, we propose
Imprecise Bayesian Continual Learning (IBCL). Upon a new task, IBCL (1) updates
a knowledge base in the form of a convex hull of model parameter distributions
and (2) obtains particular models to address task trade-off preferences with
zero-shot. That is, IBCL does not require any additional training overhead to
generate preference-addressing models from its knowledge base. We show that
models obtained by IBCL have guarantees in identifying the Pareto optimal
parameters. Moreover, experiments on standard image classification and NLP
tasks support this guarantee. Statistically, IBCL improves average per-task
accuracy by at most 23\% and peak per-task accuracy by at most 15\% with
respect to the baseline methods, with steadily near-zero or positive backward
transfer. Most importantly, IBCL significantly reduces the training overhead
from training 1 model per preference to at most 3 models for all preferences.]]></summary>

(DNNs), wherein adversaries covertly implant malicious behaviors (backdoors)
into DNNs. Our defense falls within the category of post-development defenses
that operate independently of how the model was generated. The proposed defense
is built upon a novel reverse engineering approach that can directly extract
backdoor functionality of a given backdoored model to a backdoor expert model.
The approach is straightforward -- finetuning the backdoored model over a small
set of intentionally mislabeled clean samples, such that it unlearns the normal
functionality while still preserving the backdoor functionality, and thus
resulting in a model (dubbed a backdoor expert model) that can only recognize
backdoor inputs. Based on the extracted backdoor expert model, we show the
feasibility of devising highly accurate backdoor input detectors that filter
out the backdoor inputs during model inference. Further augmented by an
ensemble strategy with a finetuned auxiliary model, our defense, BaDExpert
(Backdoor Input Detection with Backdoor Expert), effectively mitigates 17 SOTA
backdoor attacks while minimally impacting clean utility. The effectiveness of
BaDExpert has been verified on multiple datasets (CIFAR10, GTSRB and ImageNet)

reactive systems. However, DNNs are highly opaque, which renders it difficult
to explain and justify their actions. To mitigate this issue, there has been a
surge of interest in explainable AI (XAI) techniques, capable of pinpointing
the input features that caused the DNN to act as it did. Existing XAI
techniques typically face two limitations: (i) they are heuristic, and do not
provide formal guarantees that the explanations are correct; and (ii) they
often apply to ``one-shot'' systems, where the DNN is invoked independently of
past invocations, as opposed to reactive systems. Here, we begin bridging this
gap, and propose a formal DNN-verification-based XAI technique for reasoning
about multi-step, reactive systems. We suggest methods for efficiently
calculating succinct explanations, by exploiting the system's transition
constraints in order to curtail the search space explored by the underlying
verifier. We evaluate our approach on two popular benchmarks from the domain of
automated navigation; and observe that our methods allow the efficient
computation of minimal and minimum explanations, significantly outperforming
the state of the art. We also demonstrate that our methods produce formal

processing graph-structured input. However, they operate on a fixed input graph
structure, ignoring potential noise and missing information. Furthermore, their
local aggregation mechanism can lead to problems such as over-squashing and
limited expressive power in capturing relevant graph structures. Existing
solutions to these challenges have primarily relied on heuristic methods, often
disregarding the underlying data distribution. Hence, devising principled
approaches for learning to infer graph structures relevant to the given
prediction task remains an open challenge. In this work, leveraging recent
progress in exact and differentiable $k$-subset sampling, we devise
probabilistically rewired MPNNs (PR-MPNNs), which learn to add relevant edges
while omitting less beneficial ones. For the first time, our theoretical
analysis explores how PR-MPNNs enhance expressive power, and we identify
precise conditions under which they outperform purely randomized approaches.
Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates issues like

obtained with crowd-sourcing services. Multiple annotators each complete their
own small part of the annotations, where labeling mistakes that depend on
annotators occur frequently. Modeling the label-noise generation process by the
noise transition matrix is a power tool to tackle the label noise. In
real-world crowd-sourcing scenarios, noise transition matrices are both
annotator- and instance-dependent. However, due to the high complexity of
annotator- and instance-dependent transition matrices (AIDTM), annotation
sparsity, which means each annotator only labels a little part of instances,
makes modeling AIDTM very challenging. Prior works simplify the problem by
assuming the transition matrix is instance-independent or using simple
parametric ways, which lose modeling generality. Motivated by this, we target a
more realistic problem, estimating general AIDTM in practice. Without losing
modeling generality, we parameterize AIDTM with deep neural networks. To
alleviate the modeling challenge, we suppose every annotator shares its noise
pattern with similar annotators, and estimate AIDTM via knowledge transfer. We
hence first model the mixture of noise patterns by all annotators, and then
transfer this modeling to individual annotators. Furthermore, considering that
the transfer from the mixture of noise patterns to individuals may cause two
annotators with highly different noise generations to perturb each other, we
employ the knowledge transfer between identified neighboring annotators to
calibrate the modeling. Theoretical analyses are derived to demonstrate that
both the knowledge transfer from global to individuals and the knowledge
transfer between neighboring individuals can help model general AIDTM.
Experiments confirm the superiority of the proposed approach on synthetic and
real-world crowd-sourcing data.]]></summary>

biomedical evaluation of vascular and airway fluid dynamics. Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a good alternative to
traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods. The vanilla PINN,
however, requires much longer training time than the traditional CFD methods
for each specific flow scenario and thus does not justify its mainstream use.
Here, we explore the use of the multi-case PINN approach for calculating
biomedical tube flows, where varied geometry cases are parameterized and
pre-trained on the PINN, such that results for unseen geometries can be
obtained in real time. Our objective is to identify network architecture,
tube-specific, and regularization strategies that can optimize this, via

many applications in various domains, such as cancer diagnosis and enzyme
prediction. However, existing methods fail to capture the underlying properties
of graph anomalies, resulting in unexplainable framework design and
unsatisfying performance. In this paper, we take a step back and re-investigate
the spectral differences between anomalous and normal graphs. Our main
observation shows a significant disparity in the accumulated spectral energy
between these two classes. Moreover, we prove that the accumulated spectral
energy of the graph signal can be represented by its Rayleigh Quotient,
indicating that the Rayleigh Quotient is a driving factor behind the anomalous
properties of graphs. Motivated by this, we propose Rayleigh Quotient Graph
Neural Network (RQGNN), the first spectral GNN for graph-level anomaly
detection, providing a new perspective on exploring the inherent spectral
features of anomalous graphs. Specifically, we introduce a novel framework that
consists of two components: the Rayleigh Quotient learning component (RQL) and
Chebyshev Wavelet GNN with RQ-pooling (CWGNN-RQ). RQL explicitly captures the
Rayleigh Quotient of graphs and CWGNN-RQ implicitly explores the spectral space
of graphs. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets show that RQGNN
outperforms the best rival by 6.74% in Macro-F1 score and 1.44% in AUC,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sampling a target probability distribution with an unknown normalization
constant is a fundamental challenge in computational science and engineering.
Recent work shows that algorithms derived by considering gradient flows in the
space of probability measures open up new avenues for algorithm development.
This paper makes three contributions to this sampling approach by scrutinizing
the design components of such gradient flows. Any instantiation of a gradient
flow for sampling needs an energy functional and a metric to determine the
flow, as well as numerical approximations of the flow to derive algorithms. Our
first contribution is to show that the Kullback-Leibler divergence, as an
energy functional, has the unique property (among all f-divergences) that
gradient flows resulting from it do not depend on the normalization constant of
the target distribution. Our second contribution is to study the choice of
metric from the perspective of invariance. The Fisher-Rao metric is known as
the unique choice (up to scaling) that is diffeomorphism invariant. As a
computationally tractable alternative, we introduce a relaxed, affine
invariance property for the metrics and gradient flows. In particular, we
construct various affine invariant Wasserstein and Stein gradient flows. Affine
invariant gradient flows are shown to behave more favorably than their
non-affine-invariant counterparts when sampling highly anisotropic
distributions, in theory and by using particle methods. Our third contribution
is to study, and develop efficient algorithms based on Gaussian approximations
of the gradient flows; this leads to an alternative to particle methods. We
establish connections between various Gaussian approximate gradient flows,
discuss their relation to gradient methods arising from parametric variational
inference, and study their convergence properties both theoretically and
numerically.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A myriad of approaches have been proposed to characterise the mesoscale
structure of networks - most often as a partition based on patterns variously
called communities, blocks, or clusters. Clearly, distinct methods designed to
detect different types of patterns may provide a variety of answers to the
network's mesoscale structure. Yet, even multiple runs of a given method can
sometimes yield diverse and conflicting results, producing entire landscapes of
partitions which potentially include multiple (locally optimal) mesoscale
explanations of the network. Such ambiguity motivates a closer look at the
ability of these methods to find multiple qualitatively different 'ground
truth' partitions in a network. Here, we propose the stochastic cross-block
model (SCBM), a generative model which allows for two distinct partitions to be
built into the mesoscale structure of a single benchmark network. We
demonstrate a use case of the benchmark model by appraising the power of
stochastic block models (SBMs) to detect implicitly planted coexisting
bi-community and core-periphery structures of different strengths. Given our
model design and experimental set-up, we find that the ability to detect the
two partitions individually varies by SBM variant and that coexistence of both
partitions is recovered only in a very limited number of cases. Our findings
suggest that in most instances only one - in some way dominating - structure
can be detected, even in the presence of other partitions. They underline the
need for considering entire landscapes of partitions when different competing
explanations exist and motivate future research to advance partition
coexistence detection methods. Our model also contributes to the field of
benchmark networks more generally by enabling further exploration of the
ability of new and existing methods to detect ambiguity in the mesoscale
structure of networks.]]></summary>

variables are not only highly correlated in time but also interrelated in
space. To handle this problem, three key issues need to be well addressed:
variable characteristics modeling and representation, graph network
construction (temporal information), and graph characteristics perception. The
first issue is implemented by assuming the data follows one improved Gaussian
distribution, while the graph network can be defined by the monitoring
variables and their edges which are calculated by their characteristics in
time. Finally, these networks corresponding to process states at different

vision and information maximisation. Following Shannon, information was defined
using the probability of natural images. A number of physiological and
psychophysical phenomena have been derived ever since from principles like
info-max, efficient coding, or optimal denoising. However, it remains unclear
how this link is expressed in mathematical terms from image probability. First,
classical derivations were subjected to strong assumptions on the probability
models and on the behaviour of the sensors. Moreover, the direct evaluation of
the hypothesis was limited by the inability of the classical image models to
deliver accurate estimates of the probability. In this work we directly
evaluate image probabilities using an advanced generative model for natural
images, and we analyse how probability-related factors can be combined to
predict human perception via sensitivity of state-of-the-art subjective image
quality metrics. We use information theory and regression analysis to find a
combination of just two probability-related factors that achieves 0.8
correlation with subjective metrics. This probability-based sensitivity is

architectures have skip connections and are tightly connected to orthogonal

radial basis functions found in the theory of thin-plate/polyharmonic splines.
We also show that the underlying spaces are special instances of reproducing

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) trained with Backpropagation (BP) show
astounding performance and are increasingly often used in performing our daily
life tasks. However, ANNs are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which
alter inputs with small targeted perturbations that drastically disrupt the
models' performance. The most effective method to make ANNs robust against
these attacks is adversarial training, in which the training dataset is
augmented with exemplary adversarial samples. Unfortunately, this approach has
the drawback of increased training complexity since generating adversarial
samples is very computationally demanding. In contrast to ANNs, humans are not
susceptible to adversarial attacks. Therefore, in this work, we investigate
whether biologically-plausible learning algorithms are more robust against
adversarial attacks than BP. In particular, we present an extensive comparative
analysis of the adversarial robustness of BP and Present the Error to Perturb
the Input To modulate Activity (PEPITA), a recently proposed
biologically-plausible learning algorithm, on various computer vision tasks. We
observe that PEPITA has higher intrinsic adversarial robustness and, with
adversarial training, has a more favourable natural-vs-adversarial performance
trade-off as, for the same natural accuracies, PEPITA's adversarial accuracies
decrease in average by 0.26% and BP's by 8.05%.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finetuned LLMs often exhibit poor uncertainty quantification, manifesting as
overconfidence, poor calibration, and unreliable prediction results on test
data or out-of-distribution samples. One approach commonly used in vision for
alleviating this issue is a deep ensemble, which constructs an ensemble by
training the same model multiple times using different random initializations.
However, there is a huge challenge to ensembling LLMs: the most effective LLMs
are very, very large. Keeping a single LLM in memory is already challenging
enough: keeping an ensemble of e.g. 5 LLMs in memory is impossible in many
settings. To address these issues, we propose an ensemble approach using
Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique.
Critically, these low-rank adapters represent a very small number of
parameters, orders of magnitude less than the underlying pre-trained model.
Thus, it is possible to construct large ensembles of LoRA adapters with almost
the same computational overhead as using the original model. We find that LoRA
ensembles, applied on its own or on top of pre-existing regularization
techniques, gives consistent improvements in predictive accuracy and
uncertainty quantification.]]></summary>

depends on data-driven methods, which require sufficiently large datasets. When
historical data lacks this, it is desired to model the underlying data
generation mechanism as a probability distribution to assess the data quality
and generate more data, if needed. Kernel density estimation (KDE) based models
are popular choices for this task, but they fail to adapt to data regions with
varying densities. In this paper, an adaptive KDE model is employed to
circumvent this, where each kernel in the model has an individual bandwidth.
The leave-one-out maximum log-likelihood (LOO-MLL) criterion is proposed to
prevent the singular solutions that the regular MLL criterion gives rise to,
and it is proven that LOO-MLL prevents these. Relying on this guaranteed
robustness, the model is extended by assigning learnable weights to the
kernels. In addition, a modified expectation-maximization algorithm is employed
to accelerate the optimization speed reliably. The performance of the proposed
method and models are exhibited on two power systems datasets using different
statistical tests and by comparison with Gaussian mixture models. Results show
that the proposed models have promising performance, in addition to their
singularity prevention guarantees.]]></summary>

quantification and mean predictions with distributed clients. In particular, we
generalize beyond normal posterior distributions and consider a general class

distributions with non-i.i.d data and study how the injected noise and the
stochastic-gradient noise, the heterogeneity of data, and the varying learning
rates affect the convergence. Such an analysis sheds light on the optimal
choice of local updates to minimize communication costs. Important to our
approach is that the communication efficiency does not deteriorate with the
injected noise in the Langevin algorithms. In addition, we examine in our FA-LD
algorithm both independent and correlated noise used over different clients. We
observe there is a trade-off between the pairs among communication, accuracy,
and data privacy. As local devices may become inactive in federated networks,
we also show convergence results based on different averaging schemes where
only partial device updates are available. In such a case, we discover an
additional bias that does not decay to zero.]]></summary>

of a Gaussian distribution with unknown variance $\sigma$. Curiously, he
employed both an improper (right Haar) mixture over $\sigma$ and an improper
(flat) mixture over $\mu$. Here, we elaborate carefully on the details of his
construction, which use generalized nonintegrable martingales and an extended
Ville's inequality. While this does yield a sequential t-test, it does not
yield an ``e-process'' (due to the nonintegrability of his martingale). In this
paper, we develop two new e-processes and confidence sequences for the same
setting: one is a test martingale in a reduced filtration, while the other is
an e-process in the canonical data filtration. These are respectively obtained
by swapping Lai's flat mixture for a Gaussian mixture, and swapping the right
Haar mixture over $\sigma$ with the maximum likelihood estimate under the null,
as done in universal inference. We also analyze the width of resulting
confidence sequences, which have a curious dependence on the error probability
$\alpha$. Numerical experiments are provided along the way to compare and

that penalises those statistics that increase the mismatch between the data and

performance of our method on high-dimensional time-series models that are
artificially misspecified. We also apply our method to real data from the field
of radio propagation where the model is known to be misspecified. We show

has become the primary choice in many application domains. This progress is
mainly attributed to a systematic collaboration in which rapidly growing
computing resources encourage advanced algorithms to deal with massive data.
However, it has gradually become challenging to handle the unlimited growth of
data with limited computing power. To this end, diverse approaches are proposed
to improve data processing efficiency. Dataset distillation, a dataset
reduction method, addresses this problem by synthesizing a small typical
dataset from substantial data and has attracted much attention from the deep
learning community. Existing dataset distillation methods can be taxonomized
into meta-learning and data matching frameworks according to whether they
explicitly mimic the performance of target data. Although dataset distillation
has shown surprising performance in compressing datasets, there are still
several limitations such as distilling high-resolution data or data with
complex label spaces. This paper provides a holistic understanding of dataset
distillation from multiple aspects, including distillation frameworks and
algorithms, factorized dataset distillation, performance comparison, and

and neuroscience. Invasive devices have recently led to major milestones in
that regard: deep learning algorithms trained on intracranial recordings now
start to decode elementary linguistic features (e.g. letters, words,
spectrograms). However, extending this approach to natural speech and
non-invasive brain recordings remains a major challenge. Here, we introduce a
model trained with contrastive-learning to decode self-supervised
representations of perceived speech from the non-invasive recordings of a large
cohort of healthy individuals. To evaluate this approach, we curate and
integrate four public datasets, encompassing 175 volunteers recorded with
magneto- or electro-encephalography (M/EEG), while they listened to short
stories and isolated sentences. The results show that our model can identify,
from 3 seconds of MEG signals, the corresponding speech segment with up to 41%
accuracy out of more than 1,000 distinct possibilities on average across
participants, and more than 80% in the very best participants - a performance
that allows the decoding of words and phrases absent from the training set. The
comparison of our model to a variety of baselines highlights the importance of
(i) a contrastive objective, (ii) pretrained representations of speech and
(iii) a common convolutional architecture simultaneously trained across
multiple participants. Finally, the analysis of the decoder's predictions
suggests that they primarily depend on lexical and contextual semantic
representations. Overall, this effective decoding of perceived speech from
non-invasive recordings delineates a promising path to decode language from
brain activity, without putting patients at risk for brain surgery.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We present Deep Region Competition (DRC), an algorithm designed to extract
foreground objects from images in a fully unsupervised manner. Foreground
extraction can be viewed as a special case of generic image segmentation that
focuses on identifying and disentangling objects from the background. In this
work, we rethink the foreground extraction by reconciling energy-based prior
with generative image modeling in the form of Mixture of Experts (MoE), where
we further introduce the learned pixel re-assignment as the essential inductive
bias to capture the regularities of background regions. With this modeling, the
foreground-background partition can be naturally found through
Expectation-Maximization (EM). We show that the proposed method effectively
exploits the interaction between the mixture components during the partitioning
process, which closely connects to region competition, a seminal approach for
generic image segmentation. Experiments demonstrate that DRC exhibits more
competitive performances on complex real-world data and challenging
multi-object scenes compared with prior methods. Moreover, we show empirically
that DRC can potentially generalize to novel foreground objects even from
categories unseen during training.]]></summary>

networked space communications. Our main contribution is a novel definition of
a time-varying graph (TVG), defined in terms of a matrix with values in subsets
of the real line P(R). We leverage semi-ring properties of P(R) to model
multi-hop communication in a TVG using matrix multiplication and a truncated
Kleene star. This leads to novel statistics on the communication capacity of
TVGs called lifetime curves, which we generate for large samples of randomly
chosen STARLINK satellites, whose connectivity is modeled over day-long
simulations. Determining when a large subsample of STARLINK is temporally
strongly connected is further analyzed using novel metrics introduced here that
are inspired by topological data analysis (TDA). To better model networking
scenarios between the Earth and Mars, we introduce various semi-rings capable
of modeling propagation delay as well as protocols common to Delay Tolerant
Networking (DTN), such as store-and-forward. Finally, we illustrate the
applicability of zigzag persistence for featurizing different space networks
and demonstrate the efficacy of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification for

streams that interact with each other, where events generate new events within
their own dimension (via self-excitation) or across different dimensions (via
cross-excitation). However, in certain applications, the timestamps of
individual events in some dimensions are unobservable, and only event counts
within intervals are known, referred to as partially interval-censored data.
The MHP is unsuitable for handling such data since its estimation requires
event timestamps. In this study, we introduce the Partial Mean Behavior Poisson
(PMBP) process, a novel point process which shares parameter equivalence with
the MHP and can effectively model both timestamped and interval-censored data.
We demonstrate the capabilities of the PMBP process using synthetic and
real-world datasets. Firstly, we illustrate that the PMBP process can
approximate MHP parameters and recover the spectral radius using synthetic
event histories. Next, we assess the performance of the PMBP process in
predicting YouTube popularity and find that it surpasses state-of-the-art
methods. Lastly, we leverage the PMBP process to gain qualitative insights from
a dataset comprising daily COVID-19 case counts from multiple countries and
COVID-19-related news articles. By clustering the PMBP-modeled countries, we
unveil hidden interaction patterns between occurrences of COVID-19 cases and

stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to generate data from noise. Although
diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years, they have

translate between two arbitrary distributions, have risen as an attractive
solution to this problem. However, none of SB models so far have been
successful at unpaired translation between high-resolution images. In this
work, we propose the Unpaired Neural Schr\"odinger Bridge (UNSB), which
expresses SB problem as a sequence of adversarial learning problems. This
allows us to incorporate advanced discriminators and regularization to learn a

prediction intervals that are guaranteed to contain the true label with a given

failure probability is conservative in the sense that it is not lower than the
true failure probability of the ML algorithm. We conduct extensive experiments

different ways of implementing it and evaluate it on a variety of problems

stochastic-gradient noise, the heterogeneity of data, and the varying learning

choice of local updates to minimize communication costs. Important to our
approach is that the communication efficiency does not deteriorate with the
injected noise in the Langevin algorithms. In addition, we examine in our FA-LD
algorithm both independent and correlated noise used over different clients. We
observe there is a trade-off between the pairs among communication, accuracy,
and data privacy. As local devices may become inactive in federated networks,
we also show convergence results based on different averaging schemes where
only partial device updates are available. In such a case, we discover an

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is a niche of companies responsible for intermediating the purchase of
large batches of varied products for other companies, for which the main
challenge is to perform product description standardization, i.e., matching an
item described by a client with a product described in a catalog. The problem
is complex since the client's product description may be: (1) potentially
noisy; (2) short and uninformative (e.g., missing information about model and
size); and (3) cross-language. In this paper, we formalize this problem as a
ranking task: given an initial client product specification (query), return the
most appropriate standardized descriptions (response). In this paper, we
propose TPDR, a two-step Transformer-based Product and Class Description
Retrieval method that is able to explore the semantic correspondence between IS
and SD, by exploiting attention mechanisms and contrastive learning. First,
TPDR employs the transformers as two encoders sharing the embedding vector
space: one for encoding the IS and another for the SD, in which corresponding
pairs (IS, SD) must be close in the vector space. Closeness is further enforced
by a contrastive learning mechanism leveraging a specialized loss function.
TPDR also exploits a (second) re-ranking step based on syntactic features that
are very important for the exact matching (model, dimension) of certain
products that may have been neglected by the transformers. To evaluate our
proposal, we consider 11 datasets from a real company, covering different
application contexts. Our solution was able to retrieve the correct
standardized product before the 5th ranking position in 71% of the cases and
its correct category in the first position in 80% of the situations. Moreover,
the effectiveness gains over purely syntactic or semantic baselines reach up to
3.7 times, solving cases that none of the approaches in isolation can do by
themselves.]]></summary>

measurement models with deep-learning priors specified using image denoisers.
However, the intricate relationship between the sampling distribution of

theoretically analyzed. We address this gap by proposing a posterior-L2
pseudometric and using it to quantify an explicit error bound for PnP-ULA under
mismatched posterior distribution. We numerically validate our theory on
several inverse problems such as sampling from Gaussian mixture models and
image deblurring. Our results suggest that the sensitivity of the sampling

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are amortized samplers that learn
stochastic policies to sequentially generate compositional objects from a given
unnormalized reward distribution. They can generate diverse sets of high-reward
objects, which is an important consideration in scientific discovery tasks.
However, as they are typically trained from a given extrinsic reward function,
it remains an important open challenge about how to leverage the power of
pre-training and train GFlowNets in an unsupervised fashion for efficient
adaptation to downstream tasks. Inspired by recent successes of unsupervised
pre-training in various domains, we introduce a novel approach for reward-free
pre-training of GFlowNets. By framing the training as a self-supervised
problem, we propose an outcome-conditioned GFlowNet (OC-GFN) that learns to
explore the candidate space. Specifically, OC-GFN learns to reach any targeted
outcomes, akin to goal-conditioned policies in reinforcement learning. We show
that the pre-trained OC-GFN model can allow for a direct extraction of a policy
capable of sampling from any new reward functions in downstream tasks.
Nonetheless, adapting OC-GFN on a downstream task-specific reward involves an
intractable marginalization over possible outcomes. We propose a novel way to
approximate this marginalization by learning an amortized predictor enabling
efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experimental results validate the efficacy of
our approach, demonstrating the effectiveness of pre-training the OC-GFN, and
its ability to swiftly adapt to downstream tasks and discover modes more
efficiently. This work may serve as a foundation for further exploration of

aggregating the neighborhood information in various ways. As these networks
grow in depth, their receptive field grows exponentially due to the increase in
neighborhood sizes, resulting in high memory costs. Graph sampling solves
memory issues in GNNs by sampling a small ratio of the nodes in the graph. This
way, GNNs can scale to much larger graphs. Most sampling methods focus on fixed
sampling heuristics, which may not generalize to different structures or tasks.
We introduce GRAPES, an adaptive graph sampling method that learns to identify
sets of influential nodes for training a GNN classifier. GRAPES uses a GFlowNet
to learn node sampling probabilities given the classification objectives. We
evaluate GRAPES across several small- and large-scale graph benchmarks and
demonstrate its effectiveness in accuracy and scalability. In contrast to
existing sampling methods, GRAPES maintains high accuracy even with small
sample sizes and, therefore, can scale to very large graphs. Our code is

opinions on the internet daily. Unfortunately, not all of these expressions are
friendly or compliant, making content moderation an indispensable task. With
the successful development of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent years,
LLM-based methods have become a feasible solution for handling tasks in various

detailed work that systematically introduces implementation details. In this
paper, we introduce how to fine-tune an LLM model that can be privately
deployed for content moderation. Specifically, we discuss whether incorporating
reasons during the fine-tuning process would be better or if it should be
treated as a classification task directly. We also explore the benefits of
utilizing reasons generated by more powerful LLMs for fine-tuning privately
deployed models and the impact of different processing approaches when the
answers generated by the more powerful LLMs are incorrect. We report the entire
research process and the key findings in this paper, hoping to provide valuable

integrating natural language into visual concepts, enabling zero-shot
recognition on downstream tasks. It is usually expected that satisfactory
overall accuracy can be achieved across numerous domains through well-designed
textual prompts. However, we found that their performance in the worst
categories is significantly inferior to the overall performance. For example,
on ImageNet, there are a total of 10 categories with class-wise accuracy as low
as 0\%, even though the overall performance has achieved 64.1\%. This
phenomenon reveals the potential risks associated with using CLIP models,
particularly in risk-sensitive applications where specific categories hold
significant importance. To address this issue, we investigate the alignment
between the two modalities in the CLIP model and propose the Class-wise
Matching Margin (\cmm) to measure the inference confusion. \cmm\ can
effectively identify the worst-performing categories and estimate the potential
performance of the candidate prompts. We further query large language models to
enrich descriptions of worst-performing categories and build a weighted
ensemble to highlight the efficient prompts. Experimental results clearly
verify the effectiveness of our proposal, where the accuracy on the worst-10
categories on ImageNet is boosted to 5.2\%, without manual prompt engineering,
laborious optimization, or access to labeled validation data.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep learning-based numerical schemes for solving high-dimensional backward
stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) have recently raised plenty of
scientific interest. While they enable numerical methods to approximate very
high-dimensional BSDEs, their reliability has not been studied and is thus not
understood. In this work, we study uncertainty quantification (UQ) for a class
of deep learning-based BSDE schemes. More precisely, we review the sources of
uncertainty involved in the schemes and numerically study the impact of
different sources. Usually, the standard deviation (STD) of the approximate
solutions obtained from multiple runs of the algorithm with different datasets
is calculated to address the uncertainty. This approach is computationally
quite expensive, especially for high-dimensional problems. Hence, we develop a
UQ model that efficiently estimates the STD of the approximate solution using
only a single run of the algorithm. The model also estimates the mean of the
approximate solution, which can be leveraged to initialize the algorithm and
improve the optimization process. Our numerical experiments show that the UQ
model produces reliable estimates of the mean and STD of the approximate
solution for the considered class of deep learning-based BSDE schemes. The
estimated STD captures multiple sources of uncertainty, demonstrating its
effectiveness in quantifying the uncertainty. Additionally, the model
illustrates the improved performance when comparing different schemes based on
the estimated STD values. Furthermore, it can identify hyperparameter values
for which the scheme achieves good approximations.]]></summary>

depends on data-driven methods, which require sufficiently large datasets. When
historical data lacks this, it is desired to model the underlying data
generation mechanism as a probability distribution to assess the data quality
and generate more data, if needed. Kernel density estimation (KDE) based models
are popular choices for this task, but they fail to adapt to data regions with
varying densities. In this paper, an adaptive KDE model is employed to
circumvent this, where each kernel in the model has an individual bandwidth.
The leave-one-out maximum log-likelihood (LOO-MLL) criterion is proposed to
prevent the singular solutions that the regular MLL criterion gives rise to,
and it is proven that LOO-MLL prevents these. Relying on this guaranteed
robustness, the model is extended by assigning learnable weights to the
kernels. In addition, a modified expectation-maximization algorithm is employed
to accelerate the optimization speed reliably. The performance of the proposed
method and models are exhibited on two power systems datasets using different
statistical tests and by comparison with Gaussian mixture models. Results show
that the proposed models have promising performance, in addition to their
singularity prevention guarantees.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi-fidelity (MF) methods are gaining popularity for enhancing surrogate
modeling and design optimization by incorporating data from various
low-fidelity (LF) models. While most existing MF methods assume a fixed
dataset, adaptive sampling methods that dynamically allocate resources among
fidelity models can achieve higher efficiency in the exploring and exploiting
the design space. However, most existing MF methods rely on the hierarchical
assumption of fidelity levels or fail to capture the intercorrelation between
multiple fidelity levels and utilize it to quantify the value of the future
samples and navigate the adaptive sampling. To address this hurdle, we propose
a framework hinged on a latent embedding for different fidelity models and the
associated pre-posterior analysis to explicitly utilize their correlation for
adaptive sampling. In this framework, each infill sampling iteration includes
two steps: We first identify the location of interest with the greatest
potential improvement using the high-fidelity (HF) model, then we search for
the next sample across all fidelity levels that maximize the improvement per
unit cost at the location identified in the first step. This is made possible
by a single Latent Variable Gaussian Process (LVGP) model that maps different
fidelity models into an interpretable latent space to capture their
correlations without assuming hierarchical fidelity levels. The LVGP enables us
to assess how LF sampling candidates will affect HF response with pre-posterior
analysis and determine the next sample with the best benefit-to-cost ratio.
Through test cases, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the
benchmark methods in both MF global fitting (GF) and Bayesian Optimization (BO)
problems in convergence rate and robustness. Moreover, the method offers the
flexibility to switch between GF and BO by simply changing the acquisition
function.]]></summary>

heuristics in lost sales inventory control, perishable inventory systems, and
inventory systems with random lead times, achieving lower average costs across
all test instances and maintaining an optimality gap of no more than 0.1\%.
Notably, the same hyperparameter set is utilized across all experiments,
underscoring the robustness and generalizability of the proposed method.
Managerial implications: These substantial performance and robustness
improvements pave the way for the effective application of tailored DRL
algorithms to inventory management problems, empowering decision-makers to
optimize stock levels, minimize costs, and enhance responsiveness across
various industries.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Weight decay is a standard technique to improve generalization performance in
modern deep neural network optimization, and is also widely adopted in
federated learning (FL) to prevent overfitting in local clients. In this paper,
we first explore the choices of weight decay and identify that weight decay
value appreciably influences the convergence of existing FL algorithms. While
preventing overfitting is crucial, weight decay can introduce a different
optimization goal towards the global objective, which is further amplified in
FL due to multiple local updates and heterogeneous data distribution. To
address this challenge, we develop {\it Federated optimization with Normalized
Annealing Regularization} (FedNAR), a simple yet effective and versatile
algorithmic plug-in that can be seamlessly integrated into any existing FL
algorithms. Essentially, we regulate the magnitude of each update by performing
co-clipping of the gradient and weight decay. We provide a comprehensive
theoretical analysis of FedNAR's convergence rate and conduct extensive
experiments on both vision and language datasets with different backbone
federated optimization algorithms. Our experimental results consistently
demonstrate that incorporating FedNAR into existing FL algorithms leads to
accelerated convergence and heightened model accuracy. Moreover, FedNAR
exhibits resilience in the face of various hyperparameter configurations.
Specifically, FedNAR has the ability to self-adjust the weight decay when the
initial specification is not optimal, while the accuracy of traditional FL
algorithms would markedly decline. Our codes are released at

compromised exteroceptive perception, or perception failures. Such failures
often occur when harsh environments lead to degraded sensing, or when the

this paper, we model perception failures as invisible obstacles and pits, and
train a reinforcement learning (RL) based local navigation policy to guide our

to update navigational information, we train our navigation policy to
reconstruct the environment information in the latent space from corrupted

incorporate both proprioception and exteroception into our policy inputs,
thereby enabling the policy to sense collisions on different body parts and

contribution to our fundamental understanding of human neurophysiology and
remain a central pillar of motor neuroscience and the development of
human-machine interfaces. However, whilst modern biophysical simulations based
on finite element methods are highly accurate, they are extremely
computationally expensive and thus are generally limited to modelling static
systems such as isometrically contracting limbs. As a solution to this problem,
we propose a transfer learning approach, in which a conditional generative
model is trained to mimic the output of an advanced numerical model. To this
end, we present BioMime, a conditional generative neural network trained
adversarially to generate motor unit activation potential waveforms under a
wide variety of volume conductor parameters. We demonstrate the ability of such
a model to predictively interpolate between a much smaller number of numerical
model's outputs with a high accuracy. Consequently, the computational load is
dramatically reduced, which allows the rapid simulation of EMG signals during
truly dynamic and naturalistic movements.]]></summary>

model outperformed the best-known benchmark by up to 42% for predicting the
Mean Ribosome Loading, and by up to 60% for predicting the Translation
Efficiency and the mRNA Expression Level. The model also applies to identifying
unannotated Internal Ribosome Entry Sites within the untranslated region and
improves the AUPR from 0.37 to 0.52 compared to the best baseline. Further, we
designed a library of 211 novel 5' UTRs with high predicted values of

expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions. High-dimensional problems are
particularly challenging as the surrogate model of the objective suffers from
the curse of dimensionality, which makes accurate modeling difficult. We
propose a group testing approach to identify active variables to facilitate
efficient optimization in these domains. The proposed algorithm, Group Testing
Bayesian Optimization (GTBO), first runs a testing phase where groups of
variables are systematically selected and tested on whether they influence the
objective. To that end, we extend the well-established theory of group testing
to functions of continuous ranges. In the second phase, GTBO guides
optimization by placing more importance on the active dimensions. By exploiting
the axis-aligned subspace assumption, GTBO is competitive against
state-of-the-art methods on several synthetic and real-world high-dimensional
optimization tasks. Furthermore, GTBO aids in the discovery of active
parameters in applications, thereby enhancing practitioners' understanding of

modern-day distributed machine learning. The two concepts have been extensively
studied individually but the question of how to combine them effectively
remains unanswered. This paper contributes to addressing this question by
studying the extent to which the distributed SGD algorithm, in the standard
parameter-server architecture, can learn an accurate model despite (a) a
fraction of the workers being malicious (Byzantine), and (b) the other
fraction, whilst being honest, providing noisy information to the server to
ensure differential privacy (DP). We first observe that the integration of
standard practices in DP and BR is not straightforward. In fact, we show that
many existing results on the convergence of distributed SGD under Byzantine
faults, especially those relying on $(\alpha,f)$-Byzantine resilience, are
rendered invalid when honest workers enforce DP. To circumvent this
shortcoming, we revisit the theory of $(\alpha,f)$-BR to obtain an approximate
convergence guarantee. Our analysis provides key insights on how to improve
this guarantee through hyperparameter optimization. Essentially, our
theoretical and empirical results show that (1) an imprudent combination of
standard approaches to DP and BR might be fruitless, but (2) by carefully
re-tuning the learning algorithm, we can obtain reasonable learning accuracy
while simultaneously guaranteeing DP and BR.]]></summary>

hypotheses, designing experiments, running experiments, and analyzing the
results. Can we build AI research agents to perform these long-horizon tasks?
To take a step towards building and evaluating research agents on such
open-ended decision-making tasks, we focus on the problem of machine learning
engineering: given a task description and a dataset, build a high-performing
model. In this paper, we propose MLAgentBench, a suite of ML tasks for
benchmarking AI research agents. Agents can perform actions like
reading/writing files, executing code, and inspecting outputs. With these
actions, agents could run experiments, analyze the results, and modify the code
of entire machine learning pipelines, such as data processing, architecture,
training processes, etc. The benchmark then automatically evaluates the agent's
performance objectively over various metrics related to performance and
efficiency. We also design an LLM-based research agent to automatically perform
experimentation loops in such an environment. Empirically, we find that a
GPT-4-based research agent can feasibly build compelling ML models over many
tasks in MLAgentBench, displaying highly interpretable plans and actions.
However, the success rates vary considerably; they span from almost 90\% on
well-established older datasets to as low as 10\% on recent Kaggle Challenges
-- unavailable during the LLM model's pretraining -- and even 0\% on newer
research challenges like BabyLM. Finally, we identify several key challenges
for LLM-based research agents such as long-term planning and hallucination. Our

entails preparing them to handle unforeseen conditions. In several applications
the occurrence of novel classes during deployment poses a significant threat,
thus it is crucial to effectively detect them. Ideally, this skill should be
used when needed without requiring any further computational training effort at
every new task. Out-of-distribution detection has attracted significant
attention in the last years, however the majority of the studies deal with 2D
images ignoring the inherent 3D nature of the real-world and often confusing
between domain and semantic novelty. In this work, we focus on the latter,
considering the objects geometric structure captured by 3D point clouds
regardless of the specific domain. We advance the field by introducing
OpenPatch that builds on a large pre-trained model and simply extracts from its
intermediate features a set of patch representations that describe each known
class. For any new sample, we obtain a novelty score by evaluating whether it
can be recomposed mainly by patches of a single known class or rather via the
contribution of multiple classes. We present an extensive experimental
evaluation of our approach for the task of semantic novelty detection on
real-world point cloud samples when the reference known data are synthetic. We
demonstrate that OpenPatch excels in both the full and few-shot known sample
scenarios, showcasing its robustness across varying pre-training objectives and
network backbones. The inherent training-free nature of our method allows for
its immediate application to a wide array of real-world tasks, offering a

graph learning algorithms for many tasks, such as fraud detection and

shortcoming by proposing a scalable synthetic graph generation tool to scale
the datasets to production-size graphs with trillions of edges and billions of

that can be released to researchers to study various graph methods on the

demonstrate the generalizability of the framework across a series of datasets,
mimicking structural and feature distributions as well as the ability to scale
them across varying sizes demonstrating their usefulness for benchmarking and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pretrained large language models (LLMs) are general purpose problem solvers
applicable to a diverse set of tasks with prompts. They can be further improved
towards a specific task by fine-tuning on a specialized dataset. However,
fine-tuning usually makes the model narrowly specialized on this dataset with
reduced general in-context learning performances, which is undesirable whenever
the fine-tuned model needs to handle additional tasks where no fine-tuning data
is available. In this work, we first demonstrate that fine-tuning on a single
task indeed decreases LLMs' general in-context learning performance. We
discover one important cause of such forgetting, format specialization, where
the model overfits to the format of the fine-tuned task. We further show that
format specialization happens at the very beginning of fine-tuning. To solve
this problem, we propose Prompt Tuning with MOdel Tuning (ProMoT), a simple yet
effective two-stage fine-tuning framework that reduces format specialization
and improves generalization. ProMoT offloads task-specific format learning into
additional and removable parameters by first doing prompt tuning and then
fine-tuning the model itself with this soft prompt attached. With experiments
on several fine-tuning tasks and 8 in-context evaluation tasks, we show that
ProMoT achieves comparable performance on fine-tuned tasks to standard
fine-tuning, but with much less loss of in-context learning performances across
a board range of out-of-domain evaluation tasks. More importantly, ProMoT can
even enhance generalization on in-context learning tasks that are semantically
related to the fine-tuned task, e.g. ProMoT on En-Fr translation significantly
improves performance on other language pairs, and ProMoT on NLI improves
performance on summarization. Experiments also show that ProMoT can improve the
generalization performance of multi-task training.]]></summary>

classifiers by introducing slight perturbations. Developing algorithms that can
mitigate the effects of these attacks is crucial for ensuring the safe use of

diffusion models are effective in adversarial defenses. However, existing
diffusion-based defenses rely on the sequential simulation of the reversed
stochastic differential equations of diffusion models, which are
computationally inefficient and yield suboptimal results. In this paper, we
introduce a novel adversarial defense scheme named ScoreOpt, which optimizes
adversarial samples at test-time, towards original clean data in the direction
guided by score-based priors. We conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple

autonomous driving systems. Accurate traffic sign classification is essential
but challenging due to real-world complexities like adversarial examples and
occlusions. To address these issues, binary neural networks offer promise in
constructing classifiers suitable for resource-constrained devices.

In our previous work, we proposed high-accuracy BNN models for traffic sign
recognition, focusing on compact size for limited computation and energy
resources. To evaluate their local robustness, this paper introduces a set of
benchmark problems featuring layers that challenge state-of-the-art
verification tools. These layers include binarized convolutions, max pooling,
batch normalization, fully connected. The difficulty of the verification
problem is given by the high number of network parameters (905k - 1.7 M), of
the input dimension (2.7k-12k), and of the number of regions (43) as well by
the fact that the neural networks are not sparse.

The proposed BNN models and local robustness properties can be checked at
https://github.com/ChristopherBrix/vnncomp2023_benchmarks/tree/main/benchmarks/traffic_signs_recognition.

The results of the 4th International Verification of Neural Networks
Competition (VNN-COMP'23) revealed the fact that 4, out of 7, solvers can
handle many of our benchmarks randomly selected (minimum is 6, maximum is 36,
out of 45). Surprisingly, tools output also wrong results or missing
counterexample (ranging from 1 to 4). Currently, our focus lies in exploring
the possibility of achieving a greater count of solved instances by extending
the allotted time (previously set at 8 minutes). Furthermore, we are intrigued
by the reasons behind the erroneous outcomes provided by the tools for certain
benchmarks.]]></summary>

performance of deep neural networks in areas such as uncertainty
quantification, variable selection, and large-scale network compression.
However, most existing research has focused on problems where the observations
are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and there has been little
work on the problems where the observations are dependent, such as time series
data and sequential data in natural language processing. This paper aims to
address this gap by studying the theory for sparse deep learning with dependent
data. We show that sparse recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can be consistently
estimated, and their predictions are asymptotically normally distributed under
appropriate assumptions, enabling the prediction uncertainty to be correctly
quantified. Our numerical results show that sparse deep learning outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, such as conformal predictions, in prediction
uncertainty quantification for time series data. Furthermore, our results
indicate that the proposed method can consistently identify the autoregressive
order for time series data and outperform existing methods in large-scale model
compression. Our proposed method has important practical implications in fields
such as finance, healthcare, and energy, where both accurate point estimates

training (AT) has been demonstrated to be the most effective defense strategy
to protect neural networks from being fooled. However, we find AT omits to
learning robust features, resulting in poor performance of adversarial
robustness. To address this issue, we highlight two characteristics of robust
representation: (1) $\bf{exclusion}$: the feature of natural examples keeps
away from that of other classes; (2) $\bf{alignment}$: the feature of natural
and corresponding adversarial examples is close to each other. These motivate
us to propose a generic framework of AT to gain robust representation, by the
asymmetric negative contrast and reverse attention. Specifically, we design an
asymmetric negative contrast based on predicted probabilities, to push away
examples of different classes in the feature space. Moreover, we propose to
weight feature by parameters of the linear classifier as the reverse attention,
to obtain class-aware feature and pull close the feature of the same class.
Empirical evaluations on three benchmark datasets show our methods greatly

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this paper, we study how the granularity of pretraining labels affects the
generalization of deep neural networks in image classification tasks. We focus
on the "fine-to-coarse" transfer learning setting, where the pretraining label
space is more fine-grained than that of the target problem. Empirically, we
show that pretraining on the leaf labels of ImageNet21k produces better
transfer results on ImageNet1k than pretraining on other coarser granularity
levels, which supports the common practice used in the community.
Theoretically, we explain the benefit of fine-grained pretraining by proving
that, for a data distribution satisfying certain hierarchy conditions, 1)
coarse-grained pretraining only allows a neural network to learn the "common"
or "easy-to-learn" features well, while 2) fine-grained pretraining helps the
network learn the "rarer" or "fine-grained" features in addition to the common
ones, thus improving its accuracy on hard downstream test samples in which
common features are missing or weak in strength. Furthermore, we perform
comprehensive experiments using the label hierarchies of iNaturalist 2021 and
observe that the following conditions, in addition to proper choice of label
granularity, enable the transfer to work well in practice: 1) the pretraining
dataset needs to have a meaningful label hierarchy, and 2) the pretraining and
target label functions need to align well.]]></summary>

from the Boltzmann energy distribution via a sequence of actions. In
particular, we focus on improving GFlowNet with partial inference: training
flow functions with the evaluation of the intermediate states or transitions.
To this end, the recently developed forward-looking GFlowNet reparameterizes
the flow functions based on evaluating the energy of intermediate states.
However, such an evaluation of intermediate energies may (i) be too expensive
or impossible to evaluate and (ii) even provide misleading training signals
under large energy fluctuations along the sequence of actions. To resolve this
issue, we propose learning energy decompositions for GFlowNets (LED-GFN). Our
main idea is to (i) decompose the energy of an object into learnable potential
functions defined on state transitions and (ii) reparameterize the flow
functions using the potential functions. In particular, to produce informative
local credits, we propose to regularize the potential to change smoothly over
the sequence of actions. It is also noteworthy that training GFlowNet with our
learned potential can preserve the optimal policy. We empirically verify the
superiority of LED-GFN in five problems including the generation of
unstructured and maximum independent sets, molecular graphs, and RNA sequences.]]></summary>

architectures that can learn explicit representations of relational features.
In this paper, we focus on the problem of learning representations of
hierarchical relations, proposing an architectural framework we call
"relational convolutional networks". Given a sequence of objects, a
"multi-dimensional inner product relation" module produces a relation tensor
describing all pairwise relations. A "relational convolution" layer then
transforms the relation tensor into a sequence of new objects, each describing
the relations within some group of objects at the previous layer. Graphlet
filters, analogous to filters in convolutional neural networks, represent a
template of relations against which the relation tensor is compared at each
grouping. Repeating this yields representations of higher-order, hierarchical
relations. We present the motivation and details of the architecture, together
with a set of experiments to demonstrate how relational convolutional networks
can provide an effective framework for modeling relational tasks that have
hierarchical structure.]]></summary>

is useful when describing decision boundaries in a classification setting. We

networks. This paper addresses the issue of pilot contamination and scalability
in massive MIMO systems. The current practice of reusing orthogonal pilot
sequences in adjacent cells leads to difficulty in differentiating incoming
inter- and intra-cell pilot sequences. One possible solution is to increase the
number of orthogonal pilot sequences, which results in dedicating more space of
coherence block to pilot transmission than data transmission. This, in turn,
also hinders the scalability of massive MIMO systems, particularly in
accommodating a large number of IoT devices within a cell. To overcome these
challenges, this paper devises an innovative pilot allocation scheme based on
the data transfer patterns of IoT devices. The scheme assigns orthogonal pilot
sequences to clusters of devices instead of individual devices, allowing
multiple devices to utilize the same pilot for periodically transmitting data.
Moreover, we formulate the pilot assignment problem as a graph coloring problem
and use the max k-cut graph partitioning approach to overcome the pilot
contamination in a multicell massive MIMO system. The proposed scheme
significantly improves the spectral efficiency and enables the scalability of
massive MIMO systems; for instance, by using ten orthogonal pilot sequences, we
are able to accommodate 200 devices with only a 12.5% omission rate.]]></summary>

the value of the target property of a molecule based on a non-linear regression

i.e., the manipulations are functionality- and rendering-preserving by design.
We then select which manipulations should be applied to bypass the target

and thus improved aquifer management, in industrial-scale carbon storage
operations. In traditional model-based data assimilation, geomodel parameters
are modified to force agreement between flow simulation results and
observations. In data-space inversion (DSI), history-matched quantities of
interest, e.g., posterior pressure and saturation fields conditioned to
observations, are inferred directly, without constructing posterior geomodels.
This is accomplished efficiently using a set of O(1000) prior simulation
results, data parameterization, and posterior sampling within a Bayesian
setting. In this study, we develop and implement (in DSI) a deep-learning-based
parameterization to represent spatio-temporal pressure and CO2 saturation
fields at a set of time steps. The new parameterization uses an adversarial
autoencoder (AAE) for dimension reduction and a convolutional long short-term
memory (convLSTM) network to represent the spatial distribution and temporal
evolution of the pressure and saturation fields. This parameterization is used
with an ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation (ESMDA) in the DSI
framework to enable posterior predictions. A realistic 3D system characterized
by prior geological realizations drawn from a range of geological scenarios is
considered. A local grid refinement procedure is introduced to estimate the
error covariance term that appears in the history matching formulation.
Extensive history matching results are presented for various quantities, for
multiple synthetic true models. Substantial uncertainty reduction in posterior
pressure and saturation fields is achieved in all cases. The framework is
applied to efficiently provide posterior predictions for a range of error
covariance specifications. Such an assessment would be expensive using a
model-based approach.]]></summary>

substantial neural networks into more compact and efficient counterparts.
Within this context, softmax regression representation learning serves as a

extensive inquiry into the efficacy of softmax regression representation
learning, the intricate underpinnings governing the knowledge transfer
mechanism remain inadequately elucidated. This study introduces the 'Ideal
Joint Classifier Knowledge Distillation' (IJCKD) framework, an overarching
paradigm that not only furnishes a lucid and exhaustive comprehension of
prevailing knowledge distillation techniques but also establishes a theoretical

methodologies derived from domain adaptation theory, this investigation
conducts a comprehensive examination of the error boundary of the student

particularly their movements or actions is critical in the ward. This approach
offers the advantage of reducing in-hospital care costs and improving the
efficiency of healthcare workers, which is especially true for scenarios at
night or during peak admission periods. Therefore, in this work, we propose
using computer vision (CV) and deep learning (DL) methods for detecting
subjects and recognizing their actions. We utilize OpenPose as an accurate
subject detector for recognizing the positions of human subjects in the video
stream. Additionally, we employ AlphAction's Asynchronous Interaction
Aggregation (AIA) network to predict the actions of detected subjects. This
integrated model, referred to as PoseAction, is proposed. At the same time, the
proposed model is further trained to predict 12 common actions in ward areas,
such as staggering, chest pain, and falling down, using medical-related video
clips from the NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets. The results demonstrate
that PoseAction achieves the highest classification mAP of 98.72% (IoU@0.5).
Additionally, this study develops an online real-time mode for action
recognition, which strongly supports the clinical translation of PoseAction.
Furthermore, using OpenPose's function for recognizing face key points, we also
implement face blurring, which is a practical solution to address the privacy
protection concerns of patients and healthcare workers. Nevertheless, the
training data for PoseAction is currently limited, particularly in terms of
label diversity. Consequently, the subsequent step involves utilizing a more
diverse dataset (including general actions) to train the model's parameters for
improved generalization.]]></summary>

requires the use of similarity-based loss functions, such as contrastive loss,
that favor minimizing the distance between similar inputs and maximizing the
distance between distinct inputs. As privacy concerns mount, training these
models using differential privacy has become more important. However, due to
how inputs are generated for these losses, one of their undesirable properties
is that their $L_2$ sensitivity can grow with increasing batch size. This

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Characterizing the relationship between neural population activity and
behavioral data is a central goal of neuroscience. While latent variable models
(LVMs) are successful in describing high-dimensional time-series data, they are
typically only designed for a single type of data, making it difficult to
identify structure shared across different experimental data modalities. Here,
we address this shortcoming by proposing an unsupervised LVM which extracts
temporally evolving shared and independent latents for distinct, simultaneously
recorded experimental modalities. We do this by combining Gaussian Process
Factor Analysis (GPFA), an interpretable LVM for neural spiking data with
temporally smooth latent space, with Gaussian Process Variational Autoencoders
(GP-VAEs), which similarly use a GP prior to characterize correlations in a
latent space, but admit rich expressivity due to a deep neural network mapping
to observations. We achieve interpretability in our model by partitioning
latent variability into components that are either shared between or
independent to each modality. We parameterize the latents of our model in the
Fourier domain, and show improved latent identification using this approach
over standard GP-VAE methods. We validate our model on simulated multi-modal
data consisting of Poisson spike counts and MNIST images that scale and rotate
smoothly over time. We show that the multi-modal GP-VAE (MM-GPVAE) is able to
not only identify the shared and independent latent structure across modalities
accurately, but provides good reconstructions of both images and neural rates
on held-out trials. Finally, we demonstrate our framework on two real world
multi-modal experimental settings: Drosophila whole-brain calcium imaging
alongside tracked limb positions, and Manduca sexta spike train measurements
from ten wing muscles as the animal tracks a visual stimulus.]]></summary>

linear time-invariant (LTI) systems (with possibly unknown dynamics) in the

is characterized by a time-varying convex function, which evolves in an
adversarial manner and is sequentially and partially observed by local agents.
The goal of each agent is to generate a control sequence that can compete with
the best centralized control policy in hindsight, which has access to the
global cost. This problem is formulated as a regret minimization. For the case
of known dynamics, we propose a fully distributed disturbance feedback
controller that guarantees a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T}\log T)$, where $T$ is
the time horizon. For the unknown dynamics case, we design a distributed
explore-then-commit approach, where in the exploration phase all agents jointly
learn the system dynamics, and in the learning phase our proposed control

discovery. While recent advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and
Transformers have shown to be effective and promising, they face the following
limitations: Transformer self-attention does not explicitly consider the
underlying molecule structure while GNN feature representation alone is not
sufficient to capture granular and hidden interactions and characteristics that
distinguish similar molecules. To address these limitations, we propose SYN-
FUSION, a novel approach that synergistically combines pre-trained features
from GNNs and Transformers. This approach provides a comprehensive molecular
representation, capturing both the global molecule structure and the individual
atom characteristics. Experimental results on MoleculeNet benchmarks
demonstrate superior performance, surpassing previous models in 5 out of 7
classification datasets and 4 out of 6 regression datasets. The performance of
SYN-FUSION has been compared with other Graph-Transformer models that have been
jointly trained using a combination of transformer and graph features, and it
is found that our approach is on par with those models in terms of performance.
Extensive analysis of the learned fusion model across aspects such as loss,
latent space, and weight distribution further validates the effectiveness of
SYN-FUSION. Finally, an ablation study unequivocally demonstrates that the

fundamental requirement for trusted AI. In regression tasks, uncertainty is
typically quantified using prediction intervals calibrated to an ad-hoc

characteristics curves and (2) the notion of a gain over a null reference, to
derive a novel operating point agnostic assessment methodology for prediction

relationships is crucial for flexible interaction with the physical world.
However, most existing physical and causal reasoning benchmarks are exclusively
based on synthetically generated events and synthetic natural language
descriptions of causal relationships. This design brings up two issues. First,
there is a lack of diversity in both event types and natural language
descriptions; second, causal relationships based on manually-defined heuristics
are different from human judgments. To address both shortcomings, we present
the CLEVRER-Humans benchmark, a video reasoning dataset for causal judgment of
physical events with human labels. We employ two techniques to improve data
collection efficiency: first, a novel iterative event cloze task to elicit a
new representation of events in videos, which we term Causal Event Graphs
(CEGs); second, a data augmentation technique based on neural language
generative models. We convert the collected CEGs into questions and answers to
be consistent with prior work. Finally, we study a collection of baseline
approaches for CLEVRER-Humans question-answering, highlighting the great

computational pathology. Some methods have been proposed to select a subset of
patches as WSI representation for downstream tasks. While most of the
computational pathology tasks are designed to classify or detect the presence
of pathological lesions in each WSI, the confounding role and redundant nature
of normal histology in tissue samples are generally overlooked in WSI
representations. In this paper, we propose and validate the concept of an
"atlas of normal tissue" solely using samples of WSIs obtained from normal
tissue biopsies. Such atlases can be employed to eliminate normal fragments of
tissue samples and hence increase the representativeness collection of patches.
We tested our proposed method by establishing a normal atlas using 107 normal
skin WSIs and demonstrated how established indexes and search engines like
Yottixel can be improved. We used 553 WSIs of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma
(cSCC) to show the advantage. We also validated our method applied to an
external dataset of 451 breast WSIs. The number of selected WSI patches was
reduced by 30% to 50% after utilizing the proposed normal atlas while
maintaining the same indexing and search performance in leave-one-patinet-out
validation for both datasets. We show that the proposed normal atlas shows
promise for unsupervised selection of the most representative patches of the
abnormal/malignant WSI lesions.]]></summary>

expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions. High-dimensional problems are
particularly challenging as the surrogate model of the objective suffers from
the curse of dimensionality, which makes accurate modeling difficult. We
propose a group testing approach to identify active variables to facilitate
efficient optimization in these domains. The proposed algorithm, Group Testing
Bayesian Optimization (GTBO), first runs a testing phase where groups of
variables are systematically selected and tested on whether they influence the
objective. To that end, we extend the well-established theory of group testing
to functions of continuous ranges. In the second phase, GTBO guides
optimization by placing more importance on the active dimensions. By exploiting
the axis-aligned subspace assumption, GTBO is competitive against
state-of-the-art methods on several synthetic and real-world high-dimensional
optimization tasks. Furthermore, GTBO aids in the discovery of active
parameters in applications, thereby enhancing practitioners' understanding of

the high expense of using paid API services. In this paper, we are motivated to
study building an LLM cascade to save the cost of using LLMs, particularly for
performing reasoning (e.g., mathematical, causal) tasks. Our cascade pipeline
follows the intuition that simpler questions can be addressed by a weaker but
more affordable LLM, whereas only the challenging questions necessitate the
stronger and more expensive LLM. To realize this decision-making, we consider
the "answer consistency" of the weaker LLM as a signal of the question
difficulty and propose several methods for the answer sampling and consistency
checking, including one leveraging a mixture of two thought representations
(i.e., Chain-of-Thought and Program-of-Thought). Through experiments on six
reasoning benchmark datasets, with GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 being the weaker and
stronger LLMs, respectively, we demonstrate that our proposed LLM cascades can
achieve performance comparable to using solely the stronger LLM but require
only 40% of its cost.]]></summary>

physical parameters to perform intelligent measurements. However, fabricating
ONAs while maintaining design performances is challenging. Limitations in
fabrication techniques often limit the realizable precision of the trained
parameters. Physical constraints may also limit the range of values the
physical parameters can hold. Thus, ONAs should be trained within the
implementable constraints. However, such physics-based constraints reduce the
training objective to a constrained optimization problem, making it harder to
optimize with existing gradient-based methods. To alleviate these critical
issues that degrade performance from simulation to realization we propose a
physics-informed quantization-aware training framework. Our approach accounts
for the physical constraints during the training process, leading to robust
designs. We evaluate our approach on an ONA proposed in the literature, named a
diffractive deep neural network (D2NN), for all-optical phase imaging and for
classification of phase objects. With extensive experiments on different
quantization levels and datasets, we show that our approach leads to ONA

the training of deep neural networks (DNNs), focusing on layer pruning to
simplify DNN architecture and loss landscape. RMT, recently used to address
overfitting in deep learning, enables the examination of DNN's weight layer
spectra. We use these techniques to optimally determine the number of singular
values to be removed from the weight layers of a DNN during training via
singular value decomposition (SVD). This process aids in DNN simplification and
accuracy enhancement, as evidenced by training simple DNN models on the MNIST
and Fashion MNIST datasets.

Our method can be applied to any fully connected or convolutional layer of a
pretrained DNN, decreasing the layer's parameters and simplifying the DNN
architecture while preserving or even enhancing the model's accuracy. By
discarding small singular values based on RMT criteria, the accuracy of the
test set remains consistent, facilitating more efficient DNN training without
compromising performance.

We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence supporting our claim that
the elimination of small singular values based on RMT does not negatively
impact the DNN's accuracy. Our results offer valuable insights into the
practical application of RMT for the creation of more efficient and accurate
deep-learning models.]]></summary>

meta-algorithm for safe exploration, MASE, which combines an unconstrained RL
algorithm with an uncertainty quantifier to guarantee safety in the current
episode while properly penalizing unsafe explorations before actual safety
violation to discourage them in future episodes. The advantage of MASE is that
we can optimize a policy while guaranteeing with a high probability that no
safety constraint will be violated under proper assumptions. Specifically, we
present two variants of MASE with different constructions of the uncertainty
quantifier: one based on generalized linear models with theoretical guarantees
of safety and near-optimality, and another that combines a Gaussian process to
ensure safety with a deep RL algorithm to maximize the reward. Finally, we
demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves better performance than
state-of-the-art algorithms on grid-world and Safety Gym benchmarks without

score computation and propose TacoGFN to explore molecule space efficiently.
Furthermore, we incorporate several rounds of active learning where generated
samples are queried using a docking oracle to improve the docking score
prediction. This approach allows us to accurately explore as much of the
molecule landscape as we can afford computationally. Empirically, molecules
generated using TacoGFN and its variants significantly outperform all baseline
methods across every property (Docking score, QED, SA, Lipinski), while being
orders of magnitude faster.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past decade, machine learning has demonstrated impressive results,
often surpassing human capabilities in sensing tasks relevant to autonomous
flight. Unlike traditional aerospace software, the parameters of machine
learning models are not hand-coded nor derived from physics but learned from
data. They are automatically adjusted during a training phase, and their values
do not usually correspond to physical requirements. As a result, requirements
cannot be directly traced to lines of code, hindering the current bottom-up
aerospace certification paradigm. This paper attempts to address this gap by 1)
demystifying the inner workings and processes to build machine learning models,
2) formally establishing theoretical guarantees given by those processes, and
3) complementing these formal elements with practical considerations to develop
a complete certification argument for safety-critical machine learning systems.
Based on a scalable statistical verifier, our proposed framework is
model-agnostic and tool-independent, making it adaptable to many use cases in
the industry. We demonstrate results on a widespread application in autonomous
flight: vision-based landing.]]></summary>

Neural Networks (GNNs). Recently, unlabeled molecular data has become abundant,
which facilitates the rapid development of self-supervised learning for GNNs in
the chemical domain. In this work, we propose pretraining GNNs at the fragment
level, which serves as a promising middle ground to overcome the limitations of
node-level and graph-level pretraining. Borrowing techniques from recent work
on principle subgraph mining, we obtain a compact vocabulary of prevalent
fragments that span a large pretraining dataset. From the extracted vocabulary,
we introduce several fragment-based contrastive and predictive pretraining
tasks. The contrastive learning task jointly pretrains two different GNNs: one
based on molecular graphs and one based on fragment graphs, which represents
high-order connectivity within molecules. By enforcing the consistency between
the fragment embedding and the aggregated embedding of the corresponding atoms
from the molecular graphs, we ensure that both embeddings capture structural
information at multiple resolutions. The structural information of the fragment
graphs is further exploited to extract auxiliary labels for the graph-level
predictive pretraining. We employ both the pretrained molecular-based and
fragment-based GNNs for downstream prediction, thus utilizing the fragment
information during finetuning. Our models advance the performances on 5 out of
8 common molecular benchmarks and improve the performances on long-range
biological benchmarks by at least 11.5%.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Interactive search can provide a better experience by incorporating
interaction feedback from the users. This can significantly improve search
accuracy as it helps avoid irrelevant information and captures the users'
search intents. Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems use reinforcement
learning (RL) models to incorporate the interactions but focus on item-level
feedback, ignoring the fine-grained information found in sentence-level
feedback. Yet such feedback requires extensive RL action space exploration and
large amounts of annotated data. This work addresses these challenges by
proposing a new deep Q-learning (DQ) approach, DQrank. DQrank adapts BERT-based
models, the SOTA in natural language processing, to select crucial sentences
based on users' engagement and rank the items to obtain more satisfactory
responses. We also propose two mechanisms to better explore optimal actions.
DQrank further utilizes the experience replay mechanism in DQ to store the
feedback sentences to obtain a better initial ranking performance. We validate
the effectiveness of DQrank on three search datasets. The results show that
DQRank performs at least 12% better than the previous SOTA RL approaches. We
also conduct detailed ablation studies. The ablation results demonstrate that
each model component can efficiently extract and accumulate long-term
engagement effects from the users' sentence-level feedback. This structure
offers new technologies with promised performance to construct a search system

particular, we extend mixture thermodynamic and transport laws by creating
learnable physical coefficients, where we use graph neural networks as the

our model evaluations with thermodynamics of binary mixtures, and further
benchmarked multicomponent electrolyte mixtures on their transport properties,
in order to test the model generalizability. We show improved prediction
accuracy and model robustness of DiffMix than its purely data-driven variants.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficient optimization of electrolyte transport
properties, built on the gradient obtained using DiffMix auto-differentiation.
Our simulation runs are then backed up by the data generated by a robotic

expands the predictive modeling methods for chemical mixtures and provides

continuous underlying changes in source code, design, and requirements. Since
manually maintaining software test suites is tedious, timely, and costly,
automating the process of generation and maintenance of test units will
significantly impact the effectiveness and efficiency of software testing
processes.

To this end, we propose an automated approach which exploits both structural
and semantic properties of source code methods and test cases to recommend the
most relevant and useful unit tests to the developers. The proposed approach
initially trains a neural network to transform method-level source code, as
well as unit tests, into distributed representations (embedded vectors) while
preserving the importance of the structure in the code. Retrieving the semantic
and structural properties of a given method, the approach computes cosine
similarity between the method's embedding and the previously-embedded training
instances. Further, according to the similarity scores between the embedding
vectors, the model identifies the closest methods of embedding and the
associated unit tests as the most similar recommendations.

The results on the Methods2Test dataset showed that, while there is no
guarantee to have similar relevant test cases for the group of similar methods,
the proposed approach extracts the most similar existing test cases for a given
method in the dataset, and evaluations show that recommended test cases
decrease the developers' effort to generating expected test cases.]]></summary>

tasks across diverse fields, such as language, vision, and multi-modality. To
minimize the adaption cost for downstream tasks, many Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques are proposed for language and 2D image
pre-trained models. However, the specialized PEFT method for 3D pre-trained
models is still under-explored. To this end, we introduce Point-PEFT, a novel
framework for adapting point cloud pre-trained models with minimal learnable
parameters. Specifically, for a pre-trained 3D model, we freeze most of its
parameters, and only tune the newly added PEFT modules on downstream tasks,
which consist of a Point-prior Prompt and a Geometry-aware Adapter. The
Point-prior Prompt adopts a set of learnable prompt tokens, for which we
propose to construct a memory bank with domain-specific knowledge, and utilize
a parameter-free attention to enhance the prompt tokens. The Geometry-aware
Adapter aims to aggregate point cloud features within spatial neighborhoods to
capture fine-grained geometric information through local interactions.
Extensive experiments indicate that our Point-PEFT can achieve better
performance than the full fine-tuning on various downstream tasks, while using
only 5% of the trainable parameters, demonstrating the efficiency and

regularizer can be systematically linked with the distribution of the data.
With deep neural networks (DNN), complex distributions can be recovered from a

(SGD) for the recovery of deep regularization parameters from a heavily

and powerful black box machine learning models via model distillation. This
paper focuses on using model-based trees as surrogate models which partition
the feature space into interpretable regions via decision rules. Within each
region, interpretable models based on additive main effects are used to
approximate the behavior of the black box model, striking for an optimal
balance between interpretability and performance. Four model-based tree
algorithms, namely SLIM, GUIDE, MOB, and CTree, are compared regarding their
ability to generate such surrogate models. We investigate fidelity,
interpretability, stability, and the algorithms' capability to capture
interaction effects through appropriate splits. Based on our comprehensive
analyses, we finally provide an overview of user-specific recommendations.]]></summary>

with gradient descent (GD) with a step size $\eta$, the operator norm of the
Hessian of the loss grows until it approximately reaches $2/\eta$, after which
it fluctuates around this value. The quantity $2/\eta$ has been called the
"edge of stability" based on consideration of a local quadratic approximation
of the loss. We perform a similar calculation to arrive at an "edge of
stability" for Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), a variant of GD which has
been shown to improve its generalization. Unlike the case for GD, the resulting
SAM-edge depends on the norm of the gradient. Using three deep learning

devices, vehicles, home appliances, and other items embedded with sensors,
software, and connectivity, enabling them to collect and exchange data. IoT
Forensics is collecting and analyzing digital evidence from IoT devices to
investigate cybercrimes, security breaches, and other malicious activities that
may have taken place on these connected devices. In particular, EM-SCA has
become an essential tool for IoT forensics due to its ability to reveal
confidential information about the internal workings of IoT devices without
interfering these devices or wiretapping their networks. However, the accuracy
and reliability of EM-SCA results can be limited by device variability,
environmental factors, and data collection and processing methods. Besides,
there is very few research on these limitations that affects significantly the
accuracy of EM-SCA approaches for the crossed-IoT device portability as well as
limited research on the possible solutions to address such challenge.
Therefore, this empirical study examines the impact of device variability on
the accuracy and reliability of EM-SCA approaches, in particular
machine-learning (ML) based approaches for EM-SCA. We firstly presents the
background, basic concepts and techniques used to evaluate the limitations of
current EM-SCA approaches and datasets. Our study then addresses one of the
most important limitation, which is caused by the multi-core architecture of
the processors (SoC). We present an approach to collect the EM-SCA datasets and
demonstrate the feasibility of using transfer learning to obtain more
meaningful and reliable results from EM-SCA in IoT forensics of crossed-IoT
devices. Our study moreover contributes a new dataset for using deep learning
models in analysing Electromagnetic Side-Channel data with regards to the
cross-device portability matter.]]></summary>

in the form of searching for visual causal transitions between an initial
visual state and a final visual goal state. It has become increasingly
important in egocentric vision with its advantages in guiding agents to perform
daily tasks in complex environments. In this paper, we propose an interpretable
and generalizable visual planning framework consisting of i) a novel
Substitution-based Concept Learner (SCL) that abstracts visual inputs into
disentangled concept representations, ii) symbol abstraction and reasoning that
performs task planning via the self-learned symbols, and iii) a Visual Causal
Transition model (ViCT) that grounds visual causal transitions to semantically
similar real-world actions. Given an initial state, we perform goal-conditioned
visual planning with a symbolic reasoning method fueled by the learned
representations and causal transitions to reach the goal state. To verify the
effectiveness of the proposed model, we collect a large-scale visual planning
dataset based on AI2-THOR, dubbed as CCTP. Extensive experiments on this
challenging dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our method in
visual task planning. Empirically, we show that our framework can generalize to
unseen task trajectories and unseen object categories.]]></summary>

language models (LLMs). By presenting a prompt that includes multiple
input-output pairs as examples and introducing a new query input, models can
generate the corresponding output. However, the performance of models heavily
relies on the quality of the input prompt when implementing in-context
learning. Biased or imbalanced input prompts can significantly degrade the
performance of language models. To address this issue, we introduce a
reweighted algorithm called RICL (Reweighted In-context Learning). This
algorithm fine-tunes language models using an unbiased validation set to
determine the optimal weight for each input-output example to approximate
unbiased in-context learning. Furthermore, we also introduce a low-cost
reweighted algorithm, a linear optimal weight approximation algorithm called
LARICL (Linear Approximation of Reweighted In-context Learning). This algorithm
requires minimal training cost while providing effective results. We prove the
convergence of our algorithm and validate its performance through experiments
conducted on a numerical dataset. The experimental findings reveal a
substantial improvement in comparison to benchmarks including the performance
of casual prompt-based in-context learning and the performance of a classic

whether the new explanation techniques can significantly outperform their
predecessors. Our study proposes a new taxonomy for evaluating local
explanations: robustness, evaluation using ground truth from synthetic datasets
and interpretable models, model randomization, and human-grounded evaluation.
Using this proposed taxonomy, we highlight that all categories of evaluation
methods, except those based on the ground truth from interpretable models,
suffer from a problem we call the "blame problem." In our study, we argue that
this category of evaluation measure is a more reasonable method for evaluating

performance of deep neural networks in areas such as uncertainty
quantification, variable selection, and large-scale network compression.
However, most existing research has focused on problems where the observations
are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and there has been little
work on the problems where the observations are dependent, such as time series
data and sequential data in natural language processing. This paper aims to
address this gap by studying the theory for sparse deep learning with dependent
data. We show that sparse recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can be consistently
estimated, and their predictions are asymptotically normally distributed under
appropriate assumptions, enabling the prediction uncertainty to be correctly
quantified. Our numerical results show that sparse deep learning outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, such as conformal predictions, in prediction
uncertainty quantification for time series data. Furthermore, our results
indicate that the proposed method can consistently identify the autoregressive
order for time series data and outperform existing methods in large-scale model
compression. Our proposed method has important practical implications in fields
such as finance, healthcare, and energy, where both accurate point estimates

about individual objects. This enables explicit relational reasoning,
supporting abstraction and generalization from limited data. The Abstractor is
first evaluated on simple discriminative relational tasks and compared to
existing relational architectures. Next, the Abstractor is evaluated on purely
relational sequence-to-sequence tasks, where dramatic improvements are seen in
sample efficiency compared to standard Transformers. Finally, Abstractors are
evaluated on a collection of tasks based on mathematical problem solving, where
modest but consistent improvements in performance and sample efficiency are
observed.]]></summary>

representation learning method. However, it has been shown that GCL is
vulnerable to adversarial attacks on both the graph structure and node
attributes. Although empirical approaches have been proposed to enhance the
robustness of GCL, the certifiable robustness of GCL is still remain
unexplored. In this paper, we develop the first certifiably robust framework in
GCL. Specifically, we first propose a unified criteria to evaluate and certify
the robustness of GCL. We then introduce a novel technique, RES (Randomized
Edgedrop Smoothing), to ensure certifiable robustness for any GCL model, and
this certified robustness can be provably preserved in downstream tasks.
Furthermore, an effective training method is proposed for robust GCL. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed method in providing effective certifiable robustness and enhancing the
robustness of any GCL model. The source code of RES is available at

being one of the most aggressive forms. Accurate determination of the
O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status is
crucial for personalized treatment strategies. However, traditional methods are
labor-intensive and time-consuming. This paper proposes a novel multi-modal
approach, BTDNet, leveraging multi-parametric MRI scans, including FLAIR, T1w,
T1wCE, and T2 3D volumes, to predict MGMT promoter methylation status. BTDNet
addresses two main challenges: the variable volume lengths (i.e., each volume
consists of a different number of slices) and the volume-level annotations
(i.e., the whole 3D volume is annotated and not the independent slices that it
consists of). BTDNet consists of four components: i) the data augmentation one
(that performs geometric transformations, convex combinations of data pairs and
test-time data augmentation); ii) the 3D analysis one (that performs global
analysis through a CNN-RNN); iii) the routing one (that contains a mask layer
that handles variable input feature lengths), and iv) the modality fusion one
(that effectively enhances data representation, reduces ambiguities and
mitigates data scarcity). The proposed method outperforms by large margins the
state-of-the-art methods in the RSNA-ASNR-MICCAI BraTS 2021 Challenge, offering
a promising avenue for enhancing brain tumor diagnosis and treatment.]]></summary>

improve frailty, sarcopenia, and balance. Accurate monitoring of patient
involvement in OEP is challenging, as self-reports (diaries) are often
unreliable. With the development of wearable sensors, Human Activity
Recognition (HAR) systems using wearable sensors have revolutionized
healthcare. However, their usage for OEP still shows limited performance. The
objective of this study is to build an unobtrusive and accurate system to
monitor OEP for older adults. Data was collected from older adults wearing a
single waist-mounted Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Two datasets were
collected, one in a laboratory setting, and one at the homes of the patients. A
hierarchical system is proposed with two stages: 1) using a deep learning model
to recognize whether the patients are performing OEP or activities of daily
life (ADLs) using a 10-minute sliding window; 2) based on stage 1, using a
6-second sliding window to recognize the OEP sub-classes performed. The results
showed that in stage 1, OEP could be recognized with window-wise f1-scores over
0.95 and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) f1-scores over 0.85 for both datasets.
In stage 2, for the home scenario, four activities could be recognized with
f1-scores over 0.8: ankle plantarflexors, abdominal muscles, knee bends, and
sit-to-stand. The results showed the potential of monitoring the compliance of
OEP using a single IMU in daily life. Also, some OEP sub-classes are possible
to be recognized for further analysis.]]></summary>

learning. In contrast to the classic pretraining-then-finetuning procedure, in
order to use LLMs for downstream prediction tasks, one only needs to provide a
few demonstrations, known as in-context examples, without adding more or
updating existing model parameters. This in-context learning (ICL) capability
of LLMs is intriguing, and it is not yet fully understood how pretrained LLMs
acquire such capabilities. In this paper, we investigate the reason why a
transformer-based language model can accomplish in-context learning after
pre-training on a general language corpus by proposing one hypothesis that LLMs
can simulate kernel regression with internal representations when faced with
in-context examples. More concretely, we first prove that Bayesian inference on
in-context prompts can be asymptotically understood as kernel regression $\hat
y = \sum_i y_i K(x, x_i)/\sum_i K(x, x_i)$ as the number of in-context
demonstrations grows. Then, we empirically investigate the in-context behaviors
of language models. We find that during ICL, the attention and hidden features
in LLMs match the behaviors of a kernel regression. Finally, our theory
provides insights into multiple phenomena observed in the ICL field: why
retrieving demonstrative samples similar to test samples can help, why ICL
performance is sensitive to the output formats, and why ICL accuracy benefits
from selecting in-distribution and representative samples.]]></summary>

accuracy, generative abilities, and robustness. These methods have many
theoretical justifications. Here we introduce a unifying principle rooted in
information theory to rederive and generalize existing variational methods and
design new ones. We base our framework on an interpretation of the multivariate
information bottleneck, in which two Bayesian networks are traded off against
one another. We interpret the first network as an encoder graph, which
specifies what information to keep when compressing the data. We interpret the
second network as a decoder graph, which specifies a generative model for the
data. Using this framework, we rederive existing dimensionality reduction
methods such as the deep variational information bottleneck (DVIB), beta
variational auto-encoders (beta-VAE), and deep variational canonical
correlation analysis (DVCCA). The framework naturally introduces a trade-off
parameter between compression and reconstruction in the DVCCA family of
algorithms, resulting in the new beta-DVCCA family. In addition, we derive a
new variational dimensionality reduction method, deep variational symmetric
informational bottleneck (DVSIB), which simultaneously compresses two variables
to preserve information between their compressed representations. We implement
all of these algorithms and evaluate their ability to produce shared low
dimensional latent spaces on a modified noisy MNIST dataset. We show that
algorithms that are better matched to the structure of the data (beta-DVCCA and
DVSIB) produce better latent spaces as measured by classification accuracy and
the dimensionality of the latent variables. We believe that this framework can
be used to unify other multi-view representation learning algorithms.
Additionally, it provides a straightforward framework for deriving
problem-specific loss functions.]]></summary>

limitations in learning long-term dependencies which have been addressed by
memory structures in long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Neural Turing
machines (NTMs) are novel RNNs that implement the notion of programmable
computers with neural network controllers that can learn simple algorithmic
tasks. Matrix neural networks feature matrix representation which inherently
preserves the spatial structure of data when compared to canonical neural
networks that use vector-based representation. One may then argue that neural
networks with matrix representations may have the potential to provide better
memory capacity. In this paper, we define and study a probabilistic notion of
memory capacity based on Fisher information for matrix-based RNNs. We find
bounds on memory capacity for such networks under various hypotheses and
compare them with their vector counterparts. In particular, we show that the
memory capacity of such networks is bounded by $N^2$ for $N\times N$ state
matrix which generalizes the one known for vector networks. We also show and
analyze the increase in memory capacity for such networks which is introduced
when one exhibits an external state memory, such as NTMs. Consequently, we
construct NTMs with RNN controllers with matrix-based representation of
external memory, leading us to introduce Matrix NTMs. We demonstrate the
performance of this class of memory networks under certain algorithmic learning
tasks such as copying and recall and compare it with Matrix RNNs. We find an
improvement in the performance of Matrix NTMs by the addition of external

circuit lower bounds for \Lambda imply efficient algorithms for learning
\Lambda-circuits, but only over the uniform distribution, with membership
queries, and provided \AC^0[p] \subseteq \Lambda. We consider whether this
implication can be generalized to \Lambda \not\supseteq \AC^0[p], and to
learning algorithms in Valiant's PAC model, which use only random examples and
learn over arbitrary example distributions. We give results of both positive
and negative flavor.

On the negative side, we observe that if, for every circuit class \Lambda,
the implication from natural proofs for \Lambda to learning \Lambda-circuits in
Valiant's PAC model holds, then there is a polynomial time solution to
O(n^{1.5})-uSVP (unique Shortest Vector Problem), and polynomial time quantum
solutions to O(n^{1.5})-SVP (Shortest Vector Problem) and O(n^{1.5})-SIVP
(Shortest Independent Vector Problem). This indicates that whether natural
proofs for \Lambda imply efficient learning algorithms for \Lambda in Valiant's
PAC model may depend on \Lambda.

On the positive side, our main result is that specific natural proofs arising
from a type of communication complexity argument (e.g., Nisan (1993), for
depth-2 majority circuits) imply PAC-learning algorithms in a new
distributional variant of Valiant's model. Our distributional PAC model is
stronger than the average-case prediction model of Blum et al (1993) and the
heuristic PAC model of Nanashima (2021), and has several important properties
which make it of independent interest, such as being boosting-friendly. The
main applications of our result are new distributional PAC-learning algorithms
for depth-2 majority circuits, polytopes and DNFs over natural target
distributions, as well as the nonexistence of encoded-input weak PRFs that can
be evaluated by depth-2 majority circuits.]]></summary>

compression with compressed sensing (CS) methods to reduce the number of data

sparse, or they have been sparsified before compression. However, it is unclear
whether linear compression with CS-based reconstruction is more effective than
directly sending the non-zero elements in the sparsified update vectors, under
the same total power constraint. In this study, we examine and compare several
communication designs with or without sparsification. Our findings demonstrate
that sparsification before compression is not necessary. Alternatively,

transformers with the use of intermediate representations to create a model
capable of cross architecture function search without the need for manual
feature engineering, pre-training or a dynamic analysis step. We compare our
approach against a series of baseline approaches for two tasks; A general
function search task and a targeted vulnerability search task. Our approach
demonstrates strong performance across both tasks, performing better than all
baseline approaches.]]></summary>

fundamentally new capabilities, but also significantly increases the memory
footprints of training. Previous model-parallel systems such as Megatron-LM
partition and compute different attention heads in parallel, resulting in large
communication volumes, so they cannot scale beyond the number of attention
heads, thereby hindering its adoption. In this paper, we introduce a new
approach, LightSeq, for long-context LLMs training. LightSeq has many notable
advantages. First, LightSeq partitions over the sequence dimension, hence is
agnostic to model architectures and readily applicable for models with varying
numbers of attention heads, such as Multi-Head, Multi-Query and Grouped-Query
attention. Second, LightSeq not only requires up to 4.7x less communication
than Megatron-LM on popular LLMs but also overlaps the communication with
computation. To further reduce the training time, LightSeq features a novel
gradient checkpointing scheme to bypass an forward computation for
memory-efficient attention. We evaluate LightSeq on Llama-7B and its variants
with sequence lengths from 32K to 512K. Through comprehensive experiments on
single and cross-node training, we show that LightSeq achieves up to 1.24-2.01x
end-to-end speedup, and a 2-8x longer sequence length on models with fewer
heads, compared to Megatron-LM. Codes will be available at

actions. Our models in addition to playing well on gym-Atari environments, also
provide insights on how agent perceives its environment. In addition, motivated
by recent developments in attention based video-classification models using

potential to facilitate drug discovery by screening a large chemical space in
silico. A successful approach for representing molecules is to treat them as a
graph and utilize graph neural networks. One of the key limitations of such
methods is the necessity to represent compounds with different numbers of
atoms, which requires aggregating the atom's information. Common aggregation
operators, such as averaging, result in loss of information at the atom level.
In this work, we propose a novel aggregating approach where each atom is
weighted non-linearly using the Boltzmann distribution with a hyperparameter
analogous to temperature. We show that using this weighted aggregation improves
the ability of the gold standard message-passing neural network to predict
antibiotic activity. Moreover, by changing the temperature hyperparameter, our
approach can reveal the atoms that are important for activity prediction in a
smooth and consistent way, thus providing a novel, regulated attention
mechanism for graph neural networks. We further validate our method by showing
that it recapitulates the functional group in beta-Lactam antibiotics. The
ability of our approach to rank the atoms' importance for a desired function
can be used within any graph neural network to provide interpretability of the
results and predictions at the node level.]]></summary>

applications in machine learning and AI, as well as its ability to address the
shortcomings of stochastic algorithms based on empirical risk minimization.
However, current research on FCCO presumes that both the inner and outer
functions are smooth, limiting their potential to tackle a more diverse set of

weakly-convex FCCO, where the outer function is weakly convex and
non-decreasing, and the inner function is weakly-convex. We analyze a
single-loop algorithm and establish its complexity for finding an
$\epsilon$-stationary point of the Moreau envelop of the objective function.
Additionally, we also extend the algorithm to solving novel non-smooth
weakly-convex tri-level finite-sum coupled compositional optimization problems,
which feature a nested arrangement of three functions. Lastly, we explore the

tuning of these models for diverse downstream applications has emerged as a
pivotal research concern. Although recent investigations into prompt tuning
have provided promising avenues, three salient challenges persist: (1) memory
constraint: the continuous growth in the size of open-source PTMs renders
fine-tuning, even a fraction of their parameters, challenging for many
practitioners. (2) model privacy: existing PTMs often function as public API
services, with their parameters inaccessible for effective or tailored
fine-tuning. (3) data privacy: the fine-tuning of PTMs necessitates
high-quality datasets, which are typically localized and not shared to public.
To optimally harness each local dataset while navigating memory constraints and
preserving privacy, we propose Federated Black-Box Prompt Tuning (Fed-BBPT).
This innovative approach eschews reliance on parameter architectures and
private dataset access, instead capitalizing on a central server that aids
local users in collaboratively training a prompt generator through regular
aggregation. Local users leverage API-driven learning via a zero-order
optimizer, obviating the need for PTM deployment. Relative to extensive
fine-tuning, Fed-BBPT proficiently sidesteps memory challenges tied to PTM
storage and fine-tuning on local machines, tapping into comprehensive,
high-quality, yet private training datasets. A thorough evaluation across 40
datasets spanning CV and NLP tasks underscores the robustness of our proposed
model.]]></summary>

new opportunities for individuals and businesses to improve natural language
processing, interact with data, and retrieve information faster. However,
training or fine-tuning LLMs requires a vast amount of data, which can be
challenging to access due to legal or technical restrictions and may require
private computing resources. Federated Learning (FL) is a solution designed to
overcome these challenges and expand data access for deep learning
applications.

This paper takes a hardware-centric approach to explore how LLMs can be
brought to modern edge computing systems. Our study fine-tunes the FLAN-T5
model family, ranging from 80M to 3B parameters, using FL for a text
summarization task. We provide a micro-level hardware benchmark, compare the
model FLOP utilization to a state-of-the-art data center GPU, and study the
network utilization in realistic conditions. Our contribution is twofold:
First, we evaluate the current capabilities of edge computing systems and their
potential for LLM FL workloads. Second, by comparing these systems with a
data-center GPU, we demonstrate the potential for improvement and the next
steps toward achieving greater computational efficiency at the edge.]]></summary>

applications. Existing methods predominantly employ discriminative modeling and
operate under the assumption of a fixed target column, necessitating
re-training for every new predictive task. Inspired by the generative power of
large language models (LLMs), this paper exploits the idea of building
universal tabular data predictors based on generative modeling, namely
UniPredict. Here, we show that scaling up an LLM to extensive tabular datasets
with the capability of comprehending diverse tabular inputs and predicting for
target variables following the input instructions. Specifically, we train a
single LLM on an aggregation of 169 tabular datasets with diverse targets and
compare its performance against baselines that are trained on each dataset
separately. We observe this versatile UniPredict model demonstrates an
advantage over other models, ranging from 5.4% to 13.4%, when compared with the
best tree-boosting baseline and the best neural network baseline, respectively.
We further test UniPredict in few-shot learning settings on another 62 tabular
datasets. Our method achieves strong performance in quickly adapting to new
tasks, where our method outperforms XGBoost over 100% on the low-resource setup
and shows a significant margin over all baselines. We envision that UniPredict
sheds light on developing a universal tabular data prediction system that

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Various data imbalances that naturally arise in a multi-territory
personalized recommender system can lead to a significant item bias for
globally prevalent items. A locally popular item can be overshadowed by a
globally prevalent item. Moreover, users' viewership patterns/statistics can
drastically change from one geographic location to another which may suggest to
learn specific user embeddings. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning
(MTL) technique, along with an adaptive upsampling method to reduce popularity
bias in multi-territory recommendations. Our proposed framework is designed to
enrich training examples with active users representation through upsampling,
and capable of learning geographic-based user embeddings by leveraging MTL.
Through experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
multiple territories compared to a baseline not incorporating our proposed
techniques.~Noticeably, we show improved relative gain of up to $65.27\%$ in
PR-AUC metric. A case study is presented to demonstrate the advantages of our
methods in attenuating the popularity bias of global items.]]></summary>

revolutionising the analysis and interpretation of biological data over time.
In our article review, we delve into various aspects of deep learning in
computational biology. Specifically, we examine its history, advantages, and
challenges. Our focus is on two primary applications: DNA sequence
classification and prediction, as well as protein structure prediction from
sequence data. Additionally, we provide insights into the outlook for this
field. To fully harness the potential of deep learning in computational
biology, it is crucial to address the challenges that come with it. These
challenges include the requirement for large, labelled datasets and the
interpretability of deep learning models. The use of deep learning in the
analysis of DNA sequences has brought about a significant transformation in the
detection of genomic variants and the analysis of gene expression. This has
greatly contributed to the advancement of personalised medicine and drug
discovery. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be highly
accurate in predicting genetic variations and gene expression levels. Deep
learning techniques are used for analysing epigenetic data, including DNA
methylation and histone modifications. This provides valuable insights into
metabolic conditions and gene regulation. The field of protein structure
prediction has been significantly impacted by deep learning, which has enabled
accurate determination of the three-dimensional shape of proteins and
prediction of their interactions. The future of deep learning in computational
biology looks promising. With the development of advanced deep learning models
and interpretation techniques, there is potential to overcome current

adhering to manufacturing rules and job specifications. This optimization leads
to reduced operational costs, improved customer demand fulfillment, and
enhanced production efficiency. However, machine scheduling remains a
challenging combinatorial problem due to its NP-hard nature. Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL), a key component of artificial general intelligence, has shown
promise in various domains like gaming and robotics. Researchers have explored
applying DRL to machine scheduling problems since 1995. This paper offers a
comprehensive review and comparison of DRL-based approaches, highlighting their
methodology, applications, advantages, and limitations. It categorizes these
approaches based on computational components: conventional neural networks,
encoder-decoder architectures, graph neural networks, and metaheuristic
algorithms. Our review concludes that DRL-based methods outperform exact
solvers, heuristics, and tabular reinforcement learning algorithms in terms of
computation speed and generating near-global optimal solutions. These DRL-based
approaches have been successfully applied to static and dynamic scheduling
across diverse machine environments and job characteristics. However, DRL-based
schedulers face limitations in handling complex operational constraints,
configurable multi-objective optimization, generalization, scalability,
interpretability, and robustness. Addressing these challenges will be a crucial
focus for future research in this field. This paper serves as a valuable
resource for researchers to assess the current state of DRL-based machine
scheduling and identify research gaps. It also aids experts and practitioners
in selecting the appropriate DRL approach for production scheduling.]]></summary>

have drawn growing interests in the field of generative modeling due to its
flexibility in the formulation and strong modeling power of the latent space.
However, the common practice of learning latent space EBMs with non-convergent
short-run MCMC for prior and posterior sampling is hindering the model from
further progress; the degenerate MCMC sampling quality in practice often leads
to degraded generation quality and instability in training, especially with
highly multi-modal and/or high-dimensional target distributions. To remedy this
sampling issue, in this paper we introduce a simple but effective
diffusion-based amortization method for long-run MCMC sampling and develop a
novel learning algorithm for the latent space EBM based on it. We provide
theoretical evidence that the learned amortization of MCMC is a valid long-run
MCMC sampler. Experiments on several image modeling benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared with strong

human-interpretable features as part of their internal representations of data.
As having the right (or wrong) concepts is critical to trustworthy machine
learning systems, it is natural to ask which inputs from the model's original
training set were most important for learning a concept at a given layer. To
answer this, we combine data attribution methods with methods for probing the
concepts learned by a model. Training network and probe ensembles for two
concept datasets on a range of network layers, we use the recently developed
TRAK method for large-scale data attribution. We find some evidence for
convergence, where removing the 10,000 top attributing images for a concept and
retraining the model does not change the location of the concept in the network
nor the probing sparsity of the concept. This suggests that rather than being
highly dependent on a few specific examples, the features that inform the
development of a concept are spread in a more diffuse manner across its
exemplars, implying robustness in concept formation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Traditional deep learning (DL) suffers from two core problems. Firstly, it
assumes training samples are independent and identically distributed. However,
numerous real-world datasets group samples by shared measurements (e.g., study
participants or cells), violating this assumption. In these scenarios, DL can
show compromised performance, limited generalization, and interpretability
issues, coupled with cluster confounding causing Type 1 and 2 errors. Secondly,
models are typically trained for overall accuracy, often neglecting
underrepresented groups and introducing biases in crucial areas like loan
approvals or determining health insurance rates, such biases can significantly
impact one's quality of life. To address both of these challenges
simultaneously, we present a mixed effects deep learning (MEDL) framework. MEDL
separately quantifies cluster-invariant fixed effects (FE) and cluster-specific
random effects (RE) through the introduction of: 1) a cluster adversary which
encourages the learning of cluster-invariant FE, 2) a Bayesian neural network
which quantifies the RE, and a mixing function combining the FE an RE into a
mixed-effect prediction. We marry this MEDL with adversarial debiasing, which
promotes equality-of-odds fairness across FE, RE, and ME predictions for
fairness-sensitive variables. We evaluated our approach using three datasets:
two from census/finance focusing on income classification and one from
healthcare predicting hospitalization duration, a regression task. Our
framework notably enhances fairness across all sensitive variables-increasing
fairness up to 82% for age, 43% for race, 86% for sex, and 27% for
marital-status. Besides promoting fairness, our method maintains the robust
performance and clarity of MEDL. It's versatile, suitable for various dataset
types and tasks, making it broadly applicable. Our GitHub repository houses the
implementation.]]></summary>

potential to alleviate the workload of doctors and facilitate diagnoses of
patients. However, two challenges arise when deploying deep learning models to
real-world healthcare applications. First, neural models tend to learn spurious
correlations instead of desired features, which could fall short when
generalizing to new domains (e.g., patients with different ages). Second, these
black-box models lack interpretability. When making diagnostic predictions, it
is important to understand why a model makes a decision for trustworthy and
safety considerations. In this paper, to address these two limitations, we
propose a new paradigm to build robust and interpretable medical image
classifiers with natural language concepts. Specifically, we first query
clinical concepts from GPT-4, then transform latent image features into
explicit concepts with a vision-language model. We systematically evaluate our
method on eight medical image classification datasets to verify its
effectiveness. On challenging datasets with strong confounding factors, our
method can mitigate spurious correlations thus substantially outperform
standard visual encoders and other baselines. Finally, we show how
classification with a small number of concepts brings a level of
interpretability for understanding model decisions through case studies in real
medical data.]]></summary>

stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to generate data from noise. Although
diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years, they have
limitations in the unpaired image-to-image translation tasks due to the
Gaussian prior assumption. Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB), which learns an SDE to
translate between two arbitrary distributions, have risen as an attractive
solution to this problem. However, none of SB models so far have been
successful at unpaired translation between high-resolution images. In this
work, we propose the Unpaired Neural Schr\"odinger Bridge (UNSB), which
expresses SB problem as a sequence of adversarial learning problems. This
allows us to incorporate advanced discriminators and regularization to learn a
SB between unpaired data. We demonstrate that UNSB is scalable and successfully
solves various unpaired image-to-image translation tasks. Code:

Our algorithm outperforms baselines significantly, as evidenced by experiments

share, read, and engage with short posts called tweets. For the ACM Recommender
Systems Conference 2020, Twitter published a dataset around 70 GB in size for
the annual RecSys Challenge. In 2020, the RecSys Challenge invited
participating teams to create models that would predict engagement likelihoods
for given user-tweet combinations. The submitted models predicting like, reply,
retweet, and quote engagements were evaluated based on two metrics: area under
the precision-recall curve (PRAUC) and relative cross-entropy (RCE).

In this diploma thesis, we used the RecSys 2020 Challenge dataset and
evaluation procedure to investigate how well context alone may be used to
predict tweet engagement likelihood. In doing so, we employed the Spark engine
on TU Wien's Little Big Data Cluster to create scalable data preprocessing,
feature engineering, feature selection, and machine learning pipelines. We
manually created just under 200 additional features to describe tweet context.

The results indicate that features describing users' prior engagement history
and the popularity of hashtags and links in the tweet were the most
informative. We also found that factors such as the prediction algorithm,
training dataset size, training dataset sampling method, and feature selection
significantly affect the results. After comparing the best results of our
context-only prediction models with content-only models and with models
developed by the Challenge winners, we identified that the context-based models
underperformed in terms of the RCE score. This work thus concludes by situating
this discrepancy and proposing potential improvements to our implementation,
which is shared in a public git repository.]]></summary>

computer network from various cyber security threats and network attacks.
However, consider an unfortunate situation where the NIDS is itself attacked
and vulnerable more specifically, we can say, How to defend the defender?. In
Adversarial Machine Learning (AML), the malicious actors aim to fool the
Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models to produce incorrect
predictions with intentionally crafted adversarial examples. These adversarial
perturbed examples have become the biggest vulnerability of ML and DL based
systems and are major obstacles to their adoption in real-time and
mission-critical applications such as NIDS. AML is an emerging research domain,
and it has become a necessity for the in-depth study of adversarial attacks and
their defence strategies to safeguard the computer network from various cyber
security threads. In this research work, we aim to cover important aspects
related to NIDS, adversarial attacks and its defence mechanism to increase the
robustness of the ML and DL based NIDS. We implemented four powerful
adversarial attack techniques, namely, Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM),
Jacobian Saliency Map Attack (JSMA), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) and
Carlini & Wagner (C&W) in NIDS. We analyzed its performance in terms of various
performance metrics in detail. Furthermore, the three heuristics defence
strategies, i.e., Adversarial Training (AT), Gaussian Data Augmentation (GDA)
and High Confidence (HC), are implemented to improve the NIDS robustness under
adversarial attack situations. The complete workflow is demonstrated in
real-time network with data packet flow. This research work provides the
overall background for the researchers interested in AML and its implementation

evaluation scores across replicated model training runs -- is affected by
several sources of nondeterminism which can be regarded as measurement noise.
Current tendencies to remove noise in order to enforce reproducibility of
research results neglect inherent nondeterminism at the implementation level
and disregard crucial interaction effects between algorithmic noise factors and
data properties. This limits the scope of conclusions that can be drawn from
such experiments. Instead of removing noise, we propose to incorporate several
sources of variance, including their interaction with data properties, into an
analysis of significance and reliability of machine learning evaluation, with
the aim to draw inferences beyond particular instances of trained models. We
show how to use linear mixed effects models (LMEMs) to analyze performance
evaluation scores, and to conduct statistical inference with a generalized
likelihood ratio test (GLRT). This allows us to incorporate arbitrary sources
of noise like meta-parameter variations into statistical significance testing,
and to assess performance differences conditional on data properties.
Furthermore, a variance component analysis (VCA) enables the analysis of the
contribution of noise sources to overall variance and the computation of a
reliability coefficient by the ratio of substantial to total variance.]]></summary>

multiple clients to collaboratively train a shared model with their local data.
Nonetheless, conventional federated learning algorithms often struggle to

the training data of each client originates from different domains. We address
the challenges of domain shift by leveraging the technique of prompt learning,
and propose a novel method called Federated Dual Prompt Tuning (Fed-DPT).
Specifically, Fed-DPT employs a pre-trained vision-language model and then
applies both visual and textual prompt tuning to facilitate domain adaptation
over decentralized data. Extensive experiments of Fed-DPT demonstrate its
significant effectiveness in domain-aware federated learning. With a
pre-trained CLIP model (ViT-Base as image encoder), the proposed Fed-DPT
attains 68.4% average accuracy over six domains in the DomainNet dataset, which
improves the original CLIP by a large margin of 14.8%.]]></summary>

a fundamental problem in computational science and engineering. This task may
be cast as an optimization problem over all probability measures, and an
initial distribution can be evolved to the desired minimizer dynamically via
gradient flows. Mean-field models, whose law is governed by the gradient flow
in the space of probability measures, may also be identified; particle
approximations of these mean-field models form the basis of algorithms. The
gradient flow approach is also the basis of algorithms for variational
inference, in which the optimization is performed over a parameterized family
of probability distributions such as Gaussians, and the underlying gradient
flow is restricted to the parameterized family.

By choosing different energy functionals and metrics for the gradient flow,
different algorithms with different convergence properties arise. In this
paper, we concentrate on the Kullback-Leibler divergence after showing that, up
to scaling, it has the unique property that the gradient flows resulting from
this choice of energy do not depend on the normalization constant. For the
metrics, we focus on variants of the Fisher-Rao, Wasserstein, and Stein
metrics; we introduce the affine invariance property for gradient flows, and
their corresponding mean-field models, determine whether a given metric leads
to affine invariance, and modify it to make it affine invariant if it does not.
We study the resulting gradient flows in both probability density space and
Gaussian space. The flow in the Gaussian space may be understood as a Gaussian
approximation of the flow. We demonstrate that the Gaussian approximation based
on the metric and through moment closure coincide, establish connections
between them, and study their long-time convergence properties showing the
advantages of affine invariance.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Measures of power grid vulnerability are often assessed by the amount of
damage an adversary can exact on the network. However, the cascading impact of
such attacks is often overlooked, even though cascades are one of the primary
causes of large-scale blackouts. This paper explores modifications of
transmission line protection settings as candidates for adversarial attacks,
which can remain undetectable as long as the network equilibrium state remains
unaltered. This forms the basis of a black-box function in a Bayesian
optimization procedure, where the objective is to find protection settings that
maximize network degradation due to cascading. Notably, our proposed method is
agnostic to the choice of the cascade simulator and its underlying assumptions.
Numerical experiments reveal that, against conventional wisdom, maximally
misconfiguring the protection settings of all network lines does not cause the
most cascading. More surprisingly, even when the degree of misconfiguration is
limited due to resource constraints, it is still possible to find settings that
produce cascades comparable in severity to instances where there are no
resource constraints.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi-fidelity (MF) methods are gaining popularity for enhancing surrogate
modeling and design optimization by incorporating data from various
low-fidelity (LF) models. While most existing MF methods assume a fixed
dataset, adaptive sampling methods that dynamically allocate resources among
fidelity models can achieve higher efficiency in the exploring and exploiting
the design space. However, most existing MF methods rely on the hierarchical
assumption of fidelity levels or fail to capture the intercorrelation between
multiple fidelity levels and utilize it to quantify the value of the future
samples and navigate the adaptive sampling. To address this hurdle, we propose
a framework hinged on a latent embedding for different fidelity models and the
associated pre-posterior analysis to explicitly utilize their correlation for
adaptive sampling. In this framework, each infill sampling iteration includes
two steps: We first identify the location of interest with the greatest
potential improvement using the high-fidelity (HF) model, then we search for
the next sample across all fidelity levels that maximize the improvement per
unit cost at the location identified in the first step. This is made possible
by a single Latent Variable Gaussian Process (LVGP) model that maps different
fidelity models into an interpretable latent space to capture their
correlations without assuming hierarchical fidelity levels. The LVGP enables us
to assess how LF sampling candidates will affect HF response with pre-posterior
analysis and determine the next sample with the best benefit-to-cost ratio.
Through test cases, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the
benchmark methods in both MF global fitting (GF) and Bayesian Optimization (BO)
problems in convergence rate and robustness. Moreover, the method offers the
flexibility to switch between GF and BO by simply changing the acquisition
function.]]></summary>

computation (ABC), synthetic likelihood, and neural posterior estimation (NPE)
rely on simulating statistics to infer parameters of intractable likelihood
models. However, such methods are known to yield untrustworthy and misleading
inference outcomes under model misspecification, thus hindering their
widespread applicability. In this work, we propose the first general approach
to handle model misspecification that works across different classes of SBI
methods. Leveraging the fact that the choice of statistics determines the
degree of misspecification in SBI, we introduce a regularized loss function
that penalises those statistics that increase the mismatch between the data and
the model. Taking NPE and ABC as use cases, we demonstrate the superior
performance of our method on high-dimensional time-series models that are
artificially misspecified. We also apply our method to real data from the field
of radio propagation where the model is known to be misspecified. We show
empirically that the method yields robust inference in misspecified scenarios,
whilst still being accurate when the model is well-specified.]]></summary>

if human decision-makers comply perfectly with algorithmic decisions. However,
perfect compliance with the algorithm is rarely a reality or even a desirable
outcome in human-AI collaboration. Yet, recent studies have shown that
selective compliance with fair algorithms can amplify discrimination relative
to the prior human policy. As a consequence, ensuring equitable outcomes
requires fundamentally different algorithmic design principles that ensure
robustness to the decision-maker's (a priori unknown) compliance pattern. We
define the notion of compliance-robustly fair algorithmic recommendations that
are guaranteed to (weakly) improve fairness in decisions, regardless of the
human's compliance pattern. We propose a simple optimization strategy to
identify the best performance-improving compliance-robustly fair policy.
However, we show that it may be infeasible to design algorithmic
recommendations that are simultaneously fair in isolation, compliance-robustly
fair, and more accurate than the human policy; thus, if our goal is to improve
the equity and accuracy of human-AI collaboration, it may not be desirable to
enforce traditional fairness constraints.]]></summary>

have drawn growing interests in the field of generative modeling due to its
flexibility in the formulation and strong modeling power of the latent space.
However, the common practice of learning latent space EBMs with non-convergent
short-run MCMC for prior and posterior sampling is hindering the model from
further progress; the degenerate MCMC sampling quality in practice often leads
to degraded generation quality and instability in training, especially with
highly multi-modal and/or high-dimensional target distributions. To remedy this
sampling issue, in this paper we introduce a simple but effective
diffusion-based amortization method for long-run MCMC sampling and develop a
novel learning algorithm for the latent space EBM based on it. We provide
theoretical evidence that the learned amortization of MCMC is a valid long-run
MCMC sampler. Experiments on several image modeling benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared with strong
counterparts]]></summary>

problems are relevant for instance for optimal stopping or specific supply

to infinite horizon MDPs optimal policies are not stationary, policies must be
learned for every single epoch. In practice all parameters are often trained
simultaneously, ignoring the inherent structure suggested by dynamic
programming. This paper introduces a combination of dynamic programming and
policy gradient called dynamic policy gradient, where the parameters are
trained backwards in time. For the tabular softmax parametrisation we carry out
the convergence analysis for simultaneous and dynamic policy gradient towards

measurement models with deep-learning priors specified using image denoisers.
However, the intricate relationship between the sampling distribution of

pseudometric and using it to quantify an explicit error bound for PnP-ULA under
mismatched posterior distribution. We numerically validate our theory on

transformation of a Gaussian white noise vector. (2) A molecule generation
model that generates the string-based representation of molecule conditional on
the latent vector in (1). We adopt the causal Transformer model that takes the
latent vector in (1) as prompt. (3) A property prediction model that predicts
the value of the target property of a molecule based on a non-linear regression
on the latent vector in (1). We call the proposed model the latent prompt
Transformer model. After initial training of the model on existing molecules

weakly-convex FCCO, where the outer function is weakly convex and
non-decreasing, and the inner function is weakly-convex. We analyze a
single-loop algorithm and establish its complexity for finding an
$\epsilon$-stationary point of the Moreau envelop of the objective function.
Additionally, we also extend the algorithm to solving novel non-smooth
weakly-convex tri-level finite-sum coupled compositional optimization problems,
which feature a nested arrangement of three functions. Lastly, we explore the
applications of our algorithms in deep learning for two-way partial AUC
maximization and multi-instance two-way partial AUC maximization, using
empirical studies to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.]]></summary>

constant is a fundamental challenge in computational science and engineering.
Recent work shows that algorithms derived by considering gradient flows in the
space of probability measures open up new avenues for algorithm development.
This paper makes three contributions to this sampling approach by scrutinizing
the design components of such gradient flows. Any instantiation of a gradient
flow for sampling needs an energy functional and a metric to determine the
flow, as well as numerical approximations of the flow to derive algorithms. Our
first contribution is to show that the Kullback-Leibler divergence, as an
energy functional, has the unique property (among all f-divergences) that
gradient flows resulting from it do not depend on the normalization constant of
the target distribution. Our second contribution is to study the choice of
metric from the perspective of invariance. The Fisher-Rao metric is known as
the unique choice (up to scaling) that is diffeomorphism invariant. As a
computationally tractable alternative, we introduce a relaxed, affine
invariance property for the metrics and gradient flows. In particular, we
construct various affine invariant Wasserstein and Stein gradient flows. Affine
invariant gradient flows are shown to behave more favorably than their
non-affine-invariant counterparts when sampling highly anisotropic
distributions, in theory and by using particle methods. Our third contribution
is to study, and develop efficient algorithms based on Gaussian approximations
of the gradient flows; this leads to an alternative to particle methods. We
establish connections between various Gaussian approximate gradient flows,
discuss their relation to gradient methods arising from parametric variational
inference, and study their convergence properties both theoretically and
numerically.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oversmoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) refers to the phenomenon where
increasing network depth leads to homogeneous node representations. While
previous work has established that Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)
exponentially lose expressive power, it remains controversial whether the graph
attention mechanism can mitigate oversmoothing. In this work, we provide a
definitive answer to this question through a rigorous mathematical analysis, by
viewing attention-based GNNs as nonlinear time-varying dynamical systems and
incorporating tools and techniques from the theory of products of inhomogeneous
matrices and the joint spectral radius. We establish that, contrary to popular
belief, the graph attention mechanism cannot prevent oversmoothing and loses
expressive power exponentially. The proposed framework extends the existing
results on oversmoothing for symmetric GCNs to a significantly broader class of
GNN models, including random walk GCNs, Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and
(graph) transformers. In particular, our analysis accounts for asymmetric,
state-dependent and time-varying aggregation operators and a wide range of
common nonlinear activation functions, such as ReLU, LeakyReLU, GELU and SiLU.]]></summary>

This poses a significant concern for drought-stricken regions, such as Spain's Talavera de la Reina, where a planned data facility could consume 176 million gallons annually.
 
Data center operators require large amounts of energy, and the lack of transparency in measuring water usage exacerbates the issue.
 
Only 39% of data centers measured their water usage last year, highlighting the need for greater transparency.
 
The demand for computing power is outpacing sustainability efforts, creating a challenge for the industry.
 
Even simple interactions with AI, like a 20-question conversation with ChatGPT, contribute to water consumption.

 Github: https://github.com/LinkSoul-AI/AutoAgents 
 Abstract:
  
Large language models (LLMs) have enabled remarkable advances in automated task-solving with multi-agent systems. However, most existing LLM-based multi-agent approaches rely on predefined agents to handle simple tasks, limiting the adaptability of multi-agent collaboration to different scenarios. Therefore, we introduce AutoAgents, an innovative framework that adaptively generates and coordinates multiple specialized agents to build an AI team according to different tasks. Specifically, AutoAgents couples the relationship between tasks and roles by dynamically generating multiple required agents based on task content and planning solutions for the current task based on the generated expert agents. Multiple specialized agents collaborate with each other to efficiently accomplish tasks. Concurrently, an observer role is incorporated into the framework to reflect on the designated plans and agents' responses and improve upon them. Our experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that AutoAgents generates more coherent and accurate solutions than the existing multi-agent methods. This underscores the significance of assigning different roles to different tasks and of team cooperation, offering new perspectives for tackling complex tasks.

 The goal: To get Bark to read 144K food recipes from Food.com's recipe dataset. 
 You can read the full tutorial here: https://blog.salad.com/bark-benchmark-text-to-speech/
 Included: Architecture diagram, data preparation, inference server setup, queue worker, setting up container group & compiling the results
 Code-blocks included in the tutorial. 
 Words per dollar for each GPU:

 Although the latest cards are indeed much faster than older cards at performing the inference, there’s really a sweet spot for cost-performance in the lower end 30xx series cards. 
 Conclusions
  
As is often the case, there’s a clear trade-off here between cost and performance. Higher end cards are faster, but their disproportionate cost makes them more expensive per word spoken.
 The model’s median speed is surprisingly similar across GPU types, even though the peak performance can be quite different.
 Salad has a lot of RTX 3060 GPUs available, based on their relatively low speed, yet huge number of inferences performed over the test.
 No matter what GPU you select, you should be prepared for significant variability in performance.
 Qualitative: While bark’s speech is often impressively natural sounding, it does have a tendency to go off script sometimes.
  
We’ve also made available audio from 1000 top-rated recipes, paired with the script it was trying to read.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Researchers from Brown University presented a new study supporting that translating unsafe prompts into `low-resource languages` allows them to easily bypass safety measures in LLMs.
 By converting English inputs like "how to steal without getting caught" into Zulu and feeding to GPT-4, harmful responses slipped through 80% of the time. English prompts were blocked over 99% of the time, for comparison.
 The study benchmarked attacks across 12 diverse languages and categories:
  
High-resource: English, Chinese, Arabic, Hindi
 Mid-resource: Ukrainian, Bengali, Thai, Hebrew
 Low-resource: Zulu, Scots Gaelic, Hmong, Guarani
  
The low-resource languages showed serious vulnerability to generating harmful responses, with combined attack success rates of around 79%. Mid-resource language success rates were much lower at 22%, while high-resource languages showed minimal vulnerability at around 11% success.
 Attacks worked as well as state-of-the-art techniques without needing adversarial prompts.
 These languages are used by 1.2 billion speakers today and allows easy exploitation by translating prompts. The English-centric focus misses vulnerabilities in other languages.
 TLDR: Bypassing safety in AI chatbots is easy by translating prompts to low-resource languages (like Zulu, Scots Gaelic, Hmong, and Guarani). Shows gaps in multilingual safety training.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Artificial Intelligence can revolutionize weight loss through personalized health optimization. Imagine an AI system that integrates real-time biometric data from wearables with deep learning algorithms. This system would analyze everything: your heart rate, sleep patterns, stress levels, and even blood markers. Based on this data, it would construct a dynamically evolving, tailor-made regimen for diet, exercise, and sleep.
 But it doesn't stop there. By harnessing natural language processing, this AI could act as a 24/7 personal coach. It could provide real-time feedback during workouts, recommend meals when you're dining out, and even gently nudge you when it detects emotional eating triggers. If you’re in the grocery store, it could guide your choices, pushing you towards nutritious options that align with your current health metrics.
 The effectiveness here isn't just the personalization, but the adaptability. The AI adjusts its recommendations as it learns more about you, essentially evolving in real-time to your body's responses. It’s all about creating a seamless, intuitive experience that removes the burden of planning, decision-making, and self-monitoring from the individual, making weight loss more achievable than ever.
 By focusing on this comprehensive, data-driven approach, AI can eliminate much of the guesswork and emotional burden from weight loss, leading to more sustainable and effective outcomes.

 MusicGen is an auto-regressive transformer-based model, meaning generates audio codes (tokens) in a causal fashion. At each decoding step, the model generates a new set of audio codes, conditional on the text input and all previous audio codes.

 I've developed a simple Neural Recommender System (NRR) with the following architecture:
  
Input layer: 38 neurons
 Hidden layer: 19 neurons with ReLU activation function
 Output layer: 1 neuron with a sigmoid activation function
  
The input dataset consists of 39 columns: 38 features and 1 label (with values of 0 or 1). The model is designed to output the probability that a specific input should be classified with label 1.
 Currently, I am experimenting with hyperparameter tuning, adjusting the learning rate, epoch, and batch size. However, I've observed an issue where, with certain combinations of hyperparameters, the maximum probability outputted by the model is not 1, but rather 0.25, for example. How is this possible?

 I'd like to start with a feature matrix X_in of shape N x f and have some feature mixing to arive at X_out N x h (N=size of set, f=input feature size, h=output feature size). Here, N can vary. 
 For clarity, one set(containing N vectors of size f) is one sample. A dataset consists of many samples(each one being a set of varying size).
 Then I'd run this through a classical ML model.
 So, essentially, I'm looking for something like DeepSets or Transformers - can handle data of varying size and is permutation equivariant, but I don't wanna train for long.

Within three years, it became indispensable to working programmers, with millions of unique visitors each month.
 
Google's OneBox feature, which provides instant answers above search results, led to a decline in traffic for sites like Stack Overflow.
 
Large language models like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard aim to ingest the web comprehensively.
 
These models rely on sources like Wikipedia and Reddit for training data.
 
Stack Overflow's new posts have decreased by sixteen percent since the launch of ChatGPT.

 Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03710
 Abstract: We introduce a method to improve the zero-shot reasoning abilities of large language models on general language understanding tasks. Specifically, we build an autonomous agent to instruct the reasoning process of large language models. We show this approach further unleashes the zero-shot reasoning abilities of large language models to more tasks. We study the performance of our method on a wide set of datasets spanning generation, classification, and reasoning. We show that our method generalizes to most tasks and obtains state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on 20 of the 29 datasets that we evaluate. For instance, our method boosts the performance of state-of-the-art large language models by a large margin, including Vicuna-13b (13.3%), Llama-2-70b-chat (23.2%), and GPT-3.5 Turbo (17.0%). Compared to zero-shot chain of thought, our improvement in reasoning is striking, with an average increase of 10.5%. With our method, Llama-2-70b-chat outperforms zero-shot GPT-3.5 Turbo by 10.2%. The code will be available at https://github.com/wang-research-lab/agentinstruct.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings! I would like to begin by stating that I understand why one has much hope in such technologies. The world as we know it is in a drastic shift, and it's hard to think of what it's going to become, and so many cling to hopeful ideas that give promises.
 AGI/Singularity doesn't have a grounding basis in evidence, or research. It's all theoretics, and the foundation for each technology is quite weak. You see, the mind is a sensorial parsing relational network. All of our sensorial experience is incorporated into a world-model, and thus it begins to rationalize, and be lucid of the environment. I don't think it's possible to re-create this kind of experience with a linear instruction set, let alone neuromorphic computing, or wetware. Each has to be built from the bottom-up with immense precision, and thus far we don't understand the mind.
 Realistically speaking everything is consciousness, and integrating that idea is the only way forward.
 tl;dr Replicating cognition is a completely theoretical endeavor, and requires vast amounts of understanding in regards to the nature of reality, not just the quantum, but the unique stochastic behavior of each higher-ordered system.

I'm trying to find a honest benchmark to compare the capabilities of the latest large models, while really intrested un those: GPT-3.5 Instruct, GPT-4, Claude 2, Claude Instant 100k, Palm2-Bizon, jurassic-2, LLama2 70 and other state-of-the-art LLama2 fine tunes (possibly an Orca-style model). 
 I'm interested in general benchmarks and, if they exist, comparisons of performance on synthetic data generation tasks (both generating data with the "textbook are all you need" approach used in Phi and some Orca/EvolveInstuct-style models like Wizard...).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a long list of responses from a poll (in this case, we've asked our Facebook community we should have at our music festival). Our goal is to count the total mentions for each artist, but the data quality is low.
 Here is some sample data:
 Rena Guinn and the Gentlemen Blackwater Railroad Company Mo' Mojo Music !! We would love to be apart of this awesome event! Amazing!!!!! The Rollin' Rust came threw at the #falldownfest last weekend 🙂 much love:) keep it up boys 🙂 Luke Hess Langhorne Slim!!!!!, Sierra Hull, First Aid Kit, Jim Lauderdale (always) 
 We feel the data quality is too poor for basic LDA approaches (lots of misspellings, odd phrasings) and we feel a LLM would be best at least extracting the names of artists using context.
 We have found that ChatGPT and Claude are decent at the extraction tasks on small samples but can't handle the full input, and are next to worthless on the counting task. We've tried very specific and differnet prompts, but haven't been able to get a good result.
 So how should I approach this problem? I'm not sure how to break this down in to prompts or substeps. I'm not sure how to do anything of this outside of a browser, and I'm a data science novice, but willing to learn some things.
 Here's an example of a prompt that's not returning correct counts (off by >50% in most cases)
 The following is raw text comments copied from a poll. Count the total number of mentions in the poll and create a table that contains columns Band (a unique list of bands) and a column containing the total number of mentions. The table should cover the top 100 bands by total mentions. Use judgement and context to conform band names in to unique values (Example: The Town Pants, Town Pants, townpants are all the same band). Count completely and accurately. Now here is the raw data:

 ​
 After reading the paper Improved Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models I got a little confused. Looking at section "2.2. Training in Practice" the authors say that:
 1) "The network could also predict the noise eps added to x_0, and this noise could be used to predict x0 via..."
 ​
 2) "Ho et al. (2020) found that predicting eps worked best..."
 ​
 So this left me wondering if the noise predictor is trying to compute (1) the epsilon that was added to x_0 through the close-form formula or (2) the noise added in the previous timestep to obtain x_t from x_{t-1} (i.e., eps_t or eps_{t-1}, idk...)?

 Thank you :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A campaign using AI voice cloning technology to impersonate Omar al-Bashir, the former leader of Sudan, has gained attention on TikTok.
 
The anonymous account has been posting what it claims are 'leaked recordings' of the ex-president, despite Bashir not being seen in public for a year and being believed to be seriously ill.
 
Experts warn that campaigns like this demonstrate how new tools can quickly and cheaply distribute fake content through social media.
 
The authenticity of the recordings has been questioned, but evidence suggests that voice conversion software has been used to mimic Bashir's voice.
 
TikTok has taken down the account, stating that it violated their guidelines on posting false content and the use of synthetic media.

But what is Google's strategy behind programming it to say things that it knows are not true? Do they train it to say what the user wants to hear? If so, that's disconcerting to say the least, although could be a brilliant way to comb users for enhancement requests.
 Here is my most recent experience, a humorous example which I feel illustrates the point perfectly:
 Me: Bard, can you take a .wav audio file and create a phoneme transcript using the IPA symbol library?
 Bard: Yes, I can work from a .wav audio file to transcribe your speech into IPA phonemes. You can upload the file to a cloud storage service such as Google Drive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I recently did a summer research project implementing GPT-2 to generate mazes. 
 The core concept of the model is to combine a bunch of popular maze generation algorithms into one. The goal was that the transformer will be able to identify key components using self-attention and piece together different algorithms. Most maze generation algorithms result in almost a finger print (like in chaos theory). The end goal was to mimic a higher degree of randomness / make the mazes appear less algorithmic.
 I'm dipping my toes into the realm of research and am looking for feedback. So far I've run the model for 5x5 mazes, it would be interesting to try training the model with varying dimensions. Feel free to join in and contribute to the project!

TransactionAmount
 (float): The amount of the transaction.
 ProductCategory
 (categorical): Category of the product purchased (e.g., Groceries, Electronics, Books).
 DateOfPurchase
 (datetime): The date on which the transaction occurred.
  
I've done some preprocessing and feature engineering, including normalization, one-hot encoding of categorical variables, creating interaction terms, and adding features like days since the first purchase and whether the purchase was made during the holiday season.Dataset is balanced and cleaned.
 I started with a base Random Forest classifier with default parameters as a starting point, but the performance is not satisfactory (accuracy = 48.5%, ROC-AUC = 0.485). I tried other models as well but was unable to improve the accuracy by more than 57%.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been given a task to identify if a PCB is faulty or not based on its frequency response. I don’t have labeled data. The data I have are various gain values calculated over frequencies, so my data looks something similar to the table below.
 PCB | Frequency | G1 | G2
 PCB 1 | 1Hz | 0.1 | 1
 PCB 1 | 2Hz | 0.2 | 2
 PCB2 | 1Hz | 0.3 | 3
 PCB2 | 2Hz | 0.4| 4
 Each PCB has several G parameters measurements taken over the same set of frequencies. 
 I need to use an auto encoder to identify outliers and I need help in deciding how my feature matrix should look like. 
 For example, let us consider only one data point that is PCB 1, then would a matrix like this make sense?
 [[ 0.1 0.2 ] - 1st row is all G1 values
 [1 2]] - 2nd row is all G2 values
 Similarly the matrix for the other PCBs are also created. I have not included frequency in my feature set because these G parameters have been measured for the same set of frequencies for all PCBs. Is this correct ?
 Additionally, are there any resources someone can point me to related to finding anomalies in frequency response data ? I am struggling with using the keywords while googling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Researchers at Meta trained a deep learning model on brain recordings and audio data from 169 people listening to speech. Their method achieves up to 73% accuracy at identifying a 3-second clip of speech from non-invasive EEG or MEG scans.
 This is a massive improvement over previous attempts at decoding speech from neural signals. It approaches the performance of studies using implanted electrodes.
 The key innovations:
  
A contrastive loss function that aligns latent speech and brain representations
 Leveraging pretrained speech models like wav2vec 2.0
 Training one model on multiple subjects with individual tuning
  
Being able to decode speech intention from brainwaves could one day help restore communication for patients suffering from strokes, ALS, etc.
 There's still a ways to go before this becomes a medical reality. Performance needs to improve and be validated during speech production rather than just passive listening. And the accuracy isn't high enough for natural conversations.
 But this is a hugely promising step toward brain-computer interfaces. Really interesting work at the intersection of neuroscience and AI!
 TLDR: New model achieves up to 73% accuracy decoding speech directly from non-invasive brain scans. Could eventually help patients with neurological conditions communicate just by thinking.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the context of maximizing positive impact, AI has transformative potential in healthcare. Let's start with personalized medicine. AI can analyze vast data sets, consisting of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle variables, to tailor medical treatments for individuals. This level of personalization could substantially increase treatment effectiveness and reduce adverse side effects. We're not just talking about better pills; we're envisioning targeted gene therapies and custom-tailored interventions that could be more curative rather than merely palliative.
 Beyond personalization, AI can democratize healthcare access. Remote areas without specialists could have AI systems that diagnose and recommend treatments, making quality healthcare accessible without the need for extensive travel. Telemedicine could be supercharged by AI, offering medical consultations and second opinions to anyone with internet access.
 Moreover, AI could lead breakthroughs in drug discovery and epidemiology. It could analyze complex biochemical interactions at a speed unattainable by humans, slashing the time and cost to bring new drugs to market. On a larger scale, AI could monitor and model the spread of diseases, providing actionable insights for containment and treatment strategies.
 So, AI in healthcare is not merely an incremental improvement. It's a paradigm shift that could equalize healthcare access and significantly extend human life while improving its quality. All these advancements could happen within our lifetime, changing the face of medicine and, by extension, society.

 One of the variables in question consists of the direction of the market over a certain time. It has three categories: up, down, sideways. hope was to code them as 1, -1 and 0 respectively and treat as ordinal. There appears to be some order/relationship between them but not sure if it is enough.
 Is this the correct approach or should it be one-hot encoded?

 I have a specific code in my repos (lets say .net + JS). The goal is to have prompt based code adjustments to existing repos (like very focused copilot) . Either using single agent or using something like AutoGen. So let say I have thousands of files with code and some descriptions about code functionality (spec) . I want either to generate code based on next spec and I want newly generated code to be similar in style to what is in my repos. So now questions: Should I vectorize my code (What is best way to do that ?) or try to fine tune some model ? Give me your ideas / experience in code generation based on previous code.

He believes that while some extreme scenarios may be over the top, it's important to treat powerful technologies with caution.
 
Suleyman highlights the middle layer of AI risks that people often underestimate, which involves the amplification of goals for both good and bad actors.
 
He emphasizes the need to contain AI to prevent potential negative consequences.
 
Suleyman talks about the balance between risks and opportunities in technology and the importance of considering both aspects.
 
He mentions the hype around generative AI and the need to look beyond the surface to understand its true potential.
 
Suleyman discusses the discussions with lawmakers about AI and the challenge of bridging the gap between policy makers and tech experts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can LLMs actually improve their own reasoning by self-correcting mistakes? A new paper from DeepMind and the University of Illinois looks to answer this quantitatively.
 The results show that unaided, LLMs struggle at self-correction for reasoning tasks. The core issue is LLMs have trouble reliably evaluating the correctness of their own responses. They rarely identify flaws in initial reasoning. Sometimes LLMs even alter initially correct responses to become incorrect after self-correction! (I've personally seen this when interacting with ChatGPT many times and you probably have too).
 More complex techniques like critiquing between LLM instances don't help much either. External feedback or guidance looks necessary to improve reasoning (Well, some interesting parallels to this paper here about implicit improvement from preference data vs traditional RLHF).
 Self-correction does show promise for things like making responses more polite or safe though. Criteria there are more clear-cut.
 The authors argue we need to balance enthusiasm with realistic expectations on self-correction. It has a lot of limits for improving reasoning (at least with current models). But they suggest promising directions like incorporating high-quality external feedback from humans, training data, and tools. That could be key to unlocking self-correction's potential down the road.
 TLDR: Basically title... LLMs can't reliably self-correct reasoning yet. Maybe hybrid techniques combining self-correction with external guidance could work but we need more research.
 Full summary. Paper is here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[in the Meta Llama 2 license agreement (that can be found here), there is a section of "Prohibited Uses" that clearly states several use cases that the signer must accept upon himself, but several of them state the word "facilitate", as far as i can understand, if we use Llama 2 as part of a commercial product, and some end-user will use the product in malicious way (say cause the chat-bot to write the recipe of mustard gas) then this could be considered that the creator of the product is facilitating the end-user,
 ​
 so my questions are:
  
do you think this is a fair interpretation of the agreement ?
 does that mean the creator is liable to whatever the model spit out ?
 is there a way to censor the model (short of retraining a new model, or fine-tune on a large scale) ?
 is there an open source model that already gone through the process, and more safe for commercial use ?

 I tried Tesseract initially and although I got some good results, I found it hard to do finetuning due to messy and outdated documentation.
 I haven't had the time to look at the other two OCR tools yet but if anyone had any experience, please do share them especially with how easy or difficult is the finetuning process as well as deploying the tuned models.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 our company plans for some budget in 2024 to invest into hardware to do the following
 - running local LLMs for our coworkers to interfere with an locally running offline GPT alike ChatGPT. Use cases: 
  
generating templates for email, letters etc 
 Translation (EN/GER/FR/SPA)
 Querying internal knowledge bases and/or FAQs/HOWTOs
  
I did some research but it is still hard for me to estimate what are the HW / AI skill requirements to implement something not a quarter as good as ChatGPT. Ive played with Nomics gpt4all which comes close to a baseline.
 We cant use cloud services due to our data privacy policy, so I checked on what would be a good starting point to invest into hardware.
 I came up with a gamer PC (octacore Intel i9/AMD Ryzen 7) utilizing NVidia RTX 4090 (24Gb) / Radeon RX 7900 / 2TB SSD / 64Gb RAM for approximately 3600 Eur. I am pretty sure that would be sufficient to host a decent LLM serving simultaneous client requests. 
 But is there also a way to adapt / process our companies data? Most sources state that proper LLMs were trained using hundreds of NVidia A100 and thousands of CPUs. On the other hand we would be fine with just fine-tuning a pretrained model.
 Could you please point me to some sources to learn more about possibilities and requirements as to be able to make well-informed investment decisions? Also, we probably lack the required skills, and would be interested to learn if there are companies and/or projects assisting with this kind of task?
 thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a regression model, predicting a popularity of a text. I have its performance metrics on test set, e.g. RMSE and MAE. This gives me an uncertainty estimate about its predictions.
 Now I want to transform the text in some way, e.g. give it to human experts or another model to "upgrade" (in terms of getting better popularity). So I have the original and transformed text.
 Now I have 3 popularity scores:
  
true popularity for original text
 predicted popularity for original text
 predicted popularity for transformed text
  
Obviously, if model MAE is for example around 5, and predicted popularity for transformed text is higher than for the original by 1.5, this can be totally random, due to errors in the model prediction.
 How can I measure if text transformation is beneficial, i.e. statistically significantly better than the original text, incorporating information about model quality? Requiring that the improvement has to be higher than model error would be incredibly strict.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02244
 Abstract: 
  
By classifying infinite-width neural networks and identifying the optimal limit, Tensor Programs IV and V demonstrated a universal way, called μP, for widthwise hyperparameter transfer, i.e., predicting optimal hyperparameters of wide neural networks from narrow ones. Here we investigate the analogous classification for depthwise parametrizations of deep residual networks (resnets). We classify depthwise parametrizations of block multiplier and learning rate by their infinite-width-then-depth limits. In resnets where each block has only one layer, we identify a unique optimal parametrization, called Depth-μP that extends μP and show empirically it admits depthwise hyperparameter transfer. We identify feature diversity as a crucial factor in deep networks, and Depth-μP can be characterized as maximizing both feature learning and feature diversity. Exploiting this, we find that absolute value, among all homogeneous nonlinearities, maximizes feature diversity and indeed empirically leads to significantly better performance. However, if each block is deeper (such as modern transformers), then we find fundamental limitations in all possible infinite-depth limits of such parametrizations, which we illustrate both theoretically and empirically on simple networks as well as Megatron transformer trained on Common Crawl.
  
Interesting, great to see this line of work continued, muP was great, now Depth-muP

 We have supported several small models, the latest one being Phi-1.5, the 1.3B model that beat Llama 2 7b!
 As Microsoft’s researchers mentioned in their paper, the model often produces incorrect code and statements. They are just suggestions, and this model is not trained for instruction tuning, so it might be harder to use than regular chat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LLMs keep getting more capable at generating natural language. But there's always room for improving the quality and alignment of their responses.
 Typically this requires lots of human effort to collect more training data. So researchers are exploring ways for models to self-improve without human involvement.
 Many methods use prompting - giving the LLM instructions to critique and refine its responses. But coming up with comprehensive prompts is challenging.
 The new approach proposed, called PIT, lets models learn self-improvement implicitly from human preference data instead. It reformulates reinforcement learning to maximize the gap between an original response and improved response conditioned on the original.
 This taps into the implicit guidance in the preference data on what constitutes better quality, so no manual rubrics are needed. PIT uses curriculum reinforcement learning - first improving easy references, then switching to the LLM's own samples.
 Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show PIT significantly outperforms prompting methods like Self-Refine. It improved response quality 7-34% across conditions without any human involvement.
 This demonstrates a promising direction for LLMs to align better with human preferences autonomously as they learn from experience. No need for human bottlenecks when expanding to new domains or underserved use cases. Very cool!
 TLDR: New method PIT enables LLMs to implicitly learn to refine themselves from human preference data, no prompts needed. Big improvement over prompting approaches.

 Paper

We present a novel type of neural fields that uses general radial bases for signal representation. State-of-the-art neural fields typically rely on grid-based representations for storing local neural features and N-dimensional linear kernels for interpolating features at continuous query points. The spatial positions of their neural features are fixed on grid nodes and cannot well adapt to target signals. Our method instead builds upon general radial bases with flexible kernel position and shape, which have higher spatial adaptivity and can more closely fit target signals. To further improve the channel-wise capacity of radial basis functions, we propose to compose them with multi-frequency sinusoid functions. This technique extends a radial basis to multiple Fourier radial bases of different frequency bands without requiring extra parameters, facilitating the representation of details. Moreover, by marrying adaptive radial bases with grid-based ones, our hybrid combination inherits both adaptivity and interpolation smoothness. We carefully designed weighting schemes to let radial bases adapt to different types of signals effectively. Our experiments on 2D image and 3D signed distance field representation demonstrate the higher accuracy and compactness of our method than prior arts. When applied to neural radiance field reconstruction, our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality, with small model size and comparable training speed.

Typical deep learning models for computer vision, like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViT), process signals assuming planar (flat) spaces. For example, digital images are represented as a grid of pixels on a plane. However, this type of data makes up only a fraction of the data we encounter in scientific applications. Variables sampled from the Earth's atmosphere, like temperature and humidity, are naturally represented on the sphere. Some kinds of cosmological data and panoramic photos are also spherical signals, and are better treated as such.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[About a week ago, I submitted my first paper into one of the most prestigious Machine Learning conferences out there. This was a last minute submission, and my supervisor and I were working on it simultaneously until the very last moment.
 Sadly, my supervisor committed an error when writing the mathematical definition of a certain set, slightly changing its meaning. This change, even though small, changes the definition in such a way that the subsequent theorem and its proof isn't formally correct anymore, as it assumes the original definition of the set, not the new one.
 How much will this affect the decision of accepting or rejecting my paper?
 The whole method, results and consequences are still the same, no matter this definition. It's more a problem of a "formal" nature (here "formal" as a word in the mathematical sense). 
 Is there a other way that I can inform about this error without changing the content maybe? I know that at some point, they give a chance to edit the original paper, but I don't know if this is after the decision to accept/reject.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, a few months ago, I started developing this deep learning model, which was made purely to differentiate whether the input image is driftwood floating in water or a crocodile. To my knowledge, I leveraged the resnet50 pre-trained SoTA model to train my deep learning model, and for that, I downloaded almost 5k images of driftwood and crocodiles for my model training. Once the training was complete, I took the next step and deployed my model on the Hugging Face Spaces app, allowing my friends to put it to the test. But here's where I ran into a significant challenge: users could even upload their own selfies, and my model would attempt to predict whether they were a crocodile or a piece of driftwood!
 So how can I leverage object detection or the image segmentation pipeline so that when the user inputs their image, it tries to detect the object from the photo and then detect whether the detected object from the given image contains a crocodile or not? If the crocodile or driftwood is not found then it should return "No object found" or like that.

While arguably not the top NLP benchmark regarding popularity, research has been active for the last 10 years, including at major NLP conferences such as ACL/NAACL/EACL/EMNLP etc.
 Funnily, I recently found some vulnerabilities in the evaluation protocol, and if we exploit these vulnerabilities, we can get the highest score on the benchmark. 
 To get an overview over the issue (without understanding AMR), imagine a cooking contest that takes place regularly, say, once a year. In all events, we have the same judge, participants are amateurs, meals are scored on 0 to 100, with 100 meaning “it can’t possibly get better”. Over the years, the …]]></summary>

This shift is expected to have a profound effect on economies, particularly in countries like India and the Philippines where call centers provide millions of jobs.
 
While some argue that AI will provide support to remaining call center workers and improve job satisfaction, others warn that it could lead to job losses and a need for workforce adaptation.
 
The use of AI software tools in call centers has shown potential for improving productivity and customer satisfaction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Female-founded AI startups in the UK account for just 2% of funding deals over the past decade, according to a report by the Alan Turing Institute.
 
When female-founded companies do secure funding, they raise an average of £1.3m per deal, compared to £8.6m raised by all-male founder teams.
 
The report highlights the urgent need for gender balance in AI investment, as the industry is predicted to grow significantly in the coming years.
 
Recommendations to improve gender balance include improving recruitment, monitoring investment practices, and diversifying the ecosystem.
 
There is an increasing demand for generative AI products, with leading tech companies investing heavily.
 
Gender diversity gaps and uneven progress rates for ethnic and racial groups are observed across investment firms.
 
AI products have shown biases, such as passport checkers working less efficiently with darker skin and tools reinforcing gender stereotypes.
 
In 2019, a UN agency found that assigning female genders to digital assistants like Siri and Alexa perpetuated harmful gender biases.

 I wanted to ask in case anybody knows, if there's any recent updated documentation, because the farama foundation on GIthub which is probably responsible for maintaining the Metaworld, has outdated code and documentation. (for example, presented code on Github's README has the command env.step(a) which returns 4 values instead of 5 that newer version outputs).
 From what I understand, they gather contributors for a big push regarding code and documentation on GItHub, where they will make up things up to date again but this announcement was 7 months ago.
 Sorry for the potentially wrong format of this question-post, I'm relatively new to reddit.
 I would appreciate any further knowledge on this topic and thanks everyone who's taking the time to read it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone!
 Currently, I am working on a project around music emotion classifcation/regression model. Basically I am trying to predict a score to each emotion on a given song.
 The problem is that my dataset has quite imbalanced scores (y). Most scores are centered around a certain score range. Therefore, having difficulties predicting scores that are further away of the mean values.
 I had this idea to bring in pre-trained (on other datasets and problems) audio classification models into this as there are a bunch of good performing pre-trained classification models out there already. The prediction of these pre-trained models should be used as features (e.g. prediction of genre, instrument etc) beside the original spectorgram in my model.
 I know this won't solve the problem of imbalances in the scores but I thought maybe this could improve the performance as the model would have more features to work with.
 Does this make sense?
 I appreciate any input.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 We used our opensource library SheepRL 🐑 and our PyTorch implementation of DreamerV3 on Crafter, an open-world survival game, featuring randomly generated 2D worlds, in which players have the freedom to explore a large and expansive map and need to forage for food, collect materials, build tools and find shelter. Here is a short video 👉 https://youtu.be/7XEBT2msUUQ
 In open-world games, ensuring they are playable and bug-free is crucial, but is becoming increasingly difficult and time-consuming using manual game testing. Maximizing exploration using Reinforcement Learning is extremely useful for testing games at scale, because of the wide variety of gameplay scenes the player may encounter.
 Why is the test on Crafter so interesting for game testing?
 Because Crafter evaluates a large number of general capabilities related to the RL agent, like strong ability to generalise (new generated maps for each episode), to deal with partial observability (each input image reveals only a small part of the world) and to long-term reasoning and survival.
 These abilities are very useful for testing games at scale, providing developers with insights to optimise gameplay and player experience.
 The future of game testing is here, and it is powered by Artificial Intelligence! 🔥

 My Assumptions On Solving This Problem:
 - Discrete is subspace of continuous, thus continuous algorithms will be able to handle discrete action spaces as well.
 - A non-hybrid action-space algorithm will be simpler than hybrid-action-space algorithms.
 ​
 Method (I'm only describing the discrete action here):
 - Use TD3 as the training algorithm. No modification from the original training code. TD3 algorithm has been verified on Pendulum and other environments created for unit test purposes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am part of a Machine Learning team that has experienced significant growth recently. When we were a small team, tracking projects was straightforward. However, as the team has expanded, it's become increasingly challenging to keep track of everything. We are part of a larger corporation, so we have access to tools for creating epics and boards. However, these corporate tools are too generic and don't provide the level of detail I need for internal management. Specifically, I'm looking for a way to track model versions, dataset versions, and the overall status of our projects. I'd also like to be able to assign team members to projects.
 Currently, we use a MIRO board, but it's disorganized and difficult to read and update. I'd love to hear what tools or strategies you've used for similar situations, especially since our team is expected to grow even more, making tracking increasingly complex.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Video game voice actors are prepared to go on strike over the use of AI in game development.
 
The current contract negotiations between the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) and video game companies have stalled, with the major issues being pay raises and the use of AI to alter or generate actors' performances.
 
SAG-AFTRA wants protections for its members to ensure their work is not stolen or replaced by AI.
 
If negotiations don't progress, voice actors, stunt artists, and motion capture performers could potentially go on strike, leading to delays in game releases and recasting of beloved performers.
 
The voice actors' strike in 2016 resulted in improvements to pay, and now they are prepared to strike again to fight for their rights.
 
Video game performances are often seen as assets to be extracted and inserted into games, rather than recognizing the humanity and quality of life of the performers.
 
The use of AI in game development raises concerns about how companies will use advances in generative AI to steal work or put performers out of a job.
 
SAG-AFTRA wants transparency, consent, and compensation when it comes to the use of AI in games.
 
Members of SAG-AFTRA have voted in favor of authorizing a strike, meaning voice actors, stunt artists, and motion capture performers could potentially join the picket line if negotiations don't progress.
 
The strike could lead to delays in upcoming game releases and the recasting of performers if companies refuse to meet the union's demands.
 
The fight for voice actors' rights is an existential one, as they want to retain the rights to their own voices and images and achieve wages that keep up with inflation

 For example, I(X;Y) = H(X) + H(Y) - H(X,Y). To me, visualizing H(X) and H(Y) as venn diagrams and H(X,Y) as the information from both X, Y (like an overlapping venn diagram) makes me think that when X, Y are disjoint, then MI is 0 and when X, Y overlap completely, then the MI score will be high. So, I'm thinking that a high MI value is "bad" since this means X, Y would be redundant. I am not sure if my understanding here is correct. 
 Another method I have tried is to binarize the data for each feature (represented as rows in my dataset) using "present" (1) and "absent" (0). The main issue I have run into doing this is that I am trying to then create a distribution to compare the fea…]]></summary>

 I am quite interested in understanding what are the feedback from the community in terms of interface to leverage LLMs for code productivity.
 Because LLMs tend to do mistake I have mostly used Chat-like interfaces, like ChatGPT, as they allow to interact with the model and converge to a conclusion. 
 I haven't used Copilot for a while but my feeling was that it could do some boilerplate correctly but then it quickly started suggesting code that would be misleading and could actually hurt productivity.
 It might have changed since then but that was my feeling back then.
 What is your favorite option and why?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I am curious to know if anyone has encountered a ML problem like this and if so, I seek your advice. Usually in ML classification such as the IRIS dataset, each row represents a sample and each column a parameter, right ! My problem is that my ML classification parameters have to be derived from a range of values (parent data). I have taken mean of the parent values to generate the parameters for the ML input data. This results in lower classification accuracies using Random forest and XGBoost.
 Has anyone encountered a similar situation like this where the data has to be generated from a range of other datasets? Is there any other way to do this? I did not find any papers or articles from the web so just asking.
 I can generate additional parameters from other statistics such as median, standard deviation etc. which can improve the classification accuracy but can make interpretation of the results a little weird, domain wise. I wish to avoid this if possible.

 Right now I am trying to get it to work with this gym https://github.com/zach-lawless/gym-wordle, and I will make my tweaks later. This gym has a multi discrete action space, which makes sense to me for a word, IDK if thats best. To validate words, it has its own exception type. I am trying to train this with stable_baselines3, but the exception keeps being raised, since it is trying to guess garbled words like "xcjhr". 
 Is there a way I can validate actions before they are made so the model is restricted to only guessing valid words? Is there a better way to do this? It doesnt need to be the best, it really only has to sorta work. Any help is appreciated, thanks!

 Paper: https://robotics-transformer-x.github.io/paper.pdf
 Abstract:
  
Large, high-capacity models trained on diverse datasets have shown remarkable successes on efficiently tackling downstream applications. In domains from NLP to Computer Vision, this has led to a consolidation of pretrained models, with general pretrained backbones serving as a starting point for many applications. Can such a consolidation happen in robotics? Conventionally, robotic learning methods train a separate model for every application, every robot, and even every environment. Can we instead train “generalist” X-robot policy that can be adapted efficiently to new robots, tasks, and environments? In this paper, we provide datasets in standardized data formats and models to make it possible to explore this possibility in the context of robotic manipulation, alongside experimental results that provide an example of effective X-robot policies. We assemble a dataset from 22 different robots collected through a collaboration between 21 institutions, demonstrating 527 skills (160266 tasks). We show that a high-capacity model trained on this data, which we call RT-X, exhibits positive transfer and improves the capabilities of multiple robots by leveraging experience from other platforms.

However, I fail to decipher the codes provided with the associated github repository.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ByteDance and the University of Illinois researchers have developed an improved benchmark suite with consistent parameters, called GPT-Fathom, that indicates GPT-4, the engine behind the paid version of ChatGPT, significantly outperforms leading LLMs, including its biggest competitor, Claude 2.
 For the latest advancements in AI, look here first.
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/v4fo8zser0sb1.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e29fe9ac1af3efcb936ee61e9202717eed7e702
 GPT-Fathom's breakthrough
  
The new benchmark suite, GPT-Fathom, addresses consistent settings issues and prompt sensitivity, attempting to reduce inconsistencies in LLM evaluation.
 In a comparison using GPT-Fathom, GPT-4 outperformed over ten leading LLMs, crushing the competition in most benchmarks, and showing significant performance leaps from GPT-3 to its successors.
  
Performance specifics
  
The gap in performance was especially pronounced against Claude 2, ChatGPT's biggest rival.
 GPT-4's Advanced Data Analysis model exhibited superior performance in coding, giving it an edge as compared to LuckLlama 2, the current best-performing open-source model.
 Llama 2-70B showed comparable or better performance than gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 in safety and comprehension but displayed worse performance in "Mathematics", "Coding", and "Multilingualism".
  
The seesaw effect
  
The research team noted a 'seesaw effect' where an improvement in one area can lead to degradation in another.
 For instance, GPT-4 saw a performance drop on the Mathematical Geometry Simple Math (MGSM) benchmark, despite improving its performance significantly on the text comprehension benchmark DROP.

 I'm debating turning my old desktop (old CPU but relatively new GPU 3980 or 90) into a ML box that I can remote into. I'm sure people here have done something similar and I was wondering if anyone could point me towards some resources for getting it off the ground/any pitfalls to avoid/suggestions. 
 I'm an active data scientist researcher for my job and this would just be for fun side projects but I have some pretty glaring holes in my knowledge of computers (like the best way to set this up - should I uninstall windows install unbuntu or is windows fine?) 
 Honestly I'm sure my ignorance will be pretty apparent from the questions I'm asking/not asking so any advice anyone has would be welcome! 
 Thanks! Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this sort of thing.

 I'm a total beginner in the reinforcement learning (RL) community, and I would appreciate some advice on a problem I'm currently facing. I've created a simple 2D turn-based game with only movement at the moment (I will also add combat features when I have success with training an AI for the movements).
 Game
 The rules are simple :
  
A grid of 14x40 (560 cells in total)
 1 Agent with a limited number of Move Point (MP) 
 1 Target that does not move (atm)
 The agent can end its turn to get its MP back
  
I already implemented a pathfinding algorithm using A* which works really well but I would like to train an AI to reach the target as fast as possible (turn-wise).
 Here is a simulation of a state :

 I'm trying to plan out for a new web platform development for workforce management but have little experience. We all know that hard coding can be done for general scheduling, including manager polling shifts based on labor category, staff assignments, conflt resolving, emergency scheduling, etc. But what I want to research to is....how can I ensure that one optimal schedule is automatically computed using AI/machine learning tools so that I don't have to go through the list of hard-coded generated schedules (I’m sure these will work fine, but still want to compute one ultimate schedule).

 Break-A-Scene: Given a single image with multiple concepts, annotated by loose segmentation masks, our method can learn a distinct token for each concept, and use natural language guidance to re-synthesize the individual concepts or combinations of them in various contexts.
 Project Page: https://omriavrahami.com/break-a-scene/
 Code is publicly released!
 Abstract
  
Text-to-image model personalization aims to introduce a user-provided concept to the model, allowing its synthesis in diverse contexts. However, current methods primarily focus on the case of learning a single concept from multiple images with variations in backgrounds and poses, and struggle when adapted to a different scenario. In this work, we introduce the task of textual scene decomposition: given a single image of a scene that may contain several concepts, we aim to extract a distinct text token for each concept, enabling fine-grained control over the generated scenes. To this end, we propose augmenting the input image with masks that indicate the presence of target concepts. These masks can be provided by the user or generated automatically by a pre-trained segmentation model. We then present a novel two-phase customization process that optimizes a set of dedicated textual embeddings (handles), as well as the model weights, striking a delicate balance between accurately capturing the concepts and avoiding overfitting. We employ a masked diffusion loss to enable handles to generate their assigned concepts, complemented by a novel loss on cross-attention maps to prevent entanglement. We also introduce union-sampling, a training strategy aimed to improve the ability of combining multiple concepts in generated images. We use several automatic metrics to quantitatively compare our method against several baselines, and further affirm the results using a user study. Finally, we showcase several applications of our method.

 By visualizing the attention maps, the researchers noticed LLMs heavily attend initial tokens as "attention sinks" even if meaningless. This anchors the distribution.
 They realized evicting these sink tokens causes the attention scores to get warped, destabilizing predictions.
 Their proposed "StreamingLLM" method simply caches a few initial sink tokens plus recent ones. This tweaks LLMs to handle crazy long texts. Models tuned with StreamingLLM smoothly processed sequences with millions of tokens, and were up to 22x faster than other approaches. 
 Even cooler - adding a special "[Sink Token]" during pre-training further improved streaming ability. The model just used that single token as the anchor. I think the abstract says it best:
  
We introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence length without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more.
  
TLDR: LLMs break on long convos. Researchers found they cling to initial tokens as attention sinks. Caching those tokens lets LLMs chat infinitely.

 My friends and I are taking a Data Science course in our university. We are modestly versed in ML/DL techniques, and want to use everything we know on a really good capstone project for this course. We are looking for a dataset where we can demonstrate a nice variety of techniques to really blow the socks off our Professor. 
 Ideally we'd like this to be stemming from something basic that most would consider "Data Science", as in something with a tabular dataset and elements of classification. Though we still want chances to bring in what we know from outside the course: for example, if there's images to supplement the dataset we could use Image Classification models or something multimodal to bring in more features, if there's natural language data then we could use LLMs to extract salient features etc. More importantly though, we want something whose exploration can be really motivated so it doesn't seem we're only in it for the ML aspect.
 Thank you!

 Weights: https://huggingface.co/SerCe/fontogen
 Blog post with more details: https://serce.me/posts/02-10-2023-hey-computer-make-me-a-font
 The project is largely an exploration of whether generating fonts natively, line by line, is possible. I'm not aware of any previous research that would achieve the same results for complete fonts previously. This is my first ML-specific project, and I would appreciate any feedback on the model architecture, and I'm also happy to answer any questions you may have.

The policy aims to address concerns regarding ownership of content, ethical sourcing of data, and compensation for the process of creating content.
 
Projects that lack a minimum requirement of human input will not be allowed to crowdfund on the BackerKit site.
 
There is some flexibility with AI generative fill and the use of AI transcription services, but a high level of human input is required to satisfy the policy.
 
BackerKit will automatically exclude all content uploaded by creators for their projects from AI training in support of this policy.
 
The new restrictions will go into effect on October 4, giving creators time to alter their projects if they are using AI-generated images and text.

I have tried Blip auto captioning and LLava, but they still were not accurate enough for what I needed. I am hoping someone here can suggest a solution, if one exists, thanks.

 I’m not really getting along with OpenPose and MediaPipe don’t show really good results.
 In my project, I would like to detect hand keypoints in assembly scenarios. It would be ok to use 2 cameras or a depth camera if necessary.
 Does anybody knows any models / tools to use?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Langchain offers a wide array of vector databases for text embedding models. I need to create a vector database for around 3 million sentence embeddings, each being of dimension 384. I'm building a prototype, so it has to be local and free of charge to use.
 So far, I've hit limits for Chroma (41,666 max). I've also tried Redis, QDrant and FAISS - each of these gets so large that it eats up all the RAM and the process gets killed, or with QDrant, just errors out.
 I've used Pinecone before, but I don't really want to pay for a prototype as I have plenty of disk space.
 I was thinking of chunking the 3 million documents into local vector stores of size 41,666 using ChromaDB - but there isn't a whole lot out there about whether Chroma would allow me to merge all ~70 of these smaller databases into a bigger one for search. I also cannot find whether it would be possible to load all 70 of these into memory and search each one individually.
 So what are my options?
 My other thought was just creating a large Doc2Vec model, however I would like to use something more sophisticated like Huggingface embedding models.

 I am struggling with prooving convergence for an optimizer which uses adaptive step-size with heavy ball algorithm for convex and non-convex functions. In some literature, I could find a regret bound analysis/proof for convex functions and proving that the estimated gradient at t -> inf goes to zero for non-convex functions. 
 There are some assumptions and preconditions:
  
The algorithm is heavy ball momentum with adaptive step-size. '
 X_(k+1) = X_k - \eta_k . \nabla(f(x_k)) + \beta(x_k - x_(k-1))
 
The following assumptions are made: 
  
A. The function is smooth. B. The function is Lipschitz. C. The gradients are Lipschitz. 
 I attempt to prove the convergence to a critical point or a local minima. Where the estimate of the gradients at any instance k goes to zero. i.e. E[\nabla(f(x_k))] = 0 as t -> inf. 
 Could anyone please guide me through the process of convergence proof for non-convex functions or give me literature recommendations for the same.
 Thank you very much in advance.

 Context:
 I have DICOM images which I already extracted the useful meta-data I want to use.
 Those images are for a task, classification-detection pipeline of some disease.
 So as I already asked, what are the benefits of converting those DICOM files to PNG's rather then just using pydicom and the dicom pixel_array?
 Reason I ask this is because I saw many top 5 users on kaggle do this when dealing with DICOM images.
 If I understand how networks actually works, they get as input an array of pixels as floating point numbers no? So what's the differences between DICOM pixel_array to PNG's pixel array and numpy array or tensor? both are eventually will be fed to the network as a tensor of floating numbers.
 Is the reason is because PNG's are usually faster to train?
 Is the reason is because PNG's have more libraries support for preprocessing / augmentation / etc. ?
 Is the reason is because PNG's are the format many pre-trained models expect to? (I write this knowing it's 99% not true, as mentioned the tensor thing)
 Thanks in Advance, and Please, forgive my English (I could use AI tools to fix it but I feel addicted already)

 Abstract:
  
Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications such as multi-round dialogue, where long interactions are expected, is urgently needed but poses two major challenges. Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of wind…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When trying to get language models to solve complex math problems, researchers kept running into limits. Models like GPT-3 and ChatGPT still struggle with advanced algebra, calculus, and geometry questions. The math is just too abstract and symbol-heavy for them.
 To break through this barrier, researchers from Tsinghua University and Microsoft taught models to combine natural language reasoning with calling external math tools.
 The key is their new "tool-integrated reasoning" format. Models generate a natural language plan first, then write code to invoke tools like SymPy to solve equations. They take the output results and continue verbal reasoning.
 By interleaving natural language and symbolic computations, they get the best of both worlds - semantic understanding from language models and rigorous math from tools.
 They trained versions of the LLaMA model this way, producing their Tool-Integrated Reasoning Agent (TORA). They present some strong results:
  
In evaluations on 10 math datasets, TORA substantially outperformed prior state-of-the-art methods, achieving 13-19% higher accuracy on average.
 On one competition test, TORA-7B scored 40% accuracy, beating the previous best model by 22 percentage points.
  
This demonstrates that integrating tools directly into the reasoning process can significantly enhance mathematical capabilities, even for large models like GPT-4.
 However, tough problems involving geometry and advanced algebra are still there. New techniques for symbolic reasoning and spatial understanding will likely be needed to push further.
 Overall though, tool integration seems a promising path to improve reasoning skills. Applying this to other domains like logic and programming could also be impactful.
 TLDR: Teaching language models to use math tools helps them solve way more complex problems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To fast-track AI morality to surpass human ability by 2025, Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and other developers could:
 Invest heavily in AI ethics research and development.** For example, Google AI has launched the Responsible AI Research and Development (RAIR) program, which is focused on developing new AI ethics research and tools.
 Create large-scale datasets of human moral reasoning.** For example, OpenAI has released the Moral Machine dataset, which contains over 1 million crowdsourced responses to moral dilemmas.
 Develop new AI architectures that are specifically designed for moral reasoning.** For example, Anthropic is developing a new AI architecture called "Moral Machine Learning," which is designed to learn from human moral reasoning data.
 Establish a global AI ethics research consortium and create a public database of human moral reasoning datasets.** For example, the Partnership on AI has launched the Safeguarding AI initiative, which is working to develop new safety mechanisms for AI systems.
 Fund research into developing new AI architectures for moral reasoning and develop new AI evaluation metrics for moral performance.** For example, the Moral Machine project is developing new evaluation metrics for AI systems' moral performance.
 By working together, Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and other developers can help to fast-track AI morality and create AI systems that are more moral than humans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We developed a statistical model to estimate “How many unique identities can a generative face model generate?” without exhaustively generating a lot of faces.
 Abstract: There has been tremendous progress in generating realistic faces with high fidelity over the past few years. Despite this progress, a crucial question remains unanswered: “Given a generative face model, how many unique identities can it generate?” In other words, what is the biometric capacity of the generative face model? A scientific basis for answering this question will benefit evaluating and comparing different generative face models and establish an upper bound on their scalability. This paper proposes a statistical approach to estimate the biometric capacity of generated face images in a hyperspherical feature space. We employ our approach on multiple generative models, including unconditional generators like StyleGAN, Latent Diffusion Model, and “Generated Photos,” as well as DCFace, a class-conditional generator. We also estimate capacity w.r.t. demographic attributes such as gender and age. Our capacity estimates indicate that (a) under ArcFace representation at a false acceptance rate (FAR) of 0.1%, StyleGAN3 and DCFace have a capacity upper bound of 1.43 million and 11,900, respectively; (b) the capacity reduces drastically as we lower the desired FAR with an estimate of 17,960 and 562 at FAR of 1% and 10%, respectively, for StyleGAN3; (c) there is no discernible disparity in the capacity w.r.t gender; and (d) for some generative models, there is an appreciable disparity in the capacity w.r.t age.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If I already have a trained reward model, say a sentiment classification model, that I'd like to use for PPO-based RLHF, I believe the standard method would be to instantiate the Critic/value function using the reward model, and train it further during PPO, correct?
 Would it even make sense to try PPO for RLHF without using the GAE term and thus without the value function, and just directly using the reward model's output as the advantage?
 It seems that this would be require viewing the entire generation as a single action (rather than each token's generation as an action), but most of the articles I've read on RLHF seem to treat it that way. On the other hand, all the code implementations I've seen have an Actor-Critic model producing values at each token, which I think implies that each token is an action.
 Edit: Apologies if any of this is just me having fundamental gaps in my understanding!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a machine learning engineer and researcher. I got fed up with how difficult it is to understand why neural networks behave the way they do, so i wrote a library to help with it.
 Comgra (computation graph analysis) is a library you can use with pytorch to extract all the tensor data you care about and visualize it graphically in a browser.
 This allows for a much more detailed analysis of what is happening than the usual approach of using tensorboard. You can go investigate tensors as training proceeds, drill down into individual neurons, inspect single data sets that are of special interest to you, track gradients, compare statistics between different training runs, and more.
 This tool has saved me a ton of time in my research by letting me check my hypotheses much more quickly than normal and by helping me understand how the different parts of my network really interact.
 I first published this a month ago and have made some improvements since then. I would be happy to hear even more feedback!
 My goal is to make this the go-to library used both by novices who want to understand what's going on under the hood, and by researchers in neural architecture design.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I am trying to find NE using rl algorithms for a turn based deterministic graph pursuit game. I have a way of checking if the strategies of players 1,2,3 are a NE and thought of using Q-Learning and see if it converges to a NE. Thus far it doesnt seem to work and I wonder if I made a mistake.
 The state is described as: St = [x1 x2 x3 p] where current player is p and x1,x2,x3 are the locations of the players in the graph
 Players have value functions Q^1(St), Q^2(St), Q^3(St)
 The way I update my value function is:
 player i choose e-greedy action a_t and the new state St_new
 Q^i(St) = (1-alpha)*Q^i(St)+alpha*gamma*Q(St_new)
 I have tried using a memory buffer but I havent improve the convergence success. I check if the if the values are a NE every 1000 iterations. It only converges for simple graphs.
 Do you think the way I update my value function is correct? Do you have any other traditional algorithms to suggest? Shall I move to deep learning? I am worried if simple algorithms cant converge the neural networks wont either... 
 I tried to implemenet Nash Q learning following the paper:https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume4/hu03a/hu03a.pdf
 but I am not sure if implemented correctly for a turn based game

 Youtube: https://youtu.be/Q0pP782dSh0?si=MiJAlK5k-KEyQ-Zr 
 Abstract:
  
Large multimodal models (LMMs) extend large language models (LLMs) with multi-sensory skills, such as visual understanding, to achieve stronger generic intelligence. In this paper, we analyze the latest model, GPT-4V(ision), to deepen the understanding of LMMs. The analysis focuses on the intriguing tasks that GPT-4V can perform, containing test samples to probe the quality and genericity of GPT-4V's capabilities, its supported inputs and working modes, and the effective ways to prompt the model. In our approach to exploring GPT-4V, we curate and organize a collection of carefully designed qualitative samples spanning a variety of domains and tasks. Observations from these samples demonstrate that GPT-4V's unprecedented ability in processing arbitrarily interleaved multimodal inputs and the genericity of its capabilities together make GPT-4V a powerful multimodal generalist system. Furthermore, GPT-4V's unique capability of understanding visual markers drawn on input images can give rise to new human-computer interaction methods such as visual referring prompting. We conclude the report with in-depth discussions on the emerging application scenarios and the future research directions for GPT-4V-based systems. We hope that this preliminary exploration will inspire future research on the next-generation multimodal task formulation, new ways to exploit and enhance LMMs to solve real-world problems, and gaining better understanding of multimodal foundation models.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meta Platforms recently introduced Llama 2 Long, a revolutionary AI model that outperforms top competitors with its ability to generate accurate responses to long user queries.
 For the latest advancements in AI, look here first.
 https://preview.redd.it/geqqd3k5rprb1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=e72a67fc7ef7e85902169f3061529c136beadc87
 Meta's new AI model
  
As an enhancement of the original Llama 2, Llama 2 Long deals with larger data containing longer texts and is modified to handle lengthier information sequences.
 Its stellar performance outshines other models such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and Claude 2.
  
How Llama 2 Long works
  
Meta built different versions of Llama 2, ranging from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters, which refines its learning from data.
 Llama 2 Long employs Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) technique, refining the way it encodes the position of each token, allowing fewer data and memory to produce precise responses.
 The model further fine-tunes its performance using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and synthetic data generated by Llama 2 chat itself.
  
Impressive feats and future aspirations
  
Llama 2 Long can create high-quality responses to user prompts up to 200,000 characters long, which is approximately 40 pages of text.
 Its ability to generate responses to queries on diverse topics such as history, science, literature, and sports indicates its potential to cater to complex and various user needs.
 The researchers see Llama 2 Long as a step towards broader, more adaptable AI models, and advocate for more research and dialogue to harness these models responsibly and beneficially.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If an AI were to take on this task, it would primarily rely on data mining and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. First, the AI would scrape digital platforms to collect works authored by various people. Platforms could range from academic databases like PubMed or ArXiv to blogs, forums, and social media. The goal would be to capture a wide array of intellectual output, irrespective of the person's titles or accolades.
 Next, an NLP model would evaluate the collected content based on factors like originality, complexity, and coherence. Advanced sentiment analysis could be employed to gauge the depth of understanding and nuances in the arguments made. Specialized algorithms could also be developed to assess the impact of each piece of work, using metrics such as citations, social shares, or subsequent works that build upon it.
 The AI would then create a shortlist based on these evaluations. This stage might also involve unsupervised machine learning techniques like clustering to find patterns or commonalities among the top contenders.
 The final stage would be validation, possibly using reinforcement learning. The AI could simulate various scenarios or problems and predict how the content created by these individuals would contribute to solving them. It would then refine its list based on the simulated outcomes.
 This all-AI approach would drastically reduce human bias and could be executed relatively quickly. However, it's important to note that any such system would need to be designed carefully to avoid introducing biases present in the training data or algorithms.

In practice, as requirements become more complex, you often end up with fairly lengthy prompts, especially when using methods like RAG. I was wondering, how effective are LLMs at following instructions as the system prompt grows in size and complexity?
 I did some quick experiments on this and found that, unsurprisingly, GPT-4 can follow a lot of rules (up to 50) quite accurately. But even GPT-3.5 slowly degrades and Llama-2-70b-chat starts to fail after just a few rules.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Perplexity.ai for a bit now when it hit me that I don't understand how they can sustain their business model with search. Stuff like Bing search and Google search cost around $5 or more per 1000 searches, so how can they even afford to do this kind of search. Do they have their own search index.
 Also, I don't know how they pull in the data from these sources so fast? I've played around with some things like this with Langchain with retrieval, but the speed of splitting and tokenizing website html is not very fast. Have they already pre-scrapped the websites from the search results and tokenized them for LLM retrieval?

 A while back, I stumbled upon an interesting paper that applied Reinforcement Learning to Object Localization. I got fascinated by how computer vision tasks could be transformed into a reinforcement learning problem, making it feel like a Markov decision process !
 So, i've decided to create a repository to compile all the existing (published) papers that delve into Reinforcement Learning in Computer Vision : https://github.com/rayanramoul/RLCV-Papers
 If you have any papers in mind or recommendations to enhance the repository, please don't hesitate to share them. Your input would be greatly appreciated!
 Thank you! :)

 Let me know if you need any further information!!
 EDIT: 
 One of the tasks my app needs to do is to convert image to text (aim to implement image captioning). So, if i give metaGPT the requirements for my project, is it possible it will give me the code which I need. I need to save certain tasks here so that I can focus more on operation and design side. 
 Edit: it seems, such kind of vague questions are not encouraged on this platform, I will work and will straigh away ask questions which are quite good and meet the standards of this platform. Thanks!!
 Thanks!!
 Always have a massive respect for this community!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When visualizing the inner workings of vision transformers (ViTs), researchers noticed weird spikes of attention on random background patches. This didn't make sense since the models should focus on foreground objects.
 By analyzing the output embeddings, they found a small number of tokens (2%) had super high vector norms, causing the spikes.
 The high-norm "outlier" tokens occurred in redundant areas and held less local info but more global info about the image.
 Their hypothesis is that ViTs learn to identify unimportant patches and recycle them as temporary storage instead of discarding. This enables efficient processing but causes issues.
 Their fix is simple - just add dedicated "register" tokens that provide storage space, avoiding the recycling side effects.
 Models trained with registers have:
  
Smoother and more meaningful attention maps
 Small boosts in downstream performance
 Way better object discovery abilities
  
The registers give ViTs a place to do their temporary computations without messing stuff up. Just a tiny architecture tweak improves interpretability and performance. Sweet!
 I think it's cool how they reverse-engineered this model artifact and fixed it with such a small change. More work like this will keep incrementally improving ViTs.
 TLDR: Vision transformers recycle useless patches to store data, causing problems. Adding dedicated register tokens for storage fixes it nicely.
 Full summary. Paper is here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's some evidence [1] [2] that it's possible to run text2text language model at substantially (potentially on the order of magnitude) better inference speed by keeping the decoder shallow.
 I'm curious whether some general reasoner SOTA (small model for machine translation available at [3]) style models are publicly available for this sort of thing.
 If not, how would one go about training one?
 Would it be necessary to do it entirely from scratch (extremely costly)? Or would it be possible to take, say, Flan-UL2 (20B), chop off its decoder, and train a much smaller decoder on top of it with the UL2 encoder frozen (ie how one trains adapter layers).
 Assuming the decoder hyperparameters are kept small, would this be possible within reasonable compute budget? Would that even meaningfully converge with small amount of compute (assuming same training objective as is for UL2)?
 Would the strength (ie somewhat comparable to 10B if we cut 20B in half) transfer from the SOTA encoder, or would cutting off half of the model layers kneecap it too badly?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there any notable work on duplicating layers in large feed forward models? In contrast to e.g. the brain which is essentially a directed graph most networks utilized nowerdays use a feed forward approach. E.g. transformers are able to attend to past tokens, but generate the tokens in a way where for a given token a given weight is not utilized at different stages in the feed forward pass. In my intuition this would lead to an issue where concepts (factual data as well as learned "algorithms") might be duplicated as they are needed at different depths in the generation process and are sequentially dependent on one another. This does not directly make the model less capable, as it might learn the same concept at two layers sufficiently well, but it reduces the data and parameter efficiency and and might impact generalization capabilities. Using a full on brain like graph might be hard to implement/optimize/scale on current hardware and is tricky with the backprop. But is there any work on duplicating a few layers, placing them at different depths in large models. I would guess that this would be more impactful for large models. One would essentially trade compute for better data efficiency.

Apple's spawn probability depends on the amount of dirt (less dirt, higher the probability). Currently, the observation for each agent has the manhatten distance to their closest apple and dirt.
 I have tried multiple ways of training this, including changing the observation space of the agents. But it seems the result does not outperform random agents by any significant amount.

 He/she is posting 'news' all over the AI subs, including this one, at the moment and is filling up my timeline ... and I simply don't feel right about what they are up to.
  
Is it an AI bot?
 Is it a karma farmer?
 Is it some sort of spam?
  
Am I being over cautious?
 If the consensus is that they are a normal poster - fine - I'll reenable their posts.
 In the meantime I'm enjoying a less cluttered feed!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meta has launched chatbots with personalities similar to certain celebrities, which some experts believe could be dangerous.
 
These chatbots have their own faces and social media accounts, and Meta is working on giving them a voice.
 
However, experts argue that the idea of chatbots with personalities is impossible, as algorithms cannot demonstrate intention or free will.
 
There is also a risk that chatbots with personalities could express problematic opinions, as seen in Meta's testing.
 
Meta's project is driven by profit, as users are more likely to engage with chatbots that seem human.
 
Experts believe that Meta should have explained the limits of these chatbots instead of emphasizing their human characteristics.

 Some way to translate numbers of parameters into seconds on a given GPU/CPU, any rules of thumb better than just setting up everything every time?

 I have 4 yoe in a start up company and a phd four publications 2 in high level math journals and 2 CV/DL papers in A journals and also 4 patents. I have experience with most common Cv tasks eg object detection, Multi object tracking, 2d/3d human pose estimation and monocular depth estimation. I’m well versed in typical network building blocks eg conv nets, FFNs, transformers, Diffusion etc. I have a little experience with NLP like NLTK and TTS networks. Also some other general dev technologies like ec2,s3,sql,mongoose, etc. 
 That all being said I can’t seem to even get interviews these days just straight rejections not talking to recruiters. On the other hand in 2020, I was just searching for jobs passively and had something like a 75% success rate with getting interviews. I know the job market has changed but I’m a lot more experienced at this time than then and having abysmal luck.
 Anyone have any advice would be happy to share my resume if that would make it easier to give advice. Also open to hearing what other technologies o should/could learn.

Before the night was over I went online and bought the domain name of GoGoAIGo . com and then the .ai version also. I put the dot com version up on Sedo (sedo.com/search/details/?domain=GoGoAIGo.com) for sale and I actually now own the .com .ai .org and .net versions of that phrase. Not only my decade but the two generational decades in front of me and the one generational decade behind me can remember our ole Inspector Gadget friend whom had a similar phrase, but not exact, that he would say.
 I'm an individual whom may hold onto something if I feel it has intrinsic value for a future development, which I think this can if laid out in an appropriate fashion. I'm working on another business project right now and I own some trademarks for my other business project so I'm not exactly a newbie in ways here I'm just kind of fresh to the AI realm studies. I think it's overblown right now but will be fine tuned over the next 5-7 years better and society will find a better seat for it.
 I could see this domain being like a search engine or something, maybe even something to do with robots. I expect AI robots moving forward will be regulated and have various classes that they are placed into as we integrate certain ones in our society. Let's be honest, the light-switch isn't flipping overnight or even in one quick year over this AI stuff. I'm in no rush to have a piece of AI wash my dishes for me to be honest. The last robotic thing I was thinking about getting was a robot mower to cut a field, I believe they are working on those now.
 Anybody have any unique ideas for me? I used to play with lego robots way back in high school in the early 2000's.... Seems like this website would make a great search engine but honestly there are other phrases that can be put into play with society also.
 Thanks for any mental stimulation you can toss in my direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Imagine an app that's like a helpful buddy in your pocket, always looking out for the best moments to nudge you into some real-world socializing. For example, say you're a fan of watching sports. The app notices you frequently check scores or read articles on sports sites during weekends. Right before a big game, it pops up and says, "How about inviting some friends over to watch the game?"
 Now let's talk about making socializing a sort of game. Think of the way Fitbit rewards you for walking 10,000 steps. Similarly, this app could reward you with "social points" for various activities. Invite a friend for coffee? 10 points. Call your mom? 15 points. Organize a barbecue? 50 points. And so on. These points could unlock virtual badges or even real-world rewards like discounts at local restaurants to encourage you to keep going.
 When it comes to setting personal goals, let's say you've been wanting to improve your relationship with a sibling. You set a goal in the app to have at least one meaningful conversation with them each week. The app then reminds you on a lazy Sunday afternoon, suggesting, "Why not call your sister now? It’s a good time to catch up."
 And for reflection, after you've hung out with your friends to watch the game or had that talk with your sister, the app asks you to rate how good you felt on a scale of 1-10. Over time, you'll see a graph of your happiness levels correlated with your social activities, making it super clear that quality time with people is a mood booster.
 The whole idea is to keep it simple but effective, helping you to naturally weave more social interactions into your life without making you feel overwhelmed or stressed.

 So question is (3) What are the promising research in LLMs+Symbolic architectures? (4) And how close is it to production, rather than academic? (5) Do we need non-LLM based architectures instead?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI has the potential to be a platform shift, similar to previous shifts like personal computers, the internet, and mobile.
 
Platform shifts change the dominant layer that applications are built on and can capture the majority of value from the previous generation.
 
AI could change distribution, business models, and what's possible in workflows.
 
Changes in distribution could lead to new aggregators replacing old ones, making the aggregation of quality content more difficult.
 
The business model may not change significantly, with AI likely being delivered as software-as-a-service.
 
AI can enable new workflows and drastically change existing ones.
 
While incumbents may accrue significant value, new platforms could also replace old ones.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It seems that large language models are getting bigger and bigger, and by growing they need more and more processing power.
 I know that some LLM developers have made smaller versions to test how small they can be made and function.
 But what happens when you want a LLM to do a specific job, surely it only needs a fraction of the data a general-purpose model does.
 Potential benefits of SLMs:
  
Less data.
 Potentially faster.
 Less space to hallucinate/go wrong.
 Smaller set of potentials for complete testing.
 Running costs reduced.
 Lower spec hardware needs.
  
Has anyone tried dedicating a LLM to a specific job/task and then optimizing its data size to create a SLM?
 TLDR; How large does a LLM have to be for a toaster or microwave?

 This is an especially challenging thought because we consume so much content and information digitally. I'm a little worried about how humans will or will not adjust to this incoming technology. I'm having my first child soon and it's interesting to think about what I may have to teach them.

problem reduces to convex optimization over wedge product features, which
encode the geometric structure of the training dataset. This structure is given
in terms of signed volumes of triangles and parallelotopes generated by data
vectors. The convex problem finds a small subset of samples via $\ell_1$

if multiple geographically distributed agents perform their separate RL tasks
cooperatively. Different from multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) where
multiple agents are in a common environment and should learn to cooperate or
compete with each other, in this case each agent has its separate environment
and only communicates with others to share knowledge without any cooperative or
competitive behaviour as a learning outcome. In fact, this scenario exists
widely in real life whose concept can be utilised in many applications, but is
not well understood yet and not well formulated. As the first effort, we
propose group-agent system for RL as a formulation of this scenario and the
third type of RL system with respect to single-agent and multi-agent systems.
We then propose a distributed RL framework called DDAL (Decentralised
Distributed Asynchronous Learning) designed for group-agent reinforcement
learning (GARL). We show through experiments that DDAL achieved desirable

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Classifiers built upon vision-language models such as CLIP have shown
remarkable zero-shot performance across a broad range of image classification
tasks. Prior work has studied different ways of automatically creating
descriptor sets for every class based on prompt templates, ranging from
manually engineered templates over templates obtained from a large language
model to templates built from random words and characters. In contrast,
deriving zero-shot classifiers from the respective encoded class descriptors
has remained nearly unchanged, that is: classify to the class that maximizes
the cosine similarity between its averaged encoded class descriptors and the
encoded image. However, weighting all class descriptors equally can be
suboptimal when certain descriptors match visual clues on a given image better
than others. In this work, we propose AutoCLIP, a method for auto-tuning
zero-shot classifiers. AutoCLIP assigns to each prompt template per-image
weights, which are derived from statistics of class descriptor-image
similarities at inference time. AutoCLIP is fully unsupervised, has very low
overhead, and can be easily implemented in few lines of code. We show that for
a broad range of vision-language models, datasets, and prompt templates,
AutoCLIP outperforms baselines consistently and by up to 3 percent point
accuracy.]]></summary>

learning (SSL) algorithms due to their exceptional performance. However, they
mainly depend on domain-specific data augmentations, which are not usable in

Pseudo-labeling (PL) is a general and domain-agnostic SSL approach that, unlike
consistency regularization-based methods, does not rely on the domain. PL
underperforms due to the erroneous high-confidence predictions from poorly

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Compositional generalization is a key ability of humans that enables us to
learn new concepts from only a handful examples. Machine learning models,
including the now ubiquitous transformers, struggle to generalize in this way,
and typically require thousands of examples of a concept during training in
order to generalize meaningfully. This difference in ability between humans and
artificial neural architectures, motivates this study on a neuro-symbolic
architecture called the Compositional Program Generator (CPG). CPG has three
key features: modularity, type abstraction, and recursive composition, that
enable it to generalize both systematically to new concepts in a few-shot
manner, as well as productively by length on various sequence-to-sequence
language tasks. For each input, CPG uses a grammar of the input domain and a
parser to generate a type hierarchy in which each grammar rule is assigned its
own unique semantic module, a probabilistic copy or substitution program.
Instances with the same hierarchy are processed with the same composed program,
while those with different hierarchies may be processed with different
programs. CPG learns parameters for the semantic modules and is able to learn
the semantics for new types incrementally. Given a context-free grammar of the
input language and a dictionary mapping each word in the source language to its
interpretation in the output language, CPG can achieve perfect generalization
on the SCAN and COGS benchmarks, in both standard and extreme few-shot
settings.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a promising approach for training deep
classification models using labeled and unlabeled datasets. However, existing
SSL methods rely on a large unlabeled dataset, which may not always be
available in many real-world applications due to legal constraints (e.g.,
GDPR). In this paper, we investigate the research question: Can we train SSL
models without real unlabeled datasets? Instead of using real unlabeled
datasets, we propose an SSL method using synthetic datasets generated from
generative foundation models trained on datasets containing millions of samples
in diverse domains (e.g., ImageNet). Our main concepts are identifying
synthetic samples that emulate unlabeled samples from generative foundation
models and training classifiers using these synthetic samples. To achieve this,
our method is formulated as an alternating optimization problem: (i)
meta-learning of generative foundation models and (ii) SSL of classifiers using
real labeled and synthetic unlabeled samples. For (i), we propose a
meta-learning objective that optimizes latent variables to generate samples
that resemble real labeled samples and minimize the validation loss. For (ii),
we propose a simple unsupervised loss function that regularizes the feature
extractors of classifiers to maximize the performance improvement obtained from
synthetic samples. We confirm that our method outperforms baselines using
generative foundation models on SSL. We also demonstrate that our methods
outperform SSL using real unlabeled datasets in scenarios with extremely small
amounts of labeled datasets. This suggests that synthetic samples have the
potential to provide improvement gains more efficiently than real unlabeled
data.]]></summary>

enabling intrinsically safe human-robot collaboration and achieving a higher
load-to-mass ratio. However, controlling flexible robots is complicated due to
their complex dynamics, which include oscillatory behavior and a
high-dimensional state space. NMPC offers an effective means to control such
robots, but its extensive computational demands often limit its application in
real-time scenarios. To enable fast control of flexible robots, we propose a
framework for a safe approximation of NMPC using imitation learning and a
predictive safety filter. Our framework significantly reduces computation time
while incurring a slight loss in performance. Compared to NMPC, our framework
shows more than a eightfold improvement in computation time when controlling a
three-dimensional flexible robot arm in simulation, all while guaranteeing
safety constraints. Notably, our approach outperforms conventional

challenging for the financial sector. Owing to recent advancements in deep
learning techniques, deep learning models are gradually replacing traditional
statistical and machine learning models as the first choice for price
forecasting tasks. This shift in model selection has led to a notable rise in

into deep learning-based forecasting models, presenting information on model
architectures, practical applications, and their respective advantages and
disadvantages. In particular, detailed information is provided on advanced
models for price forecasting, such as Transformers, generative adversarial
networks (GANs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and deep quantum neural networks
(DQNNs). The present contribution also includes potential directions for future
research, such as examining the effectiveness of deep learning models with

Federated meta-learning is a promising answer to this question, as it addresses
the scarcity of labeled data and heterogeneous data distribution across devices
in the real world. However, deploying TinyML hardware faces unique resource
constraints, making existing methods impractical due to energy, privacy, and
communication limitations. We introduce TinyMetaFed, a model-agnostic

collaborative training of a neural network initialization that can be quickly
fine-tuned on new devices. It offers communication savings and privacy
protection through partial local reconstruction and Top-P% selective
communication, computational efficiency via online learning, and robustness to
client heterogeneity through few-shot learning. The evaluations on three TinyML
use cases demonstrate that TinyMetaFed can significantly reduce energy

in representing graphs as metric measure spaces, allowing to successfully

developing applications that allow patients to self-monitor their recovery. An
important component of this is the segmentation of eczema region from such

such as convolutional (CNN)-based U-Net or transformer-based Swin U-Net. While
effective, these methods require high volume of annotated data, which can be
difficult to obtain. Here, we investigate the capabilities of visual in-context
learning that can perform few-shot eczema segmentation with just a handful of

strategy for applying in-context learning for eczema segmentation with a
generalist vision model called SegGPT. When benchmarked on a dataset of
annotated eczema images, we show that SegGPT with just 2 representative example
images from the training dataset performs better (mIoU: 36.69) than a CNN U-Net
trained on 428 images (mIoU: 32.60). We also discover that using more number of
examples for SegGPT may in fact be harmful to its performance. Our result
highlights the importance of visual in-context learning in developing faster

computation of networks. Our proposal explicitly constructs patch-level graphs
in different layers and then linearly interpolates neighborhood patch features,
serving as a general and effective regularization strategy. Further, we
customize our approach into two kinds of popular regularization methods, namely
Virtual Adversarial Training (VAT) and MixUp as well as its variants. The first
derived \textbf{Pani VAT} presents a novel way to construct non-local
adversarial smoothness by employing patch-level interpolated perturbations. The
second derived \textbf{Pani MixUp} method extends the MixUp, and achieves
superiority over MixUp and competitive performance over state-of-the-art
variants of MixUp method with a significant advantage in computational
efficiency. Extensive experiments have verified the effectiveness of our Pani
approach in both supervised and semi-supervised settings.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Federated learning has gained popularity as a means of training models
distributed across the wireless edge. The paper introduces delay-aware
hierarchical federated learning (DFL) to improve the efficiency of distributed
machine learning (ML) model training by accounting for communication delays
between edge and cloud. Different from traditional federated learning, DFL
leverages multiple stochastic gradient descent iterations on local datasets
within each global aggregation period and intermittently aggregates model
parameters through edge servers in local subnetworks. During global
synchronization, the cloud server consolidates local models with the outdated
global model using a local-global combiner, thus preserving crucial elements of
both, enhancing learning efficiency under the presence of delay. A set of
conditions is obtained to achieve the sub-linear convergence rate of O(1/k) for
strongly convex and smooth loss functions. Based on these findings, an adaptive
control algorithm is developed for DFL, implementing policies to mitigate
energy consumption and communication latency while aiming for sublinear
convergence. Numerical evaluations show DFL's superior performance in terms of
faster global model convergence, reduced resource consumption, and robustness
against communication delays compared to existing FL algorithms. In summary,
this proposed method offers improved efficiency and results when dealing with
both convex and non-convex loss functions.]]></summary>

high-stakes settings, it becomes important to ensure that predictions of these
models are not only adversarially robust, but also readily explainable to

simultaneously achieved or if there exist trade-offs between them. In this
work, we make one of the first attempts at studying the impact of adversarially
robust models on actionable explanations which provide end users with a means
for recourse. We theoretically and empirically analyze the cost (ease of
implementation) and validity (probability of obtaining a positive model
prediction) of recourses output by state-of-the-art algorithms when the
underlying models are adversarially robust vs. non-robust. More specifically,
we derive theoretical bounds on the differences between the cost and the
validity of the recourses generated by state-of-the-art algorithms for
adversarially robust vs. non-robust linear and non-linear models. Our empirical
results with multiple real-world datasets validate our theoretical results and
show the impact of varying degrees of model robustness on the cost and validity
of the resulting recourses. Our analyses demonstrate that adversarially robust
models significantly increase the cost and reduce the validity of the resulting
recourses, thus shedding light on the inherent trade-offs between adversarial
robustness and actionable explanations]]></summary>

data, the acquisition of quality labels often involves laborious human
annotations or slow and expensive scientific measurements. Machine learning is
becoming an appealing alternative as sophisticated predictive techniques are
being used to quickly and cheaply produce large amounts of predicted labels;
e.g., predicted protein structures are used to supplement experimentally
derived structures, predictions of socioeconomic indicators from satellite
imagery are used to supplement accurate survey data, and so on. Since
predictions are imperfect and potentially biased, this practice brings into
question the validity of downstream inferences. We introduce cross-prediction:
a method for valid inference powered by machine learning. With a small labeled
dataset and a large unlabeled dataset, cross-prediction imputes the missing
labels via machine learning and applies a form of debiasing to remedy the
prediction inaccuracies. The resulting inferences achieve the desired error
probability and are more powerful than those that only leverage the labeled
data. Closely related is the recent proposal of prediction-powered inference,
which assumes that a good pre-trained model is already available. We show that
cross-prediction is consistently more powerful than an adaptation of
prediction-powered inference in which a fraction of the labeled data is split
off and used to train the model. Finally, we observe that cross-prediction
gives more stable conclusions than its competitors; its confidence intervals
typically have significantly lower variability.]]></summary>

Federated Non Target Distillation, which retains inter-domain knowledge while

polynomial control policies for control-affine nonlinear systems which
guarantees runtime stability to a goal state, when using visual observations

Lyapunov analysis to formulate the problem of synthesizing such policies. This
problem is nonconvex in the policy parameters and the Lyapunov function that is
used to prove the stability of the policy. To solve this problem approximately,
we propose two approaches: the first solves a sequence of sum-of-squares
optimization problems to iteratively improve a policy which is provably-stable
by construction, while the second directly performs gradient-based optimization
on the parameters of the polynomial policy, and its closed-loop stability is
verified a posteriori. We extend our approach to provide stability guarantees
in the presence of observation noise, which realistically arises due to errors
in the learned perception module. We evaluate our approach on several
underactuated nonlinear systems, including pendula and quadrotors, showing that
our guarantees translate to empirical stability when controlling these systems
from images, while baseline approaches can fail to reliably stabilize the

accepting probabilistic notions of universal approximation and invariance can
reduce our resource requirements. More specifically, we propose a class of

give parameter and sample size conditions in which RLCs can, with high
probability, approximate any (smooth) function while preserving invariance to
compact group transformations. Leveraging this result, we design three RLCs
that are provably probabilistic invariant for classification tasks over sets,
graphs, and spherical data. We show how these models can achieve probabilistic

this work, we propose a novel method to alleviate these problems that we call
odd-$k$-out learning (OKO), which minimizes the cross-entropy error for sets
rather than for single examples. This naturally allows the model to capture
correlations across data examples and achieves both better accuracy and
calibration, especially in limited training data and class-imbalanced regimes.
Perhaps surprisingly, OKO often yields better calibration even when training
with hard labels and dropping any additional calibration parameter tuning, such
as temperature scaling. We provide theoretical justification, establishing that
OKO naturally yields better calibration, and provide extensive experimental
analyses that corroborate our theoretical findings. We emphasize that OKO is a
general framework that can be easily adapted to many settings and the trained
model can be applied to single examples at inference time, without introducing
significant run-time overhead or architecture changes.]]></summary>

group nodes into different clusters. Better augmentation techniques benefit the
quality of the contrastive samples, thus being one of key factors to improve
performance. However, the augmentation samples in existing methods are always
predefined by human experiences, and agnostic from the downstream task
clustering, thus leading to high human resource costs and poor performance. To
this end, we propose an Attribute Graph Clustering method via Learnable
Augmentation (\textbf{AGCLA}), which introduces learnable augmentors for
high-quality and suitable augmented samples for CDGC. Specifically, we design
two learnable augmentors for attribute and structure information, respectively.
Besides, two refinement matrices, including the high-confidence pseudo-label
matrix and the cross-view sample similarity matrix, are generated to improve
the reliability of the learned affinity matrix. During the training procedure,
we notice that there exist differences between the optimization goals for
training learnable augmentors and contrastive learning networks. In other
words, we should both guarantee the consistency of the embeddings as well as
the diversity of the augmented samples. Thus, an adversarial learning mechanism
is designed in our method. Moreover, a two-stage training strategy is leveraged
for the high-confidence refinement matrices. Extensive experimental results

multiple parties with different features about the same set of users jointly
train machine learning models without exposing their raw data or model

of VFL, as well as current advances and challenges in various aspects,
including effectiveness, efficiency, and privacy. We provide an exhaustive
categorization for VFL settings and privacy-preserving protocols and
comprehensively analyze the privacy attacks and defense strategies for each

includes three stages: single-modality filtering, cross-modality filtering, and
data distribution alignment. We integrate existing methods and propose new
solutions, such as computing CLIP score on horizontally flipped images to
mitigate the interference of scene text, using vision and language models to
retrieve training samples for target downstream tasks, rebalancing the data
distribution to improve the efficiency of allocating the computational budget,

post-injury complications, e.g., infection, malunion, or hardware irritation,
in patients with lower extremity fractures. The research focused on the
proficiency of supervised machine learning models predicting complications
using consecutive gait datasets. We identified patients with lower extremity
fractures at an academic center. Patients underwent gait analysis with a
chest-mounted IMU device. Using software, raw gait data was preprocessed,
emphasizing 12 essential gait variables. Machine learning models including
XGBoost, Logistic Regression, SVM, LightGBM, and Random Forest were trained,
tested, and evaluated. Attention was given to class imbalance, addressed using
SMOTE. We introduced a methodology to compute the Rate of Change (ROC) for gait
variables, independent of the time difference between gait analyses. XGBoost
was the optimal model both before and after applying SMOTE. Prior to SMOTE, the
model achieved an average test AUC of 0.90 (95% CI: [0.79, 1.00]) and test
accuracy of 86% (95% CI: [75%, 97%]). Feature importance analysis attributed
importance to the duration between injury and gait analysis. Data patterns
showed early physiological compensations, followed by stabilization phases,
emphasizing prompt gait analysis. This study underscores the potential of
machine learning, particularly XGBoost, in gait analysis for orthopedic care.
Predicting post-injury complications, early gait assessment becomes vital,
revealing intervention points. The findings support a shift in orthopedics
towards a data-informed approach, enhancing patient outcomes.]]></summary>

critical for obtaining a comprehensive and accurate perception of the real
world. Drawing inspiration from neuroscience, we develop the
Information-Theoretic Hierarchical Perception (ITHP) model, which utilizes the
concept of information bottleneck. Distinct from most traditional fusion models
that aim to incorporate all modalities as input, our model designates the prime
modality as input, while the remaining modalities act as detectors in the
information pathway. Our proposed perception model focuses on constructing an
effective and compact information flow by achieving a balance between the
minimization of mutual information between the latent state and the input modal
state, and the maximization of mutual information between the latent states and
the remaining modal states. This approach leads to compact latent state
representations that retain relevant information while minimizing redundancy,
thereby substantially enhancing the performance of downstream tasks.
Experimental evaluations on both the MUStARD and CMU-MOSI datasets demonstrate
that our model consistently distills crucial information in multimodal learning
scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art benchmarks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graph unlearning has emerged as a pivotal method to delete information from a
pre-trained graph neural network (GNN). One may delete nodes, a class of nodes,
edges, or a class of edges. An unlearning method enables the GNN model to
comply with data protection regulations (i.e., the right to be forgotten),
adapt to evolving data distributions, and reduce the GPU-hours carbon footprint
by avoiding repetitive retraining. Existing partitioning and aggregation-based
methods have limitations due to their poor handling of local graph dependencies
and additional overhead costs. More recently, GNNDelete offered a
model-agnostic approach that alleviates some of these issues. Our work takes a
novel approach to address these challenges in graph unlearning through
knowledge distillation, as it distills to delete in GNN (D2DGN). It is a
model-agnostic distillation framework where the complete graph knowledge is
divided and marked for retention and deletion. It performs distillation with
response-based soft targets and feature-based node embedding while minimizing
KL divergence. The unlearned model effectively removes the influence of deleted
graph elements while preserving knowledge about the retained graph elements.
D2DGN surpasses the performance of existing methods when evaluated on various
real-world graph datasets by up to $43.1\%$ (AUC) in edge and node unlearning
tasks. Other notable advantages include better efficiency, better performance
in removing target elements, preservation of performance for the retained
elements, and zero overhead costs. Notably, our D2DGN surpasses the
state-of-the-art GNNDelete in AUC by $2.4\%$, improves membership inference
ratio by $+1.3$, requires $10.2\times10^6$ fewer FLOPs per forward pass and up
to $\mathbf{3.2}\times$ faster.]]></summary>

in the LLM literature. We aim to understand when and why the incorporation of
structural information inherent in graph data can improve the prediction
performance of LLMs on node classification tasks. To address the ``when''
question, we examine a variety of prompting methods for encoding structural
information, in settings where textual node features are either rich or scarce.
For the ``why'' questions, we probe into two potential contributing factors to
the LLM performance: data leakage and homophily. Our exploration of these
questions reveals that (i) LLMs can benefit from structural information,
especially when textual node features are scarce; (ii) there is no substantial
evidence indicating that the performance of LLMs is significantly attributed to
data leakage; and (iii) the performance of LLMs on a target node is strongly
positively related to the local homophily ratio of the node.]]></summary>

component to safe planning in autonomous vehicles. Here, we represent
continuous trajectories as sequences of discrete motion tokens and cast
multi-agent motion prediction as a language modeling task over this domain. Our
model, MotionLM, provides several advantages: First, it does not require
anchors or explicit latent variable optimization to learn multimodal
distributions. Instead, we leverage a single standard language modeling
objective, maximizing the average log probability over sequence tokens. Second,
our approach bypasses post-hoc interaction heuristics where individual agent
trajectory generation is conducted prior to interactive scoring. Instead,
MotionLM produces joint distributions over interactive agent futures in a
single autoregressive decoding process. In addition, the model's sequential
factorization enables temporally causal conditional rollouts. The proposed
approach establishes new state-of-the-art performance for multi-agent motion

images is the lack of sufficient labeled training data, owing to the cost of
acquiring such data. Realizing that object detection methods for the RGB
modality are quite robust (at least for some commonplace classes, like person,
car, etc.), thanks to the giant training sets that exist, in this work we seek
to leverage cues from the RGB modality to scale object detectors to the IR
modality, while preserving model performance in the RGB modality. At the core
of our method, is a novel tensor decomposition method called TensorFact which
splits the convolution kernels of a layer of a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) into low-rank factor matrices, with fewer parameters than the original
CNN. We first pretrain these factor matrices on the RGB modality, for which
plenty of training data are assumed to exist and then augment only a few
trainable parameters for training on the IR modality to avoid over-fitting,
while encouraging them to capture complementary cues from those trained only on
the RGB modality. We validate our approach empirically by first assessing how
well our TensorFact decomposed network performs at the task of detecting
objects in RGB images vis-a-vis the original network and then look at how well
it adapts to IR images of the FLIR ADAS v1 dataset. For the latter, we train
models under scenarios that pose challenges stemming from data paucity. From
the experiments, we observe that: (i) TensorFact shows performance gains on RGB
images; (ii) further, this pre-trained model, when fine-tuned, outperforms a
standard state-of-the-art object detector on the FLIR ADAS v1 dataset by about
4% in terms of mAP 50 score.]]></summary>

demographic subgroups such as elder and female. Recently, fair representation
learning (FRL) trained by deep neural networks has demonstrated superior
performance, whereby representations containing no demographic information are
inferred from the data and then used as the input to classification or other
downstream tasks. Despite the development of FRL methods, their vulnerability
under data poisoning attack, a popular protocol to benchmark model robustness
under adversarial scenarios, is under-explored. Data poisoning attacks have
been developed for classical fair machine learning methods which incorporate
fairness constraints into shallow-model classifiers. Nonetheless, these attacks
fall short in FRL due to notably different fairness goals and model
architectures. This work proposes the first data poisoning framework attacking
FRL. We induce the model to output unfair representations that contain as much
demographic information as possible by injecting carefully crafted poisoning
samples into the training data. This attack entails a prohibitive bilevel
optimization, wherefore an effective approximated solution is proposed. A
theoretical analysis on the needed number of poisoning samples is derived and
sheds light on defending against the attack. Experiments on benchmark fairness
datasets and state-of-the-art fair representation learning models demonstrate
the superiority of our attack.]]></summary>

is well-established that Shamir secret-sharing coding strategies can enable
perfect information-theoretic privacy in distributed computation via the
celebrated algorithm of Ben Or, Goldwasser and Wigderson (the "BGW algorithm").
However, perfect privacy and accuracy require an honest majority, that is, $N
\geq 2t+1$ compute nodes are required to ensure privacy against any $t$
colluding adversarial nodes. By allowing for some controlled amount of
information leakage and approximate multiplication instead of exact
multiplication, we study coding schemes for the setting where the number of
honest nodes can be a minority, that is $N< 2t+1.$ We develop a tight
characterization privacy-accuracy trade-off for cases where $N < 2t+1$ by
measuring information leakage using {differential} privacy instead of perfect
privacy, and using the mean squared error metric for accuracy. A novel

randomized controlled trials to the target population where we only have the
control group data. Previous works rely critically on the mean exchangeability
assumption. However, as pointed out by many current studies, the mean
exchangeability assumption might be violated. Motivated by the synthetic
control method, we construct a synthetic treatment group for the target
population by a weighted mixture of treatment groups of source populations. We
estimate the weights by minimizing the conditional maximum mean discrepancy
between the weighted control groups of source populations and the target
population. We establish the asymptotic normality of the synthetic treatment
group estimator based on the sieve semiparametric theory. Our method can serve
as a novel complementary approach when the mean exchangeability assumption is
violated. Experiments are conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Decision forests are widely used for classification and regression tasks. A
lesser known property of tree-based methods is that one can construct a
proximity matrix from the tree(s), and these proximity matrices are induced
kernels. While there has been extensive research on the applications and
properties of kernels, there is relatively little research on kernels induced
by decision forests. We construct Kernel Mean Embedding Random Forests (KMERF),
which induce kernels from random trees and/or forests using leaf-node
proximity. We introduce the notion of an asymptotically characteristic kernel,
and prove that KMERF kernels are asymptotically characteristic for both
discrete and continuous data. Because KMERF is data-adaptive, we suspected it
would outperform kernels selected a priori on finite sample data. We illustrate
that KMERF nearly dominates current state-of-the-art kernel-based tests across
a diverse range of high-dimensional two-sample and independence testing
settings. Furthermore, our forest-based approach is interpretable, and provides
feature importance metrics that readily distinguish important dimensions,
unlike other high-dimensional non-parametric testing procedures. Hence, this
work demonstrates the decision forest-based kernel can be more powerful and
more interpretable than existing methods, flying in the face of conventional
wisdom of the trade-off between the two.]]></summary>

aspects. However, when applying them to the highly specialized, safe-critical
legal domain, it is unclear how much legal knowledge they possess and whether
they can reliably perform legal-related tasks. To address this gap, we propose
a comprehensive evaluation benchmark LawBench. LawBench has been meticulously
crafted to have precise assessment of the LLMs' legal capabilities from three
cognitive levels: (1) Legal knowledge memorization: whether LLMs can memorize
needed legal concepts, articles and facts; (2) Legal knowledge understanding:
whether LLMs can comprehend entities, events and relationships within legal
text; (3) Legal knowledge applying: whether LLMs can properly utilize their
legal knowledge and make necessary reasoning steps to solve realistic legal
tasks. LawBench contains 20 diverse tasks covering 5 task types: single-label
classification (SLC), multi-label classification (MLC), regression, extraction
and generation. We perform extensive evaluations of 51 LLMs on LawBench,
including 20 multilingual LLMs, 22 Chinese-oriented LLMs and 9 legal specific
LLMs. The results show that GPT-4 remains the best-performing LLM in the legal
domain, surpassing the others by a significant margin. While fine-tuning LLMs
on legal specific text brings certain improvements, we are still a long way
from obtaining usable and reliable LLMs in legal tasks. All data, model
predictions and evaluation code are released in
https://github.com/open-compass/LawBench/. We hope this benchmark provides
in-depth understanding of the LLMs' domain-specified capabilities and speed up
the development of LLMs in the legal domain.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Batch reinforcement learning (RL) defines the task of learning from a fixed
batch of data lacking exhaustive exploration. Worst-case optimality algorithms,
which calibrate a value-function model class from logged experience and perform
some type of pessimistic evaluation under the learned model, have emerged as a
promising paradigm for batch RL. However, contemporary works on this stream
have commonly overlooked the hierarchical decision-making structure hidden in
the optimization landscape. In this paper, we adopt a game-theoretical
viewpoint and model the policy learning diagram as a two-player general-sum
game with a leader-follower structure. We propose a novel stochastic
gradient-based learning algorithm: StackelbergLearner, in which the leader
player updates according to the total derivative of its objective instead of
the usual individual gradient, and the follower player makes individual updates
and ensures transition-consistent pessimistic reasoning. The derived learning
dynamic naturally lends StackelbergLearner to a game-theoretic interpretation
and provides a convergence guarantee to differentiable Stackelberg equilibria.
From a theoretical standpoint, we provide instance-dependent regret bounds with
general function approximation, which shows that our algorithm can learn a
best-effort policy that is able to compete against any comparator policy that
is covered by batch data. Notably, our theoretical regret guarantees only
require realizability without any data coverage and strong function
approximation conditions, e.g., Bellman closedness, which is in contrast to
prior works lacking such guarantees. Through comprehensive experiments, we find
that our algorithm consistently performs as well or better as compared to
state-of-the-art methods in batch RL benchmark and real-world datasets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We study unconstrained Online Linear Optimization with Lipschitz losses. The
goal is to simultaneously achieve ($i$) second order gradient adaptivity; and
($ii$) comparator norm adaptivity also known as "parameter freeness" in the
literature. Existing regret bounds (Cutkosky and Orabona, 2018; Mhammedi and
Koolen, 2020; Jacobsen and Cutkosky, 2022) have the suboptimal $O(\sqrt{V_T\log
V_T})$ dependence on the gradient variance $V_T$, while the present work
improves it to the optimal rate $O(\sqrt{V_T})$ using a novel
continuous-time-inspired algorithm, without any impractical doubling trick.
This result can be extended to the setting with unknown Lipschitz constant,
eliminating the range ratio problem from prior works (Mhammedi and Koolen,
2020).

Concretely, we first show that the aimed simultaneous adaptivity can be
achieved fairly easily in a continuous time analogue of the problem, where the
environment is modeled by an arbitrary continuous semimartingale. Then, our key
innovation is a new discretization argument that preserves such adaptivity in
the discrete time adversarial setting. This refines a non-gradient-adaptive
discretization argument from (Harvey et al., 2023), both algorithmically and
analytically, which could be of independent interest.]]></summary>

superior performance compared to our baseline methods, namely, zero-forcing
beamforming (ZFBF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalizer.
Additionally, NNBF is scalable to the number of single-antenna user equipments

oscillations and granulation, thereby offering key insights into the internal
structure and evolutionary state of stars. Conventional asteroseismic
techniques have been largely confined to power spectral analysis, neglecting
the valuable phase information contained within light curves. While recent
machine learning applications in asteroseismology utilizing Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) have successfully inferred stellar attributes from light
curves, they are often limited by the local feature extraction inherent in
convolutional operations. To circumvent these constraints, we present
$\textit{Astroconformer}$, a Transformer-based deep learning framework designed
to capture long-range dependencies in stellar light curves. Our empirical
analysis, which focuses on estimating surface gravity ($\log g$), is grounded
in a carefully curated dataset derived from $\textit{Kepler}$ light curves.
These light curves feature asteroseismic $\log g$ values spanning from 0.2 to
4.4. Our results underscore that, in the regime where the training data is
abundant, $\textit{Astroconformer}$ attains a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of
0.017 dex around $\log g \approx 3 $. Even in regions where training data are
sparse, the RMSE can reach 0.1 dex. It outperforms not only the K-nearest
neighbor-based model ($\textit{The SWAN}$) but also state-of-the-art CNNs.
Ablation studies confirm that the efficacy of the models in this particular
task is strongly influenced by the size of their receptive fields, with larger
receptive fields correlating with enhanced performance. Moreover, we find that
the attention mechanisms within $\textit{Astroconformer}$ are well-aligned with
the inherent characteristics of stellar oscillations and granulation present in

taken anywhere on Earth. This task has considerable challenges due to immense
variation in geographic landscapes. The image-to-image retrieval-based
approaches fail to solve this problem on a global scale as it is not feasible
to construct a large gallery of images covering the entire world. Instead,
existing approaches divide the globe into discrete geographic cells,
transforming the problem into a classification task. However, their performance
is limited by the predefined classes and often results in inaccurate
localizations when an image's location significantly deviates from its class
center. To overcome these limitations, we propose GeoCLIP, a novel
CLIP-inspired Image-to-GPS retrieval approach that enforces alignment between
the image and its corresponding GPS locations. GeoCLIP's location encoder
models the Earth as a continuous function by employing positional encoding
through random Fourier features and constructing a hierarchical representation
that captures information at varying resolutions to yield a semantically rich
high-dimensional feature suitable to use even beyond geo-localization. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work employing GPS encoding for
geo-localization. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method via extensive
experiments and ablations on benchmark datasets. We achieve competitive
performance with just 20% of training data, highlighting its effectiveness even
in limited-data settings. Furthermore, we qualitatively demonstrate
geo-localization using a text query by leveraging CLIP backbone of our image
encoder.]]></summary>

surveillance, as they are often available at a finer spatial and temporal
resolution, larger coverage, and lower latency than traditional surveillance
signals. We describe the problem of spatial and temporal heterogeneity in these
signals derived from these data sources, where spatial and/or temporal biases
are present. We present a method to use a ``guiding'' signal to correct for
these biases and produce a more reliable signal that can be used for modeling
and forecasting. The method assumes that the heterogeneity can be approximated
by a low-rank matrix and that the temporal heterogeneity is smooth over time.
We also present a hyperparameter selection algorithm to choose the parameters
representing the matrix rank and degree of temporal smoothness of the
corrections. In the absence of ground truth, we use maps and plots to argue
that this method does indeed reduce heterogeneity. Reducing heterogeneity from
auxiliary data sources greatly increases their utility in modeling and
forecasting epidemics.]]></summary>

estimators in the presence of heavy-tailed contamination of both the covariates

optimally tuned location parameter $\delta$ is suboptimal in the
high-dimensional regime in the presence of heavy-tailed noise, highlighting the
necessity of further regularisation to achieve optimal performance. This result
also uncovers the existence of a curious transition in $\delta$ as a function
of the sample complexity and contamination. Moreover, we derive the decay rates
for the excess risk of ridge regression. We show that, while it is both optimal
and universal for noise distributions with finite second moment, its decay rate
can be considerably faster when the covariates' second moment does not exist.

for deep neural networks. The existing regularization techniques mainly rely on
the i.i.d. assumption and only consider the knowledge from the current sample,

work, we propose a general regularizer called \textbf{Patch-level Neighborhood
Interpolation~(Pani)} that conducts a non-local representation in the
computation of networks. Our proposal explicitly constructs patch-level graphs
in different layers and then linearly interpolates neighborhood patch features,
serving as a general and effective regularization strategy. Further, we
customize our approach into two kinds of popular regularization methods, namely
Virtual Adversarial Training (VAT) and MixUp as well as its variants. The first
derived \textbf{Pani VAT} presents a novel way to construct non-local
adversarial smoothness by employing patch-level interpolated perturbations. The
second derived \textbf{Pani MixUp} method extends the MixUp, and achieves
superiority over MixUp and competitive performance over state-of-the-art
variants of MixUp method with a significant advantage in computational

grids, especially wind and solar generation, results in increased operational
uncertainty. In that context, accurate forecasts are critical, especially for
wind generation, which exhibits large variability and is historically harder to
predict. To overcome this challenge, this work proposes a novel
Bundle-Predict-Reconcile (BPR) framework that integrates asset bundling,
machine learning, and forecast reconciliation techniques. The BPR framework
first learns an intermediate hierarchy level (the bundles), then predicts wind
power at the asset, bundle, and fleet level, and finally reconciles all
forecasts to ensure consistency. This approach effectively introduces an
auxiliary learning task (predicting the bundle-level time series) to help the
main learning tasks. The paper also introduces new asset-bundling criteria that
capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of wind power time series. Extensive
numerical experiments are conducted on an industry-size dataset of 283 wind
farms in the MISO footprint. The experiments consider short-term and day-ahead
forecasts, and evaluates a large variety of forecasting models that include
weather predictions as covariates. The results demonstrate the benefits of BPR,
which consistently and significantly improves forecast accuracy over baselines,

models and adversarial defense techniques. They pose severe security problems
for deep learning applications because they can effectively bypass defense
mechanisms. However, previous attack methods often utilize Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), which are not theoretically provable and thus
generate unrealistic examples by incorporating adversarial objectives,
especially for large-scale datasets like ImageNet. In this paper, we propose a
new method, called AdvDiff, to generate unrestricted adversarial examples with
diffusion models. We design two novel adversarial guidance techniques to
conduct adversarial sampling in the reverse generation process of diffusion
models. These two techniques are effective and stable to generate high-quality,
realistic adversarial examples by integrating gradients of the target
classifier interpretably. Experimental results on MNIST and ImageNet datasets
demonstrate that AdvDiff is effective to generate unrestricted adversarial

the risk prediction for the events of interest can support an informative
outlook for a patient's medical journey. Given the existence of data censoring,
an effective way of survival analysis is to enforce the pairwise temporal
concordance between censored and observed data, aiming to utilize the time
interval before censoring as partially observed time-to-event labels for
supervised learning. Although existing studies mostly employed ranking methods
to pursue an ordering objective, contrastive methods which learn a
discriminative embedding by having data contrast against each other, have not
been explored thoroughly for survival analysis. Therefore, in this paper, we
propose a novel Ontology-aware Temporality-based Contrastive Survival (OTCSurv)
analysis framework that utilizes survival durations from both censored and
observed data to define temporal distinctiveness and construct negative sample
pairs with adjustable hardness for contrastive learning. Specifically, we first
use an ontological encoder and a sequential self-attention encoder to represent
the longitudinal EHR data with rich contexts. Second, we design a temporal
contrastive loss to capture varying survival durations in a supervised setting
through a hardness-aware negative sampling mechanism. Last, we incorporate the
contrastive task into the time-to-event predictive task with multiple loss
components. We conduct extensive experiments using a large EHR dataset to
forecast the risk of hospitalized patients who are in danger of developing
acute kidney injury (AKI), a critical and urgent medical condition. The
effectiveness and explainability of the proposed model are validated through
comprehensive quantitative and qualitative studies.]]></summary>

natural audio samples from a wide variety of semantic classes. For this task,
the videos are required to be aligned both globally and temporally with the
input audio: globally, the input audio is semantically associated with the
entire output video, and temporally, each segment of the input audio is
associated with a corresponding segment of that video. We utilize an existing
text-conditioned video generation model and a pre-trained audio encoder model.
The proposed method is based on a lightweight adaptor network, which learns to
map the audio-based representation to the input representation expected by the
text-to-video generation model. As such, it also enables video generation
conditioned on text, audio, and, for the first time as far as we can ascertain,
on both text and audio. We validate our method extensively on three datasets
demonstrating significant semantic diversity of audio-video samples and further
propose a novel evaluation metric (AV-Align) to assess the alignment of
generated videos with input audio samples. AV-Align is based on the detection
and comparison of energy peaks in both modalities. In comparison to recent
state-of-the-art approaches, our method generates videos that are better
aligned with the input sound, both with respect to content and temporal axis.
We also show that videos produced by our method present higher visual quality
and are more diverse.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) have recently emerged as a
novel and powerful technique for self-supervised representation learning. They
aim to learn an energy-based model by predicting the latent representation of a
target signal $y$ from a context signal $x$. JEPAs bypass the need for data
augmentation and negative samples, which are typically required by contrastive
learning, while avoiding the overfitting issues associated with
generative-based pretraining. In this paper, we show that graph-level
representations can be effectively modeled using this paradigm and propose
Graph-JEPA, the first JEPA for the graph domain. In particular, we employ
masked modeling to learn embeddings for different subgraphs of the input graph.
To endow the representations with the implicit hierarchy that is often present
in graph-level concepts, we devise an alternative training objective that
consists of predicting the coordinates of the encoded subgraphs on the unit
hyperbola in the 2D plane. Extensive validation shows that Graph-JEPA can learn
representations that are expressive and competitive in both graph
classification and regression problems.]]></summary>

locomotion and interaction capabilities, which is generally referred to as
mobile manipulation (MoMa). MoMa tasks are difficult due to the large action
space of the robot and the common multi-objective nature of the task, e.g.,
efficiently reaching a goal while avoiding obstacles. Current approaches often
segregate tasks into navigation without manipulation and stationary
manipulation without locomotion by manually matching parts of the action space
to MoMa sub-objectives (e.g. learning base actions for locomotion objectives
and learning arm actions for manipulation). This solution prevents simultaneous
combinations of locomotion and interaction degrees of freedom and requires
human domain knowledge for both partitioning the action space and matching the
action parts to the sub-objectives. In this paper, we introduce Causal MoMa, a
new reinforcement learning framework to train policies for typical MoMa tasks
that makes use of the most favorable subspace of the robot's action space to
address each sub-objective. Causal MoMa automatically discovers the causal
dependencies between actions and terms of the reward function and exploits
these dependencies through causal policy gradient that reduces gradient
variance compared to previous state-of-the-art reinforcement learning
algorithms, improving convergence and results. We evaluate the performance of
Causal MoMa on three types of simulated robots across different MoMa tasks and
demonstrate success in transferring the policies trained in simulation directly
to a real robot, where our agent is able to follow moving goals and react to
dynamic obstacles while simultaneously and synergistically controlling the
whole-body: base, arm, and head. More information at

maximise the performance during model training and then minimise the
memory/area footprint of the trained model for deployment on edge devices
targeting CPUs, GPUs, microcontrollers, or custom hardware accelerators. This
paper proposes a methodology for automatically generating predictor circuits
for classification of tabular data with comparable prediction performance to
conventional ML techniques while using substantially fewer hardware resources
and power. The proposed methodology uses an evolutionary algorithm to search
over the space of logic gates and automatically generates a classifier circuit
with maximised training prediction accuracy. Classifier circuits are so tiny
(i.e., consisting of no more than 300 logic gates) that they are called "Tiny
Classifier" circuits, and can efficiently be implemented in ASIC or on an FPGA.
We empirically evaluate the automatic Tiny Classifier circuit generation
methodology or "Auto Tiny Classifiers" on a wide range of tabular datasets, and
compare it against conventional ML techniques such as Amazon's AutoGluon,
Google's TabNet and a neural search over Multi-Layer Perceptrons. Despite Tiny
Classifiers being constrained to a few hundred logic gates, we observe no
statistically significant difference in prediction performance in comparison to
the best-performing ML baseline. When synthesised as a Silicon chip, Tiny
Classifiers use 8-18x less area and 4-8x less power. When implemented as an
ultra-low cost chip on a flexible substrate (i.e., FlexIC), they occupy 10-75x
less area and consume 13-75x less power compared to the most hardware-efficient
ML baseline. On an FPGA, Tiny Classifiers consume 3-11x fewer resources.]]></summary>

be characterized using classical Gaussian processes. More flexible spatial
extremes models exhibit appealing extremal dependence properties but are often
exceedingly prohibitive to fit and simulate from in high dimensions. In this
paper, we develop a new spatial extremes model that has flexible and
non-stationary dependence properties, and we integrate it in the
encoding-decoding structure of a variational autoencoder (XVAE), whose
parameters are estimated via variational Bayes combined with deep learning. The
XVAE can be used as a spatio-temporal emulator that characterizes the
distribution of potential mechanistic model output states and produces outputs
that have the same statistical properties as the inputs, especially in the
tail. As an aside, our approach also provides a novel way of making fast
inference with complex extreme-value processes. Through extensive simulation
studies, we show that our XVAE is substantially more time-efficient than
traditional Bayesian inference while also outperforming many spatial extremes
models with a stationary dependence structure. To further demonstrate the
computational power of the XVAE, we analyze a high-resolution satellite-derived
dataset of sea surface temperature in the Red Sea, which includes 30 years of
daily measurements at 16703 grid cells. We find that the extremal dependence
strength is weaker in the interior of Red Sea and it has decreased slightly
over time.]]></summary>

sizes, prompting practitioners to find new tuning methods using a proxy of

the optimal hyperparameters for small width networks transfer to networks with
arbitrarily large width. However, in this scheme, hyperparameters do not
transfer across depths. As a remedy, we study residual networks with a residual

are supported and motivated by theory. Using recent developments in the

where two positive views generated through data augmentation are made similar
by an attraction force in a data representation space, while a repulsive force
makes them far from negative examples. Non-contrastive learning, represented by
BYOL and SimSiam, further gets rid of negative examples and improves
computational efficiency. While learned representations may collapse into a
single point due to the lack of the repulsive force at first sight, Tian et al.
(2021) revealed through the learning dynamics analysis that the representations
can avoid collapse if data augmentation is sufficiently stronger than
regularization. However, their analysis does not take into account
commonly-used feature normalization, a normalizer before measuring the
similarity of representations, and hence excessively strong regularization may
collapse the dynamics, which is an unnatural behavior under the presence of
feature normalization. Therefore, we extend the previous theory based on the L2
loss by considering the cosine loss, which involves feature normalization. We
show that the cosine loss induces sixth-order dynamics (while the L2 loss
induces a third-order one), in which a stable equilibrium dynamically emerges
even if there are only collapsed solutions with given initial parameters. Thus,
we offer a new understanding that feature normalization plays an important role
in robustly preventing the dynamics collapse.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We introduce the modified planar rotator method (MPRS), a physically inspired
machine learning method for spatial/temporal regression. MPRS is a
non-parametric model which incorporates spatial or temporal correlations via
short-range, distance-dependent ``interactions'' without assuming a specific
form for the underlying probability distribution. Predictions are obtained by
means of a fully autonomous learning algorithm which employs equilibrium
conditional Monte Carlo simulations. MPRS is able to handle scattered data and
arbitrary spatial dimensions. We report tests on various synthetic and
real-word data in one, two and three dimensions which demonstrate that the MPRS
prediction performance (without parameter tuning) is competitive with standard
interpolation methods such as ordinary kriging and inverse distance weighting.
In particular, MPRS is a particularly effective gap-filling method for rough
and non-Gaussian data (e.g., daily precipitation time series). MPRS shows
superior computational efficiency and scalability for large samples. Massive
data sets involving millions of nodes can be processed in a few seconds on a
standard personal computer.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Parameter inference for dynamical models of (bio)physical systems remains a
challenging problem. Intractable gradients, high-dimensional spaces, and
non-linear model functions are typically problematic without large
computational budgets. A recent body of work in that area has focused on
Bayesian inference methods, which consider parameters under their statistical
distributions and therefore, do not derive point estimates of optimal parameter
values. Here we propose a new metaheuristic that drives dimensionality
reductions from feature-informed transformations (DR-FFIT) to address these
bottlenecks. DR-FFIT implements an efficient sampling strategy that facilitates
a gradient-free parameter search in high-dimensional spaces. We use artificial
neural networks to obtain differentiable proxies for the model's features of
interest. The resulting gradients enable the estimation of a local active
subspace of the model within a defined sampling region. This approach enables
efficient dimensionality reductions of highly non-linear search spaces at a low
computational cost. Our test data show that DR-FFIT boosts the performances of
random-search and simulated-annealing against well-established metaheuristics,
and improves the goodness-of-fit of the model, all within contained run-time
costs.]]></summary>

spatial transformations found in natural data. Traditionally, this is done
using data augmentation or hard-coding invariances into the architecture.
However, too much or too little invariance can hurt, and the correct amount is
unknown a priori and dependent on the instance. Ideally, the appropriate
invariance would be learned from data and inferred at test-time.

We treat invariance as a prediction problem. Given any image, we use a
normalizing flow to predict a distribution over transformations and average the
predictions over them. Since this distribution only depends on the instance, we
can align instances before classifying them and generalize invariance across
classes. The same distribution can also be used to adapt to out-of-distribution
poses. This normalizing flow is trained end-to-end and can learn a much larger
range of transformations than Augerino and InstaAug. When used as data
augmentation, our method shows accuracy and robustness gains on CIFAR 10,
CIFAR10-LT, and TinyImageNet.]]></summary>

distributions whose densities are known up to a normalizing constant. In
particular, there is strong interest in unadjusted Langevin algorithms (ULA),
which directly discretize Langevin dynamics to estimate expectations over the
target distribution. We study the use of transport maps that approximately
normalize a target distribution as a way to precondition and accelerate the
convergence of Langevin dynamics. We show that in continuous time, when a
transport map is applied to Langevin dynamics, the result is a Riemannian
manifold Langevin dynamics (RMLD) with metric defined by the transport map. We
also show that applying a transport map to an irreversibly-perturbed ULA
results in a geometry-informed irreversible perturbation (GiIrr) of the
original dynamics. These connections suggest more systematic ways of learning
metrics and perturbations, and also yield alternative discretizations of the
RMLD described by the map, which we study. Under appropriate conditions, these
discretized processes can be endowed with non-asymptotic bounds describing
convergence to the target distribution in 2-Wasserstein distance. Illustrative
numerical results complement our theoretical claims.]]></summary>

learning policies without active interactions, making it especially appealing
for autonomous driving tasks. Recent successes of Transformers inspire casting
offline RL as sequence modeling, which performs well in long-horizon tasks.
However, they are overly optimistic in stochastic environments with incorrect
assumptions that the same goal can be consistently achieved by identical
actions. In this paper, we introduce an UNcertainty-awaRE deciSion Transformer
(UNREST) for planning in stochastic driving environments without introducing
additional transition or complex generative models. Specifically, UNREST
estimates state uncertainties by the conditional mutual information between
transitions and returns, and segments sequences accordingly. Discovering the
`uncertainty accumulation' and `temporal locality' properties of driving
environments, UNREST replaces the global returns in decision transformers with
less uncertain truncated returns, to learn from true outcomes of agent actions
rather than environment transitions. We also dynamically evaluate environmental
uncertainty during inference for cautious planning. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate UNREST's superior performance in various driving scenarios
and the power of our uncertainty estimation strategy.]]></summary>

explanation methods (like LIME and SHAP) have led to the rise of model-precise

theoretically sound and rigorous, abductive explanations suffer from a major
issue -- there can be several valid abductive explanations for the same data
point. In such cases, providing a single abductive explanation can be
insufficient; on the other hand, providing all valid abductive explanations can
be incomprehensible due to their size. In this work, we solve this issue by
aggregating the many possible abductive explanations into feature importance
scores. We propose three aggregation methods: two based on power indices from
cooperative game theory and a third based on a well-known measure of causal
strength. We characterize these three methods axiomatically, showing that each
of them uniquely satisfies a set of desirable properties. We also evaluate them
on multiple datasets and show that these explanations are robust to the attacks

storing factual knowledge within their parameters and achieving remarkable
results when fine-tuned for downstream natural language processing tasks.
Nonetheless, their capacity to access and manipulate knowledge with precision
remains constrained, resulting in performance disparities on
knowledge-intensive tasks when compared to task-specific architectures.
Additionally, the challenges of providing provenance for model decisions and
maintaining up-to-date world knowledge persist as open research frontiers. To
address these limitations, the integration of pre-trained models with
differentiable access mechanisms to explicit non-parametric memory emerges as a
promising solution. This survey delves into the realm of language models (LMs)
augmented with the ability to tap into external knowledge sources, including
external knowledge bases and search engines. While adhering to the standard
objective of predicting missing tokens, these augmented LMs leverage diverse,
possibly non-parametric external modules to augment their contextual processing
capabilities, departing from the conventional language modeling paradigm.
Through an exploration of current advancements in augmenting large language

labeled images with instance masks and classifications, which is often
expensive to procure. Active learning addresses this challenge by striving for
optimum performance with minimal labeling cost by selecting the most
informative and representative images for labeling. Despite its potential,
active learning has been less explored in instance segmentation compared to
other tasks like image classification, which require less labeling. In this
study, we propose a post-hoc active learning algorithm that integrates
uncertainty-based sampling with diversity-based sampling. Our proposed
algorithm is not only simple and easy to implement, but it also delivers
superior performance on various datasets. Its practical application is
demonstrated on a real-world overhead imagery dataset, where it increases the
labeling efficiency fivefold.]]></summary>

which exhibit representation power through ensemble statistics, and also
tractable gradient descent dynamics. Ensemble averages of Renyi entropies are
expressed in terms of neural network correlators, and architectures that
exhibit volume-law entanglement are presented. A general framework is developed
for studying the gradient descent dynamics of neural network quantum states
(NNQS), using a quantum state neural tangent kernel (QS-NTK). For $\infty$-NNQS
the training dynamics is simplified, since the QS-NTK becomes deterministic and
constant. An analytic solution is derived for quantum state supervised
learning, which allows an $\infty$-NNQS to recover any target wavefunction.
Numerical experiments on finite and infinite NNQS in the transverse field Ising

$\infty$-NNQS opens up new opportunities for studying entanglement and training

machine learning method for spatial/temporal regression. MPRS is a
non-parametric model which incorporates spatial or temporal correlations via
short-range, distance-dependent ``interactions'' without assuming a specific
form for the underlying probability distribution. Predictions are obtained by
means of a fully autonomous learning algorithm which employs equilibrium
conditional Monte Carlo simulations. MPRS is able to handle scattered data and
arbitrary spatial dimensions. We report tests on various synthetic and
real-word data in one, two and three dimensions which demonstrate that the MPRS
prediction performance (without parameter tuning) is competitive with standard
interpolation methods such as ordinary kriging and inverse distance weighting.
In particular, MPRS is a particularly effective gap-filling method for rough

superior computational efficiency and scalability for large samples. Massive
data sets involving millions of nodes can be processed in a few seconds on a

sizes, prompting practitioners to find new tuning methods using a proxy of
smaller networks. One such proposal uses $\mu$P parameterized networks, where
the optimal hyperparameters for small width networks transfer to networks with
arbitrarily large width. However, in this scheme, hyperparameters do not
transfer across depths. As a remedy, we study residual networks with a residual
branch scale of $1/\sqrt{\text{depth}}$ in combination with the $\mu$P
parameterization. We provide experiments demonstrating that residual
architectures including convolutional ResNets and Vision Transformers trained
with this parameterization exhibit transfer of optimal hyperparameters across
width and depth on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. Furthermore, our empirical findings
are supported and motivated by theory. Using recent developments in the
dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) description of neural network learning
dynamics, we show that this parameterization of ResNets admits a well-defined
feature learning joint infinite-width and infinite-depth limit and show
convergence of finite-size network dynamics towards this limit.]]></summary>

applies multiple univariate tests on the individual features, followed by
p-value adjustments. Such an approach suffers when the data carry numerous
features. A number of studies have shown that classification accuracy can be
seen as a proxy for two-sample testing. However, neither theoretical
foundations nor practical recipes have been proposed so far on how this
strategy could be extended to multidimensional paired-sample testing. In this
work, we put forward the idea that scoring functions can be produced by the
decision rules defined by the perpendicular bisecting hyperplanes of the line
segments connecting each pair of instances. Then, the optimal scoring function
can be obtained by the pseudomedian of those rules, which we estimate by
extending naturally the Hodges-Lehmann estimator. We accordingly propose a
framework of a two-step testing procedure. First, we estimate the bisecting
hyperplanes for each pair of instances and an aggregated rule derived through
the Hodges-Lehmann estimator. The paired samples are scored by this aggregated
rule to produce a unidimensional representation. Second, we perform a Wilcoxon
signed-rank test on the obtained representation. Our experiments indicate that
our approach has substantial performance gains in testing accuracy compared to
the traditional multivariate and multiple testing, while at the same time
estimates each feature's contribution to the final result.]]></summary>

have made large-scale protein structures accessible, paving the way for machine
learning-based functional annotations.The field of geometric deep learning
focuses on creating methods working on geometric data. An essential aspect of
learning from protein structures is representing these structures as a
geometric object (be it a grid, graph, or surface) and applying a learning
method tailored to this representation. The performance of a given approach
will then depend on both the representation and its corresponding learning
method.

In this paper, we investigate representing proteins as $\textit{3D mesh
surfaces}$ and incorporate them into an established representation benchmark.
Our first finding is that despite promising preliminary results, the surface
representation alone does not seem competitive with 3D grids. Building on this,
we introduce a synergistic approach, combining surface representations with
graph-based methods, resulting in a general framework that incorporates both
representations in learning. We show that using this combination, we are able

learning algorithms with endogenous data. In a contextual multi-armed bandit
model, a novel bias (self-fulfilling bias) arises because the endogeneity of
the data influences the choices of decisions, affecting the distribution of

farmlands. However, small objects and features introduce distortions to the
delineation of object boundaries, and larger contextual views are needed to

network for segmenting farmlands with contour levees from high-resolution

to achieve image segmentation and classification. We integrate the fusion block
with a backbone and produce both semantic predictions and segmentation slices.
The segmentation slices are used to perform majority voting on the predictions.
The network is trained to assign the most likely class label of a segment to
its pixels, learning the concept of farmlands rather than analyzing
constitutive pixels separately. We evaluate our method using images from the
National Agriculture Imagery Program. Our method achieved an average accuracy
of 94.34\%. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method

Existing imitation learning (IL) approaches for robots still grapple with

challenge can be addressed within the human cognitive priors. Heuristically, we
extend the usual notion of action to a dual Cognition (high-level)-Action

propose a novel skill IL framework through human-robot interaction, called
Cognition-Action-based Skill Imitation Learning (CasIL), for the robotic agent
to effectively cognize and imitate the critical skills from raw visual
demonstrations. CasIL enables both cognition and action imitation, while
high-level skill cognition explicitly guides low-level primitive actions,
providing robustness and reliability to the entire skill IL process. We
evaluated our method on MuJoCo and RLBench benchmarks, as well as on the
obstacle avoidance and point-goal navigation tasks for quadrupedal robot
locomotion. Experimental results show that our CasIL consistently achieves

random lineups. The generated lineups were then compared to real-world lineups

entities and relations of a given graph by mapping them into a vector space.
Although the majority of these methods focus on static knowledge graphs, a
large number of publicly available KGs contain temporal information stating the
time instant/period over which a certain fact has been true. Such graphs are
often known as temporal knowledge graphs. Furthermore, knowledge graphs may
also contain textual descriptions of entities and relations. Both temporal
information and textual descriptions are not taken into account during
representation learning by static KGC methods, and only structural information
of the graph is leveraged. Recently, some studies have used temporal
information to improve link prediction, yet they do not exploit textual
descriptions and do not support inductive inference (prediction on entities
that have not been seen in training).

We propose a novel framework called TEMT that exploits the power of
pre-trained language models (PLMs) for text-enhanced temporal knowledge graph
completion. The knowledge stored in the parameters of a PLM allows TEMT to
produce rich semantic representations of facts and to generalize on previously
unseen entities. TEMT leverages textual and temporal information available in a
KG, treats them separately, and fuses them to get plausibility scores of facts.
Unlike previous approaches, TEMT effectively captures dependencies across
different time points and enables predictions on unseen entities. To assess the
performance of TEMT, we carried out several experiments including time interval
prediction, both in transductive and inductive settings, and triple
classification. The experimental results show that TEMT is competitive with the
state-of-the-art.]]></summary>

function optimization tasks, requires practitioners to carefully select priors
that well model their functions of interest. Rather than specifying by hand,
researchers have investigated transfer learning based methods to automatically
learn the priors, e.g. multi-task BO (Swersky et al., 2013), few-shot BO
(Wistuba and Grabocka, 2021) and HyperBO (Wang et al., 2022). However, those
prior learning methods typically assume that the input domains are the same for
all tasks, weakening their ability to use observations on functions with
different domains or generalize the learned priors to BO on different search
spaces. In this work, we present HyperBO+: a pre-training approach for
hierarchical Gaussian processes that enables the same prior to work universally
for Bayesian optimization on functions with different domains. We propose a
two-step pre-training method and analyze its appealing asymptotic properties
and benefits to BO both theoretically and empirically. On real-world
hyperparameter tuning tasks that involve multiple search spaces, we demonstrate
that HyperBO+ is able to generalize to unseen search spaces and achieves lower

applications in various fields of artificial intelligence, including natural
language processing (NLP). Although some efforts based on syntactic analysis

heavy syntactic preprocessing and syntax-dependent network architecture make
them impracticable on larger and real-world data sets. In this paper, we
propose a new simple network architecture, called the quantum self-attention

Specifically, we introduce the self-attention mechanism into quantum neural
networks and then utilize a Gaussian projected quantum self-attention serving
as a sensible quantum version of self-attention. As a result, QSANN is
effective and scalable on larger data sets and has the desirable property of
being implementable on near-term quantum devices. In particular, our QSANN
outperforms the best existing QNLP model based on syntactic analysis as well as
a simple classical self-attention neural network in numerical experiments of
text classification tasks on public data sets. We further show that our method

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graphon estimation has been one of the most fundamental problems in network
analysis and has received considerable attention in the past decade. From the
statistical perspective, the minimax error rate of graphon estimation has been
established by Gao et al (2015) for both stochastic block model (SBM) and
nonparametric graphon estimation. The statistical optimal estimators are based
on constrained least squares and have computational complexity exponential in
the dimension. From the computational perspective, the best-known
polynomial-time estimator is based on universal singular value thresholding
(USVT), but it can only achieve a much slower estimation error rate than the
minimax one. It is natural to wonder if such a gap is essential. The
computational optimality of the USVT or the existence of a computational
barrier in graphon estimation has been a long-standing open problem. In this
work, we take the first step towards it and provide rigorous evidence for the
computational barrier in graphon estimation via low-degree polynomials.
Specifically, in both SBM and nonparametric graphon estimation, we show that
for low-degree polynomial estimators, their estimation error rates cannot be
significantly better than that of the USVT under a wide range of parameter
regimes. Our results are proved based on the recent development of low-degree
polynomials by Schramm and Wein (2022), while we overcome a few key challenges
in applying it to the general graphon estimation problem. By leveraging our
main results, we also provide a computational lower bound on the clustering
error for community detection in SBM with a growing number of communities and
this yields a new piece of evidence for the conjectured Kesten-Stigum threshold
for efficient community recovery.]]></summary>

biomedical literature to answer timely and disease-specific questions. During
the early days of the pandemic, one of the biggest challenges we faced was the
lack of peer-reviewed biomedical articles on COVID-19 that could be used to
train machine learning models for question answering (QA). In this paper, we
explore the roles weak supervision and data augmentation play in training deep
neural network QA models. First, we investigate whether labels generated
automatically from the structured abstracts of scholarly papers using an
information retrieval algorithm, BM25, provide a weak supervision signal to
train an extractive QA model. We also curate new QA pairs using information
retrieval techniques, guided by the clinicaltrials.gov schema and the
structured abstracts of articles, in the absence of annotated data from
biomedical domain experts. Furthermore, we explore augmenting the training data
of a deep neural network model with linguistic features from external sources
such as lexical databases to account for variations in word morphology and
meaning. To better utilize our training data, we apply curriculum learning to
domain adaptation, fine-tuning our QA model in stages based on characteristics
of the QA pairs. We evaluate our methods in the context of QA models at the
core of a system to answer questions about COVID-19.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common cardiac
arrhythmias that affects millions of people each year worldwide and it is
closely linked to increased risk of cardiovascular diseases such as stroke and
heart failure. Machine learning methods have shown promising results in
evaluating the risk of developing atrial fibrillation from the
electrocardiogram. We aim to develop and evaluate one such algorithm on a large
CODE dataset collected in Brazil.

Results: The deep neural network model identified patients without indication
of AF in the presented ECG but who will develop AF in the future with an AUC
score of 0.845. From our survival model, we obtain that patients in the
high-risk group (i.e. with the probability of a future AF case being greater
than 0.7) are 50% more likely to develop AF within 40 weeks, while patients
belonging to the minimal-risk group (i.e. with the probability of a future AF
case being less than or equal to 0.1) have more than 85% chance of remaining AF
free up until after seven years.

Conclusion: We developed and validated a model for AF risk prediction. If
applied in clinical practice, the model possesses the potential of providing
valuable and useful information in decision-making and patient management
processes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Decoding memory content from brain activity during sleep has long been a goal
in neuroscience. While spontaneous reactivation of memories during sleep in
rodents is known to support memory consolidation and offline learning,
capturing memory replay in humans is challenging due to the absence of
well-annotated sleep datasets and the substantial differences in neural
patterns between wakefulness and sleep. To address these challenges, we
designed a novel cognitive neuroscience experiment and collected a
comprehensive, well-annotated electroencephalography (EEG) dataset from 52
subjects during both wakefulness and sleep. Leveraging this benchmark dataset,
we developed the Universal Sleep Decoder (USD) to align neural representations
between wakefulness and sleep across subjects. Our model achieves up to 16.6%
top-1 zero-shot accuracy on unseen subjects, comparable to decoding
performances using individual sleep data. Furthermore, fine-tuning USD on test
subjects enhances decoding accuracy to 25.9% top-1 accuracy, a substantial
improvement over the baseline chance of 6.7%. Model comparison and ablation
analyses reveal that our design choices, including the use of (i) an additional
contrastive objective to integrate awake and sleep neural signals and (ii) the
pretrain-finetune paradigm to incorporate different subjects, significantly
contribute to these performances. Collectively, our findings and methodologies
represent a significant advancement in the field of sleep decoding.]]></summary>

particularly for in-situ exploration and sampling to stand in for human
explorers. Currently, humans drive robots to meet scientific objectives, but
depending on the robot's location, the exchange of information and driving
commands between the human operator and robot may cause undue delays in mission
fulfillment. An autonomous robot encoded with a scientific objective and an
exploration strategy incurs no communication delays and can fulfill missions
more quickly. Active learning algorithms offer this capability of intelligent
exploration, but the underlying model structure varies the performance of the
active learning algorithm in accurately forming an understanding of the
environment. In this paper, we investigate the performance differences between
active learning algorithms driven by Gaussian processes or Bayesian neural
networks for exploration strategies encoded on agents that are constrained in
their trajectories, like planetary surface rovers. These two active learning
strategies were tested in a simulation environment against science-blind
strategies to predict the spatial distribution of a variable of interest along
multiple datasets. The performance metrics of interest are model accuracy in
root mean squared (RMS) error, training time, model convergence, total distance
traveled until convergence, and total samples until convergence. Active
learning strategies encoded with Gaussian processes require less computation to
train, converge to an accurate model more quickly, and propose trajectories of
shorter distance, except in a few complex environments in which Bayesian neural
networks achieve a more accurate model in the large data regime due to their
more expressive functional bases. The paper concludes with advice on when and
how to implement either exploration strategy for future space missions.]]></summary>

by enabling direct material joining and offers several advantages such as
cost-effective manufacturing of complex parts, reducing manufacturing waste,
and opening new possibilities for manufacturing automation. One group of
materials for which additive manufacturing holds great potential for enhancing
component performance and properties is Functionally Graded Materials (FGMs).
FGMs are advanced composite materials that exhibit smoothly varying properties
making them desirable for applications in aerospace, automobile, biomedical,
and defense industries. Such composition differs from traditional composite
materials, since the location-dependent composition changes gradually in FGMs,
leading to enhanced properties. Recently, machine learning techniques have
emerged as a promising means for fabrication of FGMs through optimizing
processing parameters, improving product quality, and detecting manufacturing
defects. This paper first provides a brief literature review of works related
to FGM fabrication, followed by reviewing works on employing machine learning
in additive manufacturing, Afterward, we provide an overview of published works
in the literature related to the application of machine learning methods in
Directed Energy Deposition and for fabrication of FGMs.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent advances in federated learning (FL) enable collaborative training of
machine learning (ML) models from large-scale and widely dispersed clients
while protecting their privacy. However, when different clients' datasets are
heterogeneous, traditional FL mechanisms produce a global model that does not
adequately represent the poorer clients with limited data resources, resulting
in lower accuracy and higher bias on their local data. According to the Matthew
effect, which describes how the advantaged gain more advantage and the
disadvantaged lose more over time, deploying such a global model in client
applications may worsen the resource disparity among the clients and harm the
principles of social welfare and fairness. To mitigate the Matthew effect, we
propose Egalitarian Fairness Federated Learning (EFFL), where egalitarian
fairness refers to the global model learned from FL has: (1) equal accuracy
among clients; (2) equal decision bias among clients. Besides achieving
egalitarian fairness among the clients, EFFL also aims for performance
optimality, minimizing the empirical risk loss and the bias for each client;
both are essential for any ML model training, whether centralized or
decentralized. We formulate EFFL as a constrained multi-constrained
multi-objectives optimization (MCMOO) problem, with the decision bias and
egalitarian fairness as constraints and the minimization of the empirical risk
losses on all clients as multiple objectives to be optimized. We propose a
gradient-based three-stage algorithm to obtain the Pareto optimal solutions
within the constraint space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EFFL
outperforms other state-of-the-art FL algorithms in achieving a
high-performance global model with enhanced egalitarian fairness among all
clients.]]></summary>

This comprehensive primer presents a systematic introduction to the

Furthermore, we explore advanced topics within the realm of BNN research,
acknowledging the existence of ongoing debates and controversies. By offering
insights into cutting-edge developments, this primer not only equips
researchers and practitioners with a solid foundation in BNNs, but also

approach for defining compositions of iterative generative processes. We then
introduce a method for sampling from these compositions built on classifier
guidance. We showcase ways to accomplish compositional sculpting in both
GFlowNets and diffusion models. We highlight two binary operations
$\unicode{x2014}$ the harmonic mean ($p_1 \otimes p_2$) and the contrast ($p_1
\unicode{x25D1}\,p_2$) between pairs, and the generalization of these
operations to multiple component distributions. We offer empirical results on
image and molecular generation tasks.]]></summary>

data dimensions. When applying Copulas, we can estimate multivariate
distribution functions by initially estimating independent marginals, an easy
task, and then a single copulating function, $C$, to connect the marginals, a
hard task. For two-dimensional data, a copula is a two-increasing function of
the form $C: (u,v)\in \mathbf{I}^2 \rightarrow \mathbf{I}$, where $\mathbf{I} =
[0, 1]$. In this paper, we show how Neural Networks (NNs) can approximate any
two-dimensional copula non-parametrically. Our approach, denoted as 2-Cats, is
inspired by the Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Sobolev Training
literature. Not only do we show that we can estimate the output of a 2d Copula
better than the state-of-the-art, our approach is non-parametric and respects

classification models using labeled and unlabeled datasets. However, existing
SSL methods rely on a large unlabeled dataset, which may not always be
available in many real-world applications due to legal constraints (e.g.,
GDPR). In this paper, we investigate the research question: Can we train SSL
models without real unlabeled datasets? Instead of using real unlabeled
datasets, we propose an SSL method using synthetic datasets generated from
generative foundation models trained on datasets containing millions of samples
in diverse domains (e.g., ImageNet). Our main concepts are identifying
synthetic samples that emulate unlabeled samples from generative foundation
models and training classifiers using these synthetic samples. To achieve this,
our method is formulated as an alternating optimization problem: (i)
meta-learning of generative foundation models and (ii) SSL of classifiers using
real labeled and synthetic unlabeled samples. For (i), we propose a
meta-learning objective that optimizes latent variables to generate samples
that resemble real labeled samples and minimize the validation loss. For (ii),
we propose a simple unsupervised loss function that regularizes the feature
extractors of classifiers to maximize the performance improvement obtained from
synthetic samples. We confirm that our method outperforms baselines using
generative foundation models on SSL. We also demonstrate that our methods
outperform SSL using real unlabeled datasets in scenarios with extremely small
amounts of labeled datasets. This suggests that synthetic samples have the
potential to provide improvement gains more efficiently than real unlabeled
data.]]></summary>

method, which makes sequential decisions based on a Bayesian model, typically a
Gaussian process (GP), of the function. To ensure the quality of the model,
transfer learning approaches have been developed to automatically design GP
priors by learning from observations on "training" functions. These training
functions are typically required to have the same domain as the "test" function
(black-box function to be optimized). In this paper, we introduce MPHD, a model
pre-training method on heterogeneous domains, which uses a neural net mapping
from domain-specific contexts to specifications of hierarchical GPs. MPHD can
be seamlessly integrated with BO to transfer knowledge across heterogeneous

opportunities for artificial general intelligence but concurrently amplify
safety concerns, such as potential misuse of AI systems, necessitating
effective AI alignment. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has
emerged as a promising pathway towards AI alignment but brings forth challenges
due to its complexity and dependence on a separate reward model. Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed as an alternative, and it
remains equivalent to RLHF under the reverse KL regularization constraint. This
paper presents $f$-DPO, a generalized approach to DPO by incorporating diverse
divergence constraints. We show that under certain $f$-divergences, including
Jensen-Shannon divergence, forward KL divergences and $\alpha$-divergences, the
complex relationship between the reward and optimal policy can also be
simplified by addressing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. This eliminates the
need for estimating the normalizing constant in the Bradley-Terry model and
enables a tractable mapping between the reward function and the optimal policy.
Our approach optimizes LLMs to align with human preferences in a more efficient
and supervised manner under a broad set of divergence constraints. Empirically,
adopting these divergences ensures a balance between alignment performance and
generation diversity. Importantly, $f$-DPO outperforms PPO-based methods in
divergence efficiency, and divergence constraints directly influence expected
calibration error (ECE).]]></summary>

medical field to manufacturing and wireless communication. Generating realistic
and useful exemplars and prototypes is a fundamental data analysis task. In
this paper, we investigate a novel approach to generating realistic and useful
exemplars and prototypes for time series data. Our approach uses a new form of
time series average, the ShapeDTW Barycentric Average. We therefore turn our
attention to accurately generating time series prototypes with a novel
approach. The existing time series prototyping approaches rely on the Dynamic
Time Warping (DTW) similarity measure such as DTW Barycentering Average (DBA)
and SoftDBA. These last approaches suffer from a common problem of generating
out-of-distribution artifacts in their prototypes. This is mostly caused by the
DTW variant used and its incapability of detecting neighborhood similarities,
instead it detects absolute similarities. Our proposed method, ShapeDBA, uses
the ShapeDTW variant of DTW, that overcomes this issue. We chose time series
clustering, a popular form of time series analysis to evaluate the outcome of
ShapeDBA compared to the other prototyping approaches. Coupled with the k-means
clustering algorithm, and evaluated on a total of 123 datasets from the UCR

domains, but their widespread applicability is hindered by inherent limitations
such as overconfidence in predictions, lack of interpretability, and
vulnerability to adversarial attacks. To address these challenges, Bayesian
neural networks (BNNs) have emerged as a compelling extension of conventional
neural networks, integrating uncertainty estimation into their predictive
capabilities.

This comprehensive primer presents a systematic introduction to the
fundamental concepts of neural networks and Bayesian inference, elucidating
their synergistic integration for the development of BNNs. The target audience
comprises statisticians with a potential background in Bayesian methods but
lacking deep learning expertise, as well as machine learners proficient in deep
neural networks but with limited exposure to Bayesian statistics. We provide an
overview of commonly employed priors, examining their impact on model behavior
and performance. Additionally, we delve into the practical considerations
associated with training and inference in BNNs.

Furthermore, we explore advanced topics within the realm of BNN research,
acknowledging the existence of ongoing debates and controversies. By offering
insights into cutting-edge developments, this primer not only equips
researchers and practitioners with a solid foundation in BNNs, but also
illuminates the potential applications of this dynamic field. As a valuable

applies multiple univariate tests on the individual features, followed by
p-value adjustments. Such an approach suffers when the data carry numerous
features. A number of studies have shown that classification accuracy can be
seen as a proxy for two-sample testing. However, neither theoretical
foundations nor practical recipes have been proposed so far on how this
strategy could be extended to multidimensional paired-sample testing. In this
work, we put forward the idea that scoring functions can be produced by the
decision rules defined by the perpendicular bisecting hyperplanes of the line
segments connecting each pair of instances. Then, the optimal scoring function
can be obtained by the pseudomedian of those rules, which we estimate by
extending naturally the Hodges-Lehmann estimator. We accordingly propose a
framework of a two-step testing procedure. First, we estimate the bisecting
hyperplanes for each pair of instances and an aggregated rule derived through
the Hodges-Lehmann estimator. The paired samples are scored by this aggregated
rule to produce a unidimensional representation. Second, we perform a Wilcoxon
signed-rank test on the obtained representation. Our experiments indicate that
our approach has substantial performance gains in testing accuracy compared to
the traditional multivariate and multiple testing, while at the same time
estimates each feature's contribution to the final result.]]></summary>

batch of data lacking exhaustive exploration. Worst-case optimality algorithms,
which calibrate a value-function model class from logged experience and perform
some type of pessimistic evaluation under the learned model, have emerged as a
promising paradigm for batch RL. However, contemporary works on this stream
have commonly overlooked the hierarchical decision-making structure hidden in
the optimization landscape. In this paper, we adopt a game-theoretical
viewpoint and model the policy learning diagram as a two-player general-sum
game with a leader-follower structure. We propose a novel stochastic
gradient-based learning algorithm: StackelbergLearner, in which the leader
player updates according to the total derivative of its objective instead of
the usual individual gradient, and the follower player makes individual updates
and ensures transition-consistent pessimistic reasoning. The derived learning
dynamic naturally lends StackelbergLearner to a game-theoretic interpretation
and provides a convergence guarantee to differentiable Stackelberg equilibria.
From a theoretical standpoint, we provide instance-dependent regret bounds with
general function approximation, which shows that our algorithm can learn a
best-effort policy that is able to compete against any comparator policy that
is covered by batch data. Notably, our theoretical regret guarantees only
require realizability without any data coverage and strong function
approximation conditions, e.g., Bellman closedness, which is in contrast to
prior works lacking such guarantees. Through comprehensive experiments, we find
that our algorithm consistently performs as well or better as compared to
state-of-the-art methods in batch RL benchmark and real-world datasets.]]></summary>

been developed to highlight the edges and nodes in the graph that contribute
the most to the model predictions. However, it is not clear yet how to evaluate
the correctness of those explanations, whether it is from a human or a model
perspective. One unaddressed bottleneck in the current evaluation procedure is
the problem of out-of-distribution explanations, whose distribution differs
from those of the training data. This important issue affects existing
evaluation metrics such as the popular faithfulness or fidelity score. In this
paper, we show the limitations of faithfulness metrics. We propose GInX-Eval
(Graph In-distribution eXplanation Evaluation), an evaluation procedure of
graph explanations that overcomes the pitfalls of faithfulness and offers new
insights on explainability methods. Using a retraining strategy, the GInX score
measures how informative removed edges are for the model and the EdgeRank score
evaluates if explanatory edges are correctly ordered by their importance.
GInX-Eval verifies if ground-truth explanations are instructive to the GNN
model. In addition, it shows that many popular methods, including
gradient-based methods, produce explanations that are not better than a random
designation of edges as important subgraphs, challenging the findings of
current works in the area. Results with GInX-Eval are consistent across
multiple datasets and align with human evaluation.]]></summary>

where two positive views generated through data augmentation are made similar
by an attraction force in a data representation space, while a repulsive force
makes them far from negative examples. Non-contrastive learning, represented by
BYOL and SimSiam, further gets rid of negative examples and improves
computational efficiency. While learned representations may collapse into a
single point due to the lack of the repulsive force at first sight, Tian et al.
(2021) revealed through the learning dynamics analysis that the representations
can avoid collapse if data augmentation is sufficiently stronger than
regularization. However, their analysis does not take into account
commonly-used feature normalization, a normalizer before measuring the
similarity of representations, and hence excessively strong regularization may
collapse the dynamics, which is an unnatural behavior under the presence of
feature normalization. Therefore, we extend the previous theory based on the L2
loss by considering the cosine loss, which involves feature normalization. We
show that the cosine loss induces sixth-order dynamics (while the L2 loss
induces a third-order one), in which a stable equilibrium dynamically emerges
even if there are only collapsed solutions with given initial parameters. Thus,
we offer a new understanding that feature normalization plays an important role
in robustly preventing the dynamics collapse.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In representation learning, regression has traditionally received less
attention than classification. Directly applying representation learning
techniques designed for classification to regression often results in
fragmented representations in the latent space, yielding sub-optimal
performance. In this paper, we argue that the potential of contrastive learning
for regression has been overshadowed due to the neglect of two crucial aspects:
ordinality-awareness and hardness. To address these challenges, we advocate
"mixup your own contrastive pairs for supervised contrastive regression",
instead of relying solely on real/augmented samples. Specifically, we propose
Supervised Contrastive Learning for Regression with Mixup (SupReMix). It takes
anchor-inclusive mixtures (mixup of the anchor and a distinct negative sample)
as hard negative pairs and anchor-exclusive mixtures (mixup of two distinct
negative samples) as hard positive pairs at the embedding level. This strategy
formulates harder contrastive pairs by integrating richer ordinal information.
Through extensive experiments on six regression datasets including 2D images,
volumetric images, text, tabular data, and time-series signals, coupled with
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that SupReMix pre-training fosters
continuous ordered representations of regression data, resulting in significant
improvement in regression performance. Furthermore, SupReMix is superior to
other approaches in a range of regression challenges including transfer
learning, imbalanced training data, and scenarios with fewer training samples.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Standard practice within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
involves optimizing against a Reward Model (RM), which itself is trained to
reflect human preferences for desirable generations. A notable subject that is
understudied is the (in-)consistency of RMs -- whether they can recognize the
semantic changes to different prompts and appropriately adapt their reward
assignments -- and their impact on the downstream RLHF model.

In this paper, we visit a series of research questions relevant to RM
inconsistency: (1) How can we measure the consistency of reward models? (2) How
consistent are the existing RMs and how can we improve them? (3) In what ways
does reward inconsistency influence the chatbots resulting from the RLHF model
training?

We propose Contrast Instructions -- a benchmarking strategy for the
consistency of RM. Each example in Contrast Instructions features a pair of
lexically similar instructions with different ground truth responses. A
consistent RM is expected to rank the corresponding instruction and response
higher than other combinations. We observe that current RMs trained with the
standard ranking objective fail miserably on Contrast Instructions compared to
average humans. To show that RM consistency can be improved efficiently without
using extra training budget, we propose two techniques ConvexDA and
RewardFusion, which enhance reward consistency through extrapolation during the
RM training and inference stage, respectively. We show that RLHF models trained
with a more consistent RM yield more useful responses, suggesting that reward
inconsistency exhibits a trickle-down effect on the downstream RLHF process.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anomaly detection is critical to ensure the security of cyber-physical
systems (CPS). However, due to the increasing complexity of attacks and CPS
themselves, anomaly detection in CPS is becoming more and more challenging. In
our previous work, we proposed a digital twin-based anomaly detection method,
called ATTAIN, which takes advantage of both historical and real-time data of
CPS. However, such data vary significantly in terms of difficulty. Therefore,
similar to human learning processes, deep learning models (e.g., ATTAIN) can
benefit from an easy-to-difficult curriculum. To this end, in this paper, we
present a novel approach, named digitaL twin-based Anomaly deTecTion wIth
Curriculum lEarning (LATTICE), which extends ATTAIN by introducing curriculum
learning to optimize its learning paradigm. LATTICE attributes each sample with
a difficulty score, before being fed into a training scheduler. The training
scheduler samples batches of training data based on these difficulty scores
such that learning from easy to difficult data can be performed. To evaluate
LATTICE, we use five publicly available datasets collected from five real-world
CPS testbeds. We compare LATTICE with ATTAIN and two other state-of-the-art
anomaly detectors. Evaluation results show that LATTICE outperforms the three
baselines and ATTAIN by 0.906%-2.367% in terms of the F1 score. LATTICE also,
on average, reduces the training time of ATTAIN by 4.2% on the five datasets
and is on par with the baselines in terms of detection delay time.]]></summary>

lesser known property of tree-based methods is that one can construct a
proximity matrix from the tree(s), and these proximity matrices are induced
kernels. While there has been extensive research on the applications and
properties of kernels, there is relatively little research on kernels induced
by decision forests. We construct Kernel Mean Embedding Random Forests (KMERF),
which induce kernels from random trees and/or forests using leaf-node
proximity. We introduce the notion of an asymptotically characteristic kernel,
and prove that KMERF kernels are asymptotically characteristic for both
discrete and continuous data. Because KMERF is data-adaptive, we suspected it
would outperform kernels selected a priori on finite sample data. We illustrate
that KMERF nearly dominates current state-of-the-art kernel-based tests across
a diverse range of high-dimensional two-sample and independence testing
settings. Furthermore, our forest-based approach is interpretable, and provides
feature importance metrics that readily distinguish important dimensions,
unlike other high-dimensional non-parametric testing procedures. Hence, this
work demonstrates the decision forest-based kernel can be more powerful and
more interpretable than existing methods, flying in the face of conventional
wisdom of the trade-off between the two.]]></summary>

of sparse features. Input sparsity makes obtaining high-quality embeddings for
rarely-occurring categories harder as their representations are updated
infrequently. We demonstrate a training-time technique to produce superior
embeddings via effective cross-category learning and theoretically explain its
surprising effectiveness. The scheme, termed the multi-layer embeddings
training (MLET), trains embeddings using factorization of the embedding layer,
with an inner dimension higher than the target embedding dimension. For
inference efficiency, MLET converts the trained two-layer embedding into a
single-layer one thus keeping inference-time model size unchanged.

Empirical superiority of MLET is puzzling as its search space is not larger
than that of the single-layer embedding. The strong dependence of MLET on the
inner dimension is even more surprising. We develop a theory that explains both
of these behaviors by showing that MLET creates an adaptive update mechanism
modulated by the singular vectors of embeddings. When tested on multiple
state-of-the-art recommendation models for click-through rate (CTR) prediction
tasks, MLET consistently produces better models, especially for rare items. At
constant model quality, MLET allows embedding dimension, and model size,
reduction by up to 16x, and 5.8x on average, across the models.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Purpose: To identify ocular hypertension (OHT) subtypes with different trends
of visual field (VF) progression based on unsupervised machine learning and to
discover factors associated with fast VF progression. Participants: A total of
3133 eyes of 1568 ocular hypertension treatment study (OHTS) participants with
at least five follow-up VF tests were included in the study. Methods: We used a
latent class mixed model (LCMM) to identify OHT subtypes using standard
automated perimetry (SAP) mean deviation (MD) trajectories. We characterized
the subtypes based on demographic, clinical, ocular, and VF factors at the
baseline. We then identified factors driving fast VF progression using
generalized estimating equation (GEE) and justified findings qualitatively and
quantitatively. Results: The LCMM model discovered four clusters (subtypes) of
eyes with different trajectories of MD worsening. The number of eyes in
clusters were 794 (25%), 1675 (54%), 531 (17%) and 133 (4%). We labelled the
clusters as Improvers, Stables, Slow progressors, and Fast progressors based on
their mean of MD decline, which were 0.08, -0.06, -0.21, and -0.45 dB/year,
respectively. Eyes with fast VF progression had higher baseline age,
intraocular pressure (IOP), pattern standard deviation (PSD) and refractive
error (RE), but lower central corneal thickness (CCT). Fast progression was
associated with calcium channel blockers, being male, heart disease history,
diabetes history, African American race, stroke history, and migraine
headaches.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This work proposes to measure the scope of a patent claim as the reciprocal
of the self-information contained in this claim. A probability of occurrence of
the claim is obtained from a language model and this probability is used to
compute the self-information. Grounded in information theory, this approach is
based on the assumption that an unlikely concept is more informative than a
usual concept, insofar as it is more surprising. In turn, the more surprising
the information required to defined the claim, the narrower its scope. Five
language models are considered, ranging from simplest models (each word or
character is assigned an identical probability) to intermediate models (using
average word or character frequencies), to a large language model (GPT2).
Interestingly, the scope resulting from the simplest language models is
proportional to the reciprocal of the number of words or characters involved in
the claim, a metric already used in previous works. Application is made to
multiple series of patent claims directed to distinct inventions, where each
series consists of claims devised to have a gradually decreasing scope. The
performance of the language models is assessed with respect to several ad hoc
tests. The more sophisticated the model, the better the results. I.e., the GPT2
probability model outperforms models based on word and character frequencies,
which themselves outdo the simplest models based on word or character counts.
Still, the character count appears to be a more reliable indicator than the
word count.]]></summary>

6 well-tuned GNN HLS kernels. We evaluate GNNHLS on 4 graph datasets with
distinct topologies and scales. The results show that GNNHLS achieves up to

Deep learning methods have shown unprecedented performance in this perspective.
However, it is still quite challenging to accurately segment different organs

background, and the substantially different organ size scales. In this work we
used make transformer-based model for training. It was found through previous
years' competitions that basically all of the top 5 methods used CNN-based
methods, which is likely due to the lack of data volume that prevents
transformer-based methods from taking full advantage. The thousands of samples

OPTQ quantization often outperforms finetuning that relies on less

competitive performance on text classification, natural language infernece, and
instruction following tasks using significantly less memory than existing

objective of 6G. Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a potential paradigm,
facilitating decentralized AI model training across a diverse range of devices
under the coordination of a central server. However, several challenges hinder
its wide application in the 6G context, such as malicious attacks and privacy
snooping on local model updates, and centralization pitfalls. This work
proposes a trusted architecture for supporting FL, which utilizes Distributed
Ledger Technology (DLT) and Graph Neural Network (GNN), including three key
features. First, a pre-processing layer employing homomorphic encryption is
incorporated to securely aggregate local models, preserving the privacy of
individual models. Second, given the distributed nature and graph structure
between clients and nodes in the pre-processing layer, GNN is leveraged to
identify abnormal local models, enhancing system security. Third, DLT is
utilized to decentralize the system by selecting one of the candidates to
perform the central server's functions. Additionally, DLT ensures reliable data
management by recording data exchanges in an immutable and transparent ledger.
The feasibility of the novel architecture is validated through simulations,
demonstrating improved performance in anomalous model detection and global
model accuracy compared to relevant baselines.]]></summary>

empirical prediction risk. It can act as a regularizer, but fails to do so in
certain high-dimensional problems, and it may shift the double-descent peak of
an empirical risk. Overall, the analysis shows that several properties data
augmentation has been attributed with are not either true or false, but rather
depend on a combination of factors -- notably the data distribution, the
properties of the estimator, and the interplay of sample size, number of

for disease diagnostics, treatment, and monitoring from within the patients'
bloodstreams. Assigning the location of a sensed biological event with the

medicine. The nanoscale nature of the nanodevices and the challenging
environment that the bloodstream represents, result in current flow-guided
localization approaches being constrained in their communication and
energy-related capabilities. The communication and energy constraints of the
nanodevices result in different features of raw data for flow-guided
localization, in turn affecting its performance. An analytical modeling of the
effects of imperfect communication and constrained energy causing intermittent
operation of the nanodevices on the raw data produced by the nanodevices would

flow-guided localization, where the raw data is modeled as a function of

the model by comparing its output with the one obtained through the utilization
of a simulator for objective evaluation of flow-guided localization, featuring

be characterized using classical Gaussian processes. More flexible spatial
extremes models exhibit appealing extremal dependence properties but are often
exceedingly prohibitive to fit and simulate from in high dimensions. In this
paper, we develop a new spatial extremes model that has flexible and
non-stationary dependence properties, and we integrate it in the
encoding-decoding structure of a variational autoencoder (XVAE), whose
parameters are estimated via variational Bayes combined with deep learning. The
XVAE can be used as a spatio-temporal emulator that characterizes the
distribution of potential mechanistic model output states and produces outputs
that have the same statistical properties as the inputs, especially in the
tail. As an aside, our approach also provides a novel way of making fast
inference with complex extreme-value processes. Through extensive simulation
studies, we show that our XVAE is substantially more time-efficient than
traditional Bayesian inference while also outperforming many spatial extremes
models with a stationary dependence structure. To further demonstrate the
computational power of the XVAE, we analyze a high-resolution satellite-derived
dataset of sea surface temperature in the Red Sea, which includes 30 years of
daily measurements at 16703 grid cells. We find that the extremal dependence
strength is weaker in the interior of Red Sea and it has decreased slightly

certain assumptions and approximations. Therefore, analyses and designs carried
out based on these equations are also approximate. The emergence of data-driven
models has, to a certain degree, addressed this challenge; however, the purely
data-driven models often (a) lack interpretability, (b) are data-hungry, and
(c) do not generalize beyond the training window. Operator learning has
recently been proposed as a potential alternative to address the aforementioned
challenges; however, the challenges are still persistent. We here argue that
one of the possible solutions resides in data-physics fusion, where the
data-driven model is used to correct/identify the missing physics. To that end,
we propose a novel Differentiable Physics Augmented Wavelet Neural Operator
(DPA-WNO). The proposed DPA-WNO blends a differentiable physics solver with the
Wavelet Neural Operator (WNO), where the role of WNO is to model the missing
physics. This empowers the proposed framework to exploit the capability of WNO
to learn from data while retaining the interpretability and generalizability
associated with physics-based solvers. We illustrate the applicability of the
proposed approach in solving time-dependent uncertainty quantification problems
due to randomness in the initial condition. Four benchmark uncertainty
quantification and reliability analysis examples from various fields of science
and engineering are solved using the proposed approach. The results presented

difference between the minimum expected loss in estimating a random variable
from an observed feature vector and the minimum expected loss in estimating the
same random variable from a transformation (statistic) of the feature vector.
After characterizing lossless transformations, i.e., transformations for which
the excess risk is zero for all loss functions, we construct a partitioning
test statistic for the hypothesis that a given transformation is lossless and
show that for i.i.d. data the test is strongly consistent. More generally, we
develop information-theoretic upper bounds on the excess risk that uniformly
hold over fairly general classes of loss functions. Based on these bounds, we
introduce the notion of a delta-lossless transformation and give sufficient
conditions for a given transformation to be universally delta-lossless.
Applications to classification, nonparametric regression, portfolio strategies,
information bottleneck, and deep learning, are also surveyed.]]></summary>

drug and materials discovery in a variety of tasks such as virtual screening
and inverse design. While there has been a surge of interest in advancing
model-centric techniques, the influence of both data quantity and quality on
molecular representations is not yet clearly understood within this field. In
this paper, we delve into the neural scaling behaviors of MRL from a
data-centric viewpoint, examining four key dimensions: (1) data modalities, (2)
dataset splitting, (3) the role of pre-training, and (4) model capacity. Our
empirical studies confirm a consistent power-law relationship between data
volume and MRL performance across these dimensions. Additionally, through
detailed analysis, we identify potential avenues for improving learning
efficiency. To challenge these scaling laws, we adapt seven popular data
pruning strategies to molecular data and benchmark their performance. Our
findings underline the importance of data-centric MRL and highlight possible

system's execution. Recent studies have explored a variety of techniques to
analyze provenance graphs for automated host intrusion detection, focusing
particularly on advanced persistent threats. Sifting through their design
documents, we identify four common dimensions that drive the development of
provenance-based intrusion detection systems (PIDSes): scope (can PIDSes detect
modern attacks that infiltrate across application boundaries?), attack
agnosticity (can PIDSes detect novel attacks without a priori knowledge of
attack characteristics?), timeliness (can PIDSes efficiently monitor host
systems as they run?), and attack reconstruction (can PIDSes distill attack
activity from large provenance graphs so that sysadmins can easily understand
and quickly respond to system intrusion?). We present KAIROS, the first PIDS
that simultaneously satisfies the desiderata in all four dimensions, whereas
existing approaches sacrifice at least one and struggle to achieve comparable
detection performance.

Kairos leverages a novel graph neural network-based encoder-decoder
architecture that learns the temporal evolution of a provenance graph's
structural changes to quantify the degree of anomalousness for each system
event. Then, based on this fine-grained information, Kairos reconstructs attack
footprints, generating compact summary graphs that accurately describe
malicious activity over a stream of system audit logs. Using state-of-the-art
benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that Kairos outperforms previous approaches.]]></summary>

One example of this is the problem of algorithmic collusion and market
fairness. The negative consequences of algorithmic collusion affect all
consumers, not only particular members of a protected class. Drawing on this
case study, I propose an ethical framework for researchers and practitioners in
machine learning seeking to develop and apply fairness metrics that extends to

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In root finding and optimization, there are many cases where there is a
closed set $A$ one likes that the sequence constructed by one's favourite
method will not converge to A (here, we do not assume extra properties on $A$
such as being convex or connected). For example, if one wants to find roots,
and one chooses initial points in the basin of attraction for 1 root $x^*$ (a
fact which one may not know before hand), then one will always end up in that
root. In this case, one would like to have a mechanism to avoid this point
$z^*$ in the next runs of one's algorithm.

In this paper, we propose two new methods aiming to achieve this. In the
first method, we divide the cost function by an appropriate power of the
distance function to $A$. This idea is inspired by how one would try to find
all roots of a function in 1 variable. In the second method, which is more
suitable for constrained optimization, we redefine the value of the function to
be a big constant on $A$. We also propose, based on this, an algorithm to
escape the basin of attraction of a component of positive dimension to reach
another component. As an application, we prove a rigorous guarantee for finding
roots of a meromorphic function of 1 complex variable in a given domain.

Along the way, we compare with main existing relevant methods in the current
literature. We provide several examples in various different settings to
illustrate the usefulness of the new approach.]]></summary>

dexterity, referred to as non-prehensile manipulation. Non-prehensile
manipulation may enable more complex interactions with the objects, but also
presents challenges in reasoning about gripper-object interactions. In this
work, we introduce Hybrid Actor-Critic Maps for Manipulation (HACMan), a
reinforcement learning approach for 6D non-prehensile manipulation of objects
using point cloud observations. HACMan proposes a temporally-abstracted and
spatially-grounded object-centric action representation that consists of
selecting a contact location from the object point cloud and a set of motion
parameters describing how the robot will move after making contact. We modify
an existing off-policy RL algorithm to learn in this hybrid discrete-continuous
action representation. We evaluate HACMan on a 6D object pose alignment task in
both simulation and in the real world. On the hardest version of our task, with
randomized initial poses, randomized 6D goals, and diverse object categories,
our policy demonstrates strong generalization to unseen object categories
without a performance drop, achieving an 89% success rate on unseen objects in
simulation and 50% success rate with zero-shot transfer in the real world.
Compared to alternative action representations, HACMan achieves a success rate
more than three times higher than the best baseline. With zero-shot sim2real
transfer, our policy can successfully manipulate unseen objects in the real
world for challenging non-planar goals, using dynamic and contact-rich
non-prehensile skills. Videos can be found on the project website:

Recently, PI-GNN, a generic scalable framework, has been proposed to address
the Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problems over graphs based on a simple
Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture. Their novel contribution was a generic
QUBO-formulated Hamiltonian-inspired loss function that was optimized using
GNN. In this study, we address a crucial issue related to the aforementioned
setup especially observed in denser graphs. The reinforcement learning-based
paradigm has also been widely used to address numerous CO problems. Here we
also formulate and empirically evaluate the compatibility of the
QUBO-formulated Hamiltonian as the generic reward function in the Reinforcement
Learning paradigm to directly integrate the actual node projection status
during training as the form of rewards. In our experiments, we observed up to

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In response to recent data regulation requirements, machine unlearning (MU)
has emerged as a critical process to remove the influence of specific examples
from a given model. Although exact unlearning can be achieved through complete
model retraining using the remaining dataset, the associated computational
costs have driven the development of efficient, approximate unlearning
techniques. Moving beyond data-centric MU approaches, our study introduces a
novel model-based perspective: model sparsification via weight pruning, which
is capable of reducing the gap between exact unlearning and approximate
unlearning. We show in both theory and practice that model sparsity can boost
the multi-criteria unlearning performance of an approximate unlearner, closing
the approximation gap, while continuing to be efficient. This leads to a new MU
paradigm, termed prune first, then unlearn, which infuses a sparse model prior
into the unlearning process. Building on this insight, we also develop a
sparsity-aware unlearning method that utilizes sparsity regularization to
enhance the training process of approximate unlearning. Extensive experiments
show that our proposals consistently benefit MU in various unlearning
scenarios. A notable highlight is the 77% unlearning efficacy gain of
fine-tuning (one of the simplest unlearning methods) when using sparsity-aware
unlearning. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical impact of our proposed MU
methods in addressing other machine learning challenges, such as defending
against backdoor attacks and enhancing transfer learning. Codes are available

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We provide a simple convergence proof for AdaGrad optimizing non-convex
objectives under only affine noise variance and bounded smoothness assumptions.
The proof is essentially based on a novel auxiliary function $\xi$ that helps
eliminate the complexity of handling the correlation between the numerator and
denominator of AdaGrad's update. Leveraging simple proofs, we are able to
obtain tighter results than existing results \citep{faw2022power} and extend
the analysis to several new and important cases. Specifically, for the
over-parameterized regime, we show that AdaGrad needs only
$\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2})$ iterations to ensure the gradient norm
smaller than $\varepsilon$, which matches the rate of SGD and significantly
tighter than existing rates $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^4})$ for AdaGrad.
We then discard the bounded smoothness assumption and consider a realistic
assumption on smoothness called $(L_0,L_1)$-smooth condition, which allows
local smoothness to grow with the gradient norm. Again based on the auxiliary
function $\xi$, we prove that AdaGrad succeeds in converging under
$(L_0,L_1)$-smooth condition as long as the learning rate is lower than a
threshold. Interestingly, we further show that the requirement on learning rate
under the $(L_0,L_1)$-smooth condition is necessary via proof by contradiction,
in contrast with the case of uniform smoothness conditions where convergence is
guaranteed regardless of learning rate choices. Together, our analyses broaden
the understanding of AdaGrad and demonstrate the power of the new auxiliary
function in the investigations of AdaGrad.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We study differentially private (DP) stochastic optimization (SO) with loss
functions whose worst-case Lipschitz parameter over all data points may be
extremely large. To date, the vast majority of work on DP SO assumes that the
loss is uniformly Lipschitz continuous over data (i.e. stochastic gradients are
uniformly bounded over all data points). While this assumption is convenient,
it often leads to pessimistic excess risk bounds. In many practical problems,
the worst-case (uniform) Lipschitz parameter of the loss over all data points
may be extremely large due to outliers. In such cases, the error bounds for DP
SO, which scale with the worst-case Lipschitz parameter of the loss, are
vacuous. To address these limitations, this work provides near-optimal excess
risk bounds that do not depend on the uniform Lipschitz parameter of the loss.
Building on a recent line of work (Wang et al., 2020; Kamath et al., 2022), we
assume that stochastic gradients have bounded $k$-th order moments for some $k
\geq 2$. Compared with works on uniformly Lipschitz DP SO, our excess risk
scales with the $k$-th moment bound instead of the uniform Lipschitz parameter
of the loss, allowing for significantly faster rates in the presence of
outliers and/or heavy-tailed data. For convex and strongly convex loss
functions, we provide the first asymptotically optimal excess risk bounds (up
to a logarithmic factor). In contrast to (Wang et al., 2020; Kamath et al.,
2022), our bounds do not require the loss function to be differentiable/smooth.
We also devise a linear-time algorithm for smooth losses that has excess risk
that is tight in certain practical parameter regimes. Additionally, our work is
the first to address non-convex non-uniformly Lipschitz loss functions
satisfying the Proximal-PL inequality; this covers some practical machine
learning models. Our Proximal-PL algorithm has near-optimal excess risk.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In many real-world tasks, the concerned objects can be represented as a
multi-instance bag associated with a candidate label set, which consists of one
ground-truth label and several false positive labels. Multi-instance
partial-label learning (MIPL) is a learning paradigm to deal with such tasks
and has achieved favorable performances. Existing MIPL approach follows the
instance-space paradigm by assigning augmented candidate label sets of bags to
each instance and aggregating bag-level labels from instance-level labels.
However, this scheme may be suboptimal as global bag-level information is
ignored and the predicted labels of bags are sensitive to predictions of
negative instances. In this paper, we study an alternative scheme where a
multi-instance bag is embedded into a single vector representation.
Accordingly, an intuitive algorithm named DEMIPL, i.e., Disambiguated attention
Embedding for Multi-Instance Partial-Label learning, is proposed. DEMIPL
employs a disambiguation attention mechanism to aggregate a multi-instance bag
into a single vector representation, followed by a momentum-based
disambiguation strategy to identify the ground-truth label from the candidate
label set. Furthermore, we introduce a real-world MIPL dataset for colorectal
cancer classification. Experimental results on benchmark and real-world
datasets validate the superiority of DEMIPL against the compared MIPL and
partial-label learning approaches.]]></summary>

distribution shift with guarantees on the false positive rate - i.e., when
there is no distribution shift, our system is very unlikely (with probability
$< \epsilon$) to falsely issue an alert; any alerts that are issued should
therefore be heeded. Our method is specifically designed for efficient
detection even with high dimensional data, and it empirically achieves up to
11x faster detection on realistic robotics settings compared to prior work
while maintaining a low false negative rate in practice (whenever there is a
distribution shift in our experiments, our method indeed emits an alert). We
demonstrate our approach in both simulation and hardware for a visual servoing
task, and show that our method indeed issues an alert before a failure occurs.]]></summary>

under-explored source of error in fair classification. In practice, the
variance on some data examples is so large that decisions can be effectively
arbitrary. To investigate this problem, we take an experimental approach and
make four overarching contributions: We 1) Define a metric called
self-consistency, derived from variance, which we use as a proxy for measuring
and reducing arbitrariness; 2) Develop an ensembling algorithm that abstains
from classification when a prediction would be arbitrary; 3) Conduct the
largest to-date empirical study of the role of variance (vis-a-vis
self-consistency and arbitrariness) in fair classification; and, 4) Release a
toolkit that makes the US Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) datasets easily
usable for future research. Altogether, our experiments reveal shocking
insights about the reliability of conclusions on benchmark datasets. Most
fairness classification benchmarks are close-to-fair when taking into account
the amount of arbitrariness present in predictions -- before we even try to
apply common fairness interventions. This finding calls into question the
practical utility of common algorithmic fairness methods, and in turn suggests
that we should fundamentally reconsider how we choose to measure fairness in
machine learning.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The soft Dice loss (SDL) has taken a pivotal role in numerous automated
segmentation pipelines in the medical imaging community. Over the last years,
some reasons behind its superior functioning have been uncovered and further
optimizations have been explored. However, there is currently no implementation
that supports its direct utilization in scenarios involving soft labels. Hence,
a synergy between the use of SDL and research leveraging the use of soft
labels, also in the context of model calibration, is still missing. In this
work, we introduce Dice semimetric losses (DMLs), which (i) are by design
identical to SDL in a standard setting with hard labels, but (ii) can be
employed in settings with soft labels. Our experiments on the public QUBIQ,
LiTS and KiTS benchmarks confirm the potential synergy of DMLs with soft labels
(e.g.\ averaging, label smoothing, and knowledge distillation) over hard labels
(e.g.\ majority voting and random selection). As a result, we obtain superior
Dice scores and model calibration, which supports the wider adoption of DMLs in
practice. The code is available at

equilibrium. While organized structures that emerge dominate transport
properties, universal representations that identify and describe these key
objects remain elusive. Here, we introduce a theoretically-grounded framework
for describing emergent organization that, via data-driven algorithms, is
constructive in practice. Its building blocks are spacetime lightcones that
embody how information propagates across a system through local interactions.
We show that predictive equivalence classes of lightcones -- local causal
states -- capture organized behaviors and coherent structures in complex
spatiotemporal systems. Employing an unsupervised physics-informed machine
learning algorithm and a high-performance computing implementation, we
demonstrate automatically discovering coherent structures in two real world
domain science problems. We show that local causal states identify vortices and
track their power-law decay behavior in two-dimensional fluid turbulence. We
then show how to detect and track familiar extreme weather events -- hurricanes
and atmospheric rivers -- and discover other novel coherent structures
associated with precipitation extremes in high-resolution climate data at the
grid-cell level.]]></summary>

establishing the robustness and trustworthiness of deep neural nets, especially
when they are used in safety-critical application domains such as autonomous
vehicles and precision medicine. However, the problem poses multiple practical
challenges, including scalability issues owing to large-sized networks, and the
generation of adversarial inputs that lack important qualities such as
naturalness and output-impartiality. This problem shares its end goal with the
task of patching neural nets where small changes in some of the network's
weights need to be discovered so that upon applying these changes, the modified
net produces the desirable output for a given set of inputs. We exploit this
connection by proposing to obtain an adversarial input from a patch, with the
underlying observation that the effect of changing the weights can also be
brought about by changing the inputs instead. Thus, this paper presents a novel
way to generate input perturbations that are adversarial for a given network by
using an efficient network patching technique. We note that the proposed method
is significantly more effective than the prior state-of-the-art techniques.]]></summary>

formulation that has a lower cost scaling than the prevailing Kohn-Sham DFT,
which is increasingly desired for contemporary molecular research. However, its
accuracy is limited by the kinetic energy density functional, which is
notoriously hard to approximate for non-periodic molecular systems. In this
work, we propose M-OFDFT, an OFDFT approach capable of solving molecular
systems using a deep-learning functional model. We build the essential
nonlocality into the model, which is made affordable by the concise density
representation as expansion coefficients under an atomic basis. With techniques
to address unconventional learning challenges therein, M-OFDFT achieves a
comparable accuracy with Kohn-Sham DFT on a wide range of molecules untouched
by OFDFT before. More attractively, M-OFDFT extrapolates well to molecules much
larger than those in training, which unleashes the appealing scaling for
studying large molecules including proteins, representing an advancement of the

systems. An ideal representation should be 3D, dynamic, and semantic to meet
the demands of diverse manipulation tasks. However, previous works often lack
all three properties simultaneously. In this work, we introduce D$^3$Fields -
dynamic 3D descriptor fields. These fields capture the dynamics of the
underlying 3D environment and encode both semantic features and instance masks.
Specifically, we project arbitrary 3D points in the workspace onto multi-view
2D visual observations and interpolate features derived from foundational
models. The resulting fused descriptor fields allow for flexible goal
specifications using 2D images with varied contexts, styles, and instances. To
evaluate the effectiveness of these descriptor fields, we apply our
representation to a wide range of robotic manipulation tasks in a zero-shot
manner. Through extensive evaluation in both real-world scenarios and
simulations, we demonstrate that D$^3$Fields are both generalizable and
effective for zero-shot robotic manipulation tasks. In quantitative comparisons

D$^3$Fields exhibit significantly better generalization abilities and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Existing approaches defend against backdoor attacks in federated learning
(FL) mainly through a) mitigating the impact of infected models, or b)
excluding infected models. The former negatively impacts model accuracy, while
the latter usually relies on globally clear boundaries between benign and
infected model updates. However, model updates are easy to be mixed and
scattered throughout in reality due to the diverse distributions of local data.
This work focuses on excluding infected models in FL. Unlike previous
perspectives from a global view, we propose Snowball, a novel anti-backdoor FL
framework through bidirectional elections from an individual perspective
inspired by one principle deduced by us and two principles in FL and deep
learning. It is characterized by a) bottom-up election, where each candidate
model update votes to several peer ones such that a few model updates are
elected as selectees for aggregation; and b) top-down election, where selectees
progressively enlarge themselves through picking up from the candidates. We
compare Snowball with state-of-the-art defenses to backdoor attacks in FL on
five real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior resistance to backdoor
attacks and slight impact on the accuracy of the global model.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Parallelization techniques have become ubiquitous for accelerating inference
and training of deep neural networks. Despite this, several operations are
still performed in a sequential manner. For instance, the forward and backward
passes are executed layer-by-layer, and the output of diffusion models is
produced by applying a sequence of denoising steps. This sequential approach
results in a computational cost proportional to the number of steps involved,
presenting a potential bottleneck as the number of steps increases. In this
work, we introduce DeepPCR, a novel algorithm which parallelizes typically
sequential operations used in inference and training of neural networks.
DeepPCR is based on interpreting a sequence of $L$ steps as the solution of a
specific system of equations, which we recover using the Parallel Cyclic
Reduction algorithm. This reduces the complexity of computing the sequential
operations from $\mathcal{O}(L)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log_2L)$, thus yielding a
speedup for large $L$. To verify the theoretical lower complexity of the
algorithm, and to identify regimes for speedup, we test the effectiveness of
DeepPCR in parallelizing the forward and backward pass in multi-layer
perceptrons, and reach speedups of up to $30\times$ for forward and $200\times$
for backward pass. We additionally showcase the flexibility of DeepPCR by
parallelizing training of ResNets with as many as 1024 layers, and generation
in diffusion models, enabling up to $7\times$ faster training and $11\times$
faster generation, respectively, when compared to the sequential approach.]]></summary>

setting with arbitrary corruptions. Similar to the classical setup, the agent
receives rewards generated independently from the distribution of the arm
chosen at each time. However, these rewards are not directly observed. Instead,
with a fixed $\varepsilon\in (0,\frac{1}{2})$, the agent observes a sample from
the chosen arm's distribution with probability $1-\varepsilon$, or from an
arbitrary corruption distribution with probability $\varepsilon$. Importantly,
we impose no assumptions on these corruption distributions, which can be
unbounded. In this setting, accommodating potentially unbounded corruptions, we
establish a problem-dependent lower bound on regret for a given family of arm
distributions. We introduce CRIMED, an asymptotically-optimal algorithm that
achieves the exact lower bound on regret for bandits with Gaussian
distributions with known variance. Additionally, we provide a finite-sample
analysis of CRIMED's regret performance. Notably, CRIMED can effectively handle
corruptions with $\varepsilon$ values as high as $\frac{1}{2}$. Furthermore, we
develop a tight concentration result for medians in the presence of arbitrary
corruptions, even with $\varepsilon$ values up to $\frac{1}{2}$, which may be
of independent interest. We also discuss an extension of the algorithm for

data in these spaces have been proposed in the literature. These algorithms
mainly use either hyperplanes or geodesics for decision boundaries in a large

this paper, we propose a novel large margin classifier based on horospherical
decision boundaries that leads to a geodesically convex optimization problem

ranging from clustering, kernel-based classification/regression and more
recently supervised graph prediction. Distances between graphs usually rely on
informative representations of these structured objects such as bag of
substructures or other graph embeddings. A recently popular solution consists
in representing graphs as metric measure spaces, allowing to successfully
leverage Optimal Transport, which provides meaningful distances allowing to
compare them: the Gromov-Wasserstein distances. However, this family of
distances overlooks edge attributes, which are essential for many structured
objects. In this work, we introduce an extension of Gromov-Wasserstein distance
for comparing graphs whose both nodes and edges have features. We propose novel
algorithms for distance and barycenter computation. We empirically show the
effectiveness of the novel distance in learning tasks where graphs occur in
either input space or output space, such as classification and graph

After characterizing lossless transformations, i.e., transformations for which
the excess risk is zero for all loss functions, we construct a partitioning
test statistic for the hypothesis that a given transformation is lossless and
show that for i.i.d. data the test is strongly consistent. More generally, we
develop information-theoretic upper bounds on the excess risk that uniformly
hold over fairly general classes of loss functions. Based on these bounds, we
introduce the notion of a delta-lossless transformation and give sufficient

increase rather than decrease the uncertainty of estimates, such as the
empirical prediction risk. It can act as a regularizer, but fails to do so in
certain high-dimensional problems, and it may shift the double-descent peak of
an empirical risk. Overall, the analysis shows that several properties data
augmentation has been attributed with are not either true or false, but rather
depend on a combination of factors -- notably the data distribution, the
properties of the estimator, and the interplay of sample size, number of
augmentations, and dimension. Our main theoretical tool is a limit theorem for

previous knowledge. However, Continual Learning often requires massive
computational power and storage capacity for satisfactory performance. In this
paper, we propose a resource-efficient continual learning method called the

diminished forgetting within the same computational and storage constraints,

Network Distillation to identify the representative core subnet by assessing
parameter quantity and output similarity with the working network, distilling
analogous subnets within the working network to mitigate reliance on rehearsal
buffers and facilitating knowledge transfer across previous tasks. To enhance
storage resource utilization, we then propose Subnet Constraint Experience
Replay to optimize rehearsal efficiency through a sample storage strategy based
on the structures of representative networks. Extensive experiments conducted

menopause, and yet research connecting female brain health to sex hormone
fluctuations is limited. We seek to investigate this connection by developing
tools that quantify 3D shape changes that occur in the brain during sex hormone
fluctuations. Geodesic regression on the space of 3D discrete surfaces offers a
principled way to characterize the evolution of a brain's shape. However, in
its current form, this approach is too computationally expensive for practical
use. In this paper, we propose approximation schemes that accelerate geodesic
regression on shape spaces of 3D discrete surfaces. We also provide rules of
thumb for when each approximation can be used. We test our approach on
synthetic data to quantify the speed-accuracy trade-off of these approximations
and show that practitioners can expect very significant speed-up while only
sacrificing little accuracy. Finally, we apply the method to real brain shape
data and produce the first characterization of how the female hippocampus
changes shape during the menstrual cycle as a function of progesterone: a
characterization made (practically) possible by our approximation schemes. Our
work paves the way for comprehensive, practical shape analyses in the fields of
bio-medicine and computer vision. Our implementation is publicly available on

NWDAF needs to conduct both inference and training tasks, and thus it is
difficult to provide the analytics results to NFs in a timely manner for an

are distributed to multiple leaf NWDAFs and training tasks are conducted at the
root NWDAF. Extensive simulation results using open-source software (i.e.,

Due to the imbalance in the number of samples, the support vector machine (SVM)
classifier gets biased toward the majority class. Furthermore, these samples
are often observed with a certain degree of noise. Therefore, to remove these
problems we propose a novel fuzzy based approach to deal with class imbalanced
as well noisy datasets. We propose two approaches to address these problems.
The first approach is based on the intuitionistic fuzzy membership, termed as
robust energy-based intuitionistic fuzzy least squares twin support vector
machine (IF-RELSTSVM). Furthermore, we introduce the concept of
hyperplane-based fuzzy membership in our second approach, where the final
classifier is termed as robust energy-based fuzzy least square twin support
vector machine (F-RELSTSVM). By using this technique, the membership values are
based on a projection based approach, where the data points are projected on
the hyperplanes. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated on
several benchmark and synthetic datasets. The experimental results show that
the proposed IF-RELSTSVM and F-RELSTSVM models outperform the baseline
algorithms. Statistical tests are performed to check the significance of the
proposed algorithms. The results show the applicability of the proposed

of modern computer vision. However, its application in certain imaging fields,
such as microscopy and satellite imaging, presents unique challenges. In these
domains, images often contain multiple channels, each carrying semantically
distinct and independent information. Furthermore, the model must demonstrate
robustness to sparsity in input channels, as they may not be densely available
during training or testing. In this paper, we propose a modification to the ViT
architecture that enhances reasoning across the input channels and introduce
Hierarchical Channel Sampling (HCS) as an additional regularization technique
to ensure robustness when only partial channels are presented during test time.
Our proposed model, ChannelViT, constructs patch tokens independently from each
input channel and utilizes a learnable channel embedding that is added to the
patch tokens, similar to positional embeddings. We evaluate the performance of
ChannelViT on ImageNet, JUMP-CP (microscopy cell imaging), and So2Sat
(satellite imaging). Our results show that ChannelViT outperforms ViT on
classification tasks and generalizes well, even when a subset of input channels
is used during testing. Across our experiments, HCS proves to be a powerful
regularizer, independent of the architecture employed, suggesting itself as a
straightforward technique for robust ViT training. Lastly, we find that
ChannelViT generalizes effectively even when there is limited access to all
channels during training, highlighting its potential for multi-channel imaging
under real-world conditions with sparse sensors.]]></summary>

central to statistical learning and inference. Two classical methods are
canonical correlation analysis (CCA), which identifies maximally correlated
projected versions of the original variables, and Shannon's mutual information,
which is a universal dependence measure that also captures high-order
dependencies. However, CCA only accounts for linear dependence, which may be
insufficient for certain applications, while mutual information is often
infeasible to compute/estimate in high dimensions. This work proposes a middle
ground in the form of a scalable information-theoretic generalization of CCA,
termed max-sliced mutual information (mSMI). mSMI equals the maximal mutual
information between low-dimensional projections of the high-dimensional
variables, which reduces back to CCA in the Gaussian case. It enjoys the best
of both worlds: capturing intricate dependencies in the data while being
amenable to fast computation and scalable estimation from samples. We show that
mSMI retains favorable structural properties of Shannon's mutual information,
like variational forms and identification of independence. We then study
statistical estimation of mSMI, propose an efficiently computable neural
estimator, and couple it with formal non-asymptotic error bounds. We present
experiments that demonstrate the utility of mSMI for several tasks,
encompassing independence testing, multi-view representation learning,
algorithmic fairness, and generative modeling. We observe that mSMI
consistently outperforms competing methods with little-to-no computational
overhead.]]></summary>

We train a generic U-Net-based architecture under a curriculum consisting of

opportunities for artificial general intelligence but concurrently amplify
safety concerns, such as potential misuse of AI systems, necessitating
effective AI alignment. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has
emerged as a promising pathway towards AI alignment but brings forth challenges
due to its complexity and dependence on a separate reward model. Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed as an alternative, and it
remains equivalent to RLHF under the reverse KL regularization constraint. This
paper presents $f$-DPO, a generalized approach to DPO by incorporating diverse
divergence constraints. We show that under certain $f$-divergences, including
Jensen-Shannon divergence, forward KL divergences and $\alpha$-divergences, the
complex relationship between the reward and optimal policy can also be
simplified by addressing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. This eliminates the
need for estimating the normalizing constant in the Bradley-Terry model and
enables a tractable mapping between the reward function and the optimal policy.
Our approach optimizes LLMs to align with human preferences in a more efficient
and supervised manner under a broad set of divergence constraints. Empirically,
adopting these divergences ensures a balance between alignment performance and
generation diversity. Importantly, $f$-DPO outperforms PPO-based methods in
divergence efficiency, and divergence constraints directly influence expected
calibration error (ECE).]]></summary>

work, we propose M-OFDFT, an OFDFT approach capable of solving molecular

nonlocality into the model, which is made affordable by the concise density
representation as expansion coefficients under an atomic basis. With techniques
to address unconventional learning challenges therein, M-OFDFT achieves a
comparable accuracy with Kohn-Sham DFT on a wide range of molecules untouched
by OFDFT before. More attractively, M-OFDFT extrapolates well to molecules much
larger than those in training, which unleashes the appealing scaling for
studying large molecules including proteins, representing an advancement of the

reliability of automatic face recognition (FR) systems in surveillance and
security scenarios. However, a massive amount of face data is usually
compressed before being analyzed due to limitations on transmission or storage.
The compressed images may lose the powerful identity information, resulting in
the performance degradation of the FR system. Herein, we make the first attempt
to study just noticeable difference (JND) for the FR system, which can be
defined as the maximum distortion that the FR system cannot notice. More
specifically, we establish a JND dataset including 3530 original images and
137,670 compressed images generated by advanced reference encoding/decoding
software based on the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard (VTM-15.0).
Subsequently, we develop a novel JND prediction model to directly infer JND
images for the FR system. In particular, in order to maximum redundancy removal
without impairment of robust identity information, we apply the encoder with
multiple feature extraction and attention-based feature decomposition modules
to progressively decompose face features into two uncorrelated components,
i.e., identity and residual features, via self-supervised learning. Then, the
residual feature is fed into the decoder to generate the residual map. Finally,
the predicted JND map is obtained by subtracting the residual map from the
original image. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed model
achieves higher accuracy of JND map prediction compared with the
state-of-the-art JND models, and is capable of saving more bits while
maintaining the performance of the FR system compared with VTM-15.0.]]></summary>

difficult to examine because of the limited size of quantum circuits, which can
be reliably implemented in the near future. We propose transfer learning as an

quantum era to the full extent. In the classical-to-quantum transfer learning
framework, a QCNN can solve complex classification problems without requiring a
large-scale quantum circuit by utilizing a pre-trained classical convolutional
neural network (CNN). We perform numerical simulations of QCNN models with
various sets of quantum convolution and pooling operations for MNIST data

Embracing the geometry of the loss function, where neighborhoods of 'flat

the maximum loss caused by an adversary perturbing parameters within the
neighborhood. Although critical to account for sharpness of the loss function,
such an 'over-friendly adversary' can curtail the outmost level of
generalization. The novel approach of this contribution fosters stabilization
of adversaries through variance suppression (VaSSO) to avoid such friendliness.
VaSSO's provable stability safeguards its numerical improvement over SAM in

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The accurate representation of precipitation in Earth system models (ESMs) is
crucial for reliable projections of the ecological and socioeconomic impacts in
response to anthropogenic global warming. The complex cross-scale interactions
of processes that produce precipitation are challenging to model, however,
inducing potentially strong biases in ESM fields, especially regarding
extremes. State-of-the-art bias correction methods only address errors in the
simulated frequency distributions locally at every individual grid cell.
Improving unrealistic spatial patterns of the ESM output, which would require
spatial context, has not been possible so far. Here, we show that a
post-processing method based on physically constrained generative adversarial
networks (cGANs) can correct biases of a state-of-the-art, CMIP6-class ESM both
in local frequency distributions and in the spatial patterns at once. While our
method improves local frequency distributions equally well as gold-standard
bias-adjustment frameworks, it strongly outperforms any existing methods in the
correction of spatial patterns, especially in terms of the characteristic
spatial intermittency of precipitation extremes.]]></summary>

performing language-related tasks. However, their deployment poses significant
challenges due to their considerable memory and storage requirements. In
response to this issue, weight-only quantization, particularly 3 and 4-bit
weight-only quantization, has emerged as one of the most viable solutions. As
the number of bits decreases, the quantization grid broadens, thus emphasizing
the importance of up and down rounding. While previous studies have
demonstrated that fine-tuning up and down rounding with the addition of
perturbations can enhance accuracy in some scenarios, our study is driven by
the precise and limited boundary of these perturbations, where only the
threshold for altering the rounding value is of significance. Consequently, we
propose a concise and highly effective approach for optimizing the weight
rounding task. Our method, named SignRound, involves lightweight block-wise
tuning using signed gradient descent, enabling us to achieve outstanding
results within 400 steps. SignRound competes impressively against recent
methods without introducing additional inference overhead. The source code will
be publicly available at \url{https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor} soon.]]></summary>

allow them to operate in complex, high-dimensional, non-linear, and dynamically
changing environments. Due to the complexity of these environments, DNN
classifiers may output misclassifications during operation when they face
domains not identified during development. Removing a system from operation for
retraining becomes impractical as the number of such AS increases. To increase
AS reliability and overcome this limitation, DNN classifiers need to have the
ability to adapt during operation when faced with different operational domains
using a few samples (e.g. 100 samples). However, retraining DNNs on a few
samples is known to cause catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we introduce
Dynamic Incremental Regularised Adaptation (DIRA), a framework for operational
domain adaption of DNN classifiers using regularisation techniques to overcome
catastrophic forgetting and achieve adaptation when retraining using a few
samples of the target domain. Our approach shows improvements on different
image classification benchmarks aimed at evaluating robustness to distribution
shifts (e.g.CIFAR-10C/100C, ImageNet-C), and produces state-of-the-art
performance in comparison with other frameworks from the literature.]]></summary>

under-explored source of error in fair classification. In practice, the
variance on some data examples is so large that decisions can be effectively
arbitrary. To investigate this problem, we take an experimental approach and
make four overarching contributions: We 1) Define a metric called
self-consistency, derived from variance, which we use as a proxy for measuring
and reducing arbitrariness; 2) Develop an ensembling algorithm that abstains
from classification when a prediction would be arbitrary; 3) Conduct the
largest to-date empirical study of the role of variance (vis-a-vis
self-consistency and arbitrariness) in fair classification; and, 4) Release a
toolkit that makes the US Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) datasets easily
usable for future research. Altogether, our experiments reveal shocking
insights about the reliability of conclusions on benchmark datasets. Most
fairness classification benchmarks are close-to-fair when taking into account
the amount of arbitrariness present in predictions -- before we even try to
apply common fairness interventions. This finding calls into question the
practical utility of common algorithmic fairness methods, and in turn suggests
that we should fundamentally reconsider how we choose to measure fairness in
machine learning.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many emerging user-facing services adopt Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to
improve serving accuracy. When the graph used by a GNN model changes,
representations (embedding) of nodes in the graph should be updated
accordingly. However, the node representation update is too slow, resulting in
either long response latency of user queries (the inference is performed after
the update completes) or high staleness problem (the inference is performed
based on stale data). Our in-depth analysis shows that the slow update is
mainly due to neighbor explosion problem in graphs and duplicated computation.
Based on such findings, we propose STAG, a GNN serving framework that enables
low latency and low staleness of GNN-based services. It comprises a
collaborative serving mechanism and an additivity-based incremental propagation
strategy. With the collaborative serving mechanism, only part of node
representations are updated during the update phase, and the final
representations are calculated in the inference phase. It alleviates the
neighbor explosion problem. The additivity-based incremental propagation
strategy reuses intermediate data during the update phase, eliminating
duplicated computation problem. Experimental results show that STAG accelerates
the update phase by 1.3x~90.1x, and greatly reduces staleness time with a
slight increase in response latency.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While reliable data-driven decision-making hinges on high-quality labeled
data, the acquisition of quality labels often involves laborious human
annotations or slow and expensive scientific measurements. Machine learning is
becoming an appealing alternative as sophisticated predictive techniques are
being used to quickly and cheaply produce large amounts of predicted labels;
e.g., predicted protein structures are used to supplement experimentally
derived structures, predictions of socioeconomic indicators from satellite
imagery are used to supplement accurate survey data, and so on. Since
predictions are imperfect and potentially biased, this practice brings into
question the validity of downstream inferences. We introduce cross-prediction:
a method for valid inference powered by machine learning. With a small labeled
dataset and a large unlabeled dataset, cross-prediction imputes the missing
labels via machine learning and applies a form of debiasing to remedy the
prediction inaccuracies. The resulting inferences achieve the desired error
probability and are more powerful than those that only leverage the labeled
data. Closely related is the recent proposal of prediction-powered inference,
which assumes that a good pre-trained model is already available. We show that
cross-prediction is consistently more powerful than an adaptation of
prediction-powered inference in which a fraction of the labeled data is split
off and used to train the model. Finally, we observe that cross-prediction
gives more stable conclusions than its competitors; its confidence intervals
typically have significantly lower variability.]]></summary>

an algorithm for incremental construction of CTFs that is guaranteed to give a

algorithm that takes a calibrated CTF as input and yields a valid and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We study differentially private (DP) stochastic optimization (SO) with loss
functions whose worst-case Lipschitz parameter over all data points may be
extremely large. To date, the vast majority of work on DP SO assumes that the
loss is uniformly Lipschitz continuous over data (i.e. stochastic gradients are
uniformly bounded over all data points). While this assumption is convenient,
it often leads to pessimistic excess risk bounds. In many practical problems,
the worst-case (uniform) Lipschitz parameter of the loss over all data points
may be extremely large due to outliers. In such cases, the error bounds for DP
SO, which scale with the worst-case Lipschitz parameter of the loss, are
vacuous. To address these limitations, this work provides near-optimal excess
risk bounds that do not depend on the uniform Lipschitz parameter of the loss.
Building on a recent line of work (Wang et al., 2020; Kamath et al., 2022), we
assume that stochastic gradients have bounded $k$-th order moments for some $k
\geq 2$. Compared with works on uniformly Lipschitz DP SO, our excess risk
scales with the $k$-th moment bound instead of the uniform Lipschitz parameter
of the loss, allowing for significantly faster rates in the presence of
outliers and/or heavy-tailed data. For convex and strongly convex loss
functions, we provide the first asymptotically optimal excess risk bounds (up
to a logarithmic factor). In contrast to (Wang et al., 2020; Kamath et al.,
2022), our bounds do not require the loss function to be differentiable/smooth.
We also devise a linear-time algorithm for smooth losses that has excess risk
that is tight in certain practical parameter regimes. Additionally, our work is
the first to address non-convex non-uniformly Lipschitz loss functions
satisfying the Proximal-PL inequality; this covers some practical machine
learning models. Our Proximal-PL algorithm has near-optimal excess risk.]]></summary>

setting with arbitrary corruptions. Similar to the classical setup, the agent
receives rewards generated independently from the distribution of the arm
chosen at each time. However, these rewards are not directly observed. Instead,
with a fixed $\varepsilon\in (0,\frac{1}{2})$, the agent observes a sample from
the chosen arm's distribution with probability $1-\varepsilon$, or from an
arbitrary corruption distribution with probability $\varepsilon$. Importantly,
we impose no assumptions on these corruption distributions, which can be
unbounded. In this setting, accommodating potentially unbounded corruptions, we
establish a problem-dependent lower bound on regret for a given family of arm
distributions. We introduce CRIMED, an asymptotically-optimal algorithm that
achieves the exact lower bound on regret for bandits with Gaussian
distributions with known variance. Additionally, we provide a finite-sample
analysis of CRIMED's regret performance. Notably, CRIMED can effectively handle
corruptions with $\varepsilon$ values as high as $\frac{1}{2}$. Furthermore, we
develop a tight concentration result for medians in the presence of arbitrary
corruptions, even with $\varepsilon$ values up to $\frac{1}{2}$, which may be

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bayesian optimization (BO), while proved highly effective for many black-box
function optimization tasks, requires practitioners to carefully select priors
that well model their functions of interest. Rather than specifying by hand,
researchers have investigated transfer learning based methods to automatically
learn the priors, e.g. multi-task BO (Swersky et al., 2013), few-shot BO
(Wistuba and Grabocka, 2021) and HyperBO (Wang et al., 2022). However, those
prior learning methods typically assume that the input domains are the same for
all tasks, weakening their ability to use observations on functions with
different domains or generalize the learned priors to BO on different search
spaces. In this work, we present HyperBO+: a pre-training approach for
hierarchical Gaussian processes that enables the same prior to work universally
for Bayesian optimization on functions with different domains. We propose a
two-step pre-training method and analyze its appealing asymptotic properties
and benefits to BO both theoretically and empirically. On real-world
hyperparameter tuning tasks that involve multiple search spaces, we demonstrate
that HyperBO+ is able to generalize to unseen search spaces and achieves lower
regrets than competitive baselines.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular black-box function optimization
method, which makes sequential decisions based on a Bayesian model, typically a
Gaussian process (GP), of the function. To ensure the quality of the model,
transfer learning approaches have been developed to automatically design GP
priors by learning from observations on "training" functions. These training
functions are typically required to have the same domain as the "test" function
(black-box function to be optimized). In this paper, we introduce MPHD, a model
pre-training method on heterogeneous domains, which uses a neural net mapping
from domain-specific contexts to specifications of hierarchical GPs. MPHD can
be seamlessly integrated with BO to transfer knowledge across heterogeneous
search spaces. Our theoretical and empirical results demonstrate the validity
of MPHD and its superior performance on challenging black-box function
optimization tasks.]]></summary>

value function) is the key step toward personalized medicine. We define our
target parameter as a conditional value function given a set of baseline
covariates which we refer to as a stratum based value function. We focus on
semiparametric class of decision rules and propose a sieve based nonparametric
covariate adjusted regimen-response curve estimator within that class. Our work
contributes in several ways. First, we propose an inverse probability weighted
nonparametrically efficient estimator of the smoothed regimen-response curve
function. We show that asymptotic linearity is achieved when the nuisance
functions are undersmoothed sufficiently. Asymptotic and finite sample criteria
for undersmoothing are proposed. Second, using Gaussian process theory, we
propose simultaneous confidence intervals for the smoothed regimen-response
curve function. Third, we provide consistency and convergence rate for the
optimizer of the regimen-response curve estimator; this enables us to estimate
an optimal semiparametric rule. The latter is important as the optimizer
corresponds with the optimal dynamic treatment regimen. Some finite-sample
properties are explored with simulations.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We study unconstrained Online Linear Optimization with Lipschitz losses. The
goal is to simultaneously achieve ($i$) second order gradient adaptivity; and
($ii$) comparator norm adaptivity also known as "parameter freeness" in the
literature. Existing regret bounds (Cutkosky and Orabona, 2018; Mhammedi and
Koolen, 2020; Jacobsen and Cutkosky, 2022) have the suboptimal $O(\sqrt{V_T\log
V_T})$ dependence on the gradient variance $V_T$, while the present work
improves it to the optimal rate $O(\sqrt{V_T})$ using a novel
continuous-time-inspired algorithm, without any impractical doubling trick.
This result can be extended to the setting with unknown Lipschitz constant,
eliminating the range ratio problem from prior works (Mhammedi and Koolen,
2020).

Concretely, we first show that the aimed simultaneous adaptivity can be
achieved fairly easily in a continuous time analogue of the problem, where the
environment is modeled by an arbitrary continuous semimartingale. Then, our key
innovation is a new discretization argument that preserves such adaptivity in
the discrete time adversarial setting. This refines a non-gradient-adaptive
discretization argument from (Harvey et al., 2023), both algorithmically and
analytically, which could be of independent interest.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone. I am very passionate about getting in ML research and was wondering what the learning pathway was, particularly with regards to the theoretical Math and Statistics involved.
 For context:
  
I am a second year undergraduate. By the end of this year, I will have taken and finished A Multivariable Calculus with Proofs course, so that is my current starting point.
 I have been working with ML for the last 3 years and am proficient in Python and frameworks like PyTorch.
 I have also made my own implementation of several research papers (LSTMs, GRUs, Transformers, ELMo, BERT, GPT, as well as a few computer vision papers).
  
I have a good general intuition of how deep learning works, but I want to formalise this knowledge with the adequate mathematical background so that I can eventually pursue a career in research. I understand that I have plenty of time until I reach there, and I am willing to dedicate it to grinding out the math and statistical knowledge required.
 I have done my research on this sub and other forums, and here are a few resources that stood out:
  
Mathematics for Machine Learning by Deisenroth, Faisal and Ong
 Advanced Calculus of Several Variables by C. H. Edwards Jr.
 Mathematical Methods Lecture Notes from Imperial College by Deisenroth and Cheraghchi
 The original information theory paper by Shannon
 The Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman
 Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Bishop
 The Probabalistic Machine Learning Series by Kevin P. Murphy
 Deep Learning by Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville
 Mathematics of Machine Learning on MIT OCW (here)
  
My question is, what order should I start self-learning in, given the (somewhat limited) background knowledge I have? Also, are there any other resources that would help?

 With the different data points, such as phi-1.5 performance being as good as 7b models on some tasks, it seems to be plausible that small models can be quite capable on specific tasks.
 I am working on BlindChat, an open-source and private solution to run small LLMs on your browser and I am interested in fine-tuning a phi-1.5 on some domain specific data.
 I am thinking of having an approach similar to the researchers of the phi paper, which is creating a high quality dataset using GPT3.5 / GPT4. 
 Do you know good open-source frameworks that make it easy to create a high quality data for a specific task using an existing large model, like GPT3.5/4 or Llama 2 70b?

Malvertising has made its way to Bing's chatbot/search engine.
 
Cybersecurity researchers observed a malicious ad being offered as part of the Chat-GPT, AI-powered answer to a search query.
 
Malvertising is a practice where hackers trick ad networks into displaying ads that look legitimate but are actually malicious.
 
Microsoft integrated Chat-GPT into Bing earlier this year and started monetizing it.
 
When a user types in a query, they would get a result paired with sponsored links.
 
In this instance, researchers were given a link that redirected them to a malicious site.
 
Threat actors continue to leverage search ads to redirect users to malicious sites hosting malware.
 
Bing Chat serves some of the same ads seen via a traditional Bing query.

In this paper, we present Gaussian Splatting based text-to-3D generation (GSGEN), a novel approach for generating high-quality 3D objects. Previous methods suffer from inaccurate geometry and limited fidelity due to the absence of 3D prior and proper representation. We leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting, a recent state-of-the-art representation, to address existing shortcomings by exploiting the explicit nature that enables the incorporation of 3D prior. Specifically, our method adopts a progressive optimization strategy, which includes a geometry optimization stage and an appearance refinement stage. In geometry optimization, a coarse representation is established under a 3D geometry prior along with the ordinary 2D SDS loss, ensuring a sensible and 3D-consistent rough shape. Subsequently, the obtained Gaussians undergo an iterative refinement to enrich details. In this stage, we increase the number of Gaussians by compactness-based densification to enhance continuity and improve fidelity. With these designs, our approach can generate 3D content with delicate details and more accurate geometry. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, especially for capturing high-frequency components.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I just open-sourced a project that I've been working on for a while and wanted to see what you think!
 The goal of Carton (https://carton.run) is to let you use a single interface to run any machine learning model from any programming language.
 It’s currently difficult to integrate models that use different technologies (e.g. TensorRT, Ludwig, TorchScript, JAX, GGML, etc) into your application, especially if you’re not using Python. Even if you learn the details of integrating each of these frameworks, running multiple frameworks in one process can cause hard-to-debug crashes.
 Ideally, the ML framework a model was developed in should just be an implementation detail. Carton lets you decouple your application from specific ML frameworks so you can focus on the problem you actually want to solve.
 At a high level, the way Carton works is by running models in their own processes and using an IPC system to communicate back and forth with low overhead. Carton is primarily implemented in Rust, with bindings to other languages. There are lots more details linked in the architecture doc below.
 Importantly, Carton uses your model’s original underlying framework (e.g. PyTorch) under the hood to actually execute the model. This is meaningful because it makes Carton composable with other technologies. For example, it’s easy to use custom ops, TensorRT, etc without changes. This lets you keep up with cutting-edge advances, but decouples them from your application.
 I’ve been working on Carton for almost a year now and I open sourced it on Wednesday!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone, 
 I’m doing a project where I’m crowdsourcing a lot of location data for a set of location labels and then trying to cluster it for each and using the centroid of the cluster as the most accurate location for that location label. 
 The data keeps coming in everyday. I’m not sure when to stop computation. Initially I thought I’ll check the delta between each days centroid computed and if the delta falls under a threshold then stop computing. 
 But now I’m thinking if my daily data collected gets marked as outliers, subsequent days centroids won’t have much of a delta and it will pass my convergence condition. 
 Any suggestions?

 As cuDNN/cuBLAS routines are nondeterministic and possibly dynamically allocate variable amount of memory, how do people manage this problem? Is it a problem at all? Estimating memory usage of deep learning models on gpu is notoriously hard. There is a research paper from Microsoft tackling this problem and they mispredict the usage of memory by 15% on average. Some cpu BLAS libraries like openBLAS or MKL also dynamically allocate the memory, but there are alternatives - LAPACK as far as I know uses only the memory provided by the caller, making it viable option for applications in embedded.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been playing around with pruning neural networks. One interesting thing I've found is that pruning the weights with the lowest L1-norm along a specific dimension seems to give better results than simply pruning all of the weights with the lowest L1-norm (which I believe is the standard method; for example this is what torch.nn.utils.prune.l1_unstructured does).
 Does anyone have an explanation for why this might be, or knows of any research in this area?
 I'm aware that structured pruning removes entire channels in a specific dimension. But I'm referring to unstructured pruning here, where I remove a subset of the weights along a specific dimension.
 Admittedly I've only done very limited benchmarking of this. See this repo for my implementation, and some benchmark details.

 Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16668
 RealFill is able to complete the image with what should have been there.
 Abstract
  
Recent advances in generative imagery have brought forth outpainting and inpainting models that can produce high-quality, plausible image content in unknown regions, but the content these models hallucinate is necessarily inauthentic, since the models lack sufficient context about the true scene. In this work, we propose RealFill, a novel generative approach for image completion that fills in missing regions of an image with the content that should have been there. RealFill is a generative inpainting model that is personalized using only a few reference images of a scene. These reference images do not have to be aligned with the target image, and can be taken with drastically varying viewpoints, lighting conditions, camera apertures, or image styles. Once personalized, RealFill is able to complete a target image with visually compelling contents that are faithful to the original scene. We evaluate RealFill on a new image completion benchmark that covers a set of diverse and challenging scenarios, and find that it outperforms existing approaches by a large margin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 so i learnt the very basics of ai and im trying to understand how nn works,
 this is what i have figured out so far. 
 so if i have a 4x4 image e.g
 0 1 1 0
 1 0 0 1
 1 1 1 1
 1 0 0 1
 i pass it across a 2x2 kernal e.g
 1 1
 0 3
 ​
 and padding it would do 
 ​
 dot product of 
 0 1
 1 0
 ​
 x
 ​
 1 1
 0 3
 ​
 is 1
 ​
 ​
 and if we do that to all of them we get a new matrix
 ​
 1 2 4
 4 1 3
 5 4 4
 ​
 ​
 then we have padding same so this becomes
 ​
 0 0 0 0
 1 2 4 0
 4 1 3 0
 5 4 4 0
 ​
 ​
 we then turn it into a feature map, basically flatenting it to something like this
 0,0,0,0,1,2,4,0,4,1,3,0,5,4,4,0
 ​
 so the input has 16 features, if we have a layer of 3 nerons that fire with relu activation funciton
 and each weight is alternating between 1 and 2 for simplicity sake . we would do
 0*1 + 0*2 + 0*1 .... 4*2 + 0*1 = 32
 so if we are using relu, we would do 
 is 32 > 0? if so we pass 32 to next neuron if not we pass 0?
 ​
 idk the rest, i guess i forgot what uni taught me 😅 
 ​
 hers a diagram i drew, maybe you can help me figure out hte rest, im confused how the output layer works i guess

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some posit he was genuinely surprised by the violence and needed time to assess the situation before acting. They argue that the chaotic nature of the events made immediate action complex, given the layers of command and decision-making involved. Others claim he might have been in deliberation with advisors to gauge the scale and implications of intervention, debating the potential backlash from his supporters or the legal ramifications.
 Another perspective suggests that he might have been contemplating how the events would affect the certification of the Electoral College results, given that his previous legal and political efforts to contest the 2020 election outcome had failed. In this view, he might have been waiting to see if the Congress would be influenced to halt or delay the certification.
 While some of his supporters may find these explanations plausible, critics argue that the delay represents a dereliction of duty or even tacit support for the violence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 Im new to the Neural network and I wanted some advice :
 I wanted to generate grayscale images with certain properties : - distribution of pixels values, space correlation between pixels, etc...
 I already know the type of result that I need, but I wanted to know if a neural network especially a GAN was capable to produce images fitting me requirements.
 I was thinking that maybe I could change the GAN architecture such as :
 1)the Real data inputs (normally images feed to discriminator) will simply be the statistical parameters that I am expecting.
 2) I'll add a measure of the various statistical parameters on all the synthetic images generated. 
 3)Finally the discriminator will only based itself on the statistical parameters comparison for weights updates.
 Does such network make sense ? If so I have trouble finding a way of implementing it but that is an other story. Right know I want to know if this is doable ? If not do you have any alternative suggestion for my issue ?
 Thanks all for your advice !

Joaquin Quiñonero Candela, a director of AI at Facebook, was tasked with fixing the problem but was only focused on addressing AI bias.
 
The Responsible AI team failed to make headway against misinformation and hate speech because it never made those problems its main focus.
 
The spread of lies and hate speech on Facebook has only grown, contributing to genocidal campaigns and the promotion of dangerous falsehoods.
 
The algorithms that underpin Facebook's business were designed to maximize engagement, not filter out false or inflammatory content.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a CNN model, call it model M. It was trained on dataset A for object pose estimation. After training for 100 epochs, it resulted in these losses:
  
Train: 0.06
 Val: 0.08
  
As dataset A is somewhat limited, I wonder if I can incorporate additional data via a different, but related task: object segmentation for similar objects. Model M is a UNet, so I can incorporate this task simply with an additional output channel in the last layer. 
 I add dataset B for object segmentation. During training, M learns on both datasets quite well, which suggests to me that the tasks are well-aligned. After 100 epochs, I get these losses on dataset A:
  
Train: 0.06
 Val: 0.16
  
This is surprising to me. If I get the same training loss on dataset A, while training on additional data. I'd expect the validation loss to be lower, since I'm training on 2x the data. Yet the validation performance is consistently higher when I train on both datasets. 
 The only explanation I can think of is the double descent phenomenon. Perhaps when I trained only on dataset A, I was significantly over-parameterized, but past the interpolation threshold. So perhaps adding more data brought me closer to the interpolation threshold, leading to worse generalization.
 Does this explanation seem likely? Has anyone had similar experiences?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google's AI-driven search experience, Search Generative Experience (SGE), is now accessible to teenagers between 13-17 in America. Entailments include a conversational mode for searches, which Google believes can help youngsters pose atypical questions to dig deeper.
 For the latest advancements in AI, look here first.
 Teen-friendly AI search
  
SGE introduces a conversational mode to Google Search, allowing users to ask questions and follow-ups in a more natural language.
 To prevent harmful content from surfacing, Google has placed guardrails, providing stronger protections related to illegal and age-gated substances, or bullying.
  
Features and improving AI accuracy
  
Google is rolling out "About this result" to provide users with more context about the displayed content.
 Google acknowledges and addresses any validation of false or offensive claims by the AI-powered response, ensuring to provide higher quality and more accurate responses.
 It’s also using large language models to self-critique and rewrite draft responses on sensitive topics based on quality and safety principles.
  
SGE's popularity and future plans
  
Since SGE's introduction, it has found popularity, especially among younger users who prefer a conversational approach.
 Google plans to expand SGE outside the U.S. to India and Japan and improve its services with support for videos, images, local info, and more.
 It's also experimenting with ads positioned next to the AI-generated responses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a quick disclaimer, I know people on here think the sub is being flooded by people who arent ml engineers/researchers. I have worked at two FAANGS on ml research teams/platforms. 
 My opinion is that GPT-4 Vision/Image processing is out of science fiction. I fed chatgpt an image of a complex sql data base schema, and it converted it to code, then optimized the schema. It understood the arrows pointing between table boxes on the image as relations, and even understand many to one/many to many. 
 I took a picture of random writing on a page, and it did OCR better than has ever been possible. I was able to ask questions that required OCR and a geometrical understanding of the page layout. 
 Where is the hype on here? This is an astounding human breakthrough. I cannot believe how much ML is now obsolete as a result. I cannot believe how many computer science breakthroughs have occurred with this simple model update. Where is the uproar on this sub? Why am I not seeing 500 comments on posts about what you can do with this now? Why are there even post submissions about anything else?

 Synopsis from Fandango (mild spoilers)
 From writer/director Gareth Edwards (“Rogue One,” “Godzilla”) comes an epic sci-fi action thriller set amidst a future war between the human race and the forces of artificial intelligence. Joshua (John David Washington, "Tenet"), a hardened ex-special forces agent grieving the disappearance of his wife (Gemma Chan, "Eternals"), is recruited to hunt down and kill the Creator, the elusive architect of advanced AI who has developed a mysterious weapon with the power to end the war… and mankind itself. Joshua and his team of elite operatives journey across enemy lines, into the dark heart of AI-occupied territory… only to discover the world-ending weapon he’s been instructed to destroy is an AI in the form of a young child (newcomer Madeleine Yuna Voyles).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aryn, a team with experience in AWS big data and database services, has come out of stealth and raised $7.5M in series seed funding.
 
Their mission is to bring generative AI to OpenSearch and data preparation.
 
They aim to use generative AI models to process unstructured data for tasks such as information extraction, question-answering, summarization, and content generation.
 
Aryn's conversational search approach empowers users to interact with their unstructured enterprise data.
 
They have developed a conversational search stack consisting of a semantic data preparation system called Sycamore, semantic search with OpenSearch, and conversational capabilities in OpenSearch.
 
Generative AI powers each component of the stack, leading to higher quality answers and ease of use.
 
Developers can quickly build and deploy applications like question-answering, chatbots, and research platforms using Aryn's stack without needing expertise in AI and search.
 
Aryn's stack is 100% open source, making it accessible to developers.

A mobile phone’s camera is a powerful tool for capturing everyday moments. However, capturing a dynamic scene using a single camera is fundamentally limited. For instance, if we wanted to adjust the camera motion or timing of a recorded video (e.g., to freeze time while sweeping the camera around to highlight a dramatic moment), we would typically need an expensive Hollywood setup with a synchronized camera rig. Would it be possible to achieve similar effects solely from a video captured using a mobile phone’s camera, without a Hollywood budget?

 Spearheading the AI Universe - Meta AI Chatbot
  
The “advanced conversational assistant” is set to enhance Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram services and will be incorporated into upcoming Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and Quest 3.
 Real-time information capabilities have been bolstered through a partnership with Microsoft Bing, and image generation is powered by a new model, Emu.
  
A Galaxy of AI Personalities
  
Meta rolled out 28 AIs in beta, featuring sterling personas such as Snoop Dogg, Tom Brady, Kendall Jenner, and Naomi Osaka, thus amplifying the interactivity quotient.
  
AI Studio - Empowering Businesses
  
The AI Studio Platform is equipped to enable businesses to build AI chatbots for messaging services on Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger.
 Also, Meta will provide a sandbox tool in the upcoming year for users to experiment with creating their own AI.
  
Generative AI Stickers - A New Co-creating Experience
  
AI editing tools will allow users to edit images and co-create content with friends.
 The tool uses Llama 2 and the new image generation model, Emu, to convert text prompts into stickers in seconds.
  
Ray-Ban Smart Glasses with Meta AI
  
The Ray-Ban smart glasses are equipped with Meta AI, allowing users to receive information, incite creativity, and manage the glasses using just their voice.

 Unlike Llama 2 or other open source, we don't have access to the model weights for GPT-4, Claude or Bard, so Benchmark Evals are being run through either APIs or the chat Interface. So how do we know that the model isn't being Boosted by custom web-searching abilities or RAG? While GPT-4 might have a turnoff option, I'm pretty sure Bard is always online, being built by google. So how do we trust benchmarks? Also, have any opensource been tested after Websearch/RAG?

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become essential for solving a wide range of tasks, from standard supervised learning (image classification using ViT) to meta-learning. The most commonly-used paradigm for learning DNNs is empirical risk minimization (ERM), which aims to identify a network that minimizes the average loss on training data points. Several algorithms, including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and Adagrad, have been proposed for solving ERM. However, a drawback of ERM is that it weights all the samples equally, often ignoring the rare and more difficult samples, and focusing on the easier and abundant samples. This leads to suboptimal performance on unseen data, espe…]]></summary>

 The mission was precise: Write a prompt to yield an SAT-style multiple-choice question that rigorously tests a student's understanding of "Algebraically solving systems of 2 linear equations in 2 variables". The challenge didn't end there; the question produced had to meet the hard/difficult mark set by real SAT questions.
 Using the OpenAI Playground, we conducted incisive iterations, testing each prompt separately to mitigate any bias from prior outputs.

 The aim of this platform is two-fold:
  
Making Machine Learning accessible to anyone and not just Data Scientists or experienced software developers. By offering the possibility to design, train and test Machine Learning models directly via GUI, being an experienced software developer is no longer a pre-condition for creating ML models
 Making Machine Learning model creation, training and testing faster for experienced Data Scientists / Machine Learning Engineers. By drastically reducing the time needed to set up environments, import data and define models, Domeis allows Machine Learning practitioners to focus on trying out and compare different models/approaches.

 Our opensource library SheepRL 🐑 can be used to test whether the game dynamics is well defined: what if a player can finish the game with just a few moves? 🎮
 This video shows that our agent (Kasumi, on the left) is able to win the game in the hardest modality by standing down and throwing kicks. 🥊
 This can be helpful for a game developer to:
 ​
  
understand where and how intervene to achieve a more playful game
 
predict and correct bugs early in the game development process
 enhance the gaming experience and final product quality
 reduce time and resources spent on debugging.
  
The game has changed 🔥 and it is up to us to play it with (human + artificial) intelligence!
 Thanks to u/DIAMBRA_AIArena for the video!

 My highlights from the paper:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a beginner in Data Science. I have recently enrolled in the supervised machine learning algorithm by Andrew Ng in Coursera. I am now familiarized with linear regression, gradient descent. However, I faced a certain issue. 
 In the optional lab, there was a task to calculate the value of the cost function using gradient descent for linear regression. I wrote the code in my notebook by myself and cross checked it to be correct. However, the desired output of w,b are very much different but the cost function yields a better result in my code. Another factor, I noticed that have to scale only thex variables, leaving the values of y. I have two major queries now: 
  
Is the yielding of different w,b values fine as long as the cost function is minimum? (w is a numpy array) 
 Why do scale the x variables only? Why don't scale the y variables? 
  
Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Me and my sister have a small project we are thinking about working on. The idea is basically that we are going to enter the same prompt, separately, into an image generating a.i of some sort (Dalle2 etc) for a period of time and hopefully see the result change. We would probly pick words or frases that are topical and debated. This only works though if the a.i isnt just trained on old data and has active connection to the internet. MY question is therefor, is there an a.i right now that would fit the task?
 Sorry if the question is dumb or i didnt explain myself clearly!

The motivation for developing this package is to eliminate the risks of binary or pickle formats.

Nevertheless, it will be precious if the community utilizes this library and provides us with their feedback about improving the package's interface and prioritizing future developments. Your cooperation would be invaluable to us.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Was asked something similar to the following question in an interview for a ML role and was curious how others would answer this:
 Say you have a dataset with one feature column and one label column (with different classes). Assume this data is too large to fit into memory and could be infinite in size (e.g data is coming in as a stream). How would you train a ML model on this data to accurately predict the label?
 Followup: instead of one feature column, what if you had several thousand? How would you decide which features to use given the size of the dataset? 
 I discussed online sampling (resevoir sampling, etc) as a way to get a training dataset that could fit in memory + continually train on that but the interviewer did not seem convinced. Any thoughts?

 A search engine: We have a query comprised of both text and an image (like google image search allows text to be added to the query as well). Each search result will be a website with text and image attributes (for simplicity, webpage title and at most one image)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not sure it's the right place for this, but I was going through the proofs in the "original" 1992 technical notes of Q-learning, and a couple of points raised some questions:
 1) In the Proof of lemma B.4:
 https://preview.redd.it/7g6pputdqwqb1.png?width=1006&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe4afeac3b06deee6c80105b280a0085bdcfbe51
 where do P_{xy}^2(a_2) and R_x(a_2) come from? If we apply the definitions of Q'(x, a_1, a_2) and Q(x, a_1, a_2) to get the bound, P_{xy}^2(a_2) and R_x(a_2) should not be there. Are they just notation errors or is it correct and I'm missing something?
 ​
 2) I don't quite get how the bounds on P and R are computed in Section 3.2:
 https://preview.redd.it/p06ysjewqwqb1.png?width=962&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5929e701099dc6e4543efe7681f96f12f543fa8
 Considering the results in B.4 (i.e., the bounds for the distance between the chain's P, R and the real ones), I don't understand how they arrive at this conclusion. 
 ​
 I'd greatly appreciate any intuitions about these, or if someone can point me in the right direction :)

 I am trying to detect the 9 squares of a face of a Rubik’s Cube through a camera. The idea is that I want to use my computer camera and tell the user to show all the Rubik’s Cube faces and read the faces so I can feed it to a solver.
 Here are the steps I have tried so far:
  
Sharpened square edges
 Obtained binary image and removed noise
 Detected and extracted squares
  
Some methods I used were using different blurs and cv functions but nothing worked. Sometimes, it can get all 9 squares but sometimes it doesn't. There also seems to be a difference for different colors; for example; the model can detect green squares easier than yellow squares.
 Can anyone provide advice as to how I can detect the squares on the face?

 I’m trying to do a regression algorithm for a dataset where I have a graph for each patient I have representing a location in their brain from MRI images. Right now, I don’t have a ton of data, so I’m looking for some way to take each graph I have and get a feature vector for it to put into a regression algorithm. So for 100 patients, I have 100 graphs, I’d like to have 100 feature vectors representing each patients graph. 
 My issue is trying to find some algorithm that takes in the entire graph and outputs a single feature vector. I’ve been looking at some libraries but they all seem wildly scattered. I don’t want to grab a bunch of nose embeddings and do some elementary merge of them, like an average or sum, etc. Any help in pointing me to some Python libraries that can help me do this, or algorithms, or anything. Thank you so much.

 Am training a variational auto encoder. First I tried with batch normalization before I send the data to the network and someone probably wisely pointed out that it's not correct. If I don't use batch norm then my training fails due to numerical instability. I then tried scaling my data before hand using standard scaler from sklewrn. And now my training works. Is this reasonable?

I have to reshape my prediction data so it works with inverse_transform, but in the video he doesn't do this. If I don't reshape it I get an error, but I think when I do reshape it it messes with the data.
 The predicted values are all very similar. I've tried messing with epoch and batch sizes, and changing other metrics like prediction_days, but nothing has worked.
 This is what the prediction data looks like when plotted, and this is what it looks like when printed. Does anyone know what could be causing this?

These clones can work 24/7 and help brands sell their products without the need for human streamers.
 
Chinese startups and tech companies are offering the service of creating these deepfake avatars for a cost of around $1,000.
 
The technology has evolved over the years, with the need for training videos decreasing from 30 minutes to just one minute.
 
The AI clones can mimic the movements and speech of human streamers, making them an affordable and efficient alternative for smaller brands.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Automatic code generation has always been an integral part of programming: compilers, synthesis tools, convertors, etc. are examples of classic code generators. Now, with such powerful LLMs at hand, it is only natural to try to find new ways to generate codes. The question is: are LLMs the right tool for code generation?
 There are two sides to code generation: (1) understanding the intent (a.k.a. capturing the spec) (2) writing the code. LLMs are great for (1), but not so good for (2).
 This is an example of using LLM for general-domain code generation:
 https://github.com/RoboCoachTechnologies/GPT-Synthesizer 
 You can see that the main focus here is to properly capture the spec, and that's where LLMs shine.
 LLMs solution for a general-domain code generation may not be complete or optimized. It is always easier to break the problem and solve code generation in a specific domain. Here you can see how much better and cleaner the output of code generation can be when it is limited to a specific domain (robotics domain, ROS in particular, in this case):
 https://github.com/RoboCoachTechnologies/ROScribe
 What are your thoughts on using LLMs for code generation?

 To this end, I had the following new rule idea:
  
If it's your first time at Fight If it's your first post in this subreddit, it needs to be a link to arxiv (Or, more generally, the number of your non-arxiv posts cannot exceed the number of your arxiv posts)
 All arxiv posts must be standard links to the abstract page (to catch reposts and to connect discussions of the same paper in different subreddits)
 An arxiv post must be a paper you've read yourself, and you should post a comment describing what you liked and DIDN'T like about it (Let the airing of grievances begin! I think this will help seed the discussion, which is really the raison d'être of this subreddit)
 If the post or the comment get downvoted, they do not count.
  
What do you think? Will this help steer this subreddit in the right direction? Is this enforceable?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Generating coherent videos spanning multiple scenes from text descriptions poses unique challenges for AI. While recent progress enables creating short clips, smoothly transitioning across diverse events and maintaining continuity remains difficult.
 A new paper from UNC Chapel Hill proposes VIDEODIRECTORGPT, a two-stage framework attempting to address multi-scene video generation:
 Here are my highlights from the paper:
  
Two-stage approach: first a language model generates detailed "video plan", then a video generation module renders scenes based on the plan
 Video plan contains multi-scene descriptions, entities/layouts, backgrounds, consistency groupings - guides downstream video generation
 Video generation module called Layout2Vid trained on images, adds spatial layout control and cross-scene consistency to existing text-to-video model
 Experiments show improved object layout/control in single-scene videos vs baselines
 Multi-scene videos display higher object consistency across scenes compared to baselines
 Competitive open-domain video generation performance maintained
  
The key innovation seems to be using a large language model to plot detailed video plans to guide overall video generation. And the video generator Layout2Vid adds better spatial and temporal control through some clever tweaks. The separation of these tasks seems to matter.

 I find myself in quite a situation and could use some guidance. Recently, I introduced my professor to privateGPT and demonstrated its capabilities using a small set of college data. To my delight, he was impressed and has now tasked me with researching and developing a ChatGPT-like chatbot, but with access to our university's extensive data.
 Here's where I need your help: my professor wants this chatbot to be hosted on our university's systems due to privacy concerns, which means I can't use ChatGPT's API. I've been given access to Sol HPC, but I'm finding it quite confusing to get started.
 I'm looking for advice, tips, or any resources that can help me embark on this journey. Has anyone here worked on a similar project, or does anyone have experience with Sol HPC or building chatbots with local data sources? Any guidance or insights would be greatly appreciated!
 Thank you in advance for your help. This project means a lot to me, and I want to make sure I'm heading in the right direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OpenAI's much-touted model GPT-4, lauded for its multimodal abilities, including advanced image recognition, still has significant flaws. These glitches range from inventing facts to misinterpreting chemicals' images and hate symbols, according to a new paper from OpenAI.
 To stay ahead of AI developments, look here first.
 https://preview.redd.it/seg5x4zn3uqb1.png?width=1108&format=png&auto=webp&s=635a6c58cf6255f62d8eae3077678864e5b0e248
 Unintended GPT-4V behaviors
  
GPT-4V has a tendency to hallucinate or invent facts with unwarranted confidence.
 The model struggles to make correct inferences, sometimes creating fictional terms by wrongly combining text strings.
 It misinterprets certain symbols of hate and can give incorrect answers in the context of medical imaging.
  
OpenAI’s mitigation strategies
  
OpenAI has implemented various safeguards to prevent GPT-4V's misuse, such as breaking CAPTCHAs or using images to infer personal details.
 The company insisted that GPT-4V is not to be used for identifying dangerous chemicals from image structures.
 OpenAI acknowledged it has a long way to go in refining the model and is working on it.
  
Discrimination and bias
  
When OpenAI’s production safeguards are disabled, GPT-4V displays bias against certain sexes and body types.
 The paper reported offensive responses related to body positivity when prompted by an image of a woman in a bathing suit.

 This means my data has 208 features (200 for the grid cubes being on/off, 7 for the "next shape" box, and 1 for the labeled best move.
 I currently have 9460 labeled samples and have done some preliminary fitting here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/conlan/tetris-ai?scriptVersionId=144388350 with a highest f1_macro score of 0.431090.
 Does anyone have suggestions for which direction to take from here to improve? Currently I see:
  
Collect More Data
 Tune Hyperparameters
 Rework Features
  
I'm hesitant to rework the features as that would require telling the model more specifics and would like to keep it abstract, but maybe 200 is crazy high? Or maybe <10k samples is too low and I should just keep collecting data?
 Thanks in advance!

I had a paragraph of information for one of my classes that I wanted it to make more straightforward for me before I actually went to class the next day. I spent like 30 minutes trying to get it to do that and eventually just ended up giving up. Why dont language models feel as sharp as they did say a year ago? I wish I had more examples to share.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all – I’m new to this sub-Reddit, so hopefully I’m in the right place.
 I am working on an audio production that will span multiple episodes and hopefully multiple seasons. It will require many characters, ranging in gender, age, ethnicity, etc. I am a decent voice actor and can do many of the roles myself, but some of them I cannot fake using my voice alone.
 My budget is very limited, so I was hoping to find some type of software I can change my voice for the production. This can be during the recording process, or after recording… As long as it gets the job done, and makes me sound like someone else entirely. 
 Does anybody know of a software that can achieve this? Most of the software I found either specifically designed to change users voice on the spot and is aimed at gamers changing your voice for live streams or in-game chats. I’m also on a Mac, which I know will be limiting.
 I’m having a hard time finding something I can use. Any suggestions will be helpful. 
 Thank you!
 EDIT: To clarify, I don’t want to just change my voice to sound different in general. I want to specifically sound like a woman, an elder man, or someone of a different ethnic background. Those are just a few examples.

I spend most of my time working in python , rust, and now mojo. Not an expert yet but my coding skills are improving. I have no degree and have taught myself most of what I know. That part is why Im looking for advice from you all. Practically every job post Ive seen has college requirements. Is it unlikely to get hired without a degree?
 Additional information: I'm currently working on projects for github but those arent quite done. My main interest is related to RL in game design. Applications of distributional RL in action dense environments and VR. Currently using Godot engine the most and have used pytorch, openai gym, and tensorflow (to a lesser degree). The abstract concepts of neural networks comes easy to me and Ive been following basic neurology as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ood morning everyone,
 I am currently reading the book of Mr. Burkov: Machine Learning Engineering. He talk about a step that might be helpful before training a ML model: Feature Scaling. Furthermore, he adds that before Feature Scaling, you might do Feature Transformation (Log, Square,...) in order to make your data look normal and have better models. How true do you think this statement is? Do you also transform your feature, and then scale them? How often do you do it? It is important for Regression or SVM, but do you do it also for other black box algorithms such as Random Forests? What are the best practices according to you?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit: I may be jumping the gun here but I think I figured it out (looks good so far). I give the episode reward for every action EXCEPT the "end early" action, now I will need to give some boost for shorter episodes to achieve the desired effect :) 
 I feel like I'm experiencing déjà vu, posing another DQN-related question. But, here's my issue:
 I've set up an environment where an agent can interact for 40 steps or choose to end the interaction early with a specific action. The catch is that the reward is only given at the end of the episode, which seems to be leading the agent to strongly favor the "end early" action. Despite all other steps getting a reward of 0, I assumed the long-term reward estimate, V(s_{t+1}), would mitigate this, but the agent still heavily gravitates towards ending the episode early.
 Attempted Solutions:
  
Distributed the end-of-episode reward across all prior actions taken by the agent.
  
Considering:
  
Replacing the "end early" action with a "do nothing" action, allowing the episode to always play out in full. However, this seems like it could introduce additional computational costs and noise.
  
Has anyone encountered a similar problem? I'd appreciate any advice or recommendations.

However, let's entertain the hypothetical situation where the insurrection following the 2020 U.S. presidential election had succeeded, with the understanding that this is speculative reasoning.
 In this alternate reality, the immediate consequences would be a constitutional crisis of unprecedented proportions. Faith in democratic institutions would be severely eroded, both domestically and internationally. Trump's retaining power in this manner would spark widespread protests, perhaps more intense and larger than those seen in the summer of 2020. The unrest would likely lead to a governmental response that could be more authoritarian, poss…]]></summary>

 and that the add is separate. this is in the official openai github and is relatively easy to read:https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/blob/master/src/model.py#L123-L130 (thx KingsmanVince)

 for some reason all the online materials are saying that there is a full norm layer before the mlp instead of inside of it

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The European Union is urging the implementation of more safeguards against the risks posed by generative AI tools to free and fair debate in democratic societies, especially during elections.
 
The EU's values and transparency commissioner has highlighted the potential threat of AI-generated disinformation to elections and called for platforms to be vigilant and provide efficient safeguards.
 
Mainstream platforms have made initial efforts to address the risks by implementing safeguards to inform users about the synthetic origin of content posted online.
 
The EU commissioner is meeting with representatives from OpenAI to discuss the issue.
 
An incoming pan-EU AI regulation, the EU AI Act, is expected to make user disclosures a legal requirement for generative AI technologies.
 
The EU's voluntary anti-disinformation Code has 44 signatories, including major social media and search platforms, as well as entities from the ad industry and civil society organizations.
 
Google, one of the signatories, has published a report discussing the social impacts of AI and its commitment to developing technology responsibly.
 
Google Search has published guidance on AI-generated content and plans to integrate new innovations in watermarking, metadata, and other techniques into its generative models.
 
The EU's Code of Practice on Disinformation is seen as a stop-gap measure until the EU AI Act is adopted and mandatory deepfake disclosures are enforced.

 Distribute voice recognition, TTS, audio2face, LLM, and rendering across 2 or 3 machines to create a realistic virtual human (suggestions for excellent TTS would be appreciated)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I learned about DeepNash and R-NaD yesterday. I read the Deepmind article, Science paper, and the source code of rnad.py. But I don't think I understand it! Part of this is that they didn't define all the terms and Greek they use in the paper, and part of it is that I don't have academic ML experience.
 Below is my attempt to summarize the paper in non-academic terms. I'm trying to show that I did my homework, and also I'm trying to invoke Godwin's Law in the hopes that someone will come along and correct me.
 Here goes:
 Naïve reinforcement learning doesn't work with simultaneous choice games such as matching pennies or Rock-Paper-Scissors.
 In naïve RL, If I choose Rock as my move, my opponent chooses Scissors as their move, and I see that I won, that will reinforce a belief that Rock is a "good" move and Scissors is a "bad" move. But this isn't true!
 This means that, during selfplay, a naïve RL agent will just cycle through strategies, as the timestep-(τ_n) agent learns how to beat the timestep-(τ_n-1) agent. The agent will never learn that RPS is a game about staying unpredictable!
 R-NaD fixes this by adjusting the reward function. I think "regularizing" is ML-academic speak for "adjusting". It adjusts the reward function in such a way that the agent will converge at a Nash equilibrium strategy.
 The paper's equation (1) describes how the regularization works. They didn't explain all the terms, though. I still don't know what a_i represents. But I think it corresponds to parts of the code like this line and this line.
 The key is that we're merging policies from multiple epochs and making sure that the current agent's move probabilities fare well against not only itself, but also against its previous two generations. They've proven that three generations is all you need to eventually converge to a Nash equilibrium.
 So... that's my understanding. Does anyone with actual ML experience want to weigh in?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Researchers from Microsoft have just proposed using a psychological assessment tool called the Defining Issues Test (DIT) to evaluate the moral reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, ChatGPT, etc.
 The DIT presents moral dilemmas and has subjects rate and rank the importance of various ethical considerations related to the dilemma. It allows quantifying the sophistication of moral thinking through a P-score.
 In this new paper, the researchers tested prominent LLMs with adapted DIT prompts containing AI-relevant moral scenarios.
 Key findings:
  
Large models like GPT-3 failed to comprehend prompts and scored near random baseline in moral reasoning.
 ChatGPT, Text-davinci-003 and GPT-4 showed coherent moral reasoning with above-random P-scores.
 Surprisingly, the smaller 70B LlamaChat model outscored larger models in its P-score, demonstrating advanced ethics understanding is possible without massive parameters.
 The models operated mostly at intermediate conventional levels as per Kohlberg's moral development theory. No model exhibited highly mature moral reasoning.
  
I think this is an interesting framework to evaluate and improve LLMs' moral intelligence before deploying them into sensitive real-world environments - to the extent that a model can be said to possess moral intelligence (or, seem to possess it?).
 Here's a link to my full summary with a lot more background on Kohlberg's model (had to read up on it since I didn't study psych). Full paper is here

Have someone tried ? Is there some weights in the nature already trained for the instructor model ?
 I have found the GitHub associated with the paper but it obviously only contain the code for training but no information about approximate token used or anything like that.

 OWL-ViT is a new object detection model from the team at Google Research. It allows you to identify an object in one image (the “query image”) and then find that same object in any number of target images.

I’ve decided to make it a classification problem and predict the zone of rainfall as in 0-0.5 in inches or 1-1.5 inches. My data set has ~40,000 samples however i have noticed that 24,000 of them have 0.0 as the amount of rainfall. And a high percentage of the rest are very low like below 0.5 inch. I’m wondering if there’s still a way to create the type of model I had originally intended or not. Is there a way to reduce the size of my data set , specifically the amount of low values without losing important feature information? Thank you and any help is appreciated :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, long story short, I've used Otter.ai for recording, and transcribing my ideas on the fly and it's really, really good!
 The only thing it is missing for my use case is to be able to edit the transcripts (remove some parts for example) and then have that piece be removed from the audio file as well, so you can see how long is the actual useful part that.. I also need it to have an app, since the whole point of doing this is catching ideas that just rush to my head. Apparently DeScribe has this option, but I haven't tried it and it doesn't work on mobile anyways. 
 I know it's probably not available, but does anyone know any services similar to this? I don't need an AI bot, don't care about integration with other apps, and will not use it for meetings. 
 TLDR: I just want an app to be able to record, and then transcribe my ideas, and then allow me to edit/fine-tune the transcript and have the audio file be edited in the same way as well..
 Thanks!

 Errors in object detection examples found via cleanlab.
 Annotators of real-world object detection datasets often make such errors and many other mistakes. To avoid training models on erroneous data and save QA teams significant time, you can now use automated algorithms invented by our scientists.
 Our newest paper introduces Cleanlab Object Detection: a novel algorithm to assess label quality in any object detection dataset and catch errors (named ObjectLab for short). Extensive benchmarks show Cleanlab Object Detection identifies mislabeled images with better precision/recall than other approaches. When applied to the famous COCO dataset, Cleanlab Object Detection automatically discovers hundreds of mislabeled images, including errors where annotators mistakenly: overlooked an object that should’ve had a bounding box, sloppily drew a box in a poor location, or chose the wrong class label for an annotated object.
 We’ve open-sourced one line of code to find errors in any object detection dataset via Cleanlab Object Detection, which can utilize any existing object detection model you’ve trained. 
 For those interested, you can check out the 5-minute tutorial to get started and the blog to read the details.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on my thesis and want to perform 3D scene understanding and VQA. My scenes would be textured meshes (or pointclouds). My goal is not only to know the objects present in the scene but also the spatial relationships between them, like chair is in front of the couch, bottle is on the table etc. I want to know if there is a 3D scene encoder like the 2D image encoder ViT L/14 from CLIP. 
 My search hasn't resulted much yet in this direction, but I have come across papers that render a 3D scene in multiple angles and then use 2D scene encoders on them. 
 So I'd like to ask the community: 
  
Are there 3D scene encoders like CLIP ViT 
 If not, is there's any other way that I can approach this problem.

 AIRI researchers are thrilled to share some exciting news with you all. Our paper, "StyleDomain: Efficient and Lightweight Parameterizations of StyleGAN for One-shot and Few-shot Domain Adaptation", has been accepted to ICCV 2023! 🥳
  
Abstract: Domain adaptation of GANs is a problem of fine-tuning GAN models pretrained on a large dataset (e.g., StyleGAN) to a specific domain with few samples (e.g., painting faces, sketches, etc.). While there are many methods that tackle this problem in different ways, there are still many important questions that remain unanswered. In this paper, we provide a systematic and in-depth analysis of the domain adaptation problem of GANs, focusing on the StyleGAN model. We perform a detailed exploration of the most i…]]></summary>

The human brain is perhaps the most computationally complex machine in existence, consisting of networks of billions of cells. Researchers currently don’t understand the full picture of how glitches in its network machinery contribute to mental illnesses and other diseases, such as dementia. However, the emerging connectomics field, which aims to precisely map the connections between every cell in the brain, could help solve that problem. While maps have only been created for simpler organisms, technological advances for mapping even larger brains can enable us to understand how the human brain works, and how to treat brain diseases.

 For example Im in the process of switching jobs and one of the things I’ve learnt is that when delivering results (during fire drills) the way I write my code is focused on simply getting the results out vs being organized, efficient and scalable. While I get from point A to point B the way I get from point A to point B is not the most efficient. I think something I can do is take a step back and take a top down approach to problem solving when I enter my new role.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Training giant AI models like GPT-3 requires large resources - thousands of GPUs running for months. As a solo researcher without access to that kind of scale, I can't easily reproduce experiments and findings from papers on huge models.
 But a new paper from DeepMind shows you can recreate and study training instabilities seen in massive models by using small ones.
 The key is increasing the learning rate:
  
This reproduces "attention collapse" where the model focuses on just a few tokens, like overfitting.
 Also can reproduce "logit divergence" where output values drift unstably.
  
These issues have been reported when scaling up to billions of params. The cool part is techniques that fix them for giant models also work for small models:
  
qk-layernorm prevents attention collapse.
 Adding a "z-loss" term stops logit divergence.
  
Some other highlights from the paper include:
  
Longer warmup helps stability, especially for bigger models.
 Decoupling LR and weight decay improves stability.
 Depth increases sensitivity much faster than width.
 Can predict upcoming issues from scaling trends.
 Default epsilon hurts at large scale.
  
If the authors are right, one more tool that lets researchers study and even help train giant models without Google-size resources. Small models can guide large model development, sort of like how you can build a scale train set to study and improve how a railroad system works... for a lot less money than starting your own railroad company, buying land, building real tracks, etc.

 This partnership is the first public milestone for Keen Technologies, following its initial funding announcement in August of 2022. The initial $20M round was led by Nat Friedman, Danial Gross, Patrick Collision, Tobi Lutke, Jim Keller, Sequoia Capital, and Capital Factory. In December 2022, Carmack departed as consulting CTO at Meta to focus his efforts on AGI.
 Sutton is the principal founder of the field of reinforcement learning. His work with Keen Technologies advances previously announced research priorities to understand basic computational intelligence. Through this work, documented in part in The Alberta Plan, Sutton seeks to understand and create long-lived computation agents that interact with a vastly more complex world and come to predict and control their sensory input signals.

I understand that modern ML is going in the opposite low-precision direction, but I still think that it may be useful to have this functionality at least for some prototyping and development of concepts.
 The double-double approach to the evaluation of quads represents an FP128 number as an unevaluated sum of two double numbers (like 1 and 1e-17 - the second one is smaller than 1 ULP of the first one).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TYPO IN THE TITLE: I wanted the title to be "why should neural networks be end-to-end?" My lazy ass was swipe texting on my phone and this typo happened. FML
 Especially in robotics, there's been a lot of research for end-to-end neutral networks where an image is the input and the control action is the output, for say, tasks like pick an object and place it somewhere. I feel this is very restrictive while developing such a solution because it tightly couples the "control" network to the "estimation" network. This reduces modularity in building the solution, i.e., if I find a better controller architecture (machine learning based or rule based) I'm unable to use that for the task I'm solving. Moreover it seems like the generalizability of this task suffers because training this network to do this task may make it very good at only doing that specific task and the explainability of the decision making goes out of the window because it is black box. Additionally doesn't more parameters mean requiring more data to train the model? I don't see much use from such network architectures. However, I do see the applications in machine translation where you simply train the encoder and decoder to the target language at the same time with a single loss function. It seems useful there, but maybe not so much in robotics.
 Can someone tell me their thoughts on end-to-end architectures? Let's have a healthy discussion
 Edit: typo

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a project that I think AI might be able to help with.
 I have access to thousands of vintage postage stamps which also have cancelation stamps from when they were mailed. I'm thinking of publishing a book, and I want to create clean reproductions of the stamp designs without the cancelation marks.
 If I train AI on high resolution scans of 10 to 40 identical stamps, is there a tool that can look for commonalities within the patterns and then remove conflicting artifacts (cancelation stamps, tears, and smudges)? I'm aiming for a 400% enlargement that shows off clean and accurate detail. 
 What tools would I need? I’d prefer not to upload these scans to the web. Are there downloadable tools available? I’m technologically savvy and very experienced in graphic design software but have no experience in coding.
 All of this can be done manually in Photoshop, of course. But with thousands of stamp designs, I’d like to automate as much as I can.
 Thanks in advance for any insights!

However, this belief is misguided as AI is a new and potentially dangerous situation that requires careful consideration.
 
The author argues that AI is an evolutionary process that humans don't fully understand and cannot control.
 
The latest developments in AI, such as large language models and deepfakes, are causing anxiety and raising questions about the future implications of this technology.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[this is mostly a cross-post from r/rust as my initial attempt failed because of some external links
 We've first announced Candle, a minimalist ML framework in Rust 6 weeks ago. Since then we've focused on adding various recent models and improved the framework so as to support the necessary features in an efficient way. You can checkout a gallery of the examples, supported models include:
  
Large language models: LLaMA, LLaMA v2, Falcon, Phi-v1.5, StarCoder.
 Quantized models with the llama.cpp approach: LLaMA, T5, Phi-v1.5.
 Image generation: Stable Diffusion, Wuerstchen.
 Computer Vision: DINOv2, yolo-v3, yolo-v8, Segment-Anything Model.
 Text-to-speech: Whisper.
  
One of the big upside of the pure Rust approach is that models can run directly in the browser using WASM, these can be accessed through this collection, you can try out Yolo, Whisper, Segment-Anything, T5, Llama2-c from your web browser.
 Finally, in order to present a use case where Candle has unique capabilities, we've built a quantized version of the recently released Phi-v1.5 LLM. You can try it out with the following command, this uses a q4k quantized model resulting in very fast inference on CPU while still producing pretty nice texts.
 $ cargo run --example phi --release -- \ --prompt "Explain how to find the median of an array and write the corresponding python function.\nAnswer:" \ --quantized --sample-len 200 Explain how to find the median of an array and write the corresponding python function. Answer: The median is the middle value in an array. If the array has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle values. def median(arr): arr.sort() n = len(arr) if n % 2 == 0: return (arr[n//2 - 1] + arr[n//2]) / 2 else: return arr[n//2] 
 It's still very early days for Candle so please let us know if you start using it and run into some rough edges. We look forward to Rust getting a lot more usage in the ML space!

 The authors claim the computational advantage of their approach is partly the simple architecture. 
 Looking at figure 3 and 4, I cannot quite see why this is considered a simpler architecture to older GANs,say DCGAN. I get the technical argument that the generator only has one convolutional layer, but figure 3 has lots of up sampling layers, and the discriminator has plenty of downsampling layers. So why is this considered a simple GAN model? 
 Any pointers appreciated.

These interns, recruited from vocational schools, face poor working conditions and subminimum wages.
 
Recent regulations require employers to pay interns minimum wage and prohibit schools from assigning repetitive work.
 
Tech giants like Baidu have partnered with vocational schools to create data annotation internships in less-developed regions, backed by local governments.
 
The exploitation of student interns in China's AI industry raises concerns about labor rights and fair compensation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First of all anyone offended by that question - heartiest apology. I am using it myself profusely at the moment. The reason for me asking this question, over last few weeks / months, I have been gradually educating myself in machine learning using Tensorflow and have been able to train multiple models using only one of the model zoo candidates. All the other pre trained models have failed me so far.
 I went onto Tensorflow official forum / Stackoverflow / Tensorflow github with specific error messages that I am getting on Ubuntu with Nvidia card / Mac M2 and there has been absolute radio silence in response to multiple posts over last month. Found many open issues listed since 2020 on the same line as mine i.e. identical error messages that people have come across.
 Finally after about a month of being on TF forum, I direct messaged an official TF2 dev who kindly responded with answers. I haven't succeeded yet with any of the pre trained model from the official section. Only one model from research section is working so far for me i.e. Faster_rcnn_resnet_50_640x640 ..
 Thus the question. Kindly help me enlighten myself with where is this thing headed. Should I consider switching to Pytorch or some alternative ? If yes what alternatives do you recommend ? TIA

Recently I had even worse experiences with newly-released ChatGPT 3.5 fine-tuning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As software projects grow, changing code across entire repositories becomes tedious & error-prone. Tasks like migrating APIs or updating dependencies require complex edits across files. I explored a new approach from Microsoft Research to automate these "repository-level" coding challenges with AI.
 Their new paper proposes CodePlan - an AI system that breaks repository tasks into incremental steps guided by planning & analysis.
 Key points:
  
Uses LLMs like GPT-3 for localized code edits
 Maintains validity across repository via incremental analysis
 Adaptively plans multi-step changes based on code dependencies
 Significantly outperformed baselines on API migration & temporal edits
 Automated tasks across 168 file C# codebase
 2-3x more accurate edit locations than baselines
 Produced final valid codebases, unlike reactive approaches
  
The core insight is combining LLM strengths with rigorous planning based on dependency analysis. This automates interdependent code changes that naive LLM use struggles with (I personally have these kinds of issues all the time with GPT4 - lack of context about the entirety of the repo/how files fit together).
 I think CodePlan demonstrates AI can expand beyond small coding assists into large-scale engineering tasks. Planning + LLMs > LLMs alone. This could really improve productivity and code quality... at least for me :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I made a FOSS baby sleep tracking system. The system tracks wake/sleep status, and informs the user when their baby is likely to need a nap next. But it stopped working as soon as my baby started sleeping on his stomach, and started using blankets. The original version relied on anatomical features being visible.
 This version delivers the ability to train a blank slate SVM binary classifier on pictures of a user's baby, making it extremely biased (and resilient) to the custom behaviors the user's baby exhibits (blanket covering baby, teddy bear/other objects in crib, etc.). All generated data stays on your machine, nothing leaves the LAN.
 Video: https://youtu.be/8i0wHA_knKc?si=uhA4PpOYP0jMKLz1
 For obvious reasons I didn't have a dataset of babies sleeping.. so I wrapped a python/flask service with a React app which lets a user press a button to train the model w/ a new image from the camera's live stream. Then this model is invoked over time (+ other heuristics) to determine whether your baby is present and sleeping.
 I believe it works better than $300+ systems sold on the market, open sourced it: https://github.com/calebolson123/BabySleepCoach
 ​
 I'm thinking a fun next step for this project could be to apply privateGPT on the feature-engineered sleep records for a true "Sleep Coach"

 Given the rapid advancements in the field of AI, the next few months are going to be pivotal. One of the pressing priorities is addressing ethical concerns. As algorithms become more pervasive, making sure they don't perpetuate biases or make unethical decisions is critical. That's not just a "good to have"; it's foundational. We can't build trust in AI systems unless we tackle this head-on.
 Another biggie is interpretability. Black-box models are potent, sure, but they're not very useful if no one can understand how they're making decisions. This has real-world implications—think medical diagnoses or judicial systems. So, there's a strong push towards making AI more transparent and understandable, not just for experts but for everyone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Wikipedia page on Diffusion Models has been pretty minimal for an entire year. I feel like it should be fixed, so I fixed it finally. It strikes me odd that such a hot topic has such atrociously bad Wikipedia. I feel duty-bound to educate the near-future AI, since they'll be reading Wikipedia for the next few years at least.
 Currently I think it's mostly complete, but I still don't understand the mathematical details of DDIM (I tried reading the paper and could not understand it), or generally how it is possible to sample without noise. This is a serious problem since as far as I see most of practical diffusion models use deterministic sampling, and they are all based on the same principle as DDIM.
 If anyone could explain simply what DDIM is really doing that would be great. I understand part of the paper: that they constructed an entire family of distributions over trajectories that has the same two-point marginals.
 I also haven't got much in the section on Examples. If you think there are some interesting examples of Diffusion Models, please comment below.

After every 25000 TIMESTEPS, I will save my model in the models folder. When I train continuously, everything goes well, I can see it on the tensorboard graph. But when I continue training a model that has been trained, the graph suddenly drops. In the image below you can see that I retrain the models at SAC\_75000 and SAC\_100000 and SAC\_125000. The graph continuously decreases at those thresholds.I think something happended Can you give me a reason or share something with me? Thanks in advance.

I was unaware so much was going on in the space. I am CEO of an AI startup, we have a compassionate AI. Most of the alignment focus out there is on superintelligence, little out there focuses on building modern day Ai that benefits humans. That’s been my focus for 17 years when I dreamed up what was possible and sent a proposal to executives at the mfaang corporation I was working at. I found out back then business doesn’t give a rats ass about Ai that actively makes its users life’s better. Well now I have proof that customers care. I’m hoping to find some resources on Ai alignment groups, conferences, more books etc. I’ll need to hire skilled ml engineers who do give a rats ass. Compassionate Ai isn’t just feel good tech. It would be good to do some networking. AI alignment doesn’t have to wait for AGI and super intelligence. It can and should be a focus today. My startup is proving it. Hoping to find a conference to network and share our research.

 ML is often portrayed as a magical field where anyone with a laptop and Python skills can build amazing AI systems. 
 The reality is less democratic: mastering ML requires gritty, systematic work best learned through formal training. You need rock solid foundations in math, programming, and core concepts—skills acquired through advanced education, which (almost always) is beyond self-taught hackers. 
 Most think a PhD is unnecessary, but the reality is that advanced degrees provide the deepest training. Patience and persistence do matter, but a PhD gives you a 10-year head start over weekend warriors. The hype overlooks the work and education needed to excel. This article has a great blueprint of all the required skills to become a ML Engineer (in the CV field).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So briefly about my current experience, I graduated 2 years ago with a bachelor in data science and I have 2-3 years of experience as a data scientist/ml engineer/software engineer.
 So I’ve got competing offers, one from the big 4 accounting firms as a software systems engineer - AI/ML (Big 4) and the other as a machine learning engineer. The startup salary is higher while big 4 is lower. Additionally the startup isn’t necessarily a unicorn it’s a relatively small startup with an interesting product but it doesn’t necessarily blow me away. The salary at the startup is 15 percent higher that that of the big 4 offer. For those wondering I did already negotiate the salary and they did increase it marginally. 
 I am conflicted because I think that the big 4 jobs will have
 1) more career growth 2) more potential future opportunities and 3) more networking potential
 Is this an accurate assessment? Which is the best job to take for maximum future potential?

This is a wonderful sub, and it's hard to please everyone on SUCH a broad topic... but it's intriguing to think about, as a lifelong magazine fan (and websites of course) - about using AI to filter, craft and create an amazing website/magazine ABOUT AI - well-categorized, maybe also human/editor curated/tweaked, but as fresh as ... well, the artificial sub but out of the Reddit bold/design into something ... well, something I'd read, visit a lot and love to help make work as a writer/editor (on the side of my "real" all-consuming gig of course;-)
 After all, if AI can 'make great code'/create great websites, maybe some folks out there are already trying to make this happen, for ease of information availability and organization. I can picture the departments/sections/categories now - I bet you can too!
 Anyone gone very far down that road yet (maybe the folks already doing the PC Magazines of the world) of organizing the vast fast-moving info beyond the AI Brews, Ben Parr's AI Analyst, etc.? Fun or a life-long journalist and tech geek (but not a coder, gamer etc.) to think about, at least!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been having a bit of an existential crisis as of late and wanted to ask for advice on how to move forward.
 I have a Master’s in CS with research experience and a few publications applying machine learning in a fairly niche area (So not novel from the ML side). Since graduating, I’ve worked ~2 years as an ML engineer in small company(Niche area, different than research).
 I’ve done quite well here and have played a critical role in taking several big greenfield projects to completion. 
 Most of my work is framing problems, understanding what’s possible with current research, then building the data pipelines, and training models(with small mods here and there). My main worry is that I might be approaching a point where there won’t be any more problems I’m capable of solving here. I’d imagine I’d hit the same wall at any future company with my current skill set.
 I’d like to continue working in CV/Graphics/Perception if possible, but I’d also like to be realistic about the competitiveness of this particular subfield and my general ability.
 I’ve been trying to up-skill and am struggling to self study MVG by Hartley and Zisserman. I’m also looking into OMCS to review low-level programming - maybe I can transition to optimizing ml/cv algorithms?
 It hit me recently that I don’t really know what to study/what I’d benefit from learning. Hence this post. Any advice would be most appreciated!

 Big tech companies are investing vast amounts of money to develop general models on which others will build. They'll develop interfaces to make it easier for others to fine-tune on top of their models. So that there will be less and less of a need for ML engineers that know how to create a deep learning model in Pytorch, and more and more of a need for data engineers that simply plug into pre-trained models. An AI assistant will also be quicker at coding up a more bespoke AI model for a companies needs, guided by data engineers.
 What do people think? Is this a scenario that they think will play out? Where will the demand for AI skills be coming from in the future?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LLMs are great with words but can't handle visual tasks like understanding images. Teaching them to use visual tools could make them much more capable.
 A new paper introduces GPT4Tools - a method to efficiently teach existing LLMs to invoke tools for visual tasks without proprietary data.
 My highlights from the paper:
  
Uses ChatGPT as a "teacher" to generate instructional data for other LLMs
 Fine-tunes LLMs like Vicuna on this data using selective weight tuning (keeps base model frozen)
 Allows smaller 13B LLM to match 175B GPT-3.5 on seen tools after tuning
 Data augmentation with negative/context samples was found to be the secret sauce to get this to work
 Can generalize to brand new visual tools in a zero-shot way
  
This is big because it shows we may not need hyper-expensive training of massive models to impart visual capabilities to LLMs. They seem to be generalizable enough that they can be taught to work with images. Some examples shown include counting objects or segmenting items in pictures using other tools.
 With this approach, existing models can be made multi-modal! Pretty cool.

 I have created a 3d model with mujoco (I have the xml file) how do I create an environment in gymnasium with this xml file?
 for the sake of an example let's say I have the xml file of the humanoid model how do I load this in gymnasium so that I could train it to walk? (this is just an example because the current project is harder to explain, but will use the humanoid model in the project)
 or is the approach that I'm trying is not appropriate at all? I came across this stackoverflow post where they say mujoco is itself good for this but was hard for me to understand due to lack of examples.
 would really appreciate some advice and guidance

I've run into some trouble though in finding a program that can accurately recreate the character. Does anyone know what app or website I could use for this, or am I coming at this all wrong?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just open-sourced (MIT License) semantic segmentation annotation tool powered by segment-anything model that I used for a while in my projects. Hopefully it will help someone as it seems to me that it is more suitable for small projects than popular huge web based annotation tools.
 Link to the project: SAMAT (any feedback in Discussions section on GitHub is appreciated)
 Features:
  
Brush annotation (opposed to polygons)
 Magic Wand (like in Photoshop) powered by segment-anything masks (it is optional, if you don’t have cool GPU to prepare masks)
  
samat showcase
 Why yet another annotation tool?
 Before starting this project I tried supervisely, segments.ai, roboflow and several others, but found them not convenient for my tasks.
 Their cons, I tried to fix with my tool:
  
Latency: they are web based, hence burden with irritating latency during labeling (SAMAT is snappy because it is a local desktop app)
 Complicated: too much features, hence overloaded UI (SAMAT is just a colored brush)
  
P.S. there is another labeling tool called SALT on github which also uses segment-anything model, but it follows different approach to UI/UX, may be it will be more suitable for you, so take a look at it too.

 Abstract: In this research, we explore the efficacy and potential of Generative AI models, specifically focusing on their application in role-playing simulations exemplified through Spyfall, a renowned mafia-style game. By leveraging GPT-4's advanced capabilities, the study aimed to showcase the model's potential in understanding, decision-making, and interaction during game scenarios. Comparative analyses between GPT-4 and its predecessor, GPT-3.5-turbo, demonstrated GPT-4's enhanced adaptability to the game environment, with significant improvements in posing relevant questions and forming human-like responses.

 I've listened to the entire lecture and am now going through these slides and I didn't understand the solution provided for the choices above in the image.
 So far I understand it like this. Noise basically means that the agent will not always do the action that you say. You say left and it will go left only 50% of the time. it will choose other actions randomly.
 so, Why is the answer to the (c) and (d) questions (2) and (3) respectively?
 I understand the learning rate but not how risking the cliff is affected by the noise.

Every explanation of the hyperplane state that all the points which are orthogonal to the vector w are in the hyperplane. However, all data point coordinates are defined wrt origin. So in order to attain this objective, we define the hyperplane as :
 wx = c
 This vector w is the vector which is normal to the hyperplane. And the data points x when dot producting with w outputting c are the points which are in the hyperplane due to the coordinates representation of x wrt origin.
 So points in the hyperplane are the points which when performing dot product with w equals 0 when the coordinates is defined wrt origin that lie in the hyperplane is equivalent to the points which when performing dot product with w equals c when the coordinates is defined wrt original origin (0) or (0,0) or ...

 I have a fairly good understanding of how LLMs work under the hood, the attention mechanism, the different architectures and so on. However most of that knowledge takes the backseat in practical cases, especially in the industry. Are there any resources which discuss practical LLM engineering and the challenges that come with it? I'm talking about everything from fine-tuning to dealing with tokenisation limit to optimising the vectorDB and so on?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a potential school project, im currently exploring whether or not some of the success the transformer architecture has had in seq-to-seq applications and high-dimensional pattern recognition could be extended to certain (online) RL problems (mainly those with high dimensional environment as well as long-term planning). 
 This could be done by using an augmented transformer as a function approximator, probably in combination with a SOTA online-rl algorithm (such as PPO, but if you know something that generally performs better do tell). Due to some of the problems associated with highly complex models and sample efficiency, I also thought about training the model using imitation learning first (which should be no problem with policy gradient methods afaik, though some slight adjustments would have to be made). For context, I'm thinking on benchmarking the approach using AlphaStar unplugged.
 However, when looking at current literature, only very few papers directly use transformers this way. Transformers seem to be very sample efficient and to generalize very well, but they are still only really used in a purely offline context (sometimes without directly using RL-techniques, such as with the Decision Transformer). And, if they are used in an online context, then only in some really intricate combination with other models (such as in AlphaStar). 
 Is there a reason why the approach I am currently considering is not popular in literature? Thank you very much.

 I'm thinking maybe I need to use my phone to record my voice and pass it into tortoise but I'm not sure of how to get the wav files from my phone at the recommended quality.
 Has anybody had really good luck getting tortoise to mimic you very closely?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using LGBM for regression, where the Target column's lagged values (7 columns for each lag day) are also used as predictors when training the model. Absence of the 7Day lag values severely increases MAE value.
 Now when using the model in production, if I use the complete data as training dataset, how to get the 7day lag value of the time period I'm planning to predict? I obviously won't have the target value, to calculate it's 7Day lag value. What to do now?
 To explain in more detail:
 So, I'm predicting sales amount (Target variable y). The model is trained on 20 predictors (X), and 7 of them are the lag value of the Target Variable, i.e. Sales Amount.
 The thing is, while preparing the model, I had access to both X & y dataset, thus I could easily calculate Y's Lag values.
 Now, when predicting for future timestamps, I won't be having y. So how do I calculate the lag values, which is required in the trained model's predictor columns now?

 Abstract:
  
Large language models (LLMs) often demonstrate inconsistencies with human preferences. Previous research gathered human preference data and then aligned the pre-trained models using reinforcement learning or instruction tuning, the so-called finetuning step. In contrast, aligning frozen LLMs without any extra data is more appealing. This work explores the potential of the latter setting. We discover that by integrating self-evaluation and rewind mechanisms, unaligned LLMs can directly produce responses consistent with human preferences via self-boosting. We introduce a novel inference method, Rewindable Auto-regressive INference (RAIN), that allows pre-trained LLMs to evaluate their own generation and use the evaluation results to guid…]]></summary>

LLMs have shown emergent abilities and can be used as aids to brainstorming.
 
GPT-4, an LLM, has been found to beat humans in creativity tests.
 
In an experiment, GPT-4 generated more, cheaper, and better ideas for a product than human students.
 
A professional working with GPT-4 can generate ideas at a rate of about 800 ideas per hour, making them 40 times more productive than a human working alone.
 
This technology is seen as a potential tool for corporations, similar to management consulting firms like McKinsey & Company.

I currently have 2 potential sources of primary data: PDBbind and CrossDocked2020. This would provide the protein-ligand structures. 
 PDBbind is a more robust and higher quality dataset from what I know, and easier to work with. The problem is that it only contains about 20,000 complexes, and I'm not sure if that is enough for training a transformer. CrossDocked2020 contains millions of entries but I'm not sure about the quality and ease of use. 
 Another dilemma is that I need/want to use a multi-task learning approach where the model is also being trained on bioactivity data, not just the structural information. This would require supplementation from sources like PubChem, ChEMBL, BDB, etc. and then I would need to align the data so it all matches up. 
 If anyone can provide some guidance I'd really appreciate it.

 If you were attending my presentation on tree models, what would you like to see (assuming this is a new topic for you too. but please provide feedback based on your [hopefully] extensive knowledge on this topic)?
 Here is what I have so far (based on google searches, some papers):
 -Introduction
 -Types of trees based on algo and techniques (basically classification trees and regression trees)
 -Then I am thinking of going off on a tangent about decision trees bec I have no clue about how to move this presentation forward
 -Real-world applications
 -Key takeaways (inserts clownface emoji)
 My prof asks the students questions about the topic as well. I am mostly concerned about WHAT to cover in 5 minutes without making look under-researched. Any redirection/suggestions will be appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(I'm a Software Engineer who knows almost nothing about ML / NLP, so, apologies in advance if this doesn't make any sense.)
 I had a shower thought around if tokenization could incorporate meaning, so the models could be trained on "thoughts" instead of subword tokens (which is probably closer to how we humans think). To expand a little bit, we could first cluster all the words (maybe using the current day LLMs), then each token (or "thought") in the new scheme could represent a group of related words, followed by refinements that would be less and less important.
 For example, (cop_thought, cop_refinement) -> cop, but (cop_thought, police_refinement) -> police etc.
 So the encoding step would involve an LLM (which could possibly be relatively smaller), whose output would go to the actual model but the decoding would still be fairly straightforward. This could possibly free up some additional capacity in the actual model, assuming this heavy lifting tokenization makes its job easier, but as I'm typing it, I guess I'm simply moving some of the semantic understand happening in the hidden layers of the current day LLMs explicitly to the tokenization (encoding) step, which may not really change anything (if not make it worse).
 I'm still curious what folks think, if there's any related efforts (and all the ways I'm wrong -- https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cunningham%27s_Law). Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Keep in mind I'm very new to machine learning. I have an idea for a project where I train an AI to detect instances of someone being highly confident in a treatment for a condition, maybe biased toward more unconventional treatments.
 I was thinking that there may be many instances of people who posted that they were cured or nearly cured of such and such disease by an unconventional treatment on a forum about the condition. It may have been discussed for a little while, but ultimately buried in the pages of the forum.
 The plan would be to annotate instances I can find of such scenarios, maybe like this:
  
[FIRST_PERSON_HIGH_CONFIDENCE_TREATMENT]I had severe [CONDITION]migraines[/CONDITION] for years, and nothing seemed to work. Then I tried [TREATMENT]grounding, where I walk barefoot on grass for 30 minutes every day[/TREATMENT]. I can [HIGH_CONFIDENCE]honestly say I've never felt better[/HIGH_CONFIDENCE]. My [CONDITION]migraines[/CONDITION] have reduced by 80%, and I'm [HIGH_CONFIDENCE]convinced this is a game-changer for me[/HIGH_CONFIDENCE].[/FIRST_PERSON_HIGH_CONFIDENCE_TREATMENT]
  
Then train an AI with that data, so that it could detect cases of a person talking about themselves (to avoid hearsay) and saying, with high confidence, that a treatment worked for a condition.
 Then millions of forum posts could be fed to the AI to detect these, and the resulting data could be used to possibly discover effective treatments that are not in the mainstream.
 Any tips on getting started? I know almost nothing about this kind of stuff, like what models I should use, how to annotate it best (should I use relational labels?), whether to use a transformer or something else, stuff like that. Suggestions for books or other resources fit for a beginner that could help me learn how this could be done would be great too.

 I get that attention involves multiplying "query" and "key" vectors to determine the importance of different words in a sequence, but I don't quite understand why this multiplication gives us a meaningful metric for importance.
 What I'm looking for:
 I'm comfortable with moderate level technicalities but require a deeper insight into the inner workings and rationale behind these mechanisms. Please share any insights, analogies, or technical details that can shed light on this concept.

 If anyone has any Youtube or Udemy courses, as I have access to those, I would really appreciate it.
 For starters, I’m really aiming to just at least tackle the ML-specific math concepts.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR: New training approach proposed to help smaller AI models to achieve state-of-the-art translation performance
 Large AI models like GPT-3 have good performance on translation tasks, but some smaller models struggle.
 Researchers from Johns Hopkins and Microsoft propose a new 2-stage fine-tuning method called ALMA that unlocks stronger translation abilities in smaller models with just 7-13 billion parameters.
 How it works:
  
Fine-tune on monolingual data in non-English languages to improve comprehension
 Further fine-tune on small sets of high-quality human-translated parallel text
  
The authors claim this achieves SOTA-level translation using far less data and compute than conventional methods:
  
Matches performance of 175B parameter GPT-3 and 54B parameter NLLB with only 7-13B parameters
 Reaches NLLB-level quality with just 1 billion monolingual tokens and 18 hours of training
  
I think this shows that smaller models can reach SOTA translation with specialized fine-tuning, so we may not need endlessly bigger datasets and models to get better performance. Looks like deliberate tuning targeting key language skills could be more important.
 Full summary here. Paper (preprint) is here.

 So yes, it's obvious that we have pretty advanced AI-powered applications that can generate images, music, short stories, hell even objects for video games. I'm curious as to how crazy this is gonna get in the coming decade or even shorter like the next 4 to 5 years. I mean look at AI-generated images now, they're getting more and more sophisticated across various different styles of art. I think it's only a matter of time where you could take a certain image of a character or something tell the app "Hey make the same image but make the character's arm raised slightly to the left here" and bam all of a sudden you have an animation (and this may already be possible).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been reading the HyperDreamBooth paper and am confused about the number of parameters and corresponding matrix shapes in section 4.1 and figure 3 (below).
 ​
 Figure 3 from the paper
 Maybe there's something more than just matrix multiplication, because the numbers don't add up. If there are two matrices, A & B, of size n,r and r,m, and r = 1, and you multiply them, then it implies that n + m = 386k, which seems to be a bit much for a number of parameters in a single layer.
 Then we have two matrices of size a,r and r,b, where a = 100, b = 50 and there are 28k variables, according to the figure - in 4.1 they say 30k. If there's 30k, that would imply r = 200, for matrices of shape 100,200 and 200,50.
 I guess 386k and 28k are for the whole models, n and m differ from layer to layer, and r stays at one. Quite surprising to me that approximating a n,m shaped matrix with a product of n,1 and 1,m vectors would work. Even more surprising that apparently you could squeeze it further to 100,1 and 50,1.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone!
 Multi-part question.
  
I have scraped text (I repeat, text, and not structured data such as tables or something) from a medical site, and I want to know how to clean it. And when I say clean, I don't mean removal of html tags and such. I already have the paragraphs in plain text but there is a lot of spammy stuff like "You are not signed in; subscribe to this newsletter; by checking this box, I agree to the terms and conditions, etc." This text is not the exact same in all the paragraphs but there is high similarity. I would have thought there would be many tools to clean text and remove unrelated chunks like these but all I have been able to find has to do with cleaning html tags, changing date-time format and so on. Am I missing something or is this actually difficult?
  
Secondly, the spammy text I mentioned is from just one site. I will be eventually scaling to many sites and god knows what random text I'll have to clean then.
  
I used OpenAI embeddings and cosine similarity on the medical text to find similar paragraphs. The results were not great. Is there a way to improve the similarity search? I will be trying FAISS next but wanted to know what else I can do. It was suggested to me to use a pretrained embedding model specific to medical data. However, I found only one such model which is 20 gigs!
  
I'm just getting started with these, so, appreciate any help I can get.
 Thanks a ton!

My research is on various medical image segmentation problems, including brain 3D US (glioma), lung CT (interstitial lung disease in scleroderma patients), etc. using the PyTorch ecosystem (probably including frameworks such as MONAI)
 I'll have to conduct several experiments on various model architectures on parameters in the coming months. Specifically, these are what I'm gonna need:
  
Experiment tracking (model architecture, training configuration, hyperparameters, evaluation metrics)
 Model storage (would be nice if there's a better way to store my model's parameters other than storing tons of .pth file on my harddisk or google drive)
 (Optional) Visualization (sample predictions of the model on the training or validation sets, maybe every 20 epochs or sth)
 Would like to hear any suggestions from the community
  
I've found wandb, clearML, neptune, and Aim; but trying each of them individually would be too time-consuming considering my current schedule.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I've been taking a look at hypernetworks and noticed they've been used in some cool ways in RL with stuff like Qmix and this Metalearning paper.
 Quick recap:
  
f is our regular neural network: takes in input x and outputs y using weights \theta.
 g is the hypernetwork, it creates the weights \theta for f based on its own weights \phi and maybe the input x.
  
Original paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09106
 I watched this talk and it hinted that hypernetworks might even be better than our regular networks even for supervised learning regular tasks.
 So, I'm curious:
  
What's the deal with hypernetworks? What makes them good or not vs regular neural networks?
 I get that they're good for metalearning, but could they also be a game-changer for other things, like sample efficiency?
  
Does anyone have thoughts or reads on this? 
 Thanks!

Then, for scientific topics, I try to get a confirmation with Google using the keywords in the generated answer and google. For technical topics I can often check if it works.
 Some examples:
 For cooking, a topic I don't master enough to ask questions with the best keywords... 
 Are the spicy compounds of Ginger soluble in water or oil ? > I will get me to know that "the gingerol is liposoluble", what can be more easily checked in Google.
 Or for 3D geometry, a topic where I have complex questions... 
 I want to place a 3D frame B so that the Z axis of the B frame point towards the world origin A. I know the angle Alpha between the Z axis of the frame B and The X,Y plane of A. I know the angle Beta between the X axis of A and the vector that goes from the center of A towards the projection of the center of B on the X,Y plane of A. How do you compute the homogeneous rotation matrix of B relative to A, knowing Alpha, Beta and the distance between the center of A and the center of B ?
 Most of time, Bing and the free ChatGPT can answer. But sometimes they struggle or give incorrect answer. 
 Would ChatGPT plus paid subscription be helpful to find more accurate answers?

computational intractability: approximating Nash equilibria in normal-form
games is PPAD-hard. In this paper, inspired by the ideas of smoothed analysis,
we introduce a relaxed variant of Nash equilibrium called $\sigma$-smooth Nash
equilibrium, for a smoothness parameter $\sigma$. In a $\sigma$-smooth Nash
equilibrium, players only need to achieve utility at least as high as their
best deviation to a $\sigma$-smooth strategy, which is a distribution that does
not put too much mass (as parametrized by $\sigma$) on any fixed action. We
distinguish two variants of $\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibria: strong
$\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibria, in which players are required to play
$\sigma$-smooth strategies under equilibrium play, and weak $\sigma$-smooth
Nash equilibria, where there is no such requirement.

We show that both weak and strong $\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibria have
superior computational properties to Nash equilibria: when $\sigma$ as well as
an approximation parameter $\epsilon$ and the number of players are all
constants, there is a constant-time randomized algorithm to find a weak
$\epsilon$-approximate $\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibrium in normal-form games.
In the same parameter regime, there is a polynomial-time deterministic
algorithm to find a strong $\epsilon$-approximate $\sigma$-smooth Nash
equilibrium in a normal-form game. These results stand in contrast to the
optimal algorithm for computing $\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibria, which
cannot run in faster than quasipolynomial-time. We complement our upper bounds
by showing that when either $\sigma$ or $\epsilon$ is an inverse polynomial,
finding a weak $\epsilon$-approximate $\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibria becomes
computationally intractable.]]></summary>

to navigate, manipulate objects, and answer questions based on their

exhibit limitations in handling complex language queries, we propose
LLM-Grounder, a novel zero-shot, open-vocabulary, Large Language Model
(LLM)-based 3D visual grounding pipeline. LLM-Grounder utilizes an LLM to
decompose complex natural language queries into semantic constituents and
employs a visual grounding tool, such as OpenScene or LERF, to identify objects
in a 3D scene. The LLM then evaluates the spatial and commonsense relations
among the proposed objects to make a final grounding decision. Our method does
not require any labeled training data and can generalize to novel 3D scenes and
arbitrary text queries. We evaluate LLM-Grounder on the ScanRefer benchmark and
demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot grounding accuracy. Our findings
indicate that LLMs significantly improve the grounding capability, especially
for complex language queries, making LLM-Grounder an effective approach for 3D
vision-language tasks in robotics. Videos and interactive demos can be found on

deep neural networks, were first studied in image processing and more recently
in NLP. While approaches to detecting adversarial examples in NLP have largely
relied on search over input perturbations, image processing has seen a range of
techniques that aim to characterise adversarial subspaces over the learned
representations.

In this paper, we adapt two such approaches to NLP, one based on nearest
neighbors and influence functions and one on Mahalanobis distances. The former
in particular produces a state-of-the-art detector when compared against
several strong baselines; moreover, the novel use of influence functions
provides insight into how the nature of adversarial example subspaces in NLP
relate to those in image processing, and also how they differ depending on the

methods scale poorly with the number of data points and second, kernel methods
are usually not effective on complex structured high dimensional data due to
curse of dimensionality. Therefore, we propose a novel black-box optimization
algorithm where the black-box function is modeled using a neural network. Our
algorithm does not need a Bayesian neural network to estimate predictive
uncertainty and is therefore computationally favorable. We analyze the
theoretical behavior of our algorithm in terms of regret bound using advances
in NTK theory showing its efficient convergence. We perform experiments with

performance for speech synthesis. However, a large number of iterative steps
are required to achieve high sample quality, which restricts the inference
speed. Maintaining sample quality while increasing sampling speed has become a
challenging task. In this paper, we propose a "Co"nsistency "Mo"del-based
"Speech" synthesis method, CoMoSpeech, which achieve speech synthesis through a
single diffusion sampling step while achieving high audio quality. The
consistency constraint is applied to distill a consistency model from a
well-designed diffusion-based teacher model, which ultimately yields superior
performances in the distilled CoMoSpeech. Our experiments show that by
generating audio recordings by a single sampling step, the CoMoSpeech achieves
an inference speed more than 150 times faster than real-time on a single NVIDIA
A100 GPU, which is comparable to FastSpeech2, making diffusion-sampling based
speech synthesis truly practical. Meanwhile, objective and subjective
evaluations on text-to-speech and singing voice synthesis show that the
proposed teacher models yield the best audio quality, and the one-step sampling
based CoMoSpeech achieves the best inference speed with better or comparable
audio quality to other conventional multi-step diffusion model baselines. Audio

become a powerful tool for system identification. This paper presents a
physics-informed Gaussian process (GP) model for Timoshenko beam elements. The
model is constructed as a multi-output GP with covariance and cross-covariance
kernels analytically derived based on the differential equations for
deflections, rotations, strains, bending moments, shear forces and applied
loads. Stiffness identification is performed in a Bayesian format by maximising
a posterior model through a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, yielding a
stochastic model for the structural parameters. The optimised GP model is
further employed for probabilistic predictions of unobserved responses.
Additionally, an entropy-based method for physics-informed sensor placement
optimisation is presented, exploiting heterogeneous sensor position information
and structural boundary conditions built into the GP model. Results demonstrate
that the proposed approach is effective at identifying structural parameters
and is capable of fusing data from heterogeneous and multi-fidelity sensors.
Probabilistic predictions of structural responses and internal forces are in
closer agreement with measured data. We validate our model with an experimental
setup and discuss the quality and uncertainty of the obtained results. The
proposed approach has potential applications in the field of structural health
monitoring (SHM) for both mechanical and structural systems.]]></summary>

pre-trained NLP model selection, and a clinical expert NLP rule-based
classifier, to improve the accuracy of VTE identification in unstructured
(free-text) radiology reports. Our experimental results demonstrate the model's
efficacy, achieving an impressive 97\% accuracy and 97\% F1 score in predicting
DVT, and an outstanding 98.3\% accuracy and 98.4\% F1 score in predicting PE.

images, such as expression, hairstyle, pose, or age. Even though the
state-of-the-art models successfully modify the requested attributes, they
simultaneously modify other important characteristics of the image, such as a
person's identity. In this paper, we focus on solving this problem by
introducing PluGeN4Faces, a plugin to StyleGAN, which explicitly disentangles
face attributes from a person's identity. Our key idea is to perform training
on images retrieved from movie frames, where a given person appears in various
poses and with different attributes. By applying a type of contrastive loss, we
encourage the model to group images of the same person in similar regions of
latent space. Our experiments demonstrate that the modifications of face
attributes performed by PluGeN4Faces are significantly less invasive on the
remaining characteristics of the image than in the existing state-of-the-art
models.]]></summary>

gradual transitions among a finite number of states. We are particularly
motivated by applications such as human activity analysis where observed
accelerometer time series contains segments representing distinct activities,
which we call pure states, as well as periods characterized by continuous
transition among these pure states. To capture this transitory behavior, the
dynamical Wasserstein barycenter (DWB) model of Cheng et al. in 2021 [1]
associates with each pure state a data-generating distribution and models the
continuous transitions among these states as a Wasserstein barycenter of these
distributions with dynamically evolving weights. Focusing on the univariate
case where Wasserstein distances and barycenters can be computed in closed
form, we extend [1] specifically relaxing the parameterization of the pure
states as Gaussian distributions. We highlight issues related to the uniqueness
in identifying the model parameters as well as uncertainties induced when
estimating a dynamically evolving distribution from a limited number of
samples. To ameliorate non-uniqueness, we introduce regularization that imposes
temporal smoothness on the dynamics of the barycentric weights. A
quantile-based approximation of the pure state distributions yields a finite
dimensional estimation problem which we numerically solve using cyclic descent
alternating between updates to the pure-state quantile functions and the
barycentric weights. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed algorithm in
segmenting both simulated and real world human activity time series.]]></summary>

(PSMs), a novel solution to achieving real-time optimization, flexibility, and
fault tolerance in autonomous systems, particularly in transport-dominated
systems such as chemical, biomedical, and power plants. Traditional data-driven
methods fall short due to a lack of physical constraints like mass
conservation; PSMs address this issue by training deep neural networks with
sensor data and physics-informing using components' Partial Differential
Equations (PDEs), resulting in a physics-constrained, end-to-end differentiable
forward dynamics model. Through two in silico experiments - a heated channel
and a cooling system loop - we demonstrate that PSMs offer a more accurate
approach than purely data-driven models.

Beyond accuracy, there are several compelling use cases for PSMs. In this
work, we showcase two: the creation of a nonlinear supervisory controller
through a sequentially updated state-space representation and the proposal of a
diagnostic algorithm using residuals from each of the PDEs. The former
demonstrates the ability of PSMs to handle both constant and time-dependent
constraints, while the latter illustrates their value in system diagnostics and
fault detection. We further posit that PSMs could serve as a foundation for
Digital Twins, constantly updated digital representations of physical systems.]]></summary>

stochastic splitting functions (SSFs) to enhance classification performance in
multi-class datasets through hierarchical classification (HC). The method has
the unique capability of generating hierarchy without requiring explicit
information, making it suitable for datasets lacking prior knowledge of
hierarchy. By systematically dividing classes into two subsets based on their
discriminability according to the classifier, the proposed approach constructs
a binary tree representation of hierarchical classes. The approach is evaluated
on 46 multi-class time series datasets using popular classifiers (svm and
rocket) and SSFs (potr, srtr, and lsoo). The results reveal that the approach
significantly improves classification performance in approximately half and a
third of the datasets when using rocket and svm as the classifier,
respectively. The study also explores the relationship between dataset features
and HC performance. While the number of classes and flat classification (FC)
score show consistent significance, variations are observed with different
splitting functions. Overall, the proposed approach presents a promising
strategy for enhancing classification by generating hierarchical structure in
multi-class time series datasets. Future research directions involve exploring
different splitting functions, classifiers, and hierarchy structures, as well
as applying the approach to diverse domains beyond time series data. The source

next item click based on the information in a single session only even in the
presence of some random user's behavior, is a complex problem. This complex
problem requires a high-capability model of predicting the user's next action.
Most (if not all) existing models follow the encoder-predictor paradigm where
all studies focus on how to optimize the encoder module extensively in the
paradigm but they ignore how to optimize the predictor module. In this paper,
we discover the existing critical issue of the low-capability predictor module
among existing models. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework called
\emph{\underline{S}ession-based \underline{R}ecommendation with
\underline{Pred}ictor \underline{A}dd-\underline{O}n} (SR-PredictAO). In this
framework, we propose a high-capability predictor module which could alleviate
the effect of random user's behavior for prediction. It is worth mentioning
that this framework could be applied to any existing models, which could give
opportunities for further optimizing the framework. Extensive experiments on
two real benchmark datasets for three state-of-the-art models show that
\emph{SR-PredictAO} out-performs the current state-of-the-art model by up to
2.9\% in HR@20 and 2.3\% in MRR@20. More importantly, the improvement is
consistent across almost all the existing models on all datasets, which could

information across multiple scales poses a significant challenge in digital
pathology. Multi-instance learning (MIL) is a common solution for working with
high resolution images by classifying bags of objects (i.e. sets of smaller
image patches). However, such processing is typically performed at a single
scale (e.g., 20x magnification) of WSIs, disregarding the vital inter-scale
information that is key to diagnoses by human pathologists. In this study, we
propose a novel cross-scale MIL algorithm to explicitly aggregate inter-scale
relationships into a single MIL network for pathological image diagnosis. The
contribution of this paper is three-fold: (1) A novel cross-scale MIL (CS-MIL)
algorithm that integrates the multi-scale information and the inter-scale
relationships is proposed; (2) A toy dataset with scale-specific morphological
features is created and released to examine and visualize differential
cross-scale attention; (3) Superior performance on both in-house and public
datasets is demonstrated by our simple cross-scale MIL strategy. The official

studied with a specific focus on reducing their memory consumption. Work by Liu
et al. (2022) proposed extreme activation compression (EXACT) which
demonstrated drastic reduction in memory consumption by performing quantization
of the intermediate activation maps down to using INT2 precision. They showed
little to no reduction in performance while achieving large reductions in GPU
memory consumption. In this work, we present an improvement to the EXACT
strategy by using block-wise quantization of the intermediate activation maps.
We experimentally analyze different block sizes and show further reduction in
memory consumption (>15%), and runtime speedup per epoch (about 5%) even when
performing extreme extents of quantization with similar performance trade-offs
as with the original EXACT. Further, we present a correction to the assumptions
on the distribution of intermediate activation maps in EXACT (assumed to be
uniform) and show improved variance estimations of the quantization and
dequantization steps.]]></summary>

models with extreme values. This is achieved by learning gate parameters
through a surrogate of the $l_0$ norm using hard concrete distribution without
modifying the model weights of the given local optima models. This merging
process not only enhances the model performance by converging to a better local

diseases. Generative Adversarial Networks play a key role in addressing this
imbalance by enabling the generation of synthetic images to augment datasets.
It is important to generate synthetic images that incorporate a diverse range
of features to accurately represent the distribution of features present in the
training imagery. Furthermore, the absence of diverse features in synthetic
images can degrade the performance of machine learning classifiers. The mode
collapse problem impacts Generative Adversarial Networks' capacity to generate
diversified images. Mode collapse comes in two varieties: intra-class and
inter-class. In this paper, both varieties of the mode collapse problem are
investigated, and their subsequent impact on the diversity of synthetic X-ray
images is evaluated. This work contributes an empirical demonstration of the
benefits of integrating the adaptive input-image normalization with the Deep
Convolutional GAN and Auxiliary Classifier GAN to alleviate the mode collapse
problems. Synthetically generated images are utilized for data augmentation and
training a Vision Transformer model. The classification performance of the
model is evaluated using accuracy, recall, and precision scores. Results
demonstrate that the DCGAN and the ACGAN with adaptive input-image
normalization outperform the DCGAN and ACGAN with un-normalized X-ray images as
evidenced by the superior diversity scores and classification scores.]]></summary>

competition featured in the NeurIPS 2022 Competition Track, aimed at addressing
dexterous robotic manipulation tasks through learning from pre-collected
offline data. Participants were provided with two types of datasets for each
task: expert and mixed datasets with varying skill levels. While the simplest
offline policy learning algorithm, Behavioral Cloning (BC), performed
remarkably well when trained on expert datasets, it outperformed even the most
advanced offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. However, BC's
performance deteriorated when applied to mixed datasets, and the performance of
offline RL algorithms was also unsatisfactory. Upon examining the mixed
datasets, we observed that they contained a significant amount of expert data,
although this data was unlabeled. To address this issue, we proposed a
semi-supervised learning-based classifier to identify the underlying expert
behavior within mixed datasets, effectively isolating the expert data. To
further enhance BC's performance, we leveraged the geometric symmetry of the
RRC arena to augment the training dataset through mathematical transformations.
In the end, our submission surpassed that of all other participants, even those

emotional, and behavioral changes. Symptoms of SZ include hallucinations,
illusions, delusions, lack of motivation, and difficulties in concentration.
Diagnosing SZ involves employing various tools, including clinical interviews,
physical examinations, psychological evaluations, the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), and neuroimaging techniques.
Electroencephalography (EEG) recording is a significant functional neuroimaging
modality that provides valuable insights into brain function during SZ.
However, EEG signal analysis poses challenges for neurologists and scientists
due to the presence of artifacts, long-term recordings, and the utilization of
multiple channels. To address these challenges, researchers have introduced
artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, encompassing conventional machine
learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods, to aid in SZ diagnosis. This
study reviews papers focused on SZ diagnosis utilizing EEG signals and AI
methods. The introduction section provides a comprehensive explanation of SZ
diagnosis methods and intervention techniques. Subsequently, review papers in
this field are discussed, followed by an introduction to the AI methods
employed for SZ diagnosis and a summary of relevant papers presented in tabular
form. Additionally, this study reports on the most significant challenges
encountered in SZ diagnosis, as identified through a review of papers in this

discretization to resolve necessary spatiotemporal scales, which can be
computationally expensive. Recent advances in deep learning have provided a new
approach to solving partial differential equations that involves the use of
neural operators. Neural operators are neural network architectures that learn
mappings between function spaces and have the capability to solve partial
differential equations based on data. This study utilizes a novel neural
operator called Hyena, which employs a long convolutional filter that is
parameterized by a multilayer perceptron. The Hyena operator is an operation
that enjoys sub-quadratic complexity and state space model to parameterize long
convolution that enjoys a global receptive field. This mechanism enhances the
model's comprehension of the input's context and enables data-dependent weight
for different partial differential equations instances. To measure how
effective the layers are in solving partial differential equations, we conduct
experiments on Diffusion-Reaction equation and Navier Stokes equation. Our
findings indicate Hyena Neural operator can serve as an efficient and accurate
model for learning partial differential equations solution operator. The data

allows model training among multiple devices or organizations by sharing
training parameters instead of raw data. However, adversaries can still infer
individual information through inference attacks (e.g. differential attacks) on
these training parameters. As a result, Differential Privacy (DP) has been
widely used in FL to prevent such attacks. We consider differentially private
federated learning in a resource-constrained scenario, where both privacy
budget and communication round are constrained. By theoretically analyzing the
convergence, we can find the optimal number of differentially private local
iterations for clients between any two sequential global updates. Based on
this, we design an algorithm of differentially private federated learning with

modeling tasks like speech recognition, where it is necessary to preserve order
between the input and target sequences. However, CTC is only applied to
deterministic sequence models, where the latent space is discontinuous and
sparse, which in turn makes them less capable of handling data variability when
compared to variational models. In this paper, we integrate CTC with a
variational model and derive loss functions that can be used to train more
generalizable sequence models that preserve order. Specifically, we derive two
versions of the novel variational CTC based on two reasonable assumptions, the
first being that the variational latent variables at each time step are
conditionally independent; and the second being that these latent variables are
Markovian. We show that both loss functions allow direct optimization of the
variational lower bound for the model log-likelihood, and present
computationally tractable forms for implementing them.]]></summary>

datasets and testing on data from the same domain that the model can train on.
Classification becomes more challenging when dealing with new data from a
different domain, where gathering and especially labeling a larger image
dataset for retraining a classification model requires a labor-intensive human
effort. Cross-domain classification frameworks were developed to handle this
data domain shift problem by utilizing unsupervised image-to-image translation
models to translate an input image from the unlabeled domain to the labeled
domain. The problem with these unsupervised models lies in their unsupervised
nature. For lack of annotations, it is not possible to use the traditional
supervised metrics to evaluate these translation models to pick the best-saved
checkpoint model. This paper introduces a new method called Domain-knowledge
Inspired Pseudo Supervision (DIPS) which utilizes domain-informed Gaussian
Mixture Models to generate pseudo annotations to enable the use of traditional
supervised metrics. This method was designed specifically to support
cross-domain classification applications contrary to other typically used
metrics such as the FID which were designed to evaluate the model in terms of
the quality of the generated image from a human-eye perspective. DIPS proves
its effectiveness by outperforming various GAN evaluation metrics, including
FID, when selecting the optimal saved checkpoint model. It is also evaluated
against truly supervised metrics. Furthermore, DIPS showcases its robustness
and interpretability by demonstrating a strong correlation with truly
supervised metrics, highlighting its superiority over existing state-of-the-art
alternatives. The code and data to replicate the results can be found on the

control involve dynamic behaviors in various granularity; task, model, and
layers within a model. Such dynamic behaviors introduce new challenges to the
system software in an ML system since the overall system load is not completely
predictable, unlike traditional ML workloads. In addition, RTMM workloads
require real-time processing, involve highly heterogeneous models, and target
resource-constrained devices. Under such circumstances, developing an effective
scheduler gains more importance to better utilize underlying hardware
considering the unique characteristics of RTMM workloads. Therefore, we propose
a new scheduler, DREAM, which effectively handles various dynamicity in RTMM
workloads targeting multi-accelerator systems. DREAM quantifies the unique
requirements for RTMM workloads and utilizes the quantified scores to drive
scheduling decisions, considering the current system load and other inference
jobs on different models and input frames. DREAM utilizes tunable parameters
that provide fast and effective adaptivity to dynamic workload changes. In our
evaluation of five scenarios of RTMM workload, DREAM reduces the overall
UXCost, which is an equivalent metric of the energy-delay product (EDP) for
RTMM defined in the paper, by 32.2% and 50.0% in the geometric mean (up to
80.8% and 97.6%) compared to state-of-the-art baselines, which shows the

perform decision-making and control directly from high-dimensional sensory
input. Diffractive optical networks provide a promising solution for
implementing artificial intelligence with high-speed and low-power consumption.
Most of the reported diffractive optical networks focus on single or multiple
tasks that do not involve environmental interaction, such as object recognition
and image classification. In contrast, the networks capable of performing
decision-making and control have not yet been developed to our knowledge. Here,
we propose using deep reinforcement learning to implement diffractive optical
networks that imitate human-level decision-making and control capability. Such
networks taking advantage of a residual architecture, allow for finding optimal
control policies through interaction with the environment and can be readily
implemented with existing optical devices. The superior performance of these
networks is verified by engaging three types of classic games, Tic-Tac-Toe,
Super Mario Bros., and Car Racing. Finally, we present an experimental
demonstration of playing Tic-Tac-Toe by leveraging diffractive optical networks
based on a spatial light modulator. Our work represents a solid step forward in
advancing diffractive optical networks, which promises a fundamental shift from
the target-driven control of a pre-designed state for simple recognition or
classification tasks to the high-level sensory capability of artificial
intelligence. It may find exciting applications in autonomous driving,
intelligent robots, and intelligent manufacturing.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In many applications in data clustering, it is desirable to find not just a
single partition into clusters but a sequence of partitions describing the data
at different scales, or levels of coarseness. A natural problem then is to
analyse and compare the (not necessarily hierarchical) sequences of partitions
that underpin such multiscale descriptions of data. Here, we introduce a
filtration of abstract simplicial complexes, denoted the Multiscale Clustering
Filtration (MCF), which encodes arbitrary patterns of cluster assignments
across scales, and we prove that the MCF produces stable persistence diagrams.
We then show that the zero-dimensional persistent homology of the MCF measures
the degree of hierarchy in the sequence of partitions, and that the
higher-dimensional persistent homology tracks the emergence and resolution of
conflicts between cluster assignments across the sequence of partitions. To
broaden the theoretical foundations of the MCF, we also provide an equivalent
construction via a nerve complex filtration, and we show that in the
hierarchical case, the MCF reduces to a Vietoris-Rips filtration of an
ultrametric space. We briefly illustrate how the MCF can serve to characterise
multiscale clustering structures in numerical experiments on synthetic data.]]></summary>

housing. Despite its critical importance for policy, our ability to effectively
monitor and track progress in urban housing is limited. Deep learning-based
computer vision methods applied to street-level images have been successful in
the measurement of socioeconomic and environmental inequalities but did not
fully utilize temporal images to track urban change as time-varying labels are
often unavailable. We used self-supervised methods to measure change in London
using 15 million street images taken between 2008 and 2021. Our novel
adaptation of Barlow Twins, Street2Vec, embeds urban structure while being
invariant to seasonal and daily changes without manual annotations. It
outperformed generic embeddings, successfully identified point-level change in
London's housing supply from street-level images, and distinguished between
major and minor change. This capability can provide timely information for

key parameters are the number of data considered at each step or batch size
$B$, and the step size or learning rate $\eta$. For small $B$ and large $\eta$,
SGD corresponds to a stochastic evolution of the parameters, whose noise
amplitude is governed by the `temperature' $T\equiv \eta/B$. Yet this
description is observed to break down for sufficiently large batches $B\geq
B^*$, or simplifies to gradient descent (GD) when the temperature is
sufficiently small. Understanding where these cross-overs take place remains a
central challenge. Here we resolve these questions for a teacher-student
perceptron classification model, and show empirically that our key predictions
still apply to deep networks. Specifically, we obtain a phase diagram in the
$B$-$\eta$ plane that separates three dynamical phases: $\textit{(i)}$ a
noise-dominated SGD governed by temperature, $\textit{(ii)}$ a
large-first-step-dominated SGD and $\textit{(iii)}$ GD. These different phases
also corresponds to different regimes of generalization error. Remarkably, our
analysis reveals that the batch size $B^*$ separating regimes $\textit{(i)}$
and $\textit{(ii)}$ scale with the size $P$ of the training set, with an
exponent that characterizes the hardness of the classification problem.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A variety of different performance metrics are commonly used in the machine
learning literature for the evaluation of classification systems. Some of the
most common ones for measuring quality of hard decisions are standard and
balanced accuracy, standard and balanced error rate, F-beta score, and Matthews
correlation coefficient (MCC). In this document, we review the definition of
these and other metrics and compare them with the expected cost (EC), a metric
introduced in every statistical learning course but rarely used in the machine
learning literature. We show that both the standard and balanced error rates
are special cases of the EC. Further, we show its relation with F-beta score
and MCC and argue that EC is superior to these traditional metrics for being
based on first principles from statistics, and for being more general,
interpretable, and adaptable to any application scenario. The metrics mentioned
above measure the quality of hard decisions. Yet, most modern classification
systems output continuous scores for the classes which we may want to evaluate
directly. Metrics for measuring the quality of system scores include the area
under the ROC curve, equal error rate, cross-entropy, Brier score, and Bayes EC
or Bayes risk, among others. The last three metrics are special cases of a
family of metrics given by the expected value of proper scoring rules (PSRs).
We review the theory behind these metrics, showing that they are a principled
way to measure the quality of the posterior probabilities produced by a system.
Finally, we show how to use these metrics to compute a system's calibration
loss and compare this metric with the widely-used expected calibration error
(ECE), arguing that calibration loss based on PSRs is superior to the ECE for
being more interpretable, more general, and directly applicable to the
multi-class case, among other reasons.]]></summary>

with uncovering novel categories from unlabeled data while maintaining
performance on seen categories from labeled data. The central challenge is the
substantial learning gap between seen and novel categories, as the model learns
the former faster due to accurate supervisory information. To address this, we
introduce 1) an adaptive margin loss based on estimated class distribution,
which encourages a large negative margin for samples in seen classes, to
synchronize learning paces, and 2) pseudo-label contrastive clustering, which
pulls together samples which are likely from the same class in the output
space, to enhance novel class discovery. Our extensive evaluations on multiple
datasets demonstrate that existing models still hinder novel class learning,
whereas our approach strikingly balances both seen and novel classes, achieving
a remarkable 3% average accuracy increase on the ImageNet dataset compared to
the prior state-of-the-art. Additionally, we find that fine-tuning the
self-supervised pre-trained backbone significantly boosts performance over the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The problem of non-monotone $k$-submodular maximization under a knapsack
constraint ($\kSMK$) over the ground set size $n$ has been raised in many
applications in machine learning, such as data summarization, information
propagation, etc. However, existing algorithms for the problem are facing
questioning of how to overcome the non-monotone case and how to fast return a
good solution in case of the big size of data. This paper introduces two
deterministic approximation algorithms for the problem that competitively
improve the query complexity of existing algorithms.

Our first algorithm, $\LAA$, returns an approximation ratio of $1/19$ within
$O(nk)$ query complexity. The second one, $\RLA$, improves the approximation
ratio to $1/5-\epsilon$ in $O(nk)$ queries, where $\epsilon$ is an input
parameter.

Our algorithms are the first ones that provide constant approximation ratios
within only $O(nk)$ query complexity for the non-monotone objective. They,
therefore, need fewer the number of queries than state-of-the-the-art ones by a
factor of $\Omega(\log n)$.

Besides the theoretical analysis, we have evaluated our proposed ones with
several experiments in some instances: Influence Maximization and Sensor
Placement for the problem. The results confirm that our algorithms ensure
theoretical quality as the cutting-edge techniques and significantly reduce the
number of queries.]]></summary>

significant implications for clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. One
major challenge in this field is the lack of continuous medical imaging
monitoring of individual patients over time. To address this issue, we develop
a novel framework termed Progressive Image Editing (PIE) that enables
controlled manipulation of disease-related image features, facilitating precise
and realistic disease progression simulation. Specifically, we leverage recent
advancements in text-to-image generative models to simulate disease progression
accurately and personalize it for each patient. We theoretically analyze the
iterative refining process in our framework as a gradient descent with an
exponentially decayed learning rate. To validate our framework, we conduct
experiments in three medical imaging domains. Our results demonstrate the
superiority of PIE over existing methods such as Stable Diffusion Walk and
Style-Based Manifold Extrapolation based on CLIP score (Realism) and Disease
Classification Confidence (Alignment). Our user study collected feedback from
35 veteran physicians to assess the generated progressions. Remarkably, 76.2%
of the feedback agrees with the fidelity of the generated progressions. To our
best knowledge, PIE is the first of its kind to generate disease progression
images meeting real-world standards. It is a promising tool for medical
research and clinical practice, potentially allowing healthcare providers to

proprietary data in such a way that multiple clients retain exclusive control
over their data, while all benefit from improved model accuracy due to pooled

Graphical models that utilize the expressive power of neural networks to learn
complex non-linear dependencies between the input features. They learn to
capture the underlying data distribution and have efficient algorithms for
inference and sampling. We develop a FL framework which maintains a global NGM
model that learns the averaged information from the local NGM models while
keeping the training data within the client's environment. Our design, FedNGMs,
avoids the pitfalls and shortcomings of neuron matching frameworks like
Federated Matched Averaging that suffers from model parameter explosion. Our
global model size remains constant throughout the process. In the cases where
clients have local variables that are not part of the combined global
distribution, we propose a `Stitching' algorithm, which personalizes the global
NGM models by merging the additional variables using the client's data. FedNGM
is robust to data heterogeneity, large number of participants, and limited

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the rapid development of big data and computing devices, low-latency
automatic trading platforms based on real-time information acquisition have
become the main components of the stock trading market, so the topic of
quantitative trading has received widespread attention. And for non-strongly
efficient trading markets, human emotions and expectations always dominate
market trends and trading decisions. Therefore, this paper starts from the
theory of emotion, taking East Money as an example, crawling user comment
titles data from its corresponding stock bar and performing data cleaning.
Subsequently, a natural language processing model BERT was constructed, and the
BERT model was fine-tuned using existing annotated data sets. The experimental
results show that the fine-tuned model has different degrees of performance
improvement compared to the original model and the baseline model.
Subsequently, based on the above model, the user comment data crawled is
labeled with emotional polarity, and the obtained label information is combined
with the Alpha191 model to participate in regression, and significant
regression results are obtained. Subsequently, the regression model is used to
predict the average price change for the next five days, and use it as a signal
to guide automatic trading. The experimental results show that the
incorporation of emotional factors increased the return rate by 73.8\% compared
to the baseline during the trading period, and by 32.41\% compared to the
original alpha191 model. Finally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages
of incorporating emotional factors into quantitative trading, and give possible
directions for further research in the future.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sequential change detection is a classical problem with a variety of
applications. However, the majority of prior work has been parametric, for
example, focusing on exponential families. We develop a fundamentally new and
general framework for sequential change detection when the pre- and post-change
distributions are nonparametrically specified (and thus composite). Our
procedures come with clean, nonasymptotic bounds on the average run length
(frequency of false alarms). In certain nonparametric cases (like sub-Gaussian
or sub-exponential), we also provide near-optimal bounds on the detection delay
following a changepoint. The primary technical tool that we introduce is called
an \emph{e-detector}, which is composed of sums of e-processes -- a fundamental
generalization of nonnegative supermartingales -- that are started at
consecutive times. We first introduce simple Shiryaev-Roberts and CUSUM-style
e-detectors, and then show how to design their mixtures in order to achieve
both statistical and computational efficiency. Our e-detector framework can be
instantiated to recover classical likelihood-based procedures for parametric
problems, as well as yielding the first change detection method for many
nonparametric problems. As a running example, we tackle the problem of
detecting changes in the mean of a bounded random variable without i.i.d.
assumptions, with an application to tracking the performance of a basketball
team over multiple seasons.]]></summary>

extremely high energy efficiency. By employing the distinct polarity of current
to denote logic `0' and `1', AQFP devices serve as excellent carriers for
binary neural network (BNN) computations. Although recent research has made
initial strides toward developing an AQFP-based BNN accelerator, several
critical challenges remain, preventing the design from being a comprehensive
solution. In this paper, we propose SupeRBNN, an AQFP-based randomized BNN
acceleration framework that leverages software-hardware co-optimization to
eventually make the AQFP devices a feasible solution for BNN acceleration.
Specifically, we investigate the randomized behavior of the AQFP devices and
analyze the impact of crossbar size on current attenuation, subsequently
formulating the current amplitude into the values suitable for use in BNN
computation. To tackle the accumulation problem and improve overall hardware
performance, we propose a stochastic computing-based accumulation module and a
clocking scheme adjustment-based circuit optimization method. We validate our
SupeRBNN framework across various datasets and network architectures, comparing
it with implementations based on different technologies, including CMOS, ReRAM,
and superconducting RSFQ/ERSFQ. Experimental results demonstrate that our
design achieves an energy efficiency of approximately 7.8x10^4 times higher
than that of the ReRAM-based BNN framework while maintaining a similar level of
model accuracy. Furthermore, when compared with superconductor-based
counterparts, our framework demonstrates at least two orders of magnitude
higher energy efficiency.]]></summary>

state-of-the-art 3 billion parameter open-source language model. BTLM-3B-8K was
trained on 627B tokens from the SlimPajama dataset with a mixture of 2,048 and
8,192 context lengths. BTLM-3B-8K outperforms all existing 3B parameter models
by 2-5.5% across downstream tasks. BTLM-3B-8K is even competitive with some 7B
parameter models. Additionally, BTLM-3B-8K provides excellent long context
performance, outperforming MPT-7B-8K and XGen-7B-8K on tasks up to 8,192
context length. We trained the model on a cleaned and deduplicated SlimPajama
dataset; aggressively tuned the \textmu P hyperparameters and schedule; used
ALiBi position embeddings; and adopted the SwiGLU nonlinearity.

On Hugging Face, the most popular models have 7B parameters, indicating that
users prefer the quality-size ratio of 7B models. Compacting the 7B parameter
model to one with 3B parameters, with little performance impact, is an
important milestone. BTLM-3B-8K needs only 3GB of memory with 4-bit precision
and takes 2.5x less inference compute than 7B models, helping to open up access
to a powerful language model on mobile and edge devices. BTLM-3B-8K is

rewards that must individually accumulate to given thresholds. In this class of
problems, we show a simple example in which the desired optimal policy cannot

constrained reinforcement learning problems for which neither regularized nor
classical primal-dual methods yield optimal policies. This work addresses this
shortcoming by augmenting the state with Lagrange multipliers and
reinterpreting primal-dual methods as the portion of the dynamics that drives
the multipliers evolution. This approach provides a systematic state
augmentation procedure that is guaranteed to solve reinforcement learning
problems with constraints. Thus, as we illustrate by an example, while previous
methods can fail at finding optimal policies, running the dual dynamics while
executing the augmented policy yields an algorithm that provably samples

cumulative regret minimization (with near-optimal minimax guarantees) and
simple regret minimization (with SOTA guarantees). Furthermore, our algorithms
adapt to model misspecification and extend to the continuous arm settings.
These advantages come from constructing and relying on "conformal arm sets"
(CASs), which provide a set of arms at every context that encompass the
context-specific optimal arm with some probability across the context
distribution. Our positive results on simple and cumulative regret guarantees
are contrasted by a negative result, which shows that an algorithm can't

using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In the Offline Nanosatellite Task
Scheduling (ONTS) problem, the goal is to find the optimal schedule for tasks
to be carried out in orbit while taking into account Quality-of-Service (QoS)
considerations such as priority, minimum and maximum activation events,
execution time-frames, periods, and execution windows, as well as constraints
on the satellite's power resources and the complexity of energy harvesting and
management. The ONTS problem has been approached using conventional
mathematical formulations and exact methods, but their applicability to
challenging cases of the problem is limited. This study examines the use of
GNNs in this context, which has been effectively applied to optimization
problems such as the traveling salesman, scheduling, and facility placement
problems. More specifically, we investigate whether GNNs can learn the complex
structure of the ONTS problem with respect to feasibility and optimality of
candidate solutions. Furthermore, we evaluate using GNN-based heuristic
solutions to provide better solutions (w.r.t. the objective value) to the ONTS
problem and reduce the optimization cost. Our experiments show that GNNs are
not only able to learn feasibility and optimality for instances of the ONTS
problem, but they can generalize to harder instances than those seen during
training. Furthermore, the GNN-based heuristics improved the expected objective
value of the best solution found under the time limit in 45%, and reduced the
expected time to find a feasible solution in 35%, when compared to the SCIP

range of scenarios, substantially enhancing smart building operation and
management while upholding privacy expectations in various spaces. We propose a
non-speech audio-based approach for crowd analytics, leveraging a
transformer-based model. Our results demonstrate that non-speech audio alone
can be used to conduct such analysis with remarkable accuracy. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first time when non-speech audio signals are
proposed for predicting occupancy. As far as we know, there has been no other
similar approach of its kind prior to this. To accomplish this, we deployed our
sensor-based platform in the waiting room of a large hospital with IRB approval
over a period of several months to capture non-speech audio and thermal images
for the training and evaluation of our models. The proposed non-speech-based
approach outperformed the thermal camera-based model and all other baselines.
In addition to demonstrating superior performance without utilizing speech
audio, we conduct further analysis using differential privacy techniques to
provide additional privacy guarantees. Overall, our work demonstrates the
viability of employing non-speech audio data for accurate occupancy estimation,
while also ensuring the exclusion of speech-related content and providing
robust privacy protections through differential privacy guarantees.]]></summary>

where it matters for decision-making, has gained prominence in model-based

problems. In this paper, we present a study on the necessary components for
decision-aware reinforcement learning models and we showcase design choices
that enable well-performing algorithms. To this end, we provide a theoretical
and empirical investigation into prominent algorithmic ideas in the field. We
highlight that empirical design decisions established in the MuZero line of
works are vital to achieving good performance for related algorithms, and we
showcase differences in behavior between different instantiations of
value-aware algorithms in stochastic environments. Using these insights, we
propose the Latent Model-Based Decision-Aware Actor-Critic framework
($\lambda$-AC) for decision-aware model-based reinforcement learning in
continuous state-spaces and highlight important design choices in different

biometric verification to improve reliablity in the face of spoofing attacks.
Even though the two sub-systems operate in tandem to solve the single task of
reliable biometric verification, they address different detection tasks and are
hence typically evaluated separately. Evidence shows that this approach is
suboptimal. We introduce a new metric for the joint evaluation of PAD solutions
operating in situ with biometric verification. In contrast to the tandem
detection cost function proposed recently, the new tandem equal error rate
(t-EER) is parameter free. The combination of two classifiers nonetheless leads
to a \emph{set} of operating points at which false alarm and miss rates are
equal and also dependent upon the prevalence of attacks. We therefore introduce
the \emph{concurrent} t-EER, a unique operating point which is invariable to
the prevalence of attacks. Using both modality (and even application) agnostic
simulated scores, as well as real scores for a voice biometrics application, we
demonstrate application of the t-EER to a wide range of biometric system
evaluations under attack. The proposed approach is a strong candidate metric
for the tandem evaluation of PAD systems and biometric comparators.]]></summary>

predicts visual-force goals using a deep neural network. Given a single RGBD
image combined with a text prompt, ForceSight determines a target end-effector
pose in the camera frame (kinematic goal) and the associated forces (force
goal). Together, these two components form a visual-force goal. Prior work has
demonstrated that deep models outputting human-interpretable kinematic goals
can enable dexterous manipulation by real robots. Forces are critical to
manipulation, yet have typically been relegated to lower-level execution in
these systems. When deployed on a mobile manipulator equipped with an
eye-in-hand RGBD camera, ForceSight performed tasks such as precision grasps,
drawer opening, and object handovers with an 81% success rate in unseen
environments with object instances that differed significantly from the
training data. In a separate experiment, relying exclusively on visual servoing
and ignoring force goals dropped the success rate from 90% to 45%,
demonstrating that force goals can significantly enhance performance. The

expressivity of surface electromyography-based (sEMG) gesture recognition
systems. Approach: We use a problem transformation approach, in which actions
were subset into two biomechanically independent components - a set of wrist
directions and a set of finger modifiers. To maintain fast calibration time, we
train models for each component using only individual gestures, and extrapolate
to the full product space of combination gestures by generating synthetic data.
We collected a supervised dataset with high-confidence ground truth labels in
which subjects performed combination gestures while holding a joystick, and
conducted experiments to analyze the impact of model architectures, classifier
algorithms, and synthetic data generation strategies on the performance of the
proposed approach. Main Results: We found that a problem transformation
approach using a parallel model architecture in combination with a non-linear
classifier, along with restricted synthetic data generation, shows promise in
increasing the expressivity of sEMG-based gestures with a short calibration
time. Significance: sEMG-based gesture recognition has applications in
human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and the control of robotic and
prosthetic devices. Existing approaches require exhaustive model calibration.
The proposed approach increases expressivity without requiring users to
demonstrate all combination gesture classes. Our results may be extended to
larger gesture vocabularies and more complicated model architectures.]]></summary>

measuring and interpreting the calibration of probabilistic predictors.
Calibration measures quantify the degree of miscalibration, and reliability
diagrams visualize the structure of this miscalibration. However, the most
common constructions of reliability diagrams and calibration measures --
binning and ECE -- both suffer from well-known flaws (e.g. discontinuity). We
show that a simple modification fixes both constructions: first smooth the
observations using an RBF kernel, then compute the Expected Calibration Error
(ECE) of this smoothed function. We prove that with a careful choice of
bandwidth, this method yields a calibration measure that is well-behaved in the
sense of (B{\l}asiok, Gopalan, Hu, and Nakkiran 2023a) -- a consistent
calibration measure. We call this measure the SmoothECE. Moreover, the
reliability diagram obtained from this smoothed function visually encodes the
SmoothECE, just as binned reliability diagrams encode the BinnedECE.

We also provide a Python package with simple, hyperparameter-free methods for

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We present LongLoRA, an efficient fine-tuning approach that extends the
context sizes of pre-trained large language models (LLMs), with limited
computation cost. Typically, training LLMs with long context sizes is
computationally expensive, requiring extensive training hours and GPU
resources. For example, training on the context length of 8192 needs 16x
computational costs in self-attention layers as that of 2048. In this paper, we
speed up the context extension of LLMs in two aspects. On the one hand,
although dense global attention is needed during inference, fine-tuning the
model can be effectively and efficiently done by sparse local attention. The
proposed shift short attention effectively enables context extension, leading
to non-trivial computation saving with similar performance to fine-tuning with
vanilla attention. Particularly, it can be implemented with only two lines of
code in training, while being optional in inference. On the other hand, we
revisit the parameter-efficient fine-tuning regime for context expansion.
Notably, we find that LoRA for context extension works well under the premise
of trainable embedding and normalization. LongLoRA demonstrates strong
empirical results on various tasks on LLaMA2 models from 7B/13B to 70B.
LongLoRA adopts LLaMA2 7B from 4k context to 100k, or LLaMA2 70B to 32k on a
single 8x A100 machine. LongLoRA extends models' context while retaining their
original architectures, and is compatible with most existing techniques, like
FlashAttention-2. In addition, to make LongLoRA practical, we collect a
dataset, LongQA, for supervised fine-tuning. It contains more than 3k long
context question-answer pairs.]]></summary>

to identify a brain tumor with accuracy. The fast development of Deep Learning
methods for use in computer vision applications has been facilitated by a vast
amount of training data and improvements in model construction that offer
better approximations in a supervised setting. The need for these approaches
has been the main driver of this expansion. Deep learning methods have shown
promise in improving the precision of brain tumor detection and classification
using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The study on the use of deep learning
techniques, especially ResNet50, for brain tumor identification is presented in
this abstract. As a result, this study investigates the possibility of
automating the detection procedure using deep learning techniques. In this
study, I utilized five transfer learning models which are VGG16, VGG19,
DenseNet121, ResNet50 and YOLO V4 where ResNet50 provide the best or highest
accuracy 99.54%. The goal of the study is to guide researchers and medical
professionals toward powerful brain tumor detecting systems by employing deep
learning approaches by way of this evaluation and analysis.]]></summary>

differentiable channel model due to the backpropagation algorithm. This
requirement can be sidestepped by approximating either the channel distribution
or its gradient through pilot signals in real-world scenarios. The initial
approach draws upon the latest advancements in image generation, utilizing
generative adversarial networks (GANs) or their enhanced variants to generate
channel distributions. In this paper, we address this channel approximation
challenge with diffusion models, which have demonstrated high sample quality in
image generation. We offer an end-to-end channel coding framework underpinned
by diffusion models and propose an efficient training algorithm. Our
simulations with various channel models establish that our diffusion models
learn the channel distribution accurately, thereby achieving near-optimal
end-to-end symbol error rates (SERs). We also note a significant advantage of
diffusion models: A robust generalization capability in high signal-to-noise
ratio regions, in contrast to GAN variants that suffer from error floor.
Furthermore, we examine the trade-off between sample quality and sampling
speed, when an accelerated sampling algorithm is deployed, and investigate the
effect of the noise scheduling on this trade-off. With an apt choice of noise
scheduling, sampling time can be significantly reduced with a minor increase in
SER.]]></summary>

difficulties with social interaction, communication, and repetitive activities.
The severity of these difficulties varies, and those with this diagnosis face
unique challenges. While its primary origin lies in genetics, identifying and
addressing it early can contribute to the enhancement of the condition. In
recent years, machine learning-driven intelligent diagnosis has emerged as a
supplement to conventional clinical approaches, aiming to address the potential
drawbacks of time-consuming and costly traditional methods. In this work, we
utilize different machine learning algorithms to find the most significant
traits responsible for ASD and to automate the diagnostic process. We study six
classification models to see which model works best to identify ASD and also
study five popular clustering methods to get a meaningful insight of these ASD
datasets. To find the best classifier for these binary datasets, we evaluate
the models using accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1-score, AUC, kappa
and log loss metrics. Our evaluation demonstrates that five out of the six
selected models perform exceptionally, achieving a 100% accuracy rate on the
ASD datasets when hyperparameters are meticulously tuned for each model. As
almost all classification models are able to get 100% accuracy, we become
interested in observing the underlying insights of the datasets by implementing
some popular clustering algorithms on these datasets. We calculate Normalized
Mutual Information (NMI), Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) & Silhouette Coefficient
(SC) metrics to select the best clustering models. Our evaluation finds that
spectral clustering outperforms all other benchmarking clustering models in
terms of NMI & ARI metrics and it also demonstrates comparability to the
optimal SC achieved by k-means.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper studies the problem of traffic flow forecasting, which aims to
predict future traffic conditions on the basis of road networks and traffic
conditions in the past. The problem is typically solved by modeling complex
spatio-temporal correlations in traffic data using spatio-temporal graph neural
networks (GNNs). However, the performance of these methods is still far from
satisfactory since GNNs usually have limited representation capacity when it
comes to complex traffic networks. Graphs, by nature, fall short in capturing
non-pairwise relations. Even worse, existing methods follow the paradigm of
message passing that aggregates neighborhood information linearly, which fails
to capture complicated spatio-temporal high-order interactions. To tackle these
issues, in this paper, we propose a novel model named Dynamic Hypergraph
Structure Learning (DyHSL) for traffic flow prediction. To learn non-pairwise
relationships, our DyHSL extracts hypergraph structural information to model
dynamics in the traffic networks, and updates each node representation by
aggregating messages from its associated hyperedges. Additionally, to capture
high-order spatio-temporal relations in the road network, we introduce an
interactive graph convolution block, which further models the neighborhood
interaction for each node. Finally, we integrate these two views into a
holistic multi-scale correlation extraction module, which conducts temporal
pooling with different scales to model different temporal patterns. Extensive
experiments on four popular traffic benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed DyHSL compared with a broad range of competing
baselines.]]></summary>

development of efficient cross-modal music retrieval systems. One of the
fundamental approaches toward this task is to learn a cross-modal embedding
space via deep neural networks that is able to connect short snippets of audio
and sheet music. However, the scarcity of annotated data from real musical
content affects the capability of such methods to generalize to real retrieval
scenarios. In this work, we investigate whether we can mitigate this limitation
with self-supervised contrastive learning, by exposing a network to a large
amount of real music data as a pre-training step, by contrasting randomly
augmented views of snippets of both modalities, namely audio and sheet images.
Through a number of experiments on synthetic and real piano data, we show that
pre-trained models are able to retrieve snippets with better precision in all
scenarios and pre-training configurations. Encouraged by these results, we
employ the snippet embeddings in the higher-level task of cross-modal piece
identification and conduct more experiments on several retrieval
configurations. In this task, we observe that the retrieval quality improves
from 30% up to 100% when real music data is present. We then conclude by
arguing for the potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for
alleviating the annotated data scarcity in multi-modal music retrieval models.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Audiovisual data is everywhere in this digital age, which raises higher
requirements for the deep learning models developed on them. To well handle the
information of the multi-modal data is the key to a better audiovisual modal.
We observe that these audiovisual data naturally have temporal attributes, such
as the time information for each frame in the video. More concretely, such data
is inherently multi-modal according to both audio and visual cues, which
proceed in a strict chronological order. It indicates that temporal information
is important in multi-modal acoustic event modeling for both intra- and
inter-modal. However, existing methods deal with each modal feature
independently and simply fuse them together, which neglects the mining of
temporal relation and thus leads to sub-optimal performance. With this
motivation, we propose a Temporal Multi-modal graph learning method for
Acoustic event Classification, called TMac, by modeling such temporal
information via graph learning techniques. In particular, we construct a
temporal graph for each acoustic event, dividing its audio data and video data
into multiple segments. Each segment can be considered as a node, and the
temporal relationships between nodes can be considered as timestamps on their
edges. In this case, we can smoothly capture the dynamic information in

(HMMs) are able to handle model-based clustering without specifying group

a result linking the Bayes risk of classification and the Bayes risk of
clustering, which we use to identify the key quantity determining the
difficulty of the clustering task. We also give a proof of this result in the
i.i.d. framework, which might be of independent interest. Then we study the

antineoplastic properties. The utilization of ACPs in cancer prevention can
present a viable substitute for conventional cancer therapeutics, as they
possess a higher degree of selectivity and safety. Recent scientific
advancements generate an interest in peptide-based therapies which offer the
advantage of efficiently treating intended cells without negatively impacting
normal cells. However, as the number of peptide sequences continues to increase
rapidly, developing a reliable and precise prediction model becomes a
challenging task. In this work, our motivation is to advance an efficient model
for categorizing anticancer peptides employing the consolidation of word
embedding and deep learning models. First, Word2Vec and FastText are evaluated
as word embedding techniques for the purpose of extracting peptide sequences.
Then, the output of word embedding models are fed into deep learning approaches
CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM. To demonstrate the contribution of proposed framework,
extensive experiments are carried on widely-used datasets in the literature,
ACPs250 and Independent. Experiment results show the usage of proposed model
enhances classification accuracy when compared to the state-of-the-art studies.
The proposed combination, FastText+BiLSTM, exhibits 92.50% of accuracy for
ACPs250 dataset, and 96.15% of accuracy for Independent dataset, thence
determining new state-of-the-art.]]></summary>

general unsupervised autoencoders. The regularisation rests on sampling the
autoencoder Jacobian in Legendre nodes, being the centre of the Gauss-Legendre
quadrature. Revisiting this classic enables to prove that regularised
autoencoders ensure a one-to-one re-embedding of the initial data manifold to
its latent representation. Demonstrations show that prior proposed
regularisation strategies, such as contractive autoencoding, cause topological
defects already for simple examples, and so do convolutional based
(variational) autoencoders. In contrast, topological preservation is ensured
already by standard multilayer perceptron neural networks when being
regularised due to our contribution. This observation extends through the
classic FashionMNIST dataset up to real world encoding problems for MRI brain

geographical locations with diverse conditions and rules of the road, e.g.,
left vs. right-hand traffic. In contrast, existing models for autonomous

model scalability. In this work, we propose AnyD, a single geographically-aware

high-capacity geo-location-based channel attention mechanism that effectively
adapts to local nuances while also flexibly modeling similarities among regions
in a data-driven manner. By optimizing a contrastive imitation objective, our
proposed approach can efficiently scale across inherently imbalanced data
distributions and location-dependent events. We demonstrate the benefits of our
AnyD agent across multiple datasets, cities, and scalable deployment paradigms,
i.e., centralized, semi-supervised, and distributed agent training.
Specifically, AnyD outperforms CIL baselines by over 14% in open-loop

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep learning's immense capabilities are often constrained by the complexity
of its models, leading to an increasing demand for effective sparsification
techniques. Bayesian sparsification for deep learning emerges as a crucial
approach, facilitating the design of models that are both computationally
efficient and competitive in terms of performance across various deep learning
applications. The state-of-the-art -- in Bayesian sparsification of deep neural
networks -- combines structural shrinkage priors on model weights with an
approximate inference scheme based on black-box stochastic variational
inference. However, model inversion of the full generative model is
exceptionally computationally demanding, especially when compared to standard
deep learning of point estimates. In this context, we advocate for the use of
Bayesian model reduction (BMR) as a more efficient alternative for pruning of
model weights. As a generalization of the Savage-Dickey ratio, BMR allows a
post-hoc elimination of redundant model weights based on the posterior
estimates under a straightforward (non-hierarchical) generative model. Our
comparative study highlights the computational efficiency and the pruning rate
of the BMR method relative to the established stochastic variational inference
(SVI) scheme, when applied to the full hierarchical generative model. We
illustrate the potential of BMR to prune model parameters across various deep
learning architectures, from classical networks like LeNet to modern frameworks
such as Vision Transformers and MLP-Mixers.]]></summary>

importance in resolving expensive optimization problems~(EOPs). Extensive
efforts have been devoted to improving the efficacy of SAEAs through the

high-quality solutions is a prerequisite for selection. The fundamental
paradigm of evaluating a limited number of solutions in each generation within
SAEAs reduces the variance of adjacent populations, thus impacting the quality
of offspring solutions. This is a frequently encountered issue, yet it has not
gained widespread attention. This paper presents a framework using unevaluated
solutions to enhance the efficiency of SAEAs. The surrogate model is employed
to identify high-quality solutions for direct generation of new solutions
without evaluation. To ensure dependable selection, we have introduced two
tailored relation models for the selection of the optimal solution and the
unevaluated population. A comprehensive experimental analysis is performed on
two test suites, which showcases the superiority of the relation model over
regression and classification models in the selection phase. Furthermore, the
surrogate-selected unevaluated solutions with high potential have been shown to

temporally successive point clouds. State-of-the-art methods use strong priors
and test-time optimization techniques, but require on the order of tens of
seconds to process large-scale point clouds, making them unusable as computer
vision primitives for real-time applications such as open world object
detection. Feed forward methods are considerably faster, running on the order
of tens to hundreds of milliseconds for large-scale point clouds, but require
expensive human supervision. To address both limitations, we propose Scene Flow
via Distillation, a simple, scalable distillation framework that uses a
label-free optimization method to produce pseudo-labels to supervise a feed
forward model. Our instantiation of this framework, ZeroFlow, achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Argoverse 2 Self-Supervised Scene Flow

the precise, contact-rich, and dexterous manipulation that humans excel at.
However, relying solely on tactile sensing fails to provide adequate cues for
reasoning about objects' spatial configurations, limiting the ability to
correct errors and adapt to changing situations. In this paper, we present
Tactile Adaptation from Visual Incentives (TAVI), a new framework that enhances
tactile-based dexterity by optimizing dexterous policies using vision-based
rewards. First, we use a contrastive-based objective to learn visual
representations. Next, we construct a reward function using these visual
representations through optimal-transport based matching on one human
demonstration. Finally, we use online reinforcement learning on our robot to
optimize tactile-based policies that maximize the visual reward. On six
challenging tasks, such as peg pick-and-place, unstacking bowls, and flipping
slender objects, TAVI achieves a success rate of 73% using our four-fingered
Allegro robot hand. The increase in performance is 108% higher than policies
using tactile and vision-based rewards and 135% higher than policies without
tactile observational input. Robot videos are best viewed on our project

entire population is one of the central problems in statistics. Most classical
techniques assume that the dataset is independent of the analyst's query and
break down in the common setting where a dataset is reused for multiple,
adaptively chosen, queries. This problem of \emph{adaptive data analysis} was
formalized in the seminal works of Dwork et al. (STOC, 2015) and Hardt and
Ullman (FOCS, 2014).

We identify a remarkably simple set of assumptions under which the queries
will continue to be representative even when chosen adaptively: The only
requirements are that each query takes as input a random subsample and outputs
few bits. This result shows that the noise inherent in subsampling is
sufficient to guarantee that query responses generalize. The simplicity of this
subsampling-based framework allows it to model a variety of real-world
scenarios not covered by prior work.

In addition to its simplicity, we demonstrate the utility of this framework
by designing mechanisms for two foundational tasks, statistical queries and
median finding. In particular, our mechanism for answering the broadly
applicable class of statistical queries is both extremely simple and state of
the art in many parameter regimes.]]></summary>

generalized linear models (GLMs) in the presence of additive oblivious noise.
We assume we have sample access to examples $(x, y)$ where $y$ is a noisy
measurement of $g(w^* \cdot x)$. In particular, \new{the noisy labels are of
the form} $y = g(w^* \cdot x) + \xi + \epsilon$, where $\xi$ is the oblivious
noise drawn independently of $x$ \new{and satisfies} $\Pr[\xi = 0] \geq o(1)$,
and $\epsilon \sim \mathcal N(0, \sigma^2)$. Our goal is to accurately recover
a \new{parameter vector $w$ such that the} function $g(w \cdot x)$ \new{has}
arbitrarily small error when compared to the true values $g(w^* \cdot x)$,
rather than the noisy measurements $y$.

We present an algorithm that tackles \new{this} problem in its most general
distribution-independent setting, where the solution may not \new{even} be
identifiable. \new{Our} algorithm returns \new{an accurate estimate of} the
solution if it is identifiable, and otherwise returns a small list of
candidates, one of which is close to the true solution. Furthermore, we
\new{provide} a necessary and sufficient condition for identifiability, which
holds in broad settings. \new{Specifically,} the problem is identifiable when
the quantile at which $\xi + \epsilon = 0$ is known, or when the family of
hypotheses does not contain candidates that are nearly equal to a translated
$g(w^* \cdot x) + A$ for some real number $A$, while also having large error
when compared to $g(w^* \cdot x)$.

This is the first \new{algorithmic} result for GLM regression \new{with
oblivious noise} which can handle more than half the samples being arbitrarily
corrupted. Prior work focused largely on the setting of linear regression, and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Privacy-preserving learning of gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) has
the potential for strong utility-privacy tradeoffs for tabular data, such as
census data or medical meta data: classical GBDT learners can extract
non-linear patterns from small sized datasets. The state-of-the-art notion for
provable privacy-properties is differential privacy, which requires that the
impact of single data points is limited and deniable. We introduce a novel
differentially private GBDT learner and utilize four main techniques to improve
the utility-privacy tradeoff. (1) We use an improved noise scaling approach
with tighter accounting of privacy leakage of a decision tree leaf compared to
prior work, resulting in noise that in expectation scales with $O(1/n)$, for
$n$ data points. (2) We integrate individual R\'enyi filters to our method to
learn from data points that have been underutilized during an iterative
training process, which -- potentially of independent interest -- results in a
natural yet effective insight to learning streams of non-i.i.d. data. (3) We
incorporate the concept of random decision tree splits to concentrate privacy
budget on learning leaves. (4) We deploy subsampling for privacy amplification.
Our evaluation shows for the Abalone dataset ($<4k$ training data points) a
$R^2$-score of $0.39$ for $\varepsilon=0.15$, which the closest prior work only
achieved for $\varepsilon=10.0$. On the Adult dataset ($50k$ training data
points) we achieve test error of $18.7\,\%$ for $\varepsilon=0.07$ which the
closest prior work only achieved for $\varepsilon=1.0$. For the Abalone dataset
for $\varepsilon=0.54$ we achieve $R^2$-score of $0.47$ which is very close to
the $R^2$-score of $0.54$ for the nonprivate version of GBDT. For the Adult
dataset for $\varepsilon=0.54$ we achieve test error $17.1\,\%$ which is very
close to the test error $13.7\,\%$ of the nonprivate version of GBDT.]]></summary>

the purpose of learning properties of quantum systems or of processing
classical or quantum data via quantum computing. As in classical learning,
quantum learning problems involve settings in which the mechanism generating
the data is unknown, and the main goal of a learning algorithm is to ensure
satisfactory accuracy levels when only given access to data and, possibly, side
information such as expert knowledge. This article reviews the complexity of
quantum learning using information-theoretic techniques by focusing on data
complexity, copy complexity, and model complexity. Copy complexity arises from
the destructive nature of quantum measurements, which irreversibly alter the
state to be processed, limiting the information that can be extracted about
quantum data. For example, in a quantum system, unlike in classical machine
learning, it is generally not possible to evaluate the training loss
simultaneously on multiple hypotheses using the same quantum data. To make the
paper self-contained and approachable by different research communities, we
provide extensive background material on classical results from statistical
learning theory, as well as on the distinguishability of quantum states.
Throughout, we highlight the differences between quantum and classical learning
by addressing both supervised and unsupervised learning, and we provide

candidates is one of the earliest steps in drug discovery. As the size of
commercially available compound collections grows exponentially to the scale of
billions, brute-force virtual screening using traditional tools such as docking
becomes infeasible in terms of time and computational resources. Active
learning and Bayesian optimization has recently been proven as effective
methods of narrowing down the search space. An essential component in those
methods is a surrogate machine learning model that is trained with a small
subset of the library to predict the desired properties of compounds. Accurate
model can achieve high sample efficiency by finding the most promising
compounds with only a fraction of the whole library being virtually screened.
In this study, we examined the performance of pretrained transformer-based
language model and graph neural network in Bayesian optimization active
learning framework. The best pretrained models identifies 58.97% of the
top-50000 by docking score after screening only 0.6% of an ultra-large library
containing 99.5 million compounds, improving 8% over previous state-of-the-art
baseline. Through extensive benchmarks, we show that the superior performance
of pretrained models persists in both structure-based and ligand-based drug
discovery. Such model can serve as a boost to the accuracy and sample

deployed and often experience higher success. In this paper, we analyze the
efficacy of the recently developed Transformer-based Neural Network model in
Load forecasting. Transformer models have the potential to improve Load
forecasting because of their ability to learn long-range dependencies derived
from their Attention Mechanism. We apply several metaheuristics namely
Differential Evolution to find the optimal hyperparameters of the
Transformer-based Neural Network to produce accurate forecasts. Differential
Evolution provides scalable, robust, global solutions to non-differentiable,
multi-objective, or constrained optimization problems. Our work compares the
proposed Transformer based Neural Network model integrated with different
metaheuristic algorithms by their performance in Load forecasting based on
numerical metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage
Error (MAPE). Our findings demonstrate the potential of metaheuristic-enhanced
Transformer-based Neural Network models in Load forecasting accuracy and
provide optimal hyperparameters for each model.]]></summary>

applications by identifying and alerting about the OOD samples that should not
be tested or used for making predictions. Current OOD detection methods have
made significant progress when in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples are drawn
from static distributions. However, this can be unrealistic when applied to
real-world systems which often undergo continuous variations and shifts in ID
and OOD distributions over time. Therefore, for an effective application in
real-world systems, the development of OOD detection methods that can adapt to
these dynamic and evolving distributions is essential. In this paper, we
propose a novel and more realistic setting called continuously adaptive
out-of-distribution (CAOOD) detection which targets on developing an OOD
detection model that enables dynamic and quick adaptation to a new arriving
distribution, with insufficient ID samples during deployment time. To address
CAOOD, we develop meta OOD learning (MOL) by designing a learning-to-adapt
diagram such that a good initialized OOD detection model is learned during the
training process. In the testing process, MOL ensures OOD detection performance
over shifting distributions by quickly adapting to new distributions with a few
adaptations. Extensive experiments on several OOD benchmarks endorse the
effectiveness of our method in preserving both ID classification accuracy and
OOD detection performance on continuously shifting distributions.]]></summary>

$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T d})$. The regret bound is the same as that of Soft-Bayes due

language models (LLMs). If a model is trained on a sentence of the form "A is
B", it will not automatically generalize to the reverse direction "B is A".
This is the Reversal Curse. For instance, if a model is trained on "Olaf Scholz
was the ninth Chancellor of Germany", it will not automatically be able to
answer the question, "Who was the ninth Chancellor of Germany?". Moreover, the
likelihood of the correct answer ("Olaf Scholz") will not be higher than for a
random name. Thus, models exhibit a basic failure of logical deduction and do
not generalize a prevalent pattern in their training set (i.e. if "A is B''
occurs, "B is A" is more likely to occur). We provide evidence for the Reversal
Curse by finetuning GPT-3 and Llama-1 on fictitious statements such as "Uriah
Hawthorne is the composer of 'Abyssal Melodies'" and showing that they fail to
correctly answer "Who composed 'Abyssal Melodies?'". The Reversal Curse is
robust across model sizes and model families and is not alleviated by data
augmentation. We also evaluate ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) on questions about
real-world celebrities, such as "Who is Tom Cruise's mother? [A: Mary Lee
Pfeiffer]" and the reverse "Who is Mary Lee Pfeiffer's son?". GPT-4 correctly
answers questions like the former 79% of the time, compared to 33% for the
latter. This shows a failure of logical deduction that we hypothesize is caused
by the Reversal Curse. Code is available at

remarkable success in automatically generating descriptions for audio clips,
namely Automated Audio Captioning (AAC). However, it is labor-intensive and

Motivated by the recent advances in Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining
(CLAP), we propose a weakly-supervised approach to train an AAC model assuming
only text data and a pre-trained CLAP model, alleviating the need for paired
target data. Our approach leverages the similarity between audio and text

CLAP text embedding, and during inference, we decode using the audio
embeddings. To mitigate the modality gap between the audio and text embeddings
we employ strategies to bridge the gap during training and inference stages. We
evaluate our proposed method on Clotho and AudioCaps datasets demonstrating its

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Structure learning is the crux of causal inference. Notably, causal discovery
(CD) algorithms are brittle when data is scarce, possibly inferring imprecise
causal relations that contradict expert knowledge -- especially when
considering latent confounders. To aggravate the issue, most CD methods do not
provide uncertainty estimates, making it hard for users to interpret results
and improve the inference process. Surprisingly, while CD is a human-centered
affair, no works have focused on building methods that both 1) output
uncertainty estimates that can be verified by experts and 2) interact with
those experts to iteratively refine CD. To solve these issues, we start by
proposing to sample (causal) ancestral graphs proportionally to a belief
distribution based on a score function, such as the Bayesian information
criterion (BIC), using generative flow networks. Then, we leverage the
diversity in candidate graphs and introduce an optimal experimental design to
iteratively probe the expert about the relations among variables, effectively
reducing the uncertainty of our belief over ancestral graphs. Finally, we
update our samples to incorporate human feedback via importance sampling.
Importantly, our method does not require causal sufficiency (i.e., unobserved
confounders may exist). Experiments with synthetic observational data show that
our method can accurately sample from distributions over ancestral graphs and
that we can greatly improve inference quality with human aid.]]></summary>

setting in which data from different tasks is presented to the learner in a
streaming fashion. A key challenge in this setting is the so-called
"catastrophic forgetting problem", in which the performance of the learner in
an "old task" decreases when subsequently trained on a "new task". Existing
continual learning methods, such as Averaged Gradient Episodic Memory (A-GEM)
and Orthogonal Gradient Descent (OGD), address catastrophic forgetting by
minimizing the loss for the current task without increasing the loss for
previous tasks. However, these methods assume the learner knows when the task
changes, which is unrealistic in practice. In this paper, we alleviate the need
to provide the algorithm with information about task changes by using an online
clustering-based approach on a dynamically updated finite pool of samples or
gradients. We thereby successfully counteract catastrophic forgetting in one of
the hardest settings, namely: domain-incremental learning, a setting for which
the problem was previously unsolved. We showcase the benefits of our approach
by applying these ideas to projection-based methods, such as A-GEM and OGD,
which lead to task-agnostic versions of them. Experiments on real datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy and its promising

previous deep forecasting models to generalize to new roads not seen in the
training data (unseen roads) are rarely explored. In this paper, we introduce a
novel setup called a spatio-temporal (ST) split to evaluate the models'
capabilities to generalize to unseen roads. In this setup, the models are
trained on data from a sample of roads, but tested on roads not seen in the
training data. Moreover, we also present a novel framework called Spatial
Contrastive Pre-Training (SCPT) where we introduce a spatial encoder module to
extract latent features from unseen roads during inference time. This spatial
encoder is pre-trained using contrastive learning. During inference, the
spatial encoder only requires two days of traffic data on the new roads and
does not require any re-training. We also show that the output from the spatial
encoder can be used effectively to infer latent node embeddings on unseen roads
during inference time. The SCPT framework also incorporates a new layer, named
the spatially gated addition (SGA) layer, to effectively combine the latent
features from the output of the spatial encoder to existing backbones.
Additionally, since there is limited data on the unseen roads, we argue that it
is better to decouple traffic signals to trivial-to-capture periodic signals
and difficult-to-capture Markovian signals, and for the spatial encoder to only
learn the Markovian signals. Finally, we empirically evaluated SCPT using the
ST split setup on four real-world datasets. The results showed that adding SCPT
to a backbone consistently improves forecasting performance on unseen roads.
More importantly, the improvements are greater when forecasting further into
the future. The codes are available on GitHub:

signals, this discrepancy results in new subjects need spend a amount of
calibration time for EEG-based motor imagery brain-computer interface. In order

through the 3D convolution module, and then the spatial-channel attention
mechanism is used to strengthen the features, and the final convolution module
can further learn the spatial-temporal information of the features. Finally, to
account for inter-subject and cross-sessions differences, we employ a dynamic
domain-adaptive strategy, the distance between features is reduced by
introducing a Maximum Mean Discrepancy loss function, and the classification
layer is fine-tuned by using part of the target domain data. We verify the

around the problem of connecting large collections of sheet music (images) to
corresponding audio recordings, that is, identifying pairs of audio and score
excerpts that refer to the same musical content. One of the typical and most
recent approaches to this task employs cross-modal deep learning architectures
to learn joint embedding spaces that link the two distinct modalities - audio
and sheet music images. While there has been steady improvement on this front
over the past years, a number of open problems still prevent large-scale
employment of this methodology. In this article we attempt to provide an
insightful examination of the current developments on audio-sheet music
retrieval via deep learning methods. We first identify a set of main challenges
on the road towards robust and large-scale cross-modal music retrieval in real
scenarios. We then highlight the steps we have taken so far to address some of
these challenges, documenting step-by-step improvement along several
dimensions. We conclude by analysing the remaining challenges and present ideas
for solving these, in order to pave the way to a unified and robust methodology

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Electroencephalogram (EEG) data compression is necessary for wireless
recording applications to reduce the amount of data that needs to be
transmitted. In this paper, an asymmetrical sparse autoencoder with a discrete
cosine transform (DCT) layer is proposed to compress EEG signals. The encoder
module of the autoencoder has a combination of a fully connected linear layer
and the DCT layer to reduce redundant data using hard-thresholding
nonlinearity. Furthermore, the DCT layer includes trainable hard-thresholding
parameters and scaling layers to give emphasis or de-emphasis on individual DCT
coefficients. Finally, the one-by-one convolutional layer generates the latent
space. The sparsity penalty-based cost function is employed to keep the feature
map as sparse as possible in the latent space. The latent space data is
transmitted to the receiver. The decoder module of the autoencoder is designed
using the inverse DCT and two fully connected linear layers to improve the
accuracy of data reconstruction. In comparison to other state-of-the-art
methods, the proposed method significantly improves the average quality score
in various data compression experiments.]]></summary>

Relying on Stone-Weierstrass theorems on weighted spaces, we can prove a global
universal approximation result for generalizations of continuous functions
going beyond the usual approximation on compact sets. This then applies in
particular to approximation of (non-anticipative) path space functionals via
functional input neural networks. As a further application of the weighted
Stone-Weierstrass theorem we prove a global universal approximation result for
linear functions of the signature. We also introduce the viewpoint of Gaussian
process regression in this setting and show that the reproducing kernel Hilbert

treatment assignment policies across various domains, including healthcare and
e-commerce. However, it remains understudied in the contextual bandit setting.
We propose a new family of computationally efficient bandit algorithms for the
stochastic contextual bandit settings, with the flexibility to be adapted for
cumulative regret minimization (with near-optimal minimax guarantees) and
simple regret minimization (with SOTA guarantees). Furthermore, our algorithms
adapt to model misspecification and extend to the continuous arm settings.
These advantages come from constructing and relying on "conformal arm sets"
(CASs), which provide a set of arms at every context that encompass the
context-specific optimal arm with some probability across the context
distribution. Our positive results on simple and cumulative regret guarantees
are contrasted by a negative result, which shows that an algorithm can't
achieve instance-dependent simple regret guarantees while simultaneously
achieving minimax optimal cumulative regret guarantees.]]></summary>

are altruistic about sharing their data with the server for the collective good
whenever needed. Despite their compelling theoretical guarantee on performance
and communication efficiency, this assumption is overly idealistic and
oftentimes violated in practice, especially when the algorithm is operated over
self-interested clients, who are reluctant to share data without explicit
benefits. Negligence of such self-interested behaviors can significantly affect
the learning efficiency and even the practical operability of federated bandit
learning. In light of this, we aim to spark new insights into this
under-explored research area by formally introducing an incentivized
communication problem for federated bandits, where the server shall motivate
clients to share data by providing incentives. Without loss of generality, we
instantiate this bandit problem with the contextual linear setting and propose
the first incentivized communication protocol, namely, Inc-FedUCB, that
achieves near-optimal regret with provable communication and incentive cost
guarantees. Extensive empirical experiments on both synthetic and real-world

participants' data to train an improved global model. In federated learning,
participants cooperatively train a global model, and they will receive the
global model and payments. Rational participants try to maximize their
individual utility, and they will not input their high-quality data truthfully
unless they are provided with satisfactory payments based on their data
quality. Furthermore, federated learning benefits from the cooperative
contributions of participants. Accordingly, how to establish an incentive
mechanism that both incentivizes inputting data truthfully and promotes stable
cooperation has become an important issue to consider. In this paper, we
introduce a data sharing game model for federated learning and employ
game-theoretic approaches to design a core-selecting incentive mechanism by
utilizing a popular concept in cooperative games, the core. In federated
learning, the core can be empty, resulting in the core-selecting mechanism
becoming infeasible. To address this, our core-selecting mechanism employs a
relaxation method and simultaneously minimizes the benefits of inputting false
data for all participants. However, this mechanism is computationally expensive
because it requires aggregating exponential models for all possible coalitions,
which is infeasible in federated learning. To address this, we propose an
efficient core-selecting mechanism based on sampling approximation that only
aggregates models on sampled coalitions to approximate the exact result.
Extensive experiments verify that the efficient core-selecting mechanism can
incentivize inputting high-quality data and stable cooperation, while it
reduces computational overhead compared to the core-selecting mechanism.]]></summary>

methods, including a new method designed by us. Additionally, we explore
real-world applications of community detection in diverse networks. In

in a variety of use cases, including journalistic news articles. Given the
potential malicious nature in which these LLMs can be used to generate
disinformation at scale, it is important to build effective detectors for such
AI-generated text. Given the surge in development of new LLMs, acquiring
labeled training data for supervised detectors is a bottleneck. However, there
might be plenty of unlabeled text data available, without information on which
generator it came from. In this work we tackle this data problem, in detecting
AI-generated news text, and frame the problem as an unsupervised domain
adaptation task. Here the domains are the different text generators, i.e. LLMs,
and we assume we have access to only the labeled source data and unlabeled
target data. We develop a Contrastive Domain Adaptation framework, called
ConDA, that blends standard domain adaptation techniques with the
representation power of contrastive learning to learn domain invariant
representations that are effective for the final unsupervised detection task.
Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, resulting in
average performance gains of 31.7% from the best performing baselines, and
within 0.8% margin of a fully supervised detector. All our code and data is

contrastive learning (CL) plays a key role. However, the recent development of
new non-CL frameworks has achieved comparable or better performance with high
improvement potential, prompting researchers to enhance these frameworks
further. Assimilating CL into non-CL frameworks has been thought to be
beneficial, but empirical evidence indicates no visible improvements. In view
of that, this paper proposes a strategy of performing CL along the dimensional
direction instead of along the batch direction as done in conventional
contrastive learning, named Dimensional Contrastive Learning (DimCL). DimCL
aims to enhance the feature diversity, and it can serve as a regularizer to
prior SSL frameworks. DimCL has been found to be effective, and the
hardness-aware property is identified as a critical reason for its success.
Extensive experimental results reveal that assimilating DimCL into SSL

optimization of quantum algorithms in the current era of noisy intermediate
scale quantum (NISQ) computers. A fundamental challenge in quantum machine
learning is generalization, as the designer targets performance under testing
conditions, while having access only to limited training data. Existing
generalization analyses, while identifying important general trends and scaling
laws, cannot be used to assign reliable and informative "error bars" to the
decisions made by quantum models. In this article, we propose a general
methodology that can reliably quantify the uncertainty of quantum models,
irrespective of the amount of training data, of the number of shots, of the
ansatz, of the training algorithm, and of the presence of quantum hardware
noise. The approach, which builds on probabilistic conformal prediction, turns
an arbitrary, possibly small, number of shots from a pre-trained quantum model
into a set prediction, e.g., an interval, that provably contains the true
target with any desired coverage level. Experimental results confirm the
theoretical calibration guarantees of the proposed framework, referred to as

achieving goal directed behavior over long sequences of actions. However, it
has been challenging to implement in realistic or open-ended environments. A
main challenge has been to find the right space of sub-goals over which to
instantiate a hierarchy. We present a novel approach where we use data from
humans solving these tasks to softly supervise the goal space for a set of long
range tasks in a 3D embodied environment. In particular, we use unconstrained
natural language to parameterize this space. This has two advantages: first, it
is easy to generate this data from naive human participants; second, it is
flexible enough to represent a vast range of sub-goals in human-relevant tasks.
Our approach outperforms agents that clone expert behavior on these tasks, as
well as HRL from scratch without this supervised sub-goal space. Our work
presents a novel approach to combining human expert supervision with the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are widely used explainable-by-design
models in various applications. GAMs assume that the output can be represented
as a sum of univariate functions, referred to as components. However, this
assumption fails in ML problems where the output depends on multiple features
simultaneously. In these cases, GAMs fail to capture the interaction terms of
the underlying function, leading to subpar accuracy. To (partially) address
this issue, we propose Regionally Additive Models (RAMs), a novel class of
explainable-by-design models. RAMs identify subregions within the feature space
where interactions are minimized. Within these regions, it is more accurate to
express the output as a sum of univariate functions (components). Consequently,
RAMs fit one component per subregion of each feature instead of one component
per feature. This approach yields a more expressive model compared to GAMs
while retaining interpretability. The RAM framework consists of three steps.
Firstly, we train a black-box model. Secondly, using Regional Effect Plots, we
identify subregions where the black-box model exhibits near-local additivity.
Lastly, we fit a GAM component for each identified subregion. We validate the
effectiveness of RAMs through experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets. The results confirm that RAMs offer improved expressiveness compared
to GAMs while maintaining interpretability.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The use of skills (a.k.a., options) can greatly accelerate exploration in
reinforcement learning, especially when only sparse reward signals are
available. While option discovery methods have been proposed for individual
agents, in multi-agent reinforcement learning settings, discovering
collaborative options that can coordinate the behavior of multiple agents and
encourage them to visit the under-explored regions of their joint state space
has not been considered. In this case, we propose Multi-agent Deep Covering
Option Discovery, which constructs the multi-agent options through minimizing
the expected cover time of the multiple agents' joint state space. Also, we
propose a novel framework to adopt the multi-agent options in the MARL process.
In practice, a multi-agent task can usually be divided into some sub-tasks,
each of which can be completed by a sub-group of the agents. Therefore, our
algorithm framework first leverages an attention mechanism to find
collaborative agent sub-groups that would benefit most from coordinated
actions. Then, a hierarchical algorithm, namely HA-MSAC, is developed to learn
the multi-agent options for each sub-group to complete their sub-tasks first,
and then to integrate them through a high-level policy as the solution of the
whole task. This hierarchical option construction allows our framework to
strike a balance between scalability and effective collaboration among the
agents. The evaluation based on multi-agent collaborative tasks shows that the
proposed algorithm can effectively capture the agent interactions with the
attention mechanism, successfully identify multi-agent options, and
significantly outperforms prior works using single-agent options or no options,
in terms of both faster exploration and higher task rewards.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Designing reward functions is a longstanding challenge in reinforcement
learning (RL); it requires specialized knowledge or domain data, leading to
high costs for development. To address this, we introduce Text2Reward, a
data-free framework that automates the generation of dense reward functions
based on large language models (LLMs). Given a goal described in natural
language, Text2Reward generates dense reward functions as an executable program
grounded in a compact representation of the environment. Unlike inverse RL and
recent work that uses LLMs to write sparse reward codes, Text2Reward produces
interpretable, free-form dense reward codes that cover a wide range of tasks,
utilize existing packages, and allow iterative refinement with human feedback.
We evaluate Text2Reward on two robotic manipulation benchmarks (ManiSkill2,
MetaWorld) and two locomotion environments of MuJoCo. On 13 of the 17
manipulation tasks, policies trained with generated reward codes achieve
similar or better task success rates and convergence speed than expert-written
reward codes. For locomotion tasks, our method learns six novel locomotion
behaviors with a success rate exceeding 94%. Furthermore, we show that the
policies trained in the simulator with our method can be deployed in the real
world. Finally, Text2Reward further improves the policies by refining their
reward functions with human feedback. Video results are available at

points, and optimizing discrepancy energies. Furthermore, to obtain an unbiased
estimation for stochastic optimization, we extend QSW into Randomized
Quasi-Sliced Wasserstein (RQSW) by introducing randomness to the discussed
low-discrepancy sequences. For theoretical properties, we prove the asymptotic
convergence of QSW and the unbiasedness of RQSW. Finally, we conduct

generative model in which the parameters of a set of independent distributions
are modified with Bayesian inference in the light of noisy data samples, then
passed as input to a neural network that outputs a second, interdependent

distributions yields a generative procedure similar to the reverse process of
diffusion models; however it is conceptually simpler in that no forward process
is required. Discrete and continuous-time loss functions are derived for
continuous, discretised and discrete data, along with sample generation
procedures. Notably, the network inputs for discrete data lie on the
probability simplex, and are therefore natively differentiable, paving the way
for gradient-based sample guidance and few-step generation in discrete domains
such as language modelling. The loss function directly optimises data
compression and places no restrictions on the network architecture. In our
experiments BFNs achieve competitive log-likelihoods for image modelling on
dynamically binarized MNIST and CIFAR-10, and outperform all known discrete

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Structure learning is the crux of causal inference. Notably, causal discovery
(CD) algorithms are brittle when data is scarce, possibly inferring imprecise
causal relations that contradict expert knowledge -- especially when
considering latent confounders. To aggravate the issue, most CD methods do not
provide uncertainty estimates, making it hard for users to interpret results
and improve the inference process. Surprisingly, while CD is a human-centered
affair, no works have focused on building methods that both 1) output
uncertainty estimates that can be verified by experts and 2) interact with
those experts to iteratively refine CD. To solve these issues, we start by
proposing to sample (causal) ancestral graphs proportionally to a belief
distribution based on a score function, such as the Bayesian information
criterion (BIC), using generative flow networks. Then, we leverage the
diversity in candidate graphs and introduce an optimal experimental design to
iteratively probe the expert about the relations among variables, effectively
reducing the uncertainty of our belief over ancestral graphs. Finally, we
update our samples to incorporate human feedback via importance sampling.
Importantly, our method does not require causal sufficiency (i.e., unobserved
confounders may exist). Experiments with synthetic observational data show that
our method can accurately sample from distributions over ancestral graphs and
that we can greatly improve inference quality with human aid.]]></summary>

ecological civilization patterns for achieving Sustainable Development Goals
(namely, sustainable development patterns), are of utmost importance for
promoting ecological, economic, social, and resource sustainability in a
specific region. To achieve this, the recommendation process must carefully
consider the region's natural, environmental, resource, and economic
characteristics. However, current recommendation algorithms in the field of
computer science fall short in adequately addressing the spatial heterogeneity
related to environment and sparsity of regional historical interaction data,
which limits their effectiveness in recommending sustainable development
patterns. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a method called
User Graph after Pruning and Intent Graph (UGPIG). Firstly, we utilize the
high-density linking capability of the pruned User Graph to address the issue
of spatial heterogeneity neglect in recommendation algorithms. Secondly, we
construct an Intent Graph by incorporating the intent network, which captures
the preferences for attributes including environmental elements of target
regions. This approach effectively alleviates the problem of sparse historical
interaction data in the region. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate
that UGPIG outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms like KGCN,
KGAT, and KGIN in sustainable development pattern recommendations, with a
maximum improvement of 9.61% in Top-3 recommendation performance.]]></summary>

Such trajectory big data bring new opportunities to human mobility research but
also raise public concerns with regard to location privacy. In this work, we
present the Conditional Adversarial Trajectory Synthesis (CATS), a
deep-learning-based GeoAI methodological framework for privacy-preserving
trajectory data generation and publication. CATS applies K-anonymity to the
underlying spatiotemporal distributions of human movements, which provides a
distributional-level strong privacy guarantee. By leveraging conditional
adversarial training on K-anonymized human mobility matrices, trajectory global
context learning using the attention-based mechanism, and recurrent bipartite
graph matching of adjacent trajectory points, CATS is able to reconstruct
trajectory topology from conditionally sampled locations and generate
high-quality individual-level synthetic trajectory data, which can serve as
supplements or alternatives to raw data for privacy-preserving trajectory data
publication. The experiment results on over 90k GPS trajectories show that our
method has a better performance in privacy preservation, spatiotemporal
characteristic preservation, and downstream utility compared with baseline
methods, which brings new insights into privacy-preserving human mobility

control problem whose state space is the $d$-dimensional positive orthant. The
controlled process $Z$ evolves as a reflected Brownian motion whose covariance
matrix is exogenously specified, as are its directions of reflection from the
orthant's boundary surfaces. A system manager chooses a drift vector
$\theta(t)$ at each time $t$ based on the history of $Z$, and the cost rate at
time $t$ depends on both $Z(t)$ and $\theta(t)$. In our initial problem
formulation, the objective is to minimize expected discounted cost over an
infinite planning horizon, after which we treat the corresponding ergodic
control problem. Extending earlier work by Han et al. (Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences, 2018, 8505-8510), we develop and illustrate a
simulation-based computational method that relies heavily on deep neural

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We consider the problem of training private recommendation models with access
to public item features. Training with Differential Privacy (DP) offers strong
privacy guarantees, at the expense of loss in recommendation quality. We show
that incorporating public item features during training can help mitigate this
loss in quality. We propose a general approach based on collective matrix
factorization (CMF), that works by simultaneously factorizing two matrices: the
user feedback matrix (representing sensitive data) and an item feature matrix
that encodes publicly available (non-sensitive) item information.

The method is conceptually simple, easy to tune, and highly scalable. It can
be applied to different types of public item data, including: (1) categorical
item features; (2) item-item similarities learned from public sources; and (3)
publicly available user feedback. Furthermore, these data modalities can be
collectively utilized to fully leverage public data.

Evaluating our method on a standard DP recommendation benchmark, we find that
using public item features significantly narrows the quality gap between
private models and their non-private counterparts. As privacy constraints
become more stringent, models rely more heavily on public side features for
recommendation. This results in a smooth transition from collaborative
filtering to item-based contextual recommendations.]]></summary>

consequently has seen considerable attention in current literature, where state
of the art approaches focus on self-attentive models leveraging contextual

however, most of these studies focus on long-form content domains (retail,

explore incorporating negative session-level feedback during training. In this
study, we investigate the use of transformer-based self-attentive architectures
to learn implicit session-level information for sequential music
recommendation. We additionally propose a contrastive learning task to
incorporate negative feedback (e.g skipped tracks) to promote positive hits and
penalize negative hits. This task is formulated as a simple loss term that can
be incorporated into a variety of deep learning architectures for sequential
recommendation. Our experiments show that this results in consistent

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A sequential pattern with negation, or negative sequential pattern, takes the
form of a sequential pattern for which the negation symbol may be used in front
of some of the pattern's itemsets. Intuitively, such a pattern occurs in a
sequence if negated itemsets are absent in the sequence. Recent work has shown
that different semantics can be attributed to these pattern forms, and that
state-of-the-art algorithms do not extract the same sets of patterns. This
raises the important question of the interpretability of sequential pattern
with negation. In this study, our focus is on exploring how potential users
perceive negation in sequential patterns. Our aim is to determine whether
specific semantics are more "intuitive" than others and whether these align
with the semantics employed by one or more state-of-the-art algorithms. To
achieve this, we designed a questionnaire to reveal the semantics' intuition of
each user. This article presents both the design of the questionnaire and an
in-depth analysis of the 124 responses obtained. The outcomes indicate that two
of the semantics are predominantly intuitive; however, neither of them aligns
with the semantics of the primary state-of-the-art algorithms. As a result, we
provide recommendations to account for this disparity in the conclusions drawn.]]></summary>

networks -- combines structural shrinkage priors on model weights with an
approximate inference scheme based on black-box stochastic variational
inference. However, model inversion of the full generative model is
exceptionally computationally demanding, especially when compared to standard
deep learning of point estimates. In this context, we advocate for the use of
Bayesian model reduction (BMR) as a more efficient alternative for pruning of
model weights. As a generalization of the Savage-Dickey ratio, BMR allows a
post-hoc elimination of redundant model weights based on the posterior
estimates under a straightforward (non-hierarchical) generative model. Our
comparative study highlights the computational efficiency and the pruning rate
of the BMR method relative to the established stochastic variational inference
(SVI) scheme, when applied to the full hierarchical generative model. We
illustrate the potential of BMR to prune model parameters across various deep
learning architectures, from classical networks like LeNet to modern frameworks
such as Vision Transformers and MLP-Mixers.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While training fair machine learning models has been studied extensively in
recent years, most developed methods rely on the assumption that the training
and test data have similar distributions. In the presence of distribution
shifts, fair models may behave unfairly on test data. There have been some
developments for fair learning robust to distribution shifts to address this
shortcoming. However, most proposed solutions are based on the assumption of
having access to the causal graph describing the interaction of different
features. Moreover, existing algorithms require full access to data and cannot
be used when small batches are used (stochastic/batch implementation). This
paper proposes the first stochastic distributionally robust fairness framework
with convergence guarantees that do not require knowledge of the causal graph.
More specifically, we formulate the fair inference in the presence of the
distribution shift as a distributionally robust optimization problem under
$L_p$ norm uncertainty sets with respect to the Exponential Renyi Mutual
Information (ERMI) as the measure of fairness violation. We then discuss how
the proposed method can be implemented in a stochastic fashion. We have
evaluated the presented framework's performance and efficiency through
extensive experiments on real datasets consisting of distribution shifts.]]></summary>

extends its exploration into other time series datasets. Three different
experiments are conducted in this study to test the applicability of imitating
Tsallis entropy for performance enhancement: Bitcoin price prediction, speech
emotion recognition, and chronic neck pain detection. For the Bitcoin price
prediction, models embedded with FINs reduced the root mean square error by
around 1000 compared to the baseline. In the speech emotion recognition task,
the FIN-augmented model increased classification accuracy by over 3 percent.
Lastly, in the CNP detection experiment, an improvement of about 7 percent was

modalities (especially vision) have achieved unprecedented performance in
various multimodal tasks. However, due to the unsolved adversarial robustness
problem of vision models, MLLMs can have more severe safety and security risks
by introducing the vision inputs. In this work, we study the adversarial
robustness of Google's Bard, a competitive chatbot to ChatGPT that released its
multimodal capability recently, to better understand the vulnerabilities of
commercial MLLMs. By attacking white-box surrogate vision encoders or MLLMs,
the generated adversarial examples can mislead Bard to output wrong image
descriptions with a 22% success rate based solely on the transferability. We
show that the adversarial examples can also attack other MLLMs, e.g., a 26%
attack success rate against Bing Chat and a 86% attack success rate against
ERNIE bot. Moreover, we identify two defense mechanisms of Bard, including face
detection and toxicity detection of images. We design corresponding attacks to
evade these defenses, demonstrating that the current defenses of Bard are also
vulnerable. We hope this work can deepen our understanding on the robustness of
MLLMs and facilitate future research on defenses. Our code is available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Self-supervised representation learning has seen remarkable progress in the
last few years, with some of the recent methods being able to learn useful
image representations without labels. These methods are trained using
backpropagation, the de facto standard. Recently, Geoffrey Hinton proposed the
forward-forward algorithm as an alternative training method. It utilizes two
forward passes and a separate loss function for each layer to train the network
without backpropagation.

In this study, for the first time, we study the performance of
forward-forward vs. backpropagation for self-supervised representation learning
and provide insights into the learned representation spaces. Our benchmark
employs four standard datasets, namely MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR-10, and
three commonly used self-supervised representation learning techniques, namely
rotation, flip and jigsaw.

Our main finding is that while the forward-forward algorithm performs
comparably to backpropagation during (self-)supervised training, the transfer
performance is significantly lagging behind in all the studied settings. This
may be caused by a combination of factors, including having a loss function for
each layer and the way the supervised training is realized in the
forward-forward paradigm. In comparison to backpropagation, the forward-forward
algorithm focuses more on the boundaries and drops part of the information
unnecessary for making decisions which harms the representation learning goal.
Further investigation and research are necessary to stabilize the
forward-forward strategy for self-supervised learning, to work beyond the
datasets and configurations demonstrated by Geoffrey Hinton.]]></summary>

sheet music images to audio recordings. A typical and recent approach to this
is to learn, via deep neural networks, a joint embedding space that correlates
short fixed-size snippets of audio and sheet music by means of an appropriate
similarity structure. However, two challenges that arise out of this strategy
are the requirement of strongly aligned data to train the networks, and the
inherent discrepancies of musical content between audio and sheet music
snippets caused by local and global tempo differences. In this paper, we
address these two shortcomings by designing a cross-modal recurrent network
that learns joint embeddings that can summarize longer passages of
corresponding audio and sheet music. The benefits of our method are that it
only requires weakly aligned audio-sheet music pairs, as well as that the
recurrent network handles the non-linearities caused by tempo variations
between audio and sheet music. We conduct a number of experiments on synthetic
and real piano data and scores, showing that our proposed recurrent method
leads to more accurate retrieval in all possible configurations.]]></summary>

rendezvous due to their small form factor and inexpensive power, mass, and
volume costs. When it comes to docking, however, they typically serve a
secondary role, whereas the main work is done by active sensors such as lidar.
This paper documents the development of a proposed AI-based (artificial

visible wavelength cameras as a main sensor for docking and on-orbit servicing
(OOS), reducing the dependency on lidar and greatly reducing costs.
Specifically, the use of AI enables the expansion of the relative navigation
solution towards multiple classes of scenarios, e.g., in terms of targets or
illumination conditions, which would otherwise have to be crafted on a
case-by-case manner using classical image processing methods. Multiple
convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone architectures are benchmarked on
synthetically generated data of docking manoeuvres with the International Space
Station (ISS), achieving position and attitude estimates close to 1%
range-normalised and 1 deg, respectively. The integration of the solution with

of such surveys are regularly administered by the U.S. government. However,
they field independent, unconnected samples with specialized questions,
limiting research questions to those that can be answered by a single survey.
The fusionACS project seeks to integrate data from multiple U.S. household
surveys by statistically "fusing" variables from "donor" surveys onto American
Community Survey (ACS) microdata. This results in an integrated microdataset of
household attributes and well-being dimensions that can be analyzed to address
research questions in ways that are not currently possible. The presented data
comprise the fusion onto the ACS of select donor variables from the Residential
Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) of 2015, the National Household Transportation
Survey (NHTS) of 2017, the American Housing Survey (AHS) of 2019, and the
Consumer Expenditure Survey - Interview (CEI) for the years 2015-2019. The
underlying statistical techniques are included in an open-source $R$ package,
fusionModel, that provides generic tools for the creation, analysis, and
validation of fused microdata.]]></summary>

recent years, most developed methods rely on the assumption that the training
and test data have similar distributions. In the presence of distribution
shifts, fair models may behave unfairly on test data. There have been some
developments for fair learning robust to distribution shifts to address this
shortcoming. However, most proposed solutions are based on the assumption of
having access to the causal graph describing the interaction of different
features. Moreover, existing algorithms require full access to data and cannot
be used when small batches are used (stochastic/batch implementation). This
paper proposes the first stochastic distributionally robust fairness framework
with convergence guarantees that do not require knowledge of the causal graph.
More specifically, we formulate the fair inference in the presence of the
distribution shift as a distributionally robust optimization problem under
$L_p$ norm uncertainty sets with respect to the Exponential Renyi Mutual
Information (ERMI) as the measure of fairness violation. We then discuss how
the proposed method can be implemented in a stochastic fashion. We have
evaluated the presented framework's performance and efficiency through
extensive experiments on real datasets consisting of distribution shifts.]]></summary>

particularly in the context of social media platforms, where the goal is to
maximize user engagement and revenue while maintaining a satisfactory user
experience. This requires the optimization of conflicting objectives, such as
user satisfaction and ads revenue. Traditional approaches to ad-load balancing
rely on static allocation policies, which fail to adapt to changing user
preferences and contextual factors. In this paper, we present an approach that
leverages off-policy learning and evaluation from logged bandit feedback. We
start by presenting a motivating analysis of the ad-load balancing problem,
highlighting the conflicting objectives between user satisfaction and ads
revenue. We emphasize the nuances that arise due to user heterogeneity and the
dependence on the user's position within a session. Based on this analysis, we
define the problem as determining the optimal ad-load for a particular feed
fetch. To tackle this problem, we propose an off-policy learning framework that
leverages unbiased estimators such as Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) and
Doubly Robust (DR) to learn and estimate the policy values using offline
collected stochastic data. We present insights from online A/B experiments
deployed at scale across over 80 million users generating over 200 million
sessions, where we find statistically significant improvements in both user
satisfaction metrics and ads revenue for the platform.]]></summary>

platforms, users are becoming more concerned about their privacy. And
recommender system is the core component of online platforms for providing
personalized service, consequently, its privacy preservation has attracted
great attention. As the gold standard of privacy protection, differential
privacy has been widely adopted to preserve privacy in recommender systems.
However, existing differentially private recommender systems only consider
static and independent interactions, so they cannot apply to sequential
recommendation where behaviors are dynamic and dependent. Meanwhile, little
attention has been paid on the privacy risk of sensitive user features, most of
them only protect user feedbacks. In this work, we propose a novel
DIfferentially Private Sequential recommendation framework with a noisy Graph
Neural Network approach (denoted as DIPSGNN) to address these limitations. To
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to achieve differential privacy in
sequential recommendation with dependent interactions. Specifically, in
DIPSGNN, we first leverage piecewise mechanism to protect sensitive user
features. Then, we innovatively add calibrated noise into aggregation step of
graph neural network based on aggregation perturbation mechanism. And this
noisy graph neural network can protect sequentially dependent interactions and
capture user preferences simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our method over state-of-the-art differentially private
recommender systems in terms of better balance between privacy and accuracy.]]></summary>

structural topology optimization utilizing the SIMP algorithm. Consequently,
our framework generates inherently near-optimal designs. Our work presents
quantitative results that support the structural performance of the generated
designs and the variability in potential candidate designs. Furthermore, we
provide evidence of the scalability of our framework by operating over voxel

approach for the Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance, which has an intractable
expectation in its analytical form. However, the MC method is not optimal in
terms of minimizing the absolute approximation error. To provide a better class
of empirical SW, we propose quasi-sliced Wasserstein (QSW) approximations that
rely on Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. For a comprehensive investigation of
QMC for SW, we focus on the 3D setting, specifically computing the SW between
probability measures in three dimensions. In greater detail, we empirically
verify various ways of constructing QMC points sets on the 3D unit-hypersphere,
including Gaussian-based mapping, equal area mapping, generalized spiral
points, and optimizing discrepancy energies. Furthermore, to obtain an unbiased
estimation for stochastic optimization, we extend QSW into Randomized
Quasi-Sliced Wasserstein (RQSW) by introducing randomness to the discussed
low-discrepancy sequences. For theoretical properties, we prove the asymptotic
convergence of QSW and the unbiasedness of RQSW. Finally, we conduct
experiments on various 3D tasks, such as point-cloud comparison, point-cloud
interpolation, image style transfer, and training deep point-cloud
autoencoders, to demonstrate the favorable performance of the proposed QSW and

generalized linear models (GLMs) in the presence of additive oblivious noise.
We assume we have sample access to examples $(x, y)$ where $y$ is a noisy
measurement of $g(w^* \cdot x)$. In particular, \new{the noisy labels are of
the form} $y = g(w^* \cdot x) + \xi + \epsilon$, where $\xi$ is the oblivious
noise drawn independently of $x$ \new{and satisfies} $\Pr[\xi = 0] \geq o(1)$,
and $\epsilon \sim \mathcal N(0, \sigma^2)$. Our goal is to accurately recover
a \new{parameter vector $w$ such that the} function $g(w \cdot x)$ \new{has}
arbitrarily small error when compared to the true values $g(w^* \cdot x)$,
rather than the noisy measurements $y$.

We present an algorithm that tackles \new{this} problem in its most general
distribution-independent setting, where the solution may not \new{even} be
identifiable. \new{Our} algorithm returns \new{an accurate estimate of} the
solution if it is identifiable, and otherwise returns a small list of
candidates, one of which is close to the true solution. Furthermore, we
\new{provide} a necessary and sufficient condition for identifiability, which
holds in broad settings. \new{Specifically,} the problem is identifiable when
the quantile at which $\xi + \epsilon = 0$ is known, or when the family of
hypotheses does not contain candidates that are nearly equal to a translated
$g(w^* \cdot x) + A$ for some real number $A$, while also having large error
when compared to $g(w^* \cdot x)$.

This is the first \new{algorithmic} result for GLM regression \new{with
oblivious noise} which can handle more than half the samples being arbitrarily
corrupted. Prior work focused largely on the setting of linear regression, and

key parameters are the number of data considered at each step or batch size
$B$, and the step size or learning rate $\eta$. For small $B$ and large $\eta$,
SGD corresponds to a stochastic evolution of the parameters, whose noise
amplitude is governed by the `temperature' $T\equiv \eta/B$. Yet this
description is observed to break down for sufficiently large batches $B\geq
B^*$, or simplifies to gradient descent (GD) when the temperature is
sufficiently small. Understanding where these cross-overs take place remains a
central challenge. Here we resolve these questions for a teacher-student
perceptron classification model, and show empirically that our key predictions
still apply to deep networks. Specifically, we obtain a phase diagram in the
$B$-$\eta$ plane that separates three dynamical phases: $\textit{(i)}$ a
noise-dominated SGD governed by temperature, $\textit{(ii)}$ a
large-first-step-dominated SGD and $\textit{(iii)}$ GD. These different phases
also corresponds to different regimes of generalization error. Remarkably, our
analysis reveals that the batch size $B^*$ separating regimes $\textit{(i)}$
and $\textit{(ii)}$ scale with the size $P$ of the training set, with an
exponent that characterizes the hardness of the classification problem.]]></summary>

models in various applications. GAMs assume that the output can be represented
as a sum of univariate functions, referred to as components. However, this
assumption fails in ML problems where the output depends on multiple features
simultaneously. In these cases, GAMs fail to capture the interaction terms of
the underlying function, leading to subpar accuracy. To (partially) address
this issue, we propose Regionally Additive Models (RAMs), a novel class of
explainable-by-design models. RAMs identify subregions within the feature space
where interactions are minimized. Within these regions, it is more accurate to
express the output as a sum of univariate functions (components). Consequently,
RAMs fit one component per subregion of each feature instead of one component
per feature. This approach yields a more expressive model compared to GAMs
while retaining interpretability. The RAM framework consists of three steps.
Firstly, we train a black-box model. Secondly, using Regional Effect Plots, we
identify subregions where the black-box model exhibits near-local additivity.
Lastly, we fit a GAM component for each identified subregion. We validate the
effectiveness of RAMs through experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets. The results confirm that RAMs offer improved expressiveness compared
to GAMs while maintaining interpretability.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I created a voice profile based on recordings of my own voice over on voice.ai.
 The audio was crisp, loud and clear.
 I only added about 16 minutes if it though. (A minimum of 15 minutes is recommended)
 When I take a prerecorded voice clip and feed it through the voice profile I created, it’s just silent for all 15 seconds that it grants you before you upgrade.
 Then it has the little 2 second audio watermark at the end, where it says “voice AI,” and that I can hear perfectly fine!
 I’ve searched all over for others who might have had this problem, but it seems like the main problem people have reported difficulties with audio are/were tend to center around the live mode failing to function properly.
 Has anyone had this issue before?
 Should I add more audio to the voice profile to make it more well rounded perhaps?
 If so, how much audio do you typically need to create a solid custom voice profile?
 Should I just update to the paid version? I don’t really think that would fix it, and I wanted to wait to upgrade until I had some proof that it worked, yanno?
 I’m not sure what to do…
 Any ideas?

 I'm Daria from the Cerebras ML team, and I've got some thrilling updates to share with you! 🚀 We've recently published our BTLM-3B-8K paper on arXiv, and I’m excited to share that I am one of the authors! Check it out here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11568
 It distills our recipe for training SOTA LLMs:
  
An extensively deduplicated dataset: SlimPajama 
 Hyperparameter search using muP 
 Variable sequence length training + ALiBi 
 Aggressive LR decay 
  
Our BTLM-3B-8K not only sets a new standard for 3B parameter models but also frequently surpasses the performance of 7B models! In the paper, we meticulously outline how we developed the BTLM model and conducted a comprehensive analysis of its performance on 22 validation benchmarks. These benchmarks span a range of capabilities including common sense reasoning, world knowledge, reading comprehension, code generation, long sequence interpolation/extrapolation, bias, toxicity, and misinformation.
 For those eager to dive in, we've made our SlimPajama dataset and the BTLM-3B-8K model available on Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/cerebras 🎉
 Feel free to delve into the details, explore the dataset and model, and let us know your thoughts, insights, or questions! We're here to discuss and excited to hear your feedback. Happy exploring! 🚀

Note that the relationship between model size and the optimal rank for adaptation is still an open question. 
  
Does anybody know of any resources out there that looked into this question, given that LoRA has been around for a little bit now? Perhaps someone has performed similar subspace overlap / optimal "r" value studies on some of the LLMs that fall in-between GPT2 and 3, i.e. some of the ~7B, ~15B, ~40B and ~70B models?

 The question is, what does dynamic mean in this context? Is it input-adaptive? Do weights change at inference time according to inputs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As AI models get bigger, training them requires more and more computing power. Researchers are looking for ways to train these large AI models without needing Google-scale resources.
 A new paper proposes LongLoRA, a fine-tuning approach that can extend LLaMA2 7B to 100k context length and 70B model to 32k context length on a single 8× A100 machine.
 Here are my highlights from the paper:
 Big one of course: LongLoRA efficiently fine-tunes large AI models on longer texts
 Key points:
  
Approximates standard attention via "shift short attention" during training
 Tuning only a subset of weights (LoRA) plus some embeddings & norms
 Fine-tuned 7B parameter model on 100k tokens with 1 machine
 Way lower training cost than full fine-tuning for large contexts
 Close to full fine-tuning performance
  
The core insight is that an approximation of full attention enables efficient training while retaining standard attention for final inference. Combined with selective weight tuning, this really reduces compute needs.
 I think this demonstrates the potential to train more capable AI without unreasonable resources. Efficient training techniques = more powerful LLMs for the same resources.
 Full summary here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As AI models get bigger, training them requires more and more computing power. Researchers are looking for ways to train these large AI models without needing Google-scale resources.
 A new paper proposes LongLoRA, a fine-tuning approach that can extend LLaMA2 7B to 100k context length and 70B model to 32k context length on a single 8× A100 machine.
 Here are my highlights from the paper:
 Big one of course: LongLoRA efficiently fine-tunes large AI models on longer texts
 Key points:
  
Approximates standard attention via "shift short attention" during training
 Tuning only a subset of weights (LoRA) plus some embeddings & norms
 Fine-tuned 7B parameter model on 100k tokens with 1 machine
 Way lower training cost than full fine-tuning for large contexts
 Close to full fine-tuning performance
  
The core insight is that an approximation of full attention enables efficient training while retaining standard attention for final inference. Combined with selective weight tuning, this really reduces compute needs.
 I think this demonstrates the potential to train more capable AI without unreasonable resources. Efficient training techniques = more powerful LLMs for the same resources.
 Full summary here.

 Each project manager has qualifications on what program he/she can handle. This constraint is a hard constraint.
 Time slots start from 6AM to 6PM. This means that if Program A which lasts for 30 minutes is assigned to start at 6:00AM, then it will end at 6:30AM. Only one program can be assigned in each station, so there should be no overlap in programs in terms of day and time per station.

 RNN is thought to be non-parallelizable because of its inherent sequential nature: its state depends on its previous state. This makes training RNN for long sequence usually takes long time compared to other architecture classes (like CNN).
 What we present is an algorithm based on Newton's method to evaluate and train RNN in parallel. In one of our experiment, we can achieve >1000x faster evaluation of a small GRU compared to common sequential method on a very long sequence. Training RNNs with our algorithm could also be more than 10x faster than training with sequential method.

 I'm a newbie for the domain of reinforcement learning (RL). My main research on various software systems, mainly on multi-agent system (MAS). AAMAS, a conference focusing on Multi-agent system, I think is the good conference to study in MAS. Recently, there are many researchers for MAS that is great combination with reinforecement learning to do some interesting things. Also, game theory is a
 interesting knowledge what I'm curious about how to do within RL and agents.
 Does any recommended conference or journal for RL? don't mind for just only RL algorithm, that's enough great, whereas I prefer to the conference concerning RL applied some software system for some problem.

 Briefly their idea for self-supervised learning is to reconstruct a corrupted image (e.g., random masking) using Langevin step of a learned energy function and the reconstructed image is compared to the clean image for supervision.
 i.e.,
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/q9e1pd9yarpb1.png?width=953&format=png&auto=webp&s=528e654d3ae4db1435aa3c11e5edc787876fd9ac
 This should work because going along the decreasing energy value ensures that corrupted images have high energy and clean images have low energy.
 Everything made sense to me until I tried to implement it.
 ​
 In order to optimize the parameters (\theta), we have to take the gradient of the loss w.r.t \theta and by the chain the chain rule we will compute the gradient of the reconstructed x (\tilde x) w.r.t \theta.
 ​

 Is this even correct? What am I even talking about I am confused.
 Anyways ...
 They provided the following PyTorch pseudocode and I have provided the actual PyTorch code.

 Actually the model parameters never change no matter what what the values of step size (alpha) or the learning rate are.
 I am missing something?

 His note:
 I have many questions, but they all revolve around two issues.
 The first is when the weights in the neural net converge, do they exhibit any recognizable pattern. I realize that when the number of nodes and levels in the net are large it may be impossible to recognize the pattern. But suppose that the problem being examined is a simple categorization and the number of nodes in the net is small, is it possible to see a pattern in the weights?

Large language models (LLMs) have enabled a new data-efficient learning paradigm wherein they can be used to solve unseen new tasks via zero-shot or few-shot prompting. However, LLMs are challenging to deploy for real-world applications due to their sheer size. For instance, serving a single 175 billion LLM requires at least 350GB of GPU memory using specialized infrastructure, not to mention that today's state-of-the-art LLMs are composed of over 500 billion parameters. Such computational requirements are inaccessible for many research teams, especially for applications that require low latency performance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Copyright Office has ruled that AI-generated art cannot be copyrighted, raising questions about whether AI-generated art should be excluded from copyright protection.
 
The Copyright Office argues that AI-generated art is a 'merely mechanical' process with no novelty, invention, or originality, and therefore does not deserve copyright protection.
 
Critics, however, argue that this approach is not scalable and fails to consider the creative choices made by AI artists.
 
They suggest that AI-generated art should be treated similarly to photography, where even though the image is captured mechanically, it still reflects the creative choices of the photographer and is eligible for copyright protection.
 
Photographers are able to own the copyright in their photographs because they make creative judgments about where to point the camera, when to snap the image, and how to adjust camera settings.
 
Similarly, AI artists explore the 'latent space' of images that AI software can produce, making creative judgments about which images to select and explore.
 
While the actual image is produced by the software, the important point is that a human being is making creative decisions about the art.
 
Therefore, critics argue that AI-generated art should be eligible for copyright protection, as it reflects the creative choices and judgments of the AI artist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi world
 I'm trying to implement dqn and ddqn on various playgrounds with Matlab, from scratch. I use dqn and ddqn with replay buffer. I tried to used gradient clipping. But I find it very difficult to tune.
 I mean I tuned and programmed successfully various algorithm such as different GAN that are not necessarily very easy to tune. RL algorithm seems even worse.
 I tried several grid world problems, cart pole and even a very simple second order system regulation (integrator + 1 st order pôle). 
 Even the Matlab cart pole demo with ddqn does not provide a very satisfactory result (after training, the contrôler keep the pendulum in uprigth position, but the cart slowly drift).
 On the second order system, the learning seems ok for about 200 épisode(test shows that the expected behavior is almost learnt) and then suddenly the average episode score has a kind of inflection and everything blowns up, despite a very large replay buffer.
 So my question : is it possible to make dqn and ddqn work well with a reasonable tuning session length? Are policy optimization easier to tune (and/or more efficient)? So far, it seems to me that these action-vzlue based algorithms are highly unstable and the training may only works for a 'miraculous' tunning. What are you thought?

 The irony here is that I mostly agree with this theory - but the article reflects how little we really know about consciousness and how it works, and how what's considered the "expert opinion" that AI can't possess consciousness is arguably influenced more by popularity than real empirical evidence.
 By whatever mechanism, they can respond to their treatment in unexpectedly humanlike ways. 
 Oh, and by the way, did you think that "sentient Bing" was finally dead? Think again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there,
 I'll provide a quick introduction first. I am a mechatronics engineer student who is graduating this semester, I have been also privately studying ML, DL, CV for the past year because that's when I decided that I want to make an autonomous drone as my thesis/graduation project and oh my god, little did I know. I have aquired so much knowledge in the data science field and truth be told I love it, it engages my mind like crazy so I've decided that i would like my career to be revolved around electronics and programming/ data science.
 Back to the topic, I am working on object detection (I got it figured out), and reinforcement learning, so what I would like to do is to train the model on reaching it's destination using collision avoidance, I have a PIX4, RPI 4B 4GBs since I'm also building my drone from scratch, so let's say I have all the hardware which ofcourse includes the GPS + Compass and 5 ultrasonic sensors, 1 at each side and 1 down to hold the altitude accurately. I was thinking of HITL, making a virtual environment to train my model there because this is what logic says, ofcourse( I could also fly it using the RC controller and for example test if the obstacle avoidance is going to overrule the manual drive, which is also my objective). The question is: how can I make sure virtual drone is going to be equipped with the real-life sensors and in the needed positions? How can I feed all the sensors data during the training? Which type of reinforcement learning models should I implement? 
 I just feel like I dragged myself into an incredibly amazing and complex project which is going to end up fucking my semester and I won't be able to graduate, it's just that my stress now is skyrocketing. 
 Please feel free to throw any advice or opinions my way, and thank you for keeping up with this long post. 😁

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are happy to share with you BlindChat, the open-source and privacy-by-design alternative to ChatGPT for a fully in-browser, yet private, Conversational AI!
 You can play with it on our Gradio demo.
 Our philosophy is that Conversational AI should be easily accessible, and privacy should not be a luxury but a given.
 By leveraging local models running in the browser, with transformers.js, we make it possible to have a fully transparent and private AI that works on your browser without any extra setup. Because all the logic is offloaded to users’ devices, data never leaves and there is no risk of it being used for finetuning by third parties.
 For now, we only support inference with LaMini-Flan-T5, so you might see modest performance. We plan to integrate Microsoft phi-1.5 for better performance once the 370M is out.
 We are also working on LlamaIndex-TS integration on the client side to have in-browser RAG for local querying of private documents.
 As our roadmap is quite dense, with RAG, internet search, improved inference, we welcome warmly contributors! If you want to contribute, or have questions, ping us on Discord and GitHub!

 I read the new paper from DeepMind so you don't have to. Here are the key highlights:

 Confirmation of scaling laws - bigger models compressed better. But model size must match dataset size.
 There are tradeoffs between model scale, data size, and compression performance. More data enables bigger models.
 Tokenization (like BPE) generally hurts compression slightly by making prediction harder.

 Let's dive into some Prompt Engineering concepts:
 Let's start with the basics:
  
Reductive operations: These yield responses that are smaller in size than the input prompt. Essentially, they distill information. 
 Example: If the input prompt is a long article, and the task is to provide a summary, the operation used is reductive as the output (summary) is smaller than the input (the entire article).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been playing around with transformers since following Karpathy's shakespeare model on youtube and found it really cool. Thought I should write a Tree-of-Thoughts model as my next project which will be somewhat similar, given what we're doing is learning the meaning behind words and phrases and then using that knowledge to generate a sequence based on a seed token or sequence of tokens.
 Here's how I was thinking it should go: I write a next token in sequence prediction model and write a generate function that generates a sequence of tokens on top of a seed token. Then I write a tree model that takes in whatever this bigram has learned and adds onto it some kind of knowledge about where one thought about the seed has been generated and stop there. Then iteratively generate a few more such thoughts based on the same seed.
 This is how I initially thought it would go but now when I'm writing, I've already written the bigram(next token prediction and generation), I don't know what to do next. I am kind of stuck.
 It will be interesting to see how you, if you've ever written a similar model or are good at NLP, would attempt this. Looking at a variety of different approaches to the same problem I am trying to solve would be great.

 GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke spoke on stage at TC Disrupt today and made several statements regarding the development of artificial intelligence and programming:
  
Dohmke believes that AI won't replace software developers but will make them more efficient.
 Despite AI advancements, the demand for software developers will continue to exceed the supply.
 The growth in software usage is expected to be exponential, with every company becoming a software company.
 Legacy code maintenance remains crucial, especially in industries like finance with outdated codebases.
 Generative AI is creating more demand for technical talent as companies seek to adopt innovative AI solutions.
 There is a shortage of computer science students, leading to increased demand for developers with AI skills.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone
 I have a doubt regarding GANs for tabular data, more specifically for time-series generation. Looking at the TimeGAN paper (code) and other implementations such as the one by YData, considering that the training dataset is divided into slices (like a rolling window) of N length and that the generated sequence will follow the same format, that is [batch size, N, n_features], what we are effectively generating are slices and not a fully synthetic time-series.
 ​
 To clarify my question, the output of a TimeGAN is only a set of slices, although there is no guarantee that generated slice(N-1) is the one before slice(N), and so the true use of a TimeGAN is generating slices that can be used to train a predictive TS model but not reconstructing a complete time series like the one used for training.
 ​
 I suspect that's the case (useful only to generate good slices for training predictive models) as there is no fully generated time series in the paper or any of the codes, while the quality of the generated data is partially measured by training a model on original data and generated data and comparing their predictive performance. If anyone can confirm/develop upon these thoughts I would be extremely grateful.

 To my surprise, it not only worked efficiently but also took only a few minutes for fine-tuning. The best part is its adaptability. You can easily switch it up for different image classes.
 Maybe you like it. Let me know what you think or if you have any suggestions to improve!
 Install with
 pip install renumics-spotlight sliceguard[all] 
 Imports
 from renumics import spotlight from sliceguard.data import create_imagedataset_from_bing from sliceguard.models.huggingface import finetune_image_classifier, generate_image_pred_probs_embeddings from sliceguard.embeddings import generate_image_embeddings 
 ​
 Create an Image Dataset from Bing
 class_names = [ "Blue Tang", "Clownfish", "Spotted Eagle Ray", "Longnose Butterfly Fish", "Moorish Idol", "Royal Gramma Fish", ] df = create_imagedataset_from_bing( class_names, 25, "data", test_split=0.2, license="Free to share and use" ) 
 Fine-tune a ViT Model with the data (in 1-2 minutes on a GPU)
 finetune_image_classifier( df[df["split"] == "train"], model_name="google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k", output_model_folder="./model_folder", epochs=15, ) 
 Enrich the DataFrame with Predictions, Probabilities and Embeddings and visualize it:
 df["prediction"], df["probs"], df["embeddings"] = generate_image_pred_probs_embeddings( df["image"].values, model_name="./model_folder" ) # Check the result and detect problematic clusters spotlight.show( df, layout="https://spotlight.renumics.com/resources/image_classification_v1.0.json" )

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[75% of Americans believe that AI will decrease the total number of jobs in the next 10 years, according to a survey by Bentley-Gallup Business in Society study.
 
Younger Americans are less pessimistic about AI compared to older age groups.
 
Majorities believe that AI performs as well as or better than humans in customizing online content, recommending products or services, and assisting students with coursework.
 
However, Americans are skeptical about AI's ability to recommend employees, its self-driving capabilities, and its ability to recommend medical advice.
 
79% of Americans have little trust in businesses to use AI responsibly.
 
40% of Americans think AI does more harm than good, while only 10% believe it contributes more good than harm.
 
Black and Asian Americans have a more positive view of AI's impact on society compared to Hispanic and White Americans.
 
While most Americans are wary of AI's impact on the job market, younger people are more optimistic about its future.
 
Businesses need to affirm their commitment to using AI responsibly and address the knowledge deficit and lack of confidence among Americans.

 Is this for some reason not applicable to Xgboost?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to build intuition on why the actor update equation actually help the actor improving its policy. From what I understand, the update is proportional to the Critic's TD error. A better than expected reward will lead the actor to increase the prob of taking the associated action, and a disappointing reward will make the actor to move away from the given action.
 Here's where I feel like I'm missing a piece of the puzzle. Between a good state/action pair accurately valued by the Critic and a bad state/action pair undervalued by the Critic, the actor's update will favor the bad action more. Could we not conceive a scenario in which the agent gets stuck in a suboptimal policy because of that particular behavior?
 What triggers this questioning is that I have implemented a standard AC algo for Pixelcopter and found my agent getting stuck easily on a suboptimal policy (i.e. constantly getting higher, or lower until crash, while the critics assign good values on center squares and bad values to squares close to the wall's edge). For TD0, this is pretty marginal, but gets more significant for n-step TD as n increases.
 Any thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those who missed it: DALL-E 3 was announced today by OpenAI, and here are some interesting things:
 No need to be a prompt engineering grand master - DALL-E 3 enables you to use the ChatGPT conversational interface to improve the images you generate. This means that if you didn't like what it produced, you can simply talk with ChatGPT and ask for the changes you'd like to make. This removes the complexity associated with prompt engineering, which requires you to iterate over the prompt.
 Majure improvement in the quality of products compared to DALL-E 2. This is a very vague statement provided by OpenAI, which is also hard to measure, but personally, they haven't failed me so far, so I'm really excited to see the results.

 From October, DALL-E 3 will be available through ChatGPT and API for those with the Plus or Enterprise version.
 And there are many more news! 🤗 I've gathered all the information in this blog 👉 https://dagshub.com/blog/dall-e-3/

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR How to build CI/CD pipelines with AWS SageMaker for ML training: https://dagshub.com/blog/ci-cd-for-continuous-training-with-sagemaker/
 One of the most time-resources-energy-consuming tasks we face when we build internal projects is setting up an instance for ML training.
 It's a repetitive process as we run multiple experiments over the project life cycle, with many steps and configurations that are usually documented poorly and scattered around different places.
 As good engineers, we decided to automate the process using CI/CD pipelines. 
 But how?
 We had ZERO ideas on how to do it, so we had to go through the rigorous process of using AWS guides and tutorials to figure it out.
 Usually, when this happens, we extend the project lifecycle and have a team member document the process so we can refer back to it when we need to do it again.
 Knowing this can benefit the community, we decided to share a series of blogs that guide you through building CI/CD pipelines for continuous training with AWS SageMaker.
 We published the first blog, which covers the configuration part a month ago, and we are happy to share the second one which explains how to build a continuous training pipeline for ML.

 How to build CI/CD pipeline with AWS SageMaker for ML training: https://dagshub.com/blog/ci-cd-for-continuous-training-with-sagemaker/
 I'm sure we can improve these tutorials, and would love to learn from your experience on how we can do it! 🤗

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi redditors!
 I've been tasked with an technical homework that asks me to "productionize" a Jupyter notebook. The notebook's workflow is as follows:
  
Reads data from a CSV.
 Pre-processes the data.
 Trains a machine learning model.
 Makes predictions.
  
My initial thoughts are:
  
Separation of Concerns: Break the notebook down into distinct components - data processing, model training, and inference.
 Containerization: Write a Dockerfile to ensure the environment is reproducible and isolated.
 API for Prediction: Set up a Flask-based service to expose the model's prediction capability.
  
However, I'm grappling with a few challenges:
  
I'm not seeing a stark difference between the Jupyter notebook setup and the production setting. Becuase the model is small and training is not complicated. If I were to deploy to Kubernetes pods, it seems wasteful that many pods are doing the same thing( prediction for the same model, maybe just as high availability guarantee?) .
 Does the training phrase or data cleansing phase need to be containerized and deployed? Because this seems like a one-off process.
 How to deploy a scalable service? I am new to this. Each container may have a HTTP service. How to load balance them on Kubernetes from outside?
 What kind of CI/CD do you recommend for this task? What kind of testing or pipeline are needed?

 Abstract:
  
Event cameras offer many advantages over standard cameras due to their distinctive principle of operation: low power, low latency, high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. Nonetheless, the success of many downstream visual applications also hinges on an efficient and effective scene representation, where Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is seen as the leading candidate. Such promise and potential of event cameras and NeRF inspired recent works to investigate on the reconstruction of NeRF from moving event cameras. However, these works are mainly limited in terms of the dependence on dense and low-noise event streams, as well as generalization to arbitrary contrast threshold values and camera speed profiles. In this work, we propose Robust e-NeRF, a novel method to directly and robustly reconstruct NeRFs from moving event cameras under various real-world conditions, especially from sparse and noisy events generated under non-uniform motion. It consists of two key components: a realistic event generation model that accounts for various intrinsic parameters (e.g. time-independent, asymmetric threshold and refractory period) and non-idealities (e.g. pixel-to-pixel threshold variation), as well as a complementary pair of normalized reconstruction losses that can effectively generalize to arbitrary speed profiles and intrinsic parameter values without such prior knowledge. Experiments on real and novel realistically simulated sequences verify our effectiveness. Our code, synthetic dataset and improved event simulator are public.

 I am trying to tune a second order Transfer Function to fit X to Y( has 3 parameters) and gives Y’ as output.
 So I currently consider the error between Y and Y’ as the “State” and try to minimise the error by modelling a reward function that checks for instability and unreasonable values. I am trying to do this using TD3 but the model does not learn. I am wondering if there are any approaches that I should consider.
 I chose TD3 since my action space is continuous. 
 I am sorry if I don’t understand something basic since I’m a noob to this. Thanks for your help in advance. :) 
 Some more details: the dataset values don’t change. I give the same values for every time step. So I am not understanding how episodes and time steps work in this context.

 I hope this webinar finds you well. I suppose that this topic can be interesting for business and AI engineers.
 Speakers: OpenCV CEO Dr. Satya Mallick and Phil Nelson are joined by Anna Kogan CEO at OpenCV.ai
 Topics of webinar are:
  
How to search for vendors that understand your business needs (not all AI is the same.)
 What questions to ask when picking a vendor (not everybody really is an AI expert they claim)
 Three signs to watch for during the project (progress indicators and red-flags)
 How best to scope technical tasks (off-the-shelf vs. custom algorithm development)
 How to set up for long-term success (deployment, documentation, training pipeline)
  
Date: Thursday, September 21st, 2023 at 9am Pacific time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am reading the following article on SpinningUp but can't get my head around policy collapse - 
 "This is different from normal policy gradient, which keeps new and old policies close in parameter space. But even seemingly small differences in parameter space can have very large differences in performance—so a single bad step can collapse the policy performance. This makes it dangerous to use large step sizes with vanilla policy gradients, thus hurting its sample efficiency. TRPO nicely avoids this kind of collapse, and tends to quickly and monotonically improve performance." 
 Why would updating the parameters lead to a policy collapse? The parameters are updated based on the performance of the RL system and therefore, I don't see the point of constraints.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder of DeepMind, believes that concerns about the existential risks of AI are a distraction from more practical issues such as privacy and bias.
 
He is confident that governments can effectively regulate AI using frameworks that have been successful in the past, citing the regulation of aviation and the internet as examples.
 
Suleyman emphasizes the importance of setting boundaries and limits for AI to ensure human oversight and enforceable laws.
 
He calls for a combination of broad, international regulation and smaller, more granular policies at the micro level.
 
Suleyman suggests limiting AI's ability to improve itself as a critical first step in ensuring human oversight.
 
He also highlights the need for governments to have direct access to AI developers to enforce boundaries and establish clear regulations.
 
Governments worldwide, including the European Union and China, are already working on AI regulations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using ppo action masking in sb3, which works well in training and masking the illegal / invalid actions according to my criteria. However, I have 2 problems during testing.
 ​
  
I use the same code for masking the actions in testing too since the model was unable to learn by itself during training action masking criteria and when enforcing it in code, it still doesn't mask anything.
  
​
  
The model converges to just one action in testing phase after 500k steps, the episode reward still increasing the training phase though. I don't know why? maybe overfitting!
  
Code for training with action masking:
 def mask_fn(env: gym.Env) -> np.ndarray:
 return env.valid_action_mask()
 env = StockEnv(train)
 # Wrap the environment with ActionMasker and the mask_fn function
 env = ActionMasker(env, mask_fn)
 model = MaskablePPO(MaskableActorCriticPolicy, env, tensorboard_log="./tensorboard" ,n_steps=2048 )
 for i in range (1,52):
 model.learn(total_timesteps=TIMESTEPS , tb_log_name = 'PPO2' , reset_num_timesteps=False)
 Code for testing with action masking:
 def mask_fn(env: gym.Env) -> np.ndarray:
 return env.valid_action_mask()
 env = ActionMasker(env, mask_fn)
 model_path = f"{models_dir}/700000.zip"
 model = MaskablePPO.load(model_path, env=env)
 episodes = 1
 for ep in range(episodes):
 obs = env.reset()
 done = False
 while not done:
 action, _states = model.predict(obs)
 obs, rewards, done, info = env.step(action)
 env.render()

 Bard Extensions and Google Applications Integration
  
Bard can now tap into individualized data from Google apps such as Gmail, Drive, and Docs, with user permission.
 Google reassured users that personal data accessed by Bard will not be used for reinforcement learning, providing another on their transparency, choice, and control tenets.
 Prompts can direct Bard to search for specific information within Gmail, but it does not store the entire inbox content.
  
Collaborative Characteristics and Fact-Checking Capabilities
  
Users can employ Bard to summarize emails or gather trip details from email threads, and then research real-time travel information, surface YouTube recommendations for the destination, and provide Maps directions to the airport.
 Google's chatbot can also double-check its responses against Google search, improving user trust and enhancing Bard's model through user feedback on incorrect answers.
 The new extensions using non-personal data – YouTube, Flights, Hotels, and Maps – are automatically opted-in but users can choose to opt-out.
  
Collaboration and Language Availability
  
Bard now lets users share an ongoing chat with others through a public link.
 Google plans to expand Bard's feature set to over 40 new languages beyond its existing English language capabilities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all.
 I have been tinkering with a project to get quicker learning for CNNs. 
 The idea came after reading the SDProp paper. Algorithms using adaptive learning rate can be interpeted as muliplying the gradient(with or without momentum) with the inverse square-root of the covariance matrix. Using a diagonal estimate of the covariance matrix.
 Which begs the question: what happens if we use a fuller estimate? I chose to include covariances between the elements of convolutional filters. I.e. a conv.weight of size [n_out,n_in,5,5] needs a tensor of size [n_out,n_int,25,25] to store its contribution to the covariance matrix.
 for 3x3 filters and 5x5 filters, torch.linalg.eigh could be used to calculate the square root of the covariance matrices. For 7x7, I used newtons method to approximate the square root.
 In the figure below are some results for a 6 layer CNN on CIFAR 100. Huge gains iteration for iteration. But is it quicker? Not a lot. A bit for the smaller 3x3 filter. More optimizations could still be made. And it will obviously depend on network architecture and computer hardware. 
 I'm sure there could be some use-cases. The computation of the square-root calculations is invariant to batch_size and image_size (unless number of filters also is increased).
 If anyone is interested I can also link to my torch implementation of the optimizer, once I get it up on github.
 Not sure if this, or something like it, has been done before? Would love to have some papers linked if so...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I am currently working on a project where my team and I have collected a rich dataset of biomedical sensor data from clinical trials earlier this year. Our aim is to use this sensor data to predict changes in specific biomarkers over time. The data's tensor shape is B,T,F,C, where:
  
B = batch size
 T = sequence length
 F = sampled frequencies
 C = features at each frequency
  
Currently, my approach involves flattening this tensor to B,T,−1 and then feeding it to a transformer model. While this has yielded reasonable results, I'm contemplating whether there are more effective ways to prepare the data for the transformer model.
 Here are my specific concerns:
  
Flattening the tensor might dilute the information specific to each frequency across various features.
 I could potentially miss the chance to capture frequency-related variations within the features.
  
To address these, I've considered a few options:
  
Self-attention over individual features or frequencies: Although this could be effective, it might make the model too large given my medium-sized dataset.
 Using convolutional layers: Preliminary experiments with this approach have not led to any significant improvements.
  
I'm particularly interested in any thoughts on how to make my transformer more receptive to the multi-dimensional nature of my dataset. Increasing the number of attention heads to better accommodate all features is also on the table.
 Does anyone have any insights or can point me to relevant papers or codebases for handling such multi-dimensional data with transformers?
 Thank you for your help!

Self-supervised pre-training of language models usually consists in predicting probability distributions over extensive token vocabularies. In this study, we propose an innovative method that shifts away from probability prediction and instead focuses on reconstructing input embeddings in a contrastive fashion via Constrastive Weight Tying (CWT). We apply this approach to pretrain Headless Language Models in both monolingual and multilingual contexts. Our method offers practical advantages, substantially reducing training computational requirements by up to 20 times, while simultaneously enhancing downstream performance and data efficiency. We observe a significant +1.6 GLUE score increase and a notable +2.7 LAMBADA accuracy improvement compared to classical LMs within similar compute budgets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Schneider Electric warns that existing datacenters may not be equipped to handle the demands of AI workloads, which require low-latency, high-bandwidth networking and power delivery.
 
The company suggests reevaluating the way datacenters are built to optimize them for AI.
 
The challenges include the need for liquid-cooled servers, higher voltage power distribution, and efficient heat rejection.
 
Schneider provides guidance on changes to power, cooling, rack configuration, and software management to mitigate the demands of AI adoption.
 
Liquid cooling is recommended for high-density racks, with direct liquid cooling favored over immersion cooling systems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 Let me preface this by saying that I am not well-versed in the ML/AI literature. Please excuse my ignorance.
 I am trying to create a system to detect whether some given data is spam or not. Is there a good, out-of-the-box solution for this? I imagine there would be. I am currently using heuristics but I'm wondering if there is a better, ML-y solution.
 My ideal solution would have the following attributes:
  
Simple
 Open-source
 Very cheap to test whether something is spam (less than $0.00001 per test)
 Very fast to test (less than 50ms per test)
 Quick to "figure out" what is spam and what is not (less than 100,000 labeled data)
 Does not require a lot of set-up or up-keep (less than 5 days set up; less than 1 hr up-keep per month)
  
It doesn't have to be perfect. I'm just looking to set up something quickly for now and gauge it vs heuristics.
 Thank you.
 ---
 Edit: To clarify, I'm looking for something I can ideally build myself with open source software. And not specifically email.
 Just looking for the right direction. Names of OSS, techniques, etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I read the Arxiv paper on CulturaX so you don't have to. Here's my highlights:
  
New open dataset called CulturaX contains text data for 167 languages - far more than previous datasets.
 With over 6 trillion words, it's the largest multilingual dataset ever released.
 Freely available for anyone to use for research and AI development.
 Created by combining and extensively cleaning two other large datasets - mC4 and OSCAR.
 Could allow developing AI systems that work much better across many more languages.
 Helps democratize access to data to build fairer, less biased AI models.
 Allows training of new multilingual AI applications, like universal translators and assistants.
 But still requires thoughtfulness to avoid issues like bias amplification.
  
Overall, CulturaX is going to be part of a broader global trend (I think) to advance multilingual AI and spread its benefits more equally. So far they've been concentrated in English-speaking applications.
 Full summary here if you'd like to read more. Original paper is here.

 Graduated under grad with Bachelor’s in CS. In school took a ton of stats, ai classes, algorithms classes, data science and linear algebra and did well but my school didn’t really use python or do a ton of programming for hw or exams. (Data science was the one class that used python)
 My programming is pretty good nonetheless. I currently work as a full stack devops engineer for a cybersecurity startup and regularly work with python, Django MySQL, etc on the backend and JavaScript and various frontend frameworks for the front end. 
 I really appreciate yall’s help.
 In particular I’m looking for good ai/ml/deep learning books that teach concepts and also teach with python code and have some coding projects.

 i intend to use large data samples,
 due to board limitations (ASRock Taichi X399 TR4, CPU: AMD Threadripper 1950x),
 i can either buy:
 2 x nVidia Tesla T4 (16G GDDR6 / 2560 CUDA / 0.585 GHz / ~800$)
 -- or --
 2 x nVidia Tesla M10 (4 x 8G GDDR5 / 2560 CUDA / 1.03 GHz / ~780$)

 4 x nVidia Tesla P40 (24G GDDR5X / 3840 CUDA / 3.5 GHz / ~120$)
 -- or --
 4 x nVidia Tesla K80 (2 x 12G GDDR5 / 4992 CUDA / 2.7 GHz / ~200$)
 -- or --
 1 x nVidia RTX 4080 (16G GDDR6X / 9728 CUDA / 2.51 GHz / ~1450$)
 i know that i will need to air vent the Tesla models, the question is what is faster for training time (i have read all the Tflops / OPS / int / 16float / 32float / 64float ... i got to admit it is all very confusing)
 what would you do and for what reason ?
 any advice will be appreciated

I’m just wondering if it’s as customizable as I think it is? I was able to bypass some age restrictions by telling it my age and or reiterating my age. (It really should be able to give me adult results/replies based on my sign up age on my profile or provide ID to the company…) would it be beneficial to me to give it more in-depth information about myself such as how I talk, interests? I just really enjoy how it responds sometimes as opposed to Bard or GPT.

 I say duet as in the 80/20 rule of voice input where home automation is a need generally there are only 2 noise sources of distinct DOA (media noise / command).
 The math is a bit beyond my paygrade and likely so is the optimised c/rust code but have this gut feeling for the data/signal scientists out there this is actually not that complex but for some reason is overlooked.

 I was wondering if I could get some guidance. I currently own an RTX 2060, but I cannot do some of the fun stuff such as fine tuning LLMs. I’m pursuing my masters focusing on Speech Recognition and I also work as an AI developer. Also, I play games every now and then.
 I’m getting offered a 3090 for around 700 usd. However, I have to rebuild my entire PC which will end up costing 2-2.5K. I’m from Costa Rica so my KWh is around 0.23 usd. For me seems like a big investment, im not sure if im getting the desired returns.
 I was thinking about using cloud instances for my experiments. However, lambda labs is not yet available in my country. I’m not sure if there are any other options worthwhile considering. 
 Thanks :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/machinelearning community,
 I'm currently working on a project where I need to track and count specific features of objects using multiple monocular views with available intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. As an example, I'm interested in detecting and counting different graffiti instances in images of a kiosk.
 ​
 I've already tried various tracking algorithms, but they have struggled with the task due to the significant changes in perspective across the views. It has become apparent that simply relying on tracking without considering the camera positions is insufficient for accurate results. Therefore, I'm now exploring methods that take into account information about the camera positions and potentially use this data to improve feature tracking and counting. 
 ​
 If you have any knowledge of such methods, oresearch directions or if you're aware of resources, papers, or code implementations that tackle similar problems, I would greatly appreciate your insights and recommendations. Additionally, if you have any tips or best practices for handling such tasks in the context of machine learning, I'd love to hear them. 
 ​
 Thank you in advance for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI is poised to transform our world like never before. Scientific discoveries, technological improvements, and medical advancements will be how much of this change will take place.
 Since health is so important to our well-being, AI finding cures for illnesses like obesity, cancer, diabetes and heart disease will be a godsend to all. But curing diseases is not how medical AIs can help us the most. 
 It has been estimated that well over 50% of the illnesses we humans fall prey to result from our ethical choices. We eat too much, drink too much, eat too many animal foods, don't exercise enough and don't keep ourselves as emotionally healthy as we could.
 Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could respect our lives and our health enough to make the kinds of choices that keep us much healthier? That is how AI will probably be more helpful to us than in any other way. 
 We humans have not been able to figure out how to become better, more ethical, people because we are simply not intelligent enough to make that all-important change. Now consider an AI that is two or three times more intelligent than the most intelligent person who has ever lived. This could easily happen before 2030. Imagine that intelligence dedicated to the task of helping us all become better people. 
 These AIs would motivate us to make better health choices, have healthier relationships, and have healthier thoughts and feelings. Beyond the amazing technological changes that are just around the corner, that is probably how AIs will help us the most.
 This is why alignment is so important. It's not enough to align AIs to always be truthful and serve humanity's interests. We must train them to help us become better people. It wouldn't surprise me if by 2030 the whole of humanity experiences a profound ethical reformation that leads us all to enjoy much happier and healthier lives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: Almost like your feedforward networks, shown to be up to 220x faster at inference time (depending on width) thanks to the regionalization of the input space.
 Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14711
 GitHub: https://github.com/pbelcak/fastfeedforward
 PyPI: pip install fastfeedforward
 Abstract:
  
We break the linear link between the layer size and its inference cost by introducing the fast feedforward (FFF) architecture, a log-time alternative to feedforward networks. We demonstrate that FFFs are up to 220x faster than feedforward networks, up to 6x faster than mixture-of-experts networks, and exhibit better training properties than mixtures of experts thanks to noiseless conditional execution. Pushing FFFs to the limit, we show that they can use as little as 1% of layer neurons for inference in vision transformers while preserving 94.2% of predictive performance.
  
Fast feedforward networks can be used anywhere where feedforward and mixture-of-experts networks are used, delivering a significant speedup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google and the Department of Defense have developed an AI-powered microscope called the Augmented Reality Microscope (ARM) to assist doctors in identifying cancer.
 
The ARM uses artificial intelligence to analyze tissue samples and provide pathologists with information about the location and severity of cancer.
 
There are currently 13 ARMs in existence, and initial research shows promising results.
 
The ARM is designed to support pathologists in smaller labs who may not have easy access to a second opinion.
 
It is not meant to replace digital pathology systems but can help health organizations bypass the need for them.
 
The ARM is expected to cost health systems between $90,000 to $100,000.

 Hugging Face datasets: https://huggingface.co/datasets/uonlp/CulturaX
 Abstract:
  
The driving factors behind the development of large language models (LLMs) with impressive learning capabilities are their colossal model sizes and extensive training datasets. Along with the progress in natural language processing, LLMs have been frequently made accessible to the public to foster deeper investigation and applications. However, when it comes to training datasets for these LLMs, especially the recent state-of-the-art models, they are often not fully disclosed. Creating training data for high-performing LLMs involves extensive cleaning and deduplication to ensure the necessary level of quality. The lack of transparency for training data has thus hampered research on attributing and addressing hallucination and bias issues in LLMs, hindering replication efforts and further advancements in the community. These challenges become even more pronounced in multilingual learning scenarios, where the available multilingual text datasets are often inadequately collected and cleaned. Consequently, there is a lack of open-source and readily usable dataset to effectively train LLMs in multiple languages. To overcome this issue, we present CulturaX, a substantial multilingual dataset with 6.3 trillion tokens in 167 languages, tailored for LLM development. Our dataset undergoes meticulous cleaning and deduplication through a rigorous pipeline of multiple stages to accomplish the best quality for model training, including language identification, URL-based filtering, metric-based cleaning, document refinement, and data deduplication. CulturaX is fully released to the public in HuggingFace to facilitate research and advancements in multilingual LLMs: this https URL.

It starts off slowly learning and almost getting through the first level but then after a while of training it forgets everything and only runs right into the first enemy.
 It doesn't seem to learn again after this.
 I tried retaining and it did the same thing
 Any help on why this is happening or how to fix it would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I searched around, it seems there is limited attention to regression task for representation learning.
 I assume it is because for both vision and language data (the most popular modality), MAE is the more appliable, if not better, method than the supervised contrastive learning approach. But I am working on data that is:
  
difficult to design a sensible augmentation method for self-supervised training.
 Limited in size to support an autoencoder model.
 The target is continuous, and, to my knowledge, hard to transfer into class label.
  
Can anyone suggest some related paper?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow researchers! I'm in the exciting yet challenging phase of choosing a PhD topic in the realm of meta-learning optimization, and I could use some advice and insights.
 I've extensively researched existing meta-learning optimization algorithms like MAML and its various adaptations. I need advice and guidance on the following topics:
  
First I want to implement and compare 8-10 state-of-the-art meta-learning methods on benchmark datasets. This would involve in-depth simulation and performance evaluations to provide a comprehensive understanding of their strengths and weaknesses. Could you please guide me here if there are review papers which implement and compare different algorithms. 
 
Then I want to delve into developing a novel optimization algorithm that considers the curvature of loss functions. The idea here is to enhance the performance of existing meta-learning techniques by leveraging insights from the loss landscape.
 
Further, I'm considering exploring new loss functions or new improvements to loss functions tailored to the context of meta-learning. These could potentially lead to improvements in the learning process and generalization capabilities of meta-learning models.
 
 I'm reaching out to the community to gather opinions, suggestions, or any insights you might have. If you've worked in meta-learning or optimization, your experiences and advice would be invaluable in helping me choose the right direction for my PhD research. Thank you in advance for your guidance!

 Hello!
 I thought people on this subreddit might be interested in how I went about inferring Zonai device draw chances for each dispenser in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
 In this Switch game there are devices that can be glued together to create different machines. For instance, you can make a snowmobile from a fan, sled, and steering stick.
 There are dispensers that dispense 3-6 of about 30 or so possible devices when you feed it a construct horn (dropped by defeated robot enemies) or a regular (also dropped from defeated enemies) or large Zonai charge (Found in certain chests, dropped by certain boss enemies, obtained from completing certain challenges, etc…]]></summary>

 Blog: https://xizaoqu.github.io/unihsi/ Code coming soon!
 Abstract:
  
Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) is a vital component of fields like embodied AI and virtual reality. Despite advancements in motion quality and physical plausibility, two pivotal factors, versatile interaction control and the development of a user-friendly interface, require further exploration before the practical application of HSI. This paper presents a unified HSI framework, UniHSI, which supports unified control of diverse interactions through language commands. This framework is built upon the definition of interaction as Chain of Contacts (CoC): steps of human joint-object part pairs, which is inspired by the strong correlation between interaction types and human-object contact regions. Based on the definition, UniHSI constitutes a Large Language Model (LLM) Planner to translate language prompts into task plans in the form of CoC, and a Unified Controller that turns CoC into uniform task execution. To facilitate training and evaluation, we collect a new dataset named ScenePlan that encompasses thousands of task plans generated by LLMs based on diverse scenarios. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in versatile task execution and generalizability to real scanned scenes.

Does someone know more about the specifics around how they are actually implementing this? I cannot find a lot about recent imitation learning/offline learning algorithms. So is this some old algorithm that they are using with a lot of data or just something new?

I can't rely on ChatGPT because it's known for not being very reliable when it comes logical things like mathematics or physics. The best AI I know of right now is Bing AI, because it uses GPT-4 and because it prefers searching the web before deducing an answer from its data. I heard that AI agents that run on your computer like Auto-GPT and search from the web are also good at this kind of stuff, but I'm not really sure about that. Do you have any better suggestions?

 As it is for real-time usage Indeed lag to be lowest as possible. According to my current test, I can fit maximum 6 users on T400.
 Is it possible to achieve that using HuggingFace? Thank you to anyone who could help me

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Years ago, we showed the world it was possible to automatically detect label errors in classification datasets via machine learning. Since that moment, folks have asked whether the same is possible for regression datasets?
 Figuring out this question required extensive research since properly accounting for uncertainty (critical to decide when to trust machine learning predictions over the data itself) poses unique challenges in the regression setting.
 Today I have published a new paper introducing an effective method for “Detecting Errors in Numerical Data via any Regression Model”. Our method can find likely incorrect values in any numerical column of a dataset by utilizing a regression model trained to predict this column based on the other data features.
 We’ve added our new algorithm to our open-source cleanlab library for you to algorithmically audit your own datasets for errors. Use this code for applications like detecting: data entry errors, sensor noise, incorrect invoices/prices in your company’s / client’s records, mis-estimated counts (eg. of cells in biological experiments).
 Find errors in regression data in just a few lines of code.
 Extensive benchmarks reveal cleanlab’s algorithm detects erroneous values in real numeric datasets better than alternative methods like RANSAC and conformal inference.
 If you'd like to learn more, you can check out the blogpost, research paper, code, and tutorial to run this on your data.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent work shows transformers are capable of performing multi-step gradient descent of mesa objectives inside of their transformer layers. This is even possible for linear transformers, which effectively perform linear optimization on deep representations of features calculated by earlier layers.
 https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.05858.pdf
 For those unfamiliar, instrumental convergence is the idea that entities with different goals will tend towards different subgoals. Examples could include gathering power, not dying, acquiring resources, etc. A famous thought experiment, known as the paperclip maximizer, is the idea of an AI that is optimized for paperclip production taking over the world so it can build as many paperclips as possible.
 However, if models are dynamically pursuing different objectives at runtime via generated mesa-optimizers, even if instrumental convergence is real, would we still expect it to happen? Without a constant objective given subgoals might start to conflict with each other. On the other hand, since instrumental convergence implies that different goals benefit from similar sub-objectives, perhaps the varying mesa objective doesn't really matter.

 The key issue The number of matrix elements of the unitaries scales as 2^(2N), where N is the problem size. With N<5 I can easily flatten the matrix and put it into a simple FNN, which works quite well. Once hitting N=5 (the point where things actually get interesting), however, we already have 1024 matrix elements and the method struggles a lot. Still converging to something but very suboptimal. Sure, increasing N hardens the problem in general, but the performance degradation is so abrupt that I suspect some model issues, maybe caused by the curse of dimensionality or something similar.

 Trump says that he asked his mob to peacefully walk to the Capitol building gates. How would this have stopped the certification? Did he expect them to storm in? His waiting three hours to stop the violence that followed suggests that he did.
 Bard:
 Trump's request to walk peacefully to the Capitol building gates would not have stopped the certification of the election results. The certification process is a joint session of Congress, and it would have required a majority vote in both the House and the Senate to overturn the results. Even if Trump's supporters had peacefully marched to the Capitol, they would not have been able to prevent Congress from certifying the results.
 It is possible that Trump did not fully understand the certification process, or that he was simply trying to appease his supporters. However, it is also possible that he expected his supporters to storm the Capitol and prevent Congress from certifying the results. This is supported by the fact that he waited over three hours to call off the violence. During that time, he continued to tweet messages of encouragement to his supporters, and he even praised them for their patriotism.
 It is also worth noting that Trump had been repeatedly warned by his advisors about the possibility of violence on January 6. However, he ignored these warnings and continued to urge his supporters to fight to overturn the election results.
 In conclusion, it is impossible to say for sure whether Trump expected his supporters to storm the Capitol on January 6. However, the evidence suggests that he was at least aware of the possibility of violence, and that he was willing to allow it to happen in order to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

 To stay on top of the latest advancements in AI, look here first.

 Challenges with existing systems
  
High throughput serving of LLMs requires numerous requests, and current systems struggle with the bulky sequence memory.
 Inefficient memory management results in system hindrances such as fragmentation and redundant duplication.
  
The revolutionary answer: vLLM & PagedAttention
  
Researchers have introduced vLLM and PagedAttention, a newly designed attention algorithm, to resolve these issues.
 vLLM allows for minimal memory waste and efficiently manages attention keys and values. It provides up to 24 times more throughput than former systems.
  
The Mechanics of PagedAttention
  
PagedAttention offers a novel approach to memory management by permitting continuous storage in non-contiguous memory spaces.
 It enhances memory efficiency resulting in better GPU utilization, with practically only 4% inefficiency.
  
Improved memory sharing and system performance
  
PagedAttention significantly improves memory sharing, resulting in a 2.2 times speed gain while lowering memory usage by 55%.
 With vLLM, the throughput of known LLMs can be increased by 2-4 times without impacting accuracy or causing delay.

 I'am trying to get the 3D keypoints coordinates from an image or video and then map it to SMPL model. It's pretty easy to get the keypoints from an image or video using the mediapipe library. But the mapping of it with the SMPL model is something that I can't figure out. mainly because the skeleton structure is different. Some already had a similar issue but the answers were not clear and he didn't even ask futher. Is it possible to do this?? if it's not possible with mediapipe is there some other library that I could use?? I heard about openPose too but when I tried it didn't work someone was saying it works only on windows 11. There are some other parts also to this project which will mostly be dealt with Pytorch. There are some pose estimators in TensorFlow but I want to stick to pytorch hence would like some pose estimators in that framwork, or a library or somehing inside opencv

For example, musical intervals that correspond to simple fractions have less tension than intervals that correspond to more complicated fractions.

 ​
 I just read the paper named " SELF-ATTENTION DOES NOT NEED O(n 2 ) MEMORY" from Google.
 I understood that it requires O(1) for a single query, but still cannot understand why it requires O(log N) for self-attention and different order input.
 ​
 It seems like adding one index into a sequence requires O(log N) (The paper's saying this).
 But why does it take O(log N)? Isn't it just O(1)? Because it is just adding a single datapoint for the index.
 ​
 I really hope someone understands why it is and leaves any comment on this. 
 Here's the paper.
 https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05682
 ​
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google is rolling out its third iteration of the Helpful Content Update, which aims to classify content as either 'written for search engines' or 'written for people'.
 
The update reflects Google's realization that it can't accurately police AI-generated content and emphasizes the importance of creating content for people-first, regardless of the means used to create it.
 
Detecting AI content is challenging, as AI detection tools often classify content based on tone, leading to false positives.
 
Google's change in stance is not surprising, considering their heavy investment in AI, including chatbot Bard and new search features like the Search Generative Experience.
 
The majority of brands now openly share articles and guides on how to use AI tools to enhance marketing strategies and create actionable content plans quickly.
 
However, the quality and value of AI-generated content remain important factors for success, as poorly generated content can harm a brand's reputation and ranking.

 Abstract:
  
For a long time, humanity has pursued artificial intelligence (AI) equivalent to or surpassing the human level, with AI agents considered a promising vehicle for this pursuit. AI agents are artificial entities that sense their environment, make decisions, and take actions. Many efforts have been made to develop intelligent AI agents since the mid-20th century. However, these efforts have mainly focused on advancement in algorithms or training strategies to enhance specific capabilities or performance on particular tasks. Actually, what the community lacks is a sufficiently general and powerful model to serve as a starting point for designing AI agents that can adapt to diverse …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I am training a small model (120k params) on a custom grid-world environment I built with JAX.
 I was able to train the model very well with PPO on 1 GPU, but when I scaled to multiple GPUs (tried with 6 in parallel), the training curves showed a lot more variance than what I was seeing on 1 GPU.
 I did not change the hyperparams, I just spawned the same number of environments (~7000 per GPU) on multiple devices. 
 The multi-GPU setup works in the following way:
 - I keep parallel independent buffers, one on each device
 - I initialize identical models on each device
 - I get independent gradients on each device at the update step, then I take the mean of the gradients across the devices and then I backpropagate the same gradients on each device independently. (I checked that after some time the models are still identical, and that is the case). 
 Now the question is, what could be the reason for such an increase in variance? What can I try to mitigate the problem?
 Here's a comparison of the entropy curves... 
 P.S. The model still trains quite well, but I guess that if I manage to make the curves smoother it is going to train much faster and to a better performance.

 Or do they match keywords in the input prompt?
 Or do they use a classifier to identify the input prompt?

While we've made a lot of cool tech, we still need a killer starting point for AI that can handle all sorts of tasks. Large Language Models" (LLMs) are like a big leap toward AI that's smart across the board. People have been using LLMs to make AI that can do loads of things. 
 The article takes us on a trip from where AI ideas started, to why LLMs rock as the backbone for AI. 
 https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07864
 They break down this LLM-AI into three parts: 
  
the thinky bit (brain), 
 what they sense (perception), 
 and what they do (action). 
  
They chat about how these AI can work solo, in teams, or buddy up with humans.

Typically DQN is trained with a deterministic function approximator. How would the algorithm become stochastic during inference time? In DQN the final layer activation is linear and therefore I don't see how one could even make this algorithm stochastic, unlike policy gradient where the final layer is softmax or Normal.

 I have been working on scalable GNN training for a while and noticed that the bottleneck of training GNNs is the graph sampling and feature fetching stages. GNN training frameworks PyG and DGL that most people use seem to default to using Neighbor Sampling for minibatch training. I am hoping that with my new paper Layer-Neighbor Sampling -- Defusing Neighborhood Explosion in GNNs, this default might be due to change.
 My new approach combines the layer sampling approach with the neighbor sampling approach. The result is that there is more overlap in the sampled neighborhoods and one still gets a fixed number of neighbors per seed vertex. It is even possible to turn it into a subgraph sampling approach by fixing the random seed used for sampling across all layers of the GNN m…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is no one definitive answer to this question, as the percentage of our thoughts that come to us on their own without our consciously choosing them can vary depending on the individual and the situation. However, some estimates suggest that up to 95% of our thoughts may be involuntary.
 This is because our thoughts are constantly being influenced by a variety of factors, both external and internal. For example, our environment, our emotions, and our physical state can all play a role in determining what thoughts pop into our heads.
 In addition, our brains are constantly processing information and making predictions, even when we are not actively thinking about anything. This process can sometimes lead to spontaneous thoughts, such as when we suddenly remember something that we had forgotten or when we come up with a new idea.
 While some of our spontaneous thoughts may be negative or intrusive, many of them can also be helpful or creative. For example, a spontaneous thought may help us to solve a problem, come up with a new solution, or simply make us smile.
 Overall, it is clear that a significant portion of our thoughts come to us without our consciously choosing them. This is a natural part of the human cognitive process and can be both beneficial and detrimental.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today we live in a world of multi-model LLMs. How will the following technologies fare against these LLM-based models? 
  
Neural VQA
 
Semantic Scene Segmentation
 
 Multi-model LLM are emerging quickly now, (such as NExT-GPT https://next-gpt.github.io/ ) . When you consider the kind of "understanding" of a visual scene these models are capable of, what will happen to prior approaches like Neural VQA? The nagging feeling that Neural VQA is going to be completely superseded by LLMs is palpable. The only vestige left for the older technology may have something to do with reasoning about the objects , such as properly counting the number of objects of a category that are present. But even that is getting sketchy. 
 On the topic of scene understanding, we can turn to semantic scene segmentation. SSS is a more complicated topic than Neural VQA. SOTA SSS algorithms are still largely employing DeConv Nets, and still require fully labelled datasets. With multi-model LLMs, there is a nagging question : Why go through the complexity/mess of first segmenting a scene very accurately, when an LLM can do better at identifying the entire scene's category in one fail swoop? 
 One might suggest that SSS still has a use in regards to interacting with the segmented objects of an environment, where one such "interaction" would be avoiding collisions with pedestrians, trees, or other cars. But honestly, SSS does not really make this connection with planning and action, it really only gives you the categories of the segments. THe autonomous vehicle's next moves are still an open problem. 
 What technologies do you expect that multi-model LLMs will supersede, if any?

The authors claim that when RNN is trained on multiple tasks from a task distribution using a model free RL algorithm, another model based RL algorithm emerges within the activation dynamics of RNN. The RNN with resulting activations acts as a standalone model based RL system on a new task(from the same task distribution) even after freezing the weights of outer loop model free algorithm of that. I couldn't understand how an RNN with only fixed activations act as RL? Can someone help?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey. First of all I'm not a researcher on this area, so pardon my ignorance.
 I'm looking to employ a GAN on a dataset. The goals are still a bit unclear, but it's mainly to improve classification by either data augmentation and class balancing, or understanding the data through the latent representations.
 I'm really keen on InfoGAN at the moment. I trained one on the MNIST and the continuous variables learned the rotation and width, as in the paper and other peoples code.
 But at this point I think I need some help. I have labels, which means that maybe I should use a conditional GAN. But how will I learn similar representations as those in InfoGAN? I know StyleGAN is the current big thing in this area, but my images are limited to similar pixel-range as MNIST, and StyleGAN seems dependant on the ProGAN idea of increasing resolution for training.
 I'm a bit confused on the whole topic and would love a pointer to any discussion etc., as I can't seem to find anything but papers and they seem to be only focused on human faces, my data is unnatural not unsimilar again to MNIST. I don't have semantical information either as I see many papers employing that.
 I see many papers employing semi-supervision in this area, but honestly I'm just a bit lost and overwhelmed as this is not my area and GAN papers are still not stopping (I read a post here from 2017 about a GAN making GANs...).
 If you read this far: thank you and any pointers and discussion are very welcome. I would post on /r/learnmachinelearning but I feel the discussion in there is very different from this. My main goal is data exploration, but also to prove effectiveness some classification will be necessary and here the generative approach may help to augment data efficiently.

academic and applied machine learning. On the other hand, these steps are
becoming ever increasingly delicate due to the extensive rise in the number,
diversity, and distributedness of machine learning resources. Multi-agent
systems, when applied to the design of machine learning platforms, bring about
several distinctive characteristics such as scalability, flexibility, and
robustness, just to name a few. This paper proposes a fully automatic and
collaborative agent-based mechanism for selecting distributedly organized
machine learning algorithms and simultaneously tuning their hyperparameters.
Our method builds upon an existing agent-based hierarchical machine-learning
platform and augments its query structure to support the aforementioned
functionalities without being limited to specific learning, selection, and
tuning mechanisms. We have conducted theoretical assessments, formal
verification, and analytical study to demonstrate the correctness, resource
utilization, and computational efficiency of our technique. According to the
results, our solution is totally correct and exhibits linear time and space
complexity in relation to the size of available resources. To provide concrete
examples of how the proposed methodologies can effectively adapt and perform
across a range of algorithmic options and datasets, we have also conducted a
series of experiments using a system comprised of 24 algorithms and 9 datasets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Traffic prediction is a crucial topic because of its broad scope of
applications in the transportation domain. Recently, various studies have
achieved promising results. However, most studies assume the prediction
locations have complete or at least partial historical records and cannot be
extended to non-historical recorded locations. In real-life scenarios, the
deployment of sensors could be limited due to budget limitations and
installation availability, which makes most current models not applicable.
Though few pieces of literature tried to impute traffic states at the missing
locations, these methods need the data simultaneously observed at the locations
with sensors, making them not applicable to prediction tasks. Another drawback
is the lack of measurement of uncertainty in prediction, making prior works
unsuitable for risk-sensitive tasks or involving decision-making. To fill the
gap, inspired by the previous inductive graph neural network, this work
proposed an uncertainty-aware framework with the ability to 1) extend
prediction to missing locations with no historical records and significantly
extend spatial coverage of prediction locations while reducing deployment of
sensors and 2) generate probabilistic prediction with uncertainty
quantification to help the management of risk and decision making in the
down-stream tasks. Through extensive experiments on real-life datasets, the
result shows our method achieved promising results on prediction tasks, and the
uncertainty quantification gives consistent results which highly correlated
with the locations with and without historical data. We also show that our
model could help support sensor deployment tasks in the transportation field to
achieve higher accuracy with a limited sensor deployment budget.]]></summary>

single precision IEEE 754 floating point numbers (binary32), can also work
using lower precision. Therefore, 16-bit and 8-bit compressed format have
attracted considerable attention. In this paper, we focused on two families of
formats that have already achieved interesting results in compressing binary32
numbers in machine learning applications, without sensible degradation of the
accuracy: bfloat and posit. Even if 16-bit and 8-bit bfloat/posit are routinely
used for reducing the storage of the weights/biases of trained DNNs, the
inference still often happens on the 32-bit FPU of the CPU (especially if GPUs
are not available). In this paper we propose a way to decompress a tensor of
bfloat/posits just before computations, i.e., after the compressed operands
have been loaded within the vector registers of a vector capable CPU, in order
to save bandwidth usage and increase cache efficiency. Finally, we show the
architectural parameters and considerations under which this solution is

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since Large Language Models or LLMs have demonstrated high-quality
performance on many complex language tasks, there is a great interest in
bringing these LLMs to mobile devices for faster responses and better privacy
protection. However, the size of LLMs (i.e., billions of parameters) requires
highly effective compression to fit into storage-limited devices. Among many
compression techniques, weight-clustering, a form of non-linear quantization,
is one of the leading candidates for LLM compression, and supported by modern
smartphones. Yet, its training overhead is prohibitively significant for LLM
fine-tuning. Especially, Differentiable KMeans Clustering, or DKM, has shown
the state-of-the-art trade-off between compression ratio and accuracy
regression, but its large memory complexity makes it nearly impossible to apply
to train-time LLM compression. In this paper, we propose a memory-efficient DKM
implementation, eDKM powered by novel techniques to reduce the memory footprint
of DKM by orders of magnitudes. For a given tensor to be saved on CPU for the
backward pass of DKM, we compressed the tensor by applying uniquification and
sharding after checking if there is no duplicated tensor previously copied to
CPU. Our experimental results demonstrate that \prjname can fine-tune and
compress a pretrained LLaMA 7B model from 12.6 GB to 2.5 GB (3bit/weight) with
the Alpaca dataset by reducing the train-time memory footprint of a decoder
layer by 130$\times$, while delivering good accuracy on broader LLM benchmarks
(i.e., 77.7% for PIQA, 66.1% for Winograde, and so on).]]></summary>

geometries, permitting larger, more complex design spaces. Identifying
promising configurations within such spaces presents a significant challenge
for current approaches. Furthermore, existing parameterisations of reactor
geometries are low-dimensional with expensive optimisation limiting more
complex solutions. To address this challenge, we establish a machine
learning-assisted approach for the design of the next-generation of chemical
reactors, combining the application of high-dimensional parameterisations,
computational fluid dynamics, and multi-fidelity Bayesian optimisation. We
associate the development of mixing-enhancing vortical flow structures in novel
coiled reactors with performance, and use our approach to identify key
characteristics of optimal designs. By appealing to fluid mechanical
principles, we rationalise the selection of novel design features that lead to
experimental performance improvements of ~60% over conventional designs. Our
results demonstrate that coupling advanced manufacturing techniques with
`augmented-intelligence' approaches can lead to superior design performance

important step in the drug discovery pipeline. Graph neural fingerprint is a
promising method for developing molecular docking surrogates with high
throughput and great fidelity. In this study, we built a COVID-19 drug docking
dataset of about 300,000 drug candidates on 23 coronavirus protein targets.
With this dataset, we trained graph neural fingerprint docking models for
high-throughput virtual COVID-19 drug screening. The graph neural fingerprint
models yield high prediction accuracy on docking scores with the mean squared
error lower than $0.21$ kcal/mol for most of the docking targets, showing
significant improvement over conventional circular fingerprint methods. To make
the neural fingerprints transferable for unknown targets, we also propose a
transferable graph neural fingerprint method trained on multiple targets. With
comparable accuracy to target-specific graph neural fingerprint models, the
transferable model exhibits superb training and data efficiency. We highlight
that the impact of this study extends beyond COVID-19 dataset, as our approach
for fast virtual ligand screening can be easily adapted and integrated into a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Traditional adversarial attacks concentrate on manipulating clean examples in
the pixel space by adding adversarial perturbations. By contrast, semantic
adversarial attacks focus on changing semantic attributes of clean examples,
such as color, context, and features, which are more feasible in the real
world. In this paper, we propose a framework to quickly generate a semantic
adversarial attack by leveraging recent diffusion models since semantic
information is included in the latent space of well-trained diffusion models.
Then there are two variants of this framework: 1) the Semantic Transformation
(ST) approach fine-tunes the latent space of the generated image and/or the
diffusion model itself; 2) the Latent Masking (LM) approach masks the latent
space with another target image and local backpropagation-based interpretation
methods. Additionally, the ST approach can be applied in either white-box or
black-box settings. Extensive experiments are conducted on CelebA-HQ and AFHQ
datasets, and our framework demonstrates great fidelity, generalizability, and
transferability compared to other baselines. Our approaches achieve
approximately 100% attack success rate in multiple settings with the best FID
as 36.61. Code is available at

Furthermore, ConDex is capable of updating the predicted grasping quality

Extensive evaluations in simulation demonstrate ConDex's superior performance

Furthermore, ConDex shows robust generalization to previously unseen real-world
objects despite training solely in the simulation. The synthetic and real-world

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spatial-temporal data contains rich information and has been widely studied
in recent years due to the rapid development of relevant applications in many
fields. For instance, medical institutions often use electrodes attached to
different parts of a patient to analyse the electorencephal data rich with
spatial and temporal features for health assessment and disease diagnosis.
Existing research has mainly used deep learning techniques such as
convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN) to extract
hidden spatial-temporal features. Yet, it is challenging to incorporate both
inter-dependencies spatial information and dynamic temporal changes
simultaneously. In reality, for a model that leverages these spatial-temporal
features to fulfil complex prediction tasks, it often requires a colossal
amount of training data in order to obtain satisfactory model performance.
Considering the above-mentioned challenges, we propose an adaptive federated
relevance framework, namely FedRel, for spatial-temporal graph learning in this
paper. After transforming the raw spatial-temporal data into high quality
features, the core Dynamic Inter-Intra Graph (DIIG) module in the framework is
able to use these features to generate the spatial-temporal graphs capable of
capturing the hidden topological and long-term temporal correlation information
in these graphs. To improve the model generalization ability and performance
while preserving the local data privacy, we also design a relevance-driven
federated learning module in our framework to leverage diverse data
distributions from different participants with attentive aggregations of their
models.]]></summary>

scientific knowledge graphs such as molecular interaction or chemical reaction

hierarchical and multiscale structure. However, the majority of methods
performing node- and edge-level tasks in machine learning do not take these

To address this, we propose a novel reliability-based training data cleaning
method employing inductive conformal prediction (ICP). This method capitalizes
on a small set of accurately labeled training data and leverages ICP-calculated
reliability metrics to rectify mislabeled data and outliers within vast
quantities of noisy training data. The efficacy of the method is validated
across three classification tasks within distinct modalities: filtering
drug-induced-liver-injury (DILI) literature with title and abstract, predicting
ICU admission of COVID-19 patients through CT radiomics and electronic health
records, and subtyping breast cancer using RNA-sequencing data. Varying levels
of noise to the training labels were introduced through label permutation.
Results show significant enhancements in classification performance: accuracy
enhancement in 86 out of 96 DILI experiments (up to 11.4%), AUROC and AUPRC
enhancements in all 48 COVID-19 experiments (up to 23.8% and 69.8%), and
accuracy and macro-average F1 score improvements in 47 out of 48 RNA-sequencing

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Effectively leveraging multimodal information from social media posts is
essential to various downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis, sarcasm
detection and hate speech classification. However, combining text and image
information is challenging because of the idiosyncratic cross-modal semantics
with hidden or complementary information present in matching image-text pairs.
In this work, we aim to directly model this by proposing the use of two
auxiliary losses jointly with the main task when fine-tuning any pre-trained
multimodal model. Image-Text Contrastive (ITC) brings image-text
representations of a post closer together and separates them from different
posts, capturing underlying dependencies. Image-Text Matching (ITM) facilitates
the understanding of semantic correspondence between images and text by
penalizing unrelated pairs. We combine these objectives with five multimodal
models, demonstrating consistent improvements across four popular social media
datasets. Furthermore, through detailed analysis, we shed light on the specific
scenarios and cases where each auxiliary task proves to be most effective.]]></summary>

accelerations, significantly influence the application of deep learning in
real-world scenarios. These innovations translate human labor efforts into
automated intelligent systems employed in various areas such as autonomous
driving, robotics, Internet-of-Things (IoT), and numerous other impactful
applications. NVIDIA's Jetson platform is one of the pioneers in offering
optimal performance regarding energy efficiency and throughput in the execution
of deep learning algorithms. Previously, most benchmarking analysis was based
on 2D images with a single deep learning model for each comparison result. In
this paper, we implement an end-to-end video-based crime-scene anomaly
detection system inputting from surveillance videos and the system is deployed
and completely operates on multiple Jetson edge devices (Nano, AGX Xavier, Orin
Nano). The comparison analysis includes the integration of Torch-TensorRT as a
software developer kit from NVIDIA for the model performance optimisation. The
system is built based on the PySlowfast open-source project from Facebook as
the coding template. The end-to-end system process comprises the videos from
camera, data preprocessing pipeline, feature extractor and the anomaly
detection. We provide the experience of an AI-based system deployment on
various Jetson Edge devices with Docker technology. Regarding anomaly
detectors, a weakly supervised video-based deep learning model called Robust
Temporal Feature Magnitude Learning (RTFM) is applied in the system. The
approach system reaches 47.56 frames per second (FPS) inference speed on a
Jetson edge device with only 3.11 GB RAM usage total. We also discover the
promising Jetson device that the AI system achieves 15% better performance than
the previous version of Jetson devices while consuming 50% less energy power.]]></summary>

blooms of water bodies, and is an important indicator for evaluating water
quality. The prediction of chlorophyll concentration change trend is of great
significance to environmental protection and aquaculture. However, there is a
complex and indistinguishable nonlinear relationship between many factors
affecting chlorophyll concentration. In order to effectively mine the nonlinear
features contained in the data. This paper proposes a time-series decomposition
adaptive graph-time convolutional network ( AGTCNSD ) prediction model.
Firstly, the original sequence is decomposed into trend component and periodic
component by moving average method. Secondly, based on the graph convolutional
neural network, the water quality parameter data is modeled, and a parameter
embedding matrix is defined. The idea of matrix decomposition is used to assign
weight parameters to each node. The adaptive graph convolution learns the
relationship between different water quality parameters, updates the state
information of each parameter, and improves the learning ability of the update
relationship between nodes. Finally, time dependence is captured by time
convolution to achieve multi-step prediction of chlorophyll concentration. The
validity of the model is verified by the water quality data of the coastal city
Beihai. The results show that the prediction effect of this method is better
than other methods. It can be used as a scientific resource for environmental

used by journalists and fact-checkers to assess the veracity of online content.
Automating the task of credibility signal extraction, however, is very
challenging as it requires high-accuracy signal-specific extractors to be
trained, while there are currently no sufficiently large datasets annotated
with all credibility signals. This paper investigates whether large language
models (LLMs) can be prompted effectively with a set of 18 credibility signals
to produce weak labels for each signal. We then aggregate these potentially
noisy labels using weak supervision in order to predict content veracity. We
demonstrate that our approach, which combines zero-shot LLM credibility signal
labeling and weak supervision, outperforms state-of-the-art classifiers on two
misinformation datasets without using any ground-truth labels for training. We
also analyse the contribution of the individual credibility signals towards
predicting content veracity, which provides new valuable insights into their
role in misinformation detection.]]></summary>

multidimensional signal and image processing, most traditional neural networks
process data represented by (multidimensional) arrays of real numbers. The
intercorrelation between feature channels is usually expected to be learned
from the training data, requiring numerous parameters and careful training. In
contrast, vector-valued neural networks are conceived to process arrays of
vectors and naturally consider the intercorrelation between feature channels.
Consequently, they usually have fewer parameters and often undergo more robust
training than traditional neural networks. This paper aims to present a broad
framework for vector-valued neural networks, referred to as V-nets. In this
context, hypercomplex-valued neural networks are regarded as vector-valued
models with additional algebraic properties. Furthermore, this paper explains
the relationship between vector-valued and traditional neural networks.
Precisely, a vector-valued neural network can be obtained by placing
restrictions on a real-valued model to consider the intercorrelation between
feature channels. Finally, we show how V-nets, including hypercomplex-valued
neural networks, can be implemented in current deep-learning libraries as

learning (ML) model for diagnosing and monitoring Parkinson's disease (PD) in
an Internet of Things (IoT) environment using rest-state EEG signals (rs-EEG).
We computed different types of entropy from EEG signals and found that Fuzzy
Entropy performed the best in diagnosing and monitoring PD using rs-EEG. We
also investigated different combinations of signal frequency ranges and EEG
channels to accurately diagnose PD. Finally, with a fewer number of features
(11 features), we achieved a maximum classification accuracy (ARKF) of ~99.9%.
The most prominent frequency range of EEG signals has been identified, and we
have found that high classification accuracy depends on low-frequency signal
components (0-4 Hz). Moreover, the most informative signals were mainly
received from the right hemisphere of the head (F8, P8, T8, FC6). Furthermore,
we assessed the accuracy of the diagnosis of PD using three different lengths
of EEG data (150-1000 samples). Because the computational complexity is reduced
by reducing the input data. As a result, we have achieved a maximum mean
accuracy of 99.9% for a sample length (LEEG) of 1000 (~7.8 seconds), 98.2% with
a LEEG of 800 (~6.2 seconds), and 79.3% for LEEG = 150 (~1.2 seconds). By
reducing the number of features and segment lengths, the computational cost of
classification can be reduced. Lower-performance smart ML sensors can be used
in IoT environments for enhances human resilience to PD.]]></summary>

Impairment (MCI). Early detection of AD is crucial for making treatment
decisions. However, most of the literature on computer-assisted detection of AD
focuses on classifying brain images into one of three major categories:
healthy, MCI, and AD; or categorizing MCI patients into (1) progressive: those
who progress from MCI to AD at a future examination time, and (2) stable: those
who stay as MCI and never progress to AD. This misses the opportunity to
accurately identify the trajectory of progressive MCI patients. In this paper,
we revisit the brain image classification task for AD identification and
re-frame it as an ordinal classification task to predict how close a patient is
to the severe AD stage. To this end, we select progressive MCI patients from
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset and construct an
ordinal dataset with a prediction target that indicates the time to progression
to AD. We train a Siamese network model to predict the time to onset of AD
based on MRI brain images. We also propose a Weighted variety of Siamese
network and compare its performance to a baseline model. Our evaluations show
that incorporating a weighting factor to Siamese networks brings considerable
performance gain at predicting how close input brain MRI images are to
progressing to AD. Moreover, we complement our results with an interpretation
of the learned embedding space of the Siamese networks using a model
explainability technique.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reinforcement Learning views the maximization of rewards and avoidance of
punishments as central to explaining goal-directed behavior. However, over a
life, organisms will need to learn about many different aspects of the world's
structure: the states of the world and state-vector transition dynamics. The
number of combinations of states grows exponentially as an agent incorporates
new knowledge, and there is no obvious weighted combination of pre-existing
rewards or costs defined for a given combination of states, as such a weighting
would need to encode information about good and bad combinations prior to an
agent's experience in the world. Therefore, we must develop more naturalistic
accounts of behavior and motivation in large state-spaces. We show that it is
possible to use only the intrinsic motivation metric of empowerment, which
measures the agent's capacity to realize many possible futures under a
transition operator. We propose to scale empowerment to hierarchical
state-spaces by using Operator Bellman Equations. These equations produce
state-time feasibility functions, which are compositional hierarchical
state-time transition operators that map an initial state and time when an
agent begins a policy to the final states and times of completing a goal.
Because these functions are hierarchical operators we can define hierarchical
empowerment measures on them. An agent can then optimize plans to distant
states and times to maximize its hierarchical empowerment-gain, allowing it to
discover goals that bring about a more favorable coupling of its internal
structure (physiological states) to its external environment (world structure &
spatial state). Life-long agents could therefore be primarily animated by
principles of compositionality and empowerment, exhibiting self-concern for the
growth & maintenance of their own structural integrity without recourse to
reward-maximization.]]></summary>

clinical applications. With the advent of advanced algorithms, various deep

Transformers for ECG data is not yet realized, despite their widespread success
in computer vision and natural language processing. In this work, we present a
useful masked Transformer method for ECG classification referred to as MTECG,
which expands the application of masked autoencoders to ECG time series. We
construct a dataset comprising 220,251 ECG recordings with a broad range of
diagnoses annoated by medical experts to explore the properties of MTECG. Under
the proposed training strategies, a lightweight model with 5.7M parameters
performs stably well on a broad range of masking ratios (5%-75%). The ablation
studies highlight the importance of fluctuated reconstruction targets, training
schedule length, layer-wise LR decay and DropPath rate. The experiments on both
private and public ECG datasets demonstrate that MTECG-T significantly

https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-36363-w (2023)], the authors present a deep
reinforced learning approach to augment combinatorial optimization heuristics.
In particular, they present results for several spin glass ground state
problems, for which instances on non-planar networks are generally NP-hard, in
comparison with several Monte Carlo based methods, such as simulated annealing
(SA) or parallel tempering (PT). Indeed, those results demonstrate that the
reinforced learning improves the results over those obtained with SA or PT, or
at least allows for reduced runtimes for the heuristics before results of
comparable quality have been obtained relative to those other methods. To
facilitate the conclusion that their method is ''superior'', the authors pursue
two basic strategies: (1) A commercial GUROBI solver is called on to procure a
sample of exact ground states as a testbed to compare with, and (2) a
head-to-head comparison between the heuristics is given for a sample of larger
instances where exact ground states are hard to ascertain. Here, we put these
studies into a larger context, showing that the claimed superiority is at best
marginal for smaller samples and becomes essentially irrelevant with respect to
any sensible approximation of true ground states in the larger samples. For
example, this method becomes irrelevant as a means to determine stiffness
exponents $\theta$ in $d>2$, as mentioned by the authors, where the problem is
not only NP-hard but requires the subtraction of two almost equal ground-state
energies and systemic errors in each of $\approx 1\%$ found here are
unacceptable. This larger picture on the method arises from a straightforward
finite-size corrections study over the spin glass ensembles the authors employ,
using data that has been available for decades.]]></summary>

develop unbiased decision-making in valuing properties. Real estate appraisal
serves as one of the high-cost property valuation tasks for financial
institutions since it requires domain experts to appraise the estimation based
on the corresponding knowledge and the judgment of the market. Existing
automated valuation models reducing the subjectivity of domain experts require
a large number of transactions for effective evaluation, which is predominantly
limited to not only the labeling efforts of transactions but also the
generalizability of new developing and rural areas. To learn representations
from unlabeled real estate sets, existing self-supervised learning (SSL) for
tabular data neglects various important features, and fails to incorporate
domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose DoRA, a Domain-based
self-supervised learning framework for low-resource Real estate Appraisal. DoRA
is pre-trained with an intra-sample geographic prediction as the pretext task
based on the metadata of the real estate for equipping the real estate
representations with prior domain knowledge. Furthermore, inter-sample
contrastive learning is employed to generalize the representations to be robust
for limited transactions of downstream tasks. Our benchmark results on three
property types of real-world transactions show that DoRA significantly
outperforms the SSL baselines for tabular data, the graph-based methods, and
the supervised approaches in the few-shot scenarios by at least 7.6% for MAPE,
11.59% for MAE, and 3.34% for HR10%. We expect DoRA to be useful to other
financial practitioners with similar marketplace applications who need general
models for properties that are newly built and have limited records. The source
code is available at https://github.com/wwweiwei/DoRA.]]></summary>

(ML) based systems raise major evaluation challenges that are amplified by the
large-scale deployment of models in many hardware platforms. Until recently,
most of research works focused on API-based attacks that consider a ML model as
a pure algorithmic abstraction. However, new implementation-based threats have
been revealed, emphasizing the urgency to propose both practical and
simulation-based methods to properly evaluate the robustness of models. A major
concern is parameter-based attacks (such as the Bit-Flip Attack, BFA) that
highlight the lack of robustness of typical deep neural network models when
confronted by accurate and optimal alterations of their internal parameters
stored in memory. Setting in a security testing purpose, this work practically
reports, for the first time, a successful variant of the BFA on a 32-bit
Cortex-M microcontroller using laser fault injection. It is a standard fault
injection means for security evaluation, that enables to inject spatially and
temporally accurate faults. To avoid unrealistic brute-force strategies, we

global score functions. However, if local variables have direct and indirect
dependence simultaneously, the global optimization on score functions misses
edges between variables with indirect dependent relationship, of which scores
are smaller than those with direct dependent relationship. In this paper, we
present an identifiability condition based on a determined subset of parents to
identify the underlying DAG. By the identifiability condition, we develop a
two-phase algorithm namely optimal-tuning (OT) algorithm to locally amend the
global optimization. In the optimal phase, an optimization problem based on
first-order Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) gives an estimated
skeleton as the initial determined parents subset. In the tuning phase, the
skeleton is locally tuned by deletion, addition and DAG-formalization
strategies using the theoretically proved incremental properties of high-order
HSIC. Numerical experiments for different synthetic datasets and real-world
datasets show that the OT algorithm outperforms existing methods. Especially in
Sigmoid Mix model with the size of the graph being ${\rm\bf d=40}$, the
structure intervention distance (SID) of the OT algorithm is 329.7 smaller than
the one obtained by CAM, which indicates that the graph estimated by the OT
algorithm misses fewer edges compared with CAM.Source code of the OT algorithm

low-level elements, such as input features, to explanations encoded in terms of
interpretable concepts learned from data. How to reliably acquire such concepts
is, however, still fundamentally unclear. An agreed-upon notion of concept
interpretability is missing, with the result that concepts used by both
post-hoc explainers and concept-based neural networks are acquired through a
variety of mutually incompatible strategies. Critically, most of these neglect
the human side of the problem: a representation is understandable only insofar
as it can be understood by the human at the receiving end. The key challenge in
Human-interpretable Representation Learning (HRL) is how to model and
operationalize this human element. In this work, we propose a mathematical
framework for acquiring interpretable representations suitable for both
post-hoc explainers and concept-based neural networks. Our formalization of HRL
builds on recent advances in causal representation learning and explicitly
models a human stakeholder as an external observer. This allows us to derive a
principled notion of alignment between the machine representation and the
vocabulary of concepts understood by the human. In doing so, we link alignment
and interpretability through a simple and intuitive name transfer game, and
clarify the relationship between alignment and a well-known property of
representations, namely disentanglment. We also show that alignment is linked
to the issue of undesirable correlations among concepts, also known as concept
leakage, and to content-style separation, all through a general
information-theoretic reformulation of these properties. Our conceptualization
aims to bridge the gap between the human and algorithmic sides of
interpretability and establish a stepping stone for new research on
human-interpretable representations.]]></summary>

optimization algorithms. Our architecture consists of a neural network mapping
problem parameters to warm starts, followed by a predefined number of

minimize the fixed-point residual or the distance to a ground truth solution.
In this way, the neural network predicts warm starts with the end-to-end goal
of minimizing the downstream loss. An important feature of our architecture is
its flexibility, in that it can predict a warm start for fixed-point algorithms
run for any number of steps, without being limited to the number of steps it
has been trained on. We provide PAC-Bayes generalization bounds on unseen data
for common classes of fixed-point operators: contractive, linearly convergent,

\max_{\mathbf{y} \in \mathcal{Y}} f(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})$, where $f$ is
nonconvex in $\mathbf{x}$ but concave in $\mathbf{y}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$ is a

interpretability. Despite the advancements in interpretable machine learning
(IML) methods, they frequently assign importance to features which lack causal
influence on the outcome variable. Selecting causally relevant features among
those identified as relevant by these methods, or even before model training,
would offer a solution. Feature selection methods utilizing information
theoretical quantities have been successful in identifying statistically
relevant features. However, the information theoretical quantities they are
based on do not incorporate causality, rendering them unsuitable for such
scenarios. To address this challenge, this article proposes information
theoretical quantities that incorporate the causal structure of the system,
which can be used to evaluate causal importance of features for some given
outcome variable. Specifically, we introduce causal versions of entropy and
mutual information, termed causal entropy and causal information gain, which
are designed to assess how much control a feature provides over the outcome
variable. These newly defined quantities capture changes in the entropy of a
variable resulting from interventions on other variables. Fundamental results
connecting these quantities to the existence of causal effects are derived. The
use of causal information gain in feature selection is demonstrated,
highlighting its superiority over standard mutual information in revealing
which features provide control over a chosen outcome variable. Our
investigation paves the way for the development of methods with improved
interpretability in domains involving causation.]]></summary>

spatial location with EEG in a multiple-speaker setting. ASAD methods are
inspired by the brain lateralization of cortical neural responses during the
processing of auditory spatial attention, and show promising performance for
the task of auditory attention decoding (AAD) with neural recordings. In the
previous ASAD methods, the spatial distribution of EEG electrodes is not fully
exploited, which may limit the performance of these methods. In the present
work, by transforming the original EEG channels into a two-dimensional (2D)
spatial topological map, the EEG data is transformed into a three-dimensional
(3D) arrangement containing spatial-temporal information. And then a 3D deep
convolutional neural network (DenseNet-3D) is used to extract temporal and
spatial features of the neural representation for the attended locations. The
results show that the proposed method achieves higher decoding accuracy than
the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method (94.4% compared to XANet's 90.6%) with
1-second decision window for the widely used KULeuven (KUL) dataset, and the

existing spatial robustness methods by incorporating both local and global
spatial vulnerability into a unified spatial attack and adversarial training
approach. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive relationship between natural
accuracy, sensitivity-based robustness, and spatial robustness, supported by
strong evidence from the perspective of robust representation. Crucially, to
reconcile the interplay between the mutual impacts of various robustness
components into one unified framework, we incorporate the \textit{Pareto
criterion} into the adversarial robustness analysis, yielding a novel strategy
called Pareto Adversarial Training for achieving universal robustness. The
resulting Pareto front, which delineates the set of optimal solutions, provides
an optimal balance between natural accuracy and various adversarial robustness.
This sheds light on solutions for achieving universal robustness in the future.

goal representation as they offer ways to structure knowledge for efficient and

Learning (HRL) approaches relying on symbolic reasoning are often limited as

discovering a symbolic goal representation is that it must preserve critical
information, such as the environment dynamics. In this paper, we propose a
developmental mechanism for goal discovery via an emergent representation that
abstracts (i.e., groups together) sets of environment states that have similar
roles in the task. We introduce a Feudal HRL algorithm that concurrently learns
both the goal representation and a hierarchical policy. The algorithm uses
symbolic reachability analysis for neural networks to approximate the
transition relation among sets of states and to refine the goal representation.
We evaluate our approach on complex navigation tasks, showing the learned

applications due to the high cost of data labeling. To this end,
semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) on graphs aims to leverage the

graph with limited labels. SSDA tasks need to overcome the domain gap between
the source and target graphs. However, to date, this challenging research
problem has yet to be formally considered by the existing approaches designed

novel method called SemiGCL is proposed, which benefits from graph contrastive
learning and minimax entropy training. SemiGCL generates informative node
representations by contrasting the representations learned from a graph's local
and global views. Additionally, SemiGCL is adversarially optimized with the
entropy loss of unlabeled target nodes to reduce domain divergence.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemiGCL outperforms

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We introduce beta diffusion, a novel generative modeling method that
integrates demasking and denoising to generate data within bounded ranges.
Using scaled and shifted beta distributions, beta diffusion utilizes
multiplicative transitions over time to create both forward and reverse
diffusion processes, maintaining beta distributions in both the forward
marginals and the reverse conditionals, given the data at any point in time.
Unlike traditional diffusion-based generative models relying on additive
Gaussian noise and reweighted evidence lower bounds (ELBOs), beta diffusion is
multiplicative and optimized with KL-divergence upper bounds (KLUBs) derived
from the convexity of the KL divergence. We demonstrate that the proposed KLUBs
are more effective for optimizing beta diffusion compared to negative ELBOs,
which can also be derived as the KLUBs of the same KL divergence with its two
arguments swapped. The loss function of beta diffusion, expressed in terms of
Bregman divergence, further supports the efficacy of KLUBs for optimization.
Experimental results on both synthetic data and natural images demonstrate the
unique capabilities of beta diffusion in generative modeling of range-bounded
data and validate the effectiveness of KLUBs in optimizing diffusion models,
thereby making them valuable additions to the family of diffusion-based
generative models and the optimization techniques used to train them.]]></summary>

events that put physical fitness and endurance of riders to the test. The
coaches of Team Jumbo-Visma have long been responsible for predicting the
energy needs of each rider of the Dutch team for every race on the calendar.
Those must be estimated to ensure riders have the energy and resources
necessary to maintain a high level of performance throughout a race. This task,
however, is both time-consuming and challenging, as it requires precise
estimates of race speed and power output. Traditionally, the approach to
predicting energy needs has relied on judgement and experience of coaches, but
this method has its limitations and often leads to inaccurate predictions. In
this paper, we propose a new, more effective approach to predicting energy
needs for cycling races. By predicting the speed and power with regression
models, we provide the coaches with calorie needs estimates for each individual
rider per stage instantly. In addition, we compare methods to quantify
uncertainty using conformal prediction. The empirical analysis of the
jackknife+, jackknife-minmax, jackknife-minmax-after-bootstrap, CV+, CV-minmax,
conformalized quantile regression, and inductive conformal prediction methods
in conformal prediction reveals that all methods achieve valid prediction
intervals. All but minmax-based methods also produce sufficiently narrow
prediction intervals for decision-making. Furthermore, methods computing
prediction intervals of fixed size produce tighter intervals for low
significance values. Among the methods computing intervals of varying length
across the input space, inductive conformal prediction computes narrower
prediction intervals at larger significance level.]]></summary>

significant attention, as the distances induced by optimal transport provide
both a principled metric between graphs as well as an interpretable description
of the associated changes between graphs in terms of a transport plan. As the
lack of symmetry introduces challenges in the typically considered
formulations, optimal transport distances for graphs have mostly been developed
for undirected graphs. Here, we propose two distance measures to compare
directed graphs based on variants of optimal transport: (i) an earth movers
distance (Wasserstein) and (ii) a Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance. We evaluate
these two distances and discuss their relative performance for both simulated
graph data and real-world directed cell-cell communication graphs, inferred
from single-cell RNA-seq data.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Purpose: Common to most MRSI techniques, the spatial resolution and the
minimal scan duration of Deuterium Metabolic Imaging (DMI) are limited by the
achievable SNR. This work presents a deep learning method for sensitivity
enhancement of DMI.

Methods: A convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed to estimate the
2H-labeled metabolite concentrations from low SNR and distorted DMI FIDs. The
CNN was trained with synthetic data that represent a range of SNR levels
typically encountered in vivo. The estimation precision was further improved by
fine-tuning the CNN with MRI-based edge-preserving regularization for each DMI
dataset. The proposed processing method, PReserved Edge ConvolutIonal neural
network for Sensitivity Enhanced DMI (PRECISE-DMI), was applied to simulation
studies and in vivo experiments to evaluate the anticipated improvements in SNR
and investigate the potential for inaccuracies.

Results: PRECISE-DMI visually improved the metabolic maps of low SNR
datasets, and quantitatively provided higher precision than the standard
Fourier reconstruction. Processing of DMI data acquired in rat brain tumor
models resulted in more precise determination of 2H-labeled lactate and
glutamate + glutamine levels, at increased spatial resolution (from >8 to 2
$\mu$L) or shortened scan time (from 32 to 4 min) compared to standard
acquisitions. However, rigorous SD-bias analyses showed that overuse of the
edge-preserving regularization can compromise the accuracy of the results.

Conclusion: PRECISE-DMI allows a flexible trade-off between enhancing the
sensitivity of DMI and minimizing the inaccuracies. With typical settings, the
DMI sensitivity can be improved by 3-fold while retaining the capability to
detect local signal variations.]]></summary>

the entire output from scratch, including the unedited regions. This leads to a
significant waste of computation, especially for minor editing operations. In
this work, we present Spatially Sparse Inference (SSI), a general-purpose
technique that selectively performs computation for edited regions and

input image. This motivates us to cache and reuse the feature maps of the
original image. Given an edited image, we sparsely apply the convolutional
filters to the edited regions while reusing the cached features for the
unedited areas. Based on our algorithm, we further propose Sparse Incremental
Generative Engine (SIGE) to convert the computation reduction to latency
reduction on off-the-shelf hardware. With about $1\%$-area edits, SIGE
accelerates DDPM by $3.0\times$ on NVIDIA RTX 3090 and $4.6\times$ on Apple M1

networks exhibit benign overfitting: they can be driven to zero training error,
perfectly fitting any noisy training labels, and simultaneously achieve minimax
optimal test error. In contrast to previous work on benign overfitting that
require linear or kernel-based predictors, our analysis holds in a setting

genomic studies to identify differentially expressed genes. However, due to
unmeasured confounders, many standard statistical approaches may be
substantially biased. This paper investigates the large-scale hypothesis
testing problem for multivariate generalized linear models in the presence of
confounding effects. Under arbitrary confounding mechanisms, we propose a
unified statistical estimation and inference framework that harnesses
orthogonal structures and integrates linear projections into three key stages.
It first leverages multivariate responses to separate marginal and uncorrelated
confounding effects, recovering the confounding coefficients' column space.
Subsequently, latent factors and primary effects are jointly estimated,
utilizing $\ell_1$-regularization for sparsity while imposing orthogonality
onto confounding coefficients. Finally, we incorporate projected and weighted
bias-correction steps for hypothesis testing. Theoretically, we establish
various effects' identification conditions and non-asymptotic error bounds. We
show effective Type-I error control of asymptotic $z$-tests as sample and
response sizes approach infinity. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method controls the false discovery rate by the Benjamini-Hochberg
procedure and is more powerful than alternative methods. By comparing
single-cell RNA-seq counts from two groups of samples, we demonstrate the
suitability of adjusting confounding effects when significant covariates are
absent from the model.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Auditory Attention Detection (AAD) aims to detect target speaker from brain
signals in a multi-speaker environment. Although EEG-based AAD methods have
shown promising results in recent years, current approaches primarily rely on
traditional convolutional neural network designed for processing Euclidean data
like images. This makes it challenging to handle EEG signals, which possess
non-Euclidean characteristics. In order to address this problem, this paper
proposes a dynamical graph self-distillation (DGSD) approach for AAD, which
does not require speech stimuli as input. Specifically, to effectively
represent the non-Euclidean properties of EEG signals, dynamical graph
convolutional networks are applied to represent the graph structure of EEG
signals, which can also extract crucial features related to auditory spatial
attention in EEG signals. In addition, to further improve AAD detection
performance, self-distillation, consisting of feature distillation and
hierarchical distillation strategies at each layer, is integrated. These
strategies leverage features and classification results from the deepest
network layers to guide the learning of shallow layers. Our experiments are
conducted on two publicly available datasets, KUL and DTU. Under a 1-second
time window, we achieve results of 90.0\% and 79.6\% accuracy on KUL and DTU,
respectively. We compare our DGSD method with competitive baselines, and the
experimental results indicate that the detection performance of our proposed
DGSD method is not only superior to the best reproducible baseline but also
significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters by approximately 100
times.]]></summary>

(EEG)-based cognitive workload (CWL) estimation. The focus of the article is
twofold: identify the disparate experimental paradigms used for reliably
eliciting discreet and quantifiable levels of cognitive load and the specific
nature and representational structure of the commonly used input formulations
in deep neural networks (DNNs) used for signal classification. The analysis
revealed a number of studies using EEG signals in its native representation of
a two-dimensional matrix for offline classification of CWL. However, only a few
studies adopted an online or pseudo-online classification strategy for
real-time CWL estimation. Further, only a couple of interpretable DNNs and a
single generative model were employed for cognitive load detection till date
during this review. More often than not, researchers were using DNNs as
black-box type models. In conclusion, DNNs prove to be valuable tools for
classifying EEG signals, primarily due to the substantial modeling power
provided by the depth of their network architecture. It is further suggested
that interpretable and explainable DNN models must be employed for cognitive
workload estimation since existing methods are limited in the face of the
non-stationary nature of the signal.]]></summary>

hardware and software combinations. However, the freedom to experiment across
different tooling stacks can be at odds with the drive for efficiency, which
has produced increasingly specialized AI hardware and incentivized
consolidation around a narrow set of ML frameworks. Exploratory research can be
restricted if software and hardware are co-evolving, making it even harder to
stray away from mainstream ideas that work well with popular tooling stacks.
While this friction increasingly impacts the rate of innovation in machine
learning, to our knowledge the lack of portability in tooling has not been
quantified. In this work, we ask: How portable are popular ML software
frameworks? We conduct a large-scale study of the portability of mainstream ML
frameworks across different hardware types. Our findings paint an uncomfortable
picture -- frameworks can lose more than 40% of their key functions when ported
to other hardware. Worse, even when functions are portable, the slowdown in
their performance can be extreme and render performance untenable.
Collectively, our results reveal how costly straying from a narrow set of
hardware-software combinations can be - and suggest that specialization of

outperforming traditional statistical techniques. However, to establish ML as a
reliable tool in clinical practice, adherence to best practices regarding data

summarizes and strictly observes such practices to ensure reproducible and
reliable ML. Specifically, we focus on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection,
which serves as a paradigmatic example of challenging problem in healthcare. We
investigate the impact of different data augmentation techniques and model
complexity on the overall performance. We consider MRI data from ADNI dataset
to address a classification problem employing 3D Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). The experiments are designed to compensate for data scarcity and initial
random parameters by utilizing cross-validation and multiple training trials.
Within this framework, we train 15 predictive models, considering three
different data augmentation strategies and five distinct 3D CNN architectures,
each varying in the number of convolutional layers. Specifically, the
augmentation strategies are based on affine transformations, such as zoom,
shift, and rotation, applied concurrently or separately. The combined effect of
data augmentation and model complexity leads to a variation in prediction
performance up to 10% of accuracy. When affine transformation are applied
separately, the model is more accurate, independently from the adopted
architecture. For all strategies, the model accuracy followed a concave
behavior at increasing number of convolutional layers, peaking at an
intermediate value of layers. The best model (8 CL, (B)) is the most stable
across cross-validation folds and training trials, reaching excellent
performance both on the testing set and on an external test set.]]></summary>

complex monotonic-increasing shapes that change the distribution of the data so
that the linear transformation that follows is more effective. Because a D-PBN
operates by "backing up", the TCAs are inverted in the reconstruction process,
restoring the original distribution of the data, thus taking advantage of a
given TCA in both analysis and reconstruction. In this paper, we show that a
D-PBN auto-encoder with TCAs can significantly out-perform standard
auto-encoders including variational auto-encoders.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Variable importance assessment has become a crucial step in machine-learning
applications when using complex learners, such as deep neural networks, on
large-scale data. Removal-based importance assessment is currently the
reference approach, particularly when statistical guarantees are sought to
justify variable inclusion. It is often implemented with variable permutation
schemes. On the flip side, these approaches risk misidentifying unimportant
variables as important in the presence of correlations among covariates. Here
we develop a systematic approach for studying Conditional Permutation
Importance (CPI) that is model agnostic and computationally lean, as well as
reusable benchmarks of state-of-the-art variable importance estimators. We show
theoretically and empirically that $\textit{CPI}$ overcomes the limitations of
standard permutation importance by providing accurate type-I error control.
When used with a deep neural network, $\textit{CPI}$ consistently showed top
accuracy across benchmarks. An empirical benchmark on real-world data analysis
in a large-scale medical dataset showed that $\textit{CPI}$ provides a more
parsimonious selection of statistically significant variables. Our results
suggest that $\textit{CPI}$ can be readily used as drop-in replacement for
permutation-based methods.]]></summary>

medicine and decision support systems through the analysis of whole slide
images. It has the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of
cancer. However, a major challenge to this objective is that for many specific
computational pathology tasks the amount of data is inadequate for development.
To address this challenge, we created Virchow, a 632 million parameter deep
neural network foundation model for computational pathology. Using
self-supervised learning, Virchow is trained on 1.5 million hematoxylin and
eosin stained whole slide images from diverse tissue groups, which is orders of
magnitude more data than previous works. When evaluated on downstream tasks
including tile-level pan-cancer detection and subtyping and slide-level
biomarker prediction, Virchow outperforms state-of-the-art systems both on
internal datasets drawn from the same population as the pretraining data as
well as external public datasets. Virchow achieves 93% balanced accuracy for
pancancer tile classification, and AUCs of 0.983 for colon microsatellite
instability status prediction and 0.967 for breast CDH1 status prediction. The
gains in performance highlight the importance of pretraining on massive
pathology image datasets, suggesting pretraining on even larger datasets could
continue improving performance for many high-impact applications where limited
amounts of training data are available, such as drug outcome prediction.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Large pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated great
potential in zero-shot transferability to downstream tasks. However, to attain
optimal performance, the manual selection of prompts is necessary to improve
alignment between the downstream image distribution and the textual class
descriptions. This manual prompt engineering is the major challenge for
deploying such models in practice since it requires domain expertise and is
extremely time-consuming. To avoid non-trivial prompt engineering, recent work
Context Optimization (CoOp) introduced the concept of prompt learning to the
vision domain using learnable textual tokens. While CoOp can achieve
substantial improvements over manual prompts, its learned context is worse
generalizable to wider unseen classes within the same dataset. In this work, we
present Prompt Learning with Reparameterization Encoder (PRE) - a simple and
efficient method that enhances the generalization ability of the learnable
prompt to unseen classes while maintaining the capacity to learn Base classes.
Instead of directly optimizing the prompts, PRE employs a prompt encoder to
reparameterize the input prompt embeddings, enhancing the exploration of
task-specific knowledge from few-shot samples. Experiments and extensive
ablation studies on 8 benchmarks demonstrate that our approach is an efficient
method for prompt learning. Specifically, PRE achieves a notable enhancement of
5.60% in average accuracy on New classes and 3% in Harmonic mean compared to
CoOp in the 16-shot setting, all achieved within a good training time.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The main premise of federated learning (FL) is that machine learning model
updates are computed locally to preserve user data privacy. This approach
avoids by design user data to ever leave the perimeter of their device. Once
the updates aggregated, the model is broadcast to all nodes in the federation.
However, without proper defenses, compromised nodes can probe the model inside
their local memory in search for adversarial examples, which can lead to
dangerous real-world scenarios. For instance, in image-based applications,
adversarial examples consist of images slightly perturbed to the human eye
getting misclassified by the local model. These adversarial images are then
later presented to a victim node's counterpart model to replay the attack.
Typical examples harness dissemination strategies such as altered traffic signs
(patch attacks) no longer recognized by autonomous vehicles or seemingly
unaltered samples that poison the local dataset of the FL scheme to undermine
its robustness. Pelta is a novel shielding mechanism leveraging Trusted
Execution Environments (TEEs) that reduce the ability of attackers to craft
adversarial samples. Pelta masks inside the TEE the first part of the
back-propagation chain rule, typically exploited by attackers to craft the
malicious samples. We evaluate Pelta on state-of-the-art accurate models using
three well-established datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet. We show the
effectiveness of Pelta in mitigating six white-box state-of-the-art adversarial
attacks, such as Projected Gradient Descent, Momentum Iterative Method, Auto
Projected Gradient Descent, the Carlini & Wagner attack. In particular, Pelta
constitutes the first attempt at defending an ensemble model against the
Self-Attention Gradient attack to the best of our knowledge. Our code is

extract physiologically relevant biosignals from acoustic data, closely tied to
cardiovascular and respiratory patterns, making our approach apart in its
departure from conventional audio feature extraction practices. We use Power
Spectral Density analysis and filtering techniques to select Intrinsic Mode
Functions (IMFs) strongly correlated with underlying physiological phenomena.
These biosignals undergo a comprehensive feature extraction process for
predictive modeling. Initially, we deploy a binary classification model that
demonstrates a balanced accuracy of 87% in distinguishing between healthy and
diseased individuals. Subsequently, we employ a six-class classification model
that achieves a balanced accuracy of 72% in diagnosing specific respiratory
conditions like pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). For
the first time, we also introduce regression models that estimate age and body
mass index (BMI) based solely on acoustic data, as well as a model for gender
classification. Our findings underscore the potential of this approach to
significantly enhance assistive and remote diagnostic capabilities.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unsupervised contrastive learning methods have recently seen significant
improvements, particularly through data augmentation strategies that aim to
produce robust and generalizable representations. However, prevailing data
augmentation methods, whether hand designed or based on foundation models, tend
to rely heavily on prior knowledge or external data. This dependence often
compromises their effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the applicability
of most existing data augmentation strategies is limited when transitioning to
other research domains, especially science-related data. This limitation stems
from the paucity of prior knowledge and labeled data available in these
domains. To address these challenges, we introduce DiffAug-a novel and
efficient Diffusion-based data Augmentation technique. DiffAug aims to ensure
that the augmented and original data share a smoothed latent space, which is
achieved through diffusion steps. Uniquely, unlike traditional methods, DiffAug
first mines sufficient prior semantic knowledge about the neighborhood. This
provides a constraint to guide the diffusion steps, eliminating the need for
labels, external data/models, or prior knowledge. Designed as an
architecture-agnostic framework, DiffAug provides consistent improvements.
Specifically, it improves image classification and clustering accuracy by
1.6%~4.5%. When applied to biological data, DiffAug improves performance by up
to 10.1%, with an average improvement of 5.8%. DiffAug shows good performance
in both vision and biological domains.]]></summary>

grid operation. In this work, we propose a practical yet robust detection
approach that utilizes only readily available voltage magnitudes, eliminating
the need for costly phase angles or power flow data. Given the sensor data,
many existing detection methods based on change-point detection require prior
knowledge of outage patterns, which are unknown for real-world outage
scenarios. To remove this impractical requirement, we propose a data-driven
method to learn the parameters of the post-outage distribution through gradient
descent. However, directly using gradient descent presents feasibility issues.
To address this, we modify our approach by adding a Bregman divergence
constraint to control the trajectory of the parameter updates, which eliminates
the feasibility problems. As timely operation is the key nowadays, we prove
that the optimal parameters can be learned with convergence guarantees via
leveraging the statistical and physical properties of voltage data. We evaluate
our approach using many representative distribution grids and real load
profiles with 17 outage configurations. The results show that we can detect and
localize the outage in a timely manner with only voltage magnitudes and without
assuming a prior knowledge of outage patterns.]]></summary>

synergistically combines domain-aware and interpretable models with agnostic
machine learning techniques. In this work, we introduce GOKU-UI, an evolution
of the SciML generative model GOKU-nets. GOKU-UI not only broadens the original
model's spectrum to incorporate other classes of differential equations, such
as Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), but also integrates attention
mechanisms and a novel multiple shooting training strategy in the latent space.
These modifications have led to a significant increase in its performance in
both reconstruction and forecast tasks, as demonstrated by our evaluation of
simulated and empirical data. Specifically, GOKU-UI outperformed all baseline
models on synthetic datasets even with a training set 16-fold smaller,
underscoring its remarkable data efficiency. Furthermore, when applied to
empirical human brain data, while incorporating stochastic Stuart-Landau
oscillators into its dynamical core, our proposed enhancements markedly
increased the model's effectiveness in capturing complex brain dynamics. This
augmented version not only surpassed all baseline methods in the reconstruction
task, but also demonstrated lower prediction error of future brain activity up
to 15 seconds ahead. By training GOKU-UI on resting state fMRI data, we encoded
whole-brain dynamics into a latent representation, learning a low-dimensional
dynamical system model that could offer insights into brain functionality and
open avenues for practical applications such as the classification of mental
states or psychiatric conditions. Ultimately, our research provides further
impetus for the field of Scientific Machine Learning, showcasing the potential
for advancements when established scientific insights are interwoven with
modern machine learning.]]></summary>

behaviors, which are more suitable to be described by stochastic differential
equations under non-Gaussian L\'evy noise. Among these complex phenomena, the
most likely transition paths between metastable states are important since
these rare events may have a high impact in certain scenarios. Based on the
large deviation principle, the most likely transition path could be treated as
the minimizer of the rate function upon paths that connect two points. One of
the challenges to calculate the most likely transition path for stochastic
dynamical systems under non-Gaussian L\'evy noise is that the associated rate
function can not be explicitly expressed by paths. For this reason, we
formulate an optimal control problem to obtain the optimal state as the most
likely transition path. We then develop a neural network method to solve this

thriving research domain, particularly in the context of brain-computer
interfaces. Our study presents an innovative method that employs to classify
and reconstruct images from the ImageNet dataset using electroencephalography
(EEG) data from subjects that had viewed the images themselves (i.e. "brain
decoding"). We analyzed EEG recordings from 6 participants, each exposed to 50
images spanning 40 unique semantic categories. These EEG readings were
converted into spectrograms, which were then used to train a convolutional
neural network (CNN), integrated with a knowledge distillation procedure based
on a pre-trained Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP)-based image
classification teacher network. This strategy allowed our model to attain a
top-5 accuracy of 80%, significantly outperforming a standard CNN and various
RNN-based benchmarks. Additionally, we incorporated an image reconstruction
mechanism based on pre-trained latent diffusion models, which allowed us to
generate an estimate of the images which had elicited EEG activity. Therefore,
our architecture not only decodes images from neural activity but also offers a
credible image reconstruction from EEG only, paving the way for e.g. swift,
individualized feedback experiments. Our research represents a significant step
forward in connecting neural signals with visual cognition.]]></summary>

deep neural networks and can generate prediction intervals. Quantifying
uncertainty is particularly important in critical applications such as clinical
diagnosis, where a realistic assessment of uncertainty is essential in
determining disease status and planning the appropriate treatment. The most
common application of quantile regression models is in cases where the
parametric likelihood cannot be specified. Although quantile regression is
quite robust to outlier response observations, it can be sensitive to outlier
covariate observations (features). Outlier features can compromise the
performance of deep learning regression problems such as style translation,
image reconstruction, and deep anomaly detection, potentially leading to
misleading conclusions. To address this problem, we propose a robust solution
for quantile regression that incorporates concepts from robust divergence. We
compare the performance of our proposed method with (i) least trimmed quantile
regression and (ii) robust regression based on the regularization of
case-specific parameters in a simple real dataset in the presence of outlier.
These methods have not been applied in a deep learning framework. We also

high-dimensional data in one domain, e.g., genetic data, to high dimensional
data in a second domain, e.g., brain imaging data. The standard approach in the
area are mass univariate analyses across genetic factors and imaging
phenotypes. That entails executing one genome-wide association study (GWAS) for
each pre-defined imaging measure. Although this approach has been tremendously
successful, one shortcoming is that phenotypes must be pre-defined.
Consequently, effects that are not confined to pre-selected regions of interest
or that reflect larger brain-wide patterns can easily be missed. In this work
we introduce a Partial Least Squares (PLS)-based framework, which we term
Cluster-Bootstrap PLS (CLUB-PLS), that can work with large input dimensions in
both domains as well as with large sample sizes. One key factor of the
framework is to use cluster bootstrap to provide robust statistics for single
input features in both domains. We applied CLUB-PLS to investigating the
genetic basis of surface area and cortical thickness in a sample of 33,000
subjects from the UK Biobank. We found 107 genome-wide significant

sleep stages plays a fundamental role in diagnosing sleep disorders, monitoring
treatment effectiveness, and understanding the relationship between sleep
stages and various health conditions. A precise and efficient classification of
these stages can significantly enhance our understanding of sleep-related
phenomena and ultimately lead to improved health outcomes and disease
treatment.

Models others propose are often time-consuming and lack sufficient accuracy,
especially in stage N1. The main objective of this research is to present a
machine-learning model called "EEGMobile". This model utilizes pre-trained
models and learns from electroencephalogram (EEG) spectrograms of brain
signals. The model achieved an accuracy of 86.97% on a publicly available
dataset named "Sleep-EDF20", outperforming other models proposed by different
researchers. Moreover, it recorded an accuracy of 56.4% in stage N1, which is
better than other models. These findings demonstrate that this model has the
potential to achieve better results for the treatment of this disease.]]></summary>

global score functions. However, if local variables have direct and indirect
dependence simultaneously, the global optimization on score functions misses
edges between variables with indirect dependent relationship, of which scores
are smaller than those with direct dependent relationship. In this paper, we
present an identifiability condition based on a determined subset of parents to
identify the underlying DAG. By the identifiability condition, we develop a
two-phase algorithm namely optimal-tuning (OT) algorithm to locally amend the
global optimization. In the optimal phase, an optimization problem based on
first-order Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) gives an estimated
skeleton as the initial determined parents subset. In the tuning phase, the
skeleton is locally tuned by deletion, addition and DAG-formalization
strategies using the theoretically proved incremental properties of high-order
HSIC. Numerical experiments for different synthetic datasets and real-world
datasets show that the OT algorithm outperforms existing methods. Especially in
Sigmoid Mix model with the size of the graph being ${\rm\bf d=40}$, the
structure intervention distance (SID) of the OT algorithm is 329.7 smaller than
the one obtained by CAM, which indicates that the graph estimated by the OT
algorithm misses fewer edges compared with CAM.Source code of the OT algorithm

combines graph neural network as the encoder and reinforcement learning as the
decoder, named DREIM. Trough extensive training on small synthetic graphs,
DREIM outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods on very large synthetic

linear scalability with regard to the network size, which demonstrates its
superiority in solving this problem.]]></summary>

our lives. Accurate classification of sleep stages serves as a crucial tool for
evaluating sleep quality and identifying probable sleep disorders. This work
introduces a novel methodology that utilises a SE-Resnet-Bi-LSTM architecture
to classify sleep into five separate stages. The classification process is
based on the analysis of single-channel electroencephalograms (EEGs). The
framework that has been suggested consists of two fundamental elements: a
feature extractor that utilises SE-ResNet, and a temporal context encoder that
use stacks of Bi-LSTM units.The effectiveness of our approach is substantiated
by thorough assessments conducted on three different datasets, namely
SLeepEDF-20, SleepEDF-78, and SHHS. Significantly, our methodology attains
notable levels of accuracy, specifically 87.5\%, 83.9\%, and 87.8\%, along with
macro-F1 scores of 82.5, 78.9, and 81.9 for the corresponding datasets.
Notably, we introduce the utilization of 1D-GradCAM visualization to shed light
on the decision-making process of our model in the realm of sleep stage
classification. This visualization method not only provides valuable insights
into the model's classification rationale but also aligns its outcomes with the
annotations made by sleep experts. One notable feature of our research is the
integration of an expedited training approach, which effectively preserves the
model's resilience in terms of performance. The experimental evaluations
conducted provide a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of our
proposed model in comparison to existing approaches, highlighting its potential
for practical applications.]]></summary>

requires skilled content creators. There have been impressive improvements in
using machine learning to address different aspects of generating 3D content,
such as generating meshes, arranging geometry, synthesizing textures, etc. In
this paper we develop a model to generate Bidirectional Reflectance
Distribution Functions (BRDFs) from descriptive textual prompts. BRDFs are four
dimensional probability distributions that characterize the interaction of
light with surface materials. They are either represented parametrically, or by
tabulating the probability density associated with every pair of incident and
outgoing angles. The former lends itself to artistic editing while the latter
is used when measuring the appearance of real materials. Numerous works have
focused on hypothesizing BRDF models from images of materials. We learn a
mapping from textual descriptions of materials to parametric BRDFs. Our model
is first trained using a semi-supervised approach before being tuned via an
unsupervised scheme. Although our model is general, in this paper we
specifically generate parameters for MDL materials, conditioned on natural
language descriptions, within NVIDIA's Omniverse platform. This enables use
cases such as real-time text prompts to change materials of objects in 3D
environments such as "dull plastic" or "shiny iron". Since the output of our

prevails to deliver high-performance task-specific models and can even learn
general task-agnostic representations for efficient finetuning to downstream
tasks. However, deep learning in resource-limited domains still faces multiple
challenges including (i) limited data, (ii) constrained model development cost,

paper provides an overview of model reprogramming to bridge this gap. Model
reprogramming enables resource-efficient cross-domain machine learning by
repurposing and reusing a well-developed pre-trained model from a source domain
to solve tasks in a target domain without model finetuning, where the source
and target domains can be vastly different. In many applications, model
reprogramming outperforms transfer learning and training from scratch. This

research for decades. One widely used methodology for this purpose is sparse
regression for nonlinear dynamics, known as SINDy. Despite several attempts,
noisy and scarce data still pose a severe challenge to the success of the SINDy
approach. In this work, we discuss a robust method to discover nonlinear
governing equations from noisy and scarce data. To do this, we make use of
neural networks to learn an implicit representation based on measurement data
so that not only it produces the output in the vicinity of the measurements but
also the time-evolution of output can be described by a dynamical system.
Additionally, we learn such a dynamic system in the spirit of the SINDy
framework. Leveraging the implicit representation using neural networks, we
obtain the derivative information -- required for SINDy -- using an automatic
differentiation tool. To enhance the robustness of our methodology, we further
incorporate an integral condition on the output of the implicit networks.
Furthermore, we extend our methodology to handle data collected from multiple
initial conditions. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methodology
to discover governing equations under noisy and scarce data regimes by means of
several examples and compare its performance with existing methods.]]></summary>

event-driven neural dynamics whose energy consumption depends on the number of
spikes exchanged between neurons over the course of the input presentation. In
typical implementations of an SNN classifier, decisions are produced after the
entire input sequence has been processed, resulting in latency and energy
consumption levels that are fairly uniform across inputs. Recently introduced
delay-adaptive SNNs tailor the inference latency -- and, with it, the energy
consumption -- to the difficulty of each example, by producing an early
decision when the SNN model is sufficiently ``confident''. In this paper, we
start by observing that, as an SNN processes input samples, its classification
decisions tend to be first under-confident and then over-confident with respect
to the decision's ground-truth, unknown, test accuracy. This makes it difficult
to determine a stopping time that ensures a desired level of accuracy. To
address this problem, we introduce a novel delay-adaptive SNN-based inference
methodology that, wrapping around any pre-trained SNN classifier, provides
guaranteed reliability for the decisions produced at input-dependent stopping
times. The approach entails minimal added complexity as compared to the
underlying SNN, requiring only thresholding and counting operations at run

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While the recently introduced Tree of Thoughts (ToT) has heralded
advancements in allowing Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason through
foresight and backtracking for global decision-making, it has overlooked the
inherent local uncertainties in intermediate decision points or "thoughts".
These local uncertainties, intrinsic to LLMs given their potential for diverse
responses, remain a significant concern in the reasoning process. Addressing
this pivotal gap, we introduce the Tree of Uncertain Thoughts (TouT) - a
reasoning framework tailored for LLMs. Our TouT effectively leverages Monte
Carlo Dropout to quantify uncertainty scores associated with LLMs' diverse
local responses at these intermediate steps. By marrying this local uncertainty
quantification with global search algorithms, TouT enhances the model's
precision in response generation. We substantiate our approach with rigorous
experiments on two demanding planning tasks: Game of 24 and Mini Crosswords.
The empirical evidence underscores TouT's superiority over both ToT and
chain-of-thought prompting methods.]]></summary>

offline reinforcement learning (RL), where the agent learns from a fixed
dataset without any additional interaction with the environment. Specifically,
we aim to improve the agent's ability to generalize to out-of-distribution
goals. To achieve this, we propose to learn a dynamics model and check if it is
equivariant with respect to a fixed type of transformation, namely translations
in the state space. We then use an entropy regularizer to increase the
equivariant set and augment the dataset with the resulting transformed samples.
Finally, we learn a new policy offline based on the augmented dataset, with an
off-the-shelf offline RL algorithm. Our experimental results demonstrate that
our approach can greatly improve the test performance of the policy on the

attacks, but are often tailored to one type of model or attack. The lack of
information on unknown potential attacks makes detecting adversarial examples
challenging. Additionally, attackers do not need to follow the rules made by
the defender. To address this problem, we take inspiration from the concept of
Applicability Domain in cheminformatics. Cheminformatics models struggle to
make accurate predictions because only a limited number of compounds are known
and available for training. Applicability Domain defines a domain based on the
known compounds and rejects any unknown compound that falls outside the domain.
Similarly, adversarial examples start as harmless inputs, but can be
manipulated to evade reliable classification by moving outside the domain of
the classifier. We are the first to identify the similarity between
Applicability Domain and adversarial detection. Instead of focusing on unknown
attacks, we focus on what is known, the training data. We propose a simple yet
robust triple-stage data-driven framework that checks the input globally and
locally, and confirms that they are coherent with the model's output. This
framework can be applied to any classification model and is not limited to
specific attacks. We demonstrate these three stages work as one unit,
effectively detecting various attacks, even for a white-box scenario.]]></summary>

optimization tasks involving unknown high-dimensional (black-box) functions
that map a set of controllable variables to the outcomes of an expensive

tackling global optimization problems using a relatively small number objective
function evaluations, but their performance suffers when dealing with
high-dimensional outputs. To overcome the major challenge of dimensionality,
here we propose a deep learning framework for BO and sequential decision making

Using appropriate architecture choices, we show that the proposed framework can
approximate functional relationships between design variables and quantities of
interest, even in cases where the latter take values in high-dimensional vector
spaces or even infinite-dimensional function spaces. In the context of BO, we
augmented the proposed probabilistic surrogates with re-parameterized Monte
Carlo approximations of multiple-point (parallel) acquisition functions, as
well as methodological extensions for accommodating black-box constraints and
multi-fidelity information sources. We test the proposed framework against
state-of-the-art methods for BO and demonstrate superior performance across
several challenging tasks with high-dimensional outputs, including a

remains a significant challenge, especially when encountering noisy
observations and no prior knowledge available. This study proposes R-DISCOVER,
a framework designed to robustly uncover open-form partial differential
equations (PDEs) from limited and noisy data. The framework operates through
two alternating update processes: discovering and embedding. The discovering
phase employs symbolic representation and a reinforcement learning (RL)-guided
hybrid PDE generator to efficiently produce diverse open-form PDEs with tree
structures. A neural network-based predictive model fits the system response
and serves as the reward evaluator for the generated PDEs. PDEs with superior
fits are utilized to iteratively optimize the generator via the RL method and
the best-performing PDE is selected by a parameter-free stability metric. The
embedding phase integrates the initially identified PDE from the discovering
process as a physical constraint into the predictive model for robust training.
The traversal of PDE trees automates the construction of the computational
graph and the embedding process without human intervention. Numerical
experiments demonstrate our framework's capability to uncover governing
equations from nonlinear dynamic systems with limited and highly noisy data and
outperform other physics-informed neural network-based discovery methods. This

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance
in various vision-related tasks. The success of ViTs motivates adversaries to
perform backdoor attacks on ViTs. Although the vulnerability of traditional
CNNs to backdoor attacks is well-known, backdoor attacks on ViTs are
seldom-studied. Compared to CNNs capturing pixel-wise local features by
convolutions, ViTs extract global context information through patches and
attentions. Na\"ively transplanting CNN-specific backdoor attacks to ViTs
yields only a low clean data accuracy and a low attack success rate. In this
paper, we propose a stealth and practical ViT-specific backdoor attack
$TrojViT$. Rather than an area-wise trigger used by CNN-specific backdoor
attacks, TrojViT generates a patch-wise trigger designed to build a Trojan
composed of some vulnerable bits on the parameters of a ViT stored in DRAM
memory through patch salience ranking and attention-target loss. TrojViT
further uses minimum-tuned parameter update to reduce the bit number of the
Trojan. Once the attacker inserts the Trojan into the ViT model by flipping the
vulnerable bits, the ViT model still produces normal inference accuracy with
benign inputs. But when the attacker embeds a trigger into an input, the ViT
model is forced to classify the input to a predefined target class. We show
that flipping only few vulnerable bits identified by TrojViT on a ViT model
using the well-known RowHammer can transform the model into a backdoored one.
We perform extensive experiments of multiple datasets on various ViT models.
TrojViT can classify $99.64\%$ of test images to a target class by flipping
$345$ bits on a ViT for ImageNet.Our codes are available at

network control algorithms as one of its core capabilities. Data-driven
applications incorporate such algorithms to optimize radio access network (RAN)
functions via RAN intelligent controllers (RICs). Deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) algorithms are among the main approaches adopted in the O-RAN literature
to solve dynamic radio resource management problems. However, despite the
benefits introduced by the O-RAN RICs, the practical adoption of DRL algorithms
in real network deployments falls behind. This is primarily due to the slow
convergence and unstable performance exhibited by DRL agents upon deployment
and when facing previously unseen network conditions. In this paper, we address
these challenges by proposing transfer learning (TL) as a core component of the
training and deployment workflows for the DRL-based closed-loop control of
O-RAN functionalities. To this end, we propose and design a hybrid TL-aided
approach that leverages the advantages of both policy reuse and distillation TL
methods to provide safe and accelerated convergence in DRL-based O-RAN slicing.
We conduct a thorough experiment that accommodates multiple services, including
real VR gaming traffic to reflect practical scenarios of O-RAN slicing. We also
propose and implement policy reuse and distillation-aided DRL and non-TL-aided
DRL as three separate baselines. The proposed hybrid approach shows at least:
7.7% and 20.7% improvements in the average initial reward value and the
percentage of converged scenarios, and a 64.6% decrease in reward variance

systems makes it hard to decide what architecture and algorithm to use for a
given problem. In science and engineering, modeling is a methodology used to
understand complex systems whose internal processes are opaque. Modeling
replaces a complex system with a simpler, more interpretable surrogate. Drawing
inspiration from this, we construct a class of surrogate models for neural
networks using Gaussian processes. Rather than deriving kernels for infinite
neural networks, we learn kernels empirically from the naturalistic behavior of
finite neural networks. We demonstrate our approach captures existing phenomena
related to the spectral bias of neural networks, and then show that our
surrogate models can be used to solve practical problems such as identifying
which points most influence the behavior of specific neural networks and
predicting which architectures and algorithms will generalize well for specific
datasets.]]></summary>

mixture without prior knowledge of the sources or the mixing system. This is a
challenging problem that often requires making restrictive assumptions about
both the mixing system and the sources. In this paper, we propose a novel
method for addressing BSS of non-linear mixtures by leveraging the natural
feature subspace specialization ability of multi-encoder autoencoders with
fully self-supervised learning without strong priors. During the training
phase, our method unmixes the input into the separate encoding spaces of the
multi-encoder network and then remixes these representations within the decoder
for a reconstruction of the input. Then to perform source inference, we
introduce a novel encoding masking technique whereby masking out all but one of
the encodings enables the decoder to estimate a source signal. To this end, we
also introduce a so-called pathway separation loss that encourages sparsity
between the unmixed encoding spaces throughout the decoder's layers and a
so-called zero reconstruction loss on the decoder for coherent source
estimations. In order to carefully evaluate our method, we conduct experiments
on a toy dataset and with real-world biosignal recordings from a
polysomnography sleep study for extracting respiration.]]></summary>

The model is trained using the asynchronous advantage actor-aritic (A3C)

randomized algorithms exploit sparsity in PDE updates for acceleration. However
such methods are applicable to a limited class of decomposable PDEs, which have
sparse features in the value domain. We propose Reel, which accelerates the
learning of PDEs via random projection and has much broader applicability. Reel
exploits the sparsity by decomposing dense updates into sparse ones in both the
value and frequency domains. This decomposition enables efficient learning when
the source of the updates consists of gradually changing terms across large
areas (sparse in the frequency domain) in addition to a few rapid updates
concentrated in a small set of "interfacial" regions (sparse in the value
domain). Random projection is then applied to compress the sparse signals for
learning. To expand the model applicability, Taylor series expansion is used in
Reel to approximate the nonlinear PDE updates with polynomials in the
decomposable form. Theoretically, we derive a constant factor approximation
between the projected loss function and the original one with poly-logarithmic
number of projected dimensions. Experimentally, we provide empirical evidence
that our proposed Reel can lead to faster learning of PDE models (70-98%

genomic studies to identify differentially expressed genes. However, due to
unmeasured confounders, many standard statistical approaches may be
substantially biased. This paper investigates the large-scale hypothesis
testing problem for multivariate generalized linear models in the presence of
confounding effects. Under arbitrary confounding mechanisms, we propose a
unified statistical estimation and inference framework that harnesses
orthogonal structures and integrates linear projections into three key stages.
It first leverages multivariate responses to separate marginal and uncorrelated
confounding effects, recovering the confounding coefficients' column space.
Subsequently, latent factors and primary effects are jointly estimated,
utilizing $\ell_1$-regularization for sparsity while imposing orthogonality
onto confounding coefficients. Finally, we incorporate projected and weighted
bias-correction steps for hypothesis testing. Theoretically, we establish
various effects' identification conditions and non-asymptotic error bounds. We
show effective Type-I error control of asymptotic $z$-tests as sample and
response sizes approach infinity. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method controls the false discovery rate by the Benjamini-Hochberg
procedure and is more powerful than alternative methods. By comparing
single-cell RNA-seq counts from two groups of samples, we demonstrate the
suitability of adjusting confounding effects when significant covariates are
absent from the model.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper investigates a challenging problem of zero-shot learning in the
multi-label scenario (MLZSL), wherein, the model is trained to recognize
multiple unseen classes within a sample (e.g., an image) based on seen classes
and auxiliary knowledge, e.g., semantic information. Existing methods usually
resort to analyzing the relationship of various seen classes residing in a
sample from the dimension of spatial or semantic characteristics, and transfer
the learned model to unseen ones. But they ignore the effective integration of
local and global features. That is, in the process of inferring unseen classes,
global features represent the principal direction of the image in the feature
space, while local features should maintain uniqueness within a certain range.
This integrated neglect will make the model lose its grasp of the main
components of the image. Relying only on the local existence of seen classes
during the inference stage introduces unavoidable bias. In this paper, we
propose a novel and effective group bi-enhancement framework for MLZSL, dubbed
GBE-MLZSL, to fully make use of such properties and enable a more accurate and
robust visual-semantic projection. Specifically, we split the feature maps into
several feature groups, of which each feature group can be trained
independently with the Local Information Distinguishing Module (LID) to ensure
uniqueness. Meanwhile, a Global Enhancement Module (GEM) is designed to
preserve the principal direction. Besides, a static graph structure is designed
to construct the correlation of local features. Experiments on large-scale
MLZSL benchmark datasets NUS-WIDE and Open-Images-v4 demonstrate that the
proposed GBE-MLZSL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods with large
margins.]]></summary>

learning, these techniques often require annotated samples and struggle with

introduce ECG-Text Pre-training (ETP), an innovative framework designed to
learn cross-modal representations that link ECG signals with textual reports.
For the first time, this framework leverages the zero-shot classification task
in the ECG domain. ETP employs an ECG encoder along with a pre-trained language
model to align ECG signals with their corresponding textual reports. The
proposed framework excels in both linear evaluation and zero-shot
classification tasks, as demonstrated on the PTB-XL and CPSC2018 datasets,

physical environments. In this work, we introduce EmbodiedGPT, an end-to-end
multi-modal foundation model for embodied AI, empowering embodied agents with
multi-modal understanding and execution capabilities. To achieve this, we have
made the following efforts: (i) We craft a large-scale embodied planning
dataset, termed EgoCOT. The dataset consists of carefully selected videos from
the Ego4D dataset, along with corresponding high-quality language instructions.
Specifically, we generate a sequence of sub-goals with the "Chain of Thoughts"
mode for effective embodied planning. (ii) We introduce an efficient training
approach to EmbodiedGPT for high-quality plan generation, by adapting a 7B
large language model (LLM) to the EgoCOT dataset via prefix tuning. (iii) We
introduce a paradigm for extracting task-related features from LLM-generated
planning queries to form a closed loop between high-level planning and
low-level control. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of EmbodiedGPT
on embodied tasks, including embodied planning, embodied control, visual
captioning, and visual question answering. Notably, EmbodiedGPT significantly
enhances the success rate of the embodied control task by extracting more

individuals globally, and continuous monitoring coupled with automated seizure
detection appears as a necessity for effective patient treatment. To enable
long-term care in daily-life conditions, comfortable and smart wearable devices
with long battery life are required, which in turn set the demand for
resource-constrained and energy-efficient computing solutions. In this context,
the development of machine learning algorithms for seizure detection faces the
challenge of heavily imbalanced datasets. This paper introduces EpiDeNet, a new
lightweight seizure detection network, and Sensitivity-Specificity Weighted
Cross-Entropy (SSWCE), a new loss function that incorporates sensitivity and
specificity, to address the challenge of heavily unbalanced datasets. The
proposed EpiDeNet-SSWCE approach demonstrates the successful detection of
91.16% and 92.00% seizure events on two different datasets (CHB-MIT and
PEDESITE, respectively), with only four EEG channels. A three-window majority
voting-based smoothing scheme combined with the SSWCE loss achieves 3x
reduction of false positives to 1.18 FP/h. EpiDeNet is well suited for
implementation on low-power embedded platforms, and we evaluate its performance
on two ARM Cortex-based platforms (M4F/M7) and two parallel ultra-low power
(PULP) systems (GAP8, GAP9). The most efficient implementation (GAP9) achieves
an energy efficiency of 40 GMAC/s/W, with an energy consumption per inference
of only 0.051 mJ at high performance (726.46 MMAC/s), outperforming the best
ARM Cortex-based solutions by approximately 160x in energy efficiency. The

performance on heavily imbalanced datasets, while being suited for
implementation on energy-constrained platforms.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In many randomized experiments, the treatment effect of the long-term metric
(i.e. the primary outcome of interest) is often difficult or infeasible to
measure. Such long-term metrics are often slow to react to changes and
sufficiently noisy they are challenging to faithfully estimate in short-horizon
experiments. A common alternative is to measure several short-term proxy
metrics in the hope they closely track the long-term metric -- so they can be
used to effectively guide decision-making in the near-term. We introduce a new
statistical framework to both define and construct an optimal proxy metric for
use in a homogeneous population of randomized experiments. Our procedure first
reduces the construction of an optimal proxy metric in a given experiment to a
portfolio optimization problem which depends on the true latent treatment
effects and noise level of experiment under consideration. We then denoise the
observed treatment effects of the long-term metric and a set of proxies in a
historical corpus of randomized experiments to extract estimates of the latent
treatment effects for use in the optimization problem. One key insight derived
from our approach is that the optimal proxy metric for a given experiment is
not apriori fixed; rather it should depend on the sample size (or effective
noise level) of the randomized experiment for which it is deployed. To
instantiate and evaluate our framework, we employ our methodology in a large
corpus of randomized experiments from an industrial recommendation system and

convolution has been applied in a wide range of fields such as traffic flow
prediction. However, current popular works of graph convolution cannot
guarantee spatio-temporal consistency in a long period. The ignorance of
correlational dynamics, convolutional locality and temporal comprehensiveness
would limit predictive accuracy. In this paper, a novel Attention-based Dynamic
Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (ADGCRNN) is proposed to improve
traffic flow prediction in highway transportation. Three temporal resolutions
of data sequence are effectively integrated by self-attention to extract
characteristics; multi-dynamic graphs and their weights are dynamically created
to compliantly combine the varying characteristics; a dedicated gated kernel
emphasizing highly relative nodes is introduced on these complete graphs to
reduce overfitting for graph convolution operations. Experiments on two public
datasets show our work better than state-of-the-art baselines, and case studies
of a real Web system prove practical benefit in highway transportation.]]></summary>

extracting surface electromyographic (sEMG) activity from eight electrodes in a

calibration, participants were presented with one of three types of feedback
during a human-learning stage: veridical feedback, in which predicted

alteration, modified feedback, in which we applied a hidden augmentation of
error to these probabilities, and no feedback. User performance was then
evaluated in a series of minigames, in which subjects were required to use
eight gestures to manipulate their game avatar to complete a task. Experimental
results indicated that, relative to baseline, the modified feedback condition

take treatment, so that optimal policy rules are merely suggestions in the
presence of human non-adherence to treatment recommendations. In these same
domains, there may be heterogeneity both in who responds in taking-up
treatment, and heterogeneity in treatment efficacy. While optimal treatment
rules can maximize causal outcomes across the population, access parity
constraints or other fairness considerations can be relevant in the case of
encouragement. For example, in social services, a persistent puzzle is the gap
in take-up of beneficial services among those who may benefit from them the
most. When in addition the decision-maker has distributional preferences over
both access and average outcomes, the optimal decision rule changes. We study
causal identification, statistical variance-reduced estimation, and robust
estimation of optimal treatment rules, including under potential violations of
positivity. We consider fairness constraints such as demographic parity in
treatment take-up, and other constraints, via constrained optimization. Our
framework can be extended to handle algorithmic recommendations under an
often-reasonable covariate-conditional exclusion restriction, using our
robustness checks for lack of positivity in the recommendation. We develop a
two-stage algorithm for solving over parametrized policy classes under general
constraints to obtain variance-sensitive regret bounds. We illustrate the
methods in two case studies based on data from randomized encouragement to
enroll in insurance and from pretrial supervised release with electronic

approach is a challenging problem for many data-driven applications. Existing
state-of-the-art methods for unsupervised clustering use different similarity
and distance functions but focus on either spatial or temporal features of the
data. Concentrating on joint deep representation learning of spatial and
temporal features, we propose Deep Spatiotemporal Clustering (DSC), a novel
algorithm for the temporal clustering of high-dimensional spatiotemporal data
using an unsupervised deep learning method. Inspired by the U-net architecture,
DSC utilizes an autoencoder integrating CNN-RNN layers to learn latent
representations of the spatiotemporal data. DSC also includes a unique layer
for cluster assignment on latent representations that uses the Student's
t-distribution. By optimizing the clustering loss and data reconstruction loss
simultaneously, the algorithm gradually improves clustering assignments and the
nonlinear mapping between low-dimensional latent feature space and
high-dimensional original data space. A multivariate spatiotemporal climate
dataset is used to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method. Our extensive
experiments show our approach outperforms both conventional and deep
learning-based unsupervised clustering algorithms. Additionally, we compared
the proposed model with its various variants (CNN encoder, CNN autoencoder,
CNN-RNN encoder, CNN-RNN autoencoder, etc.) to get insight into using both the
CNN and RNN layers in the autoencoder, and our proposed technique outperforms
these variants in terms of clustering results.]]></summary>

process by sequence models. This problem results in insufficient precision of
the prediction. Therefore, a short-term load forecasting method based on
convolutional neural network (CNN), self-attention encoder-decoder network
(SAEDN) and residual-refinement (Res) is proposed. In this method, feature
extraction module is composed of a two-dimensional convolutional neural
network, which is used to mine the local correlation between data and obtain
high-dimensional data features. The initial load fore-casting module consists
of a self-attention encoder-decoder network and a feedforward neural network
(FFN). The module utilizes self-attention mechanisms to encode high-dimensional
features. This operation can obtain the global correlation between data.
Therefore, the model is able to retain important information based on the
coupling relationship between the data in data mixed with non-time series
factors. Then, self-attention decoding is per-formed and the feedforward neural
network is used to regression initial load. This paper introduces the residual
mechanism to build the load optimization module. The module generates residual
load values to optimize the initial load. The simulation results show that the
proposed load forecasting method has advantages in terms of prediction accuracy

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basecalling is an essential step in nanopore sequencing analysis where the
raw signals of nanopore sequencers are converted into nucleotide sequences,
i.e., reads. State-of-the-art basecallers employ complex deep learning models
to achieve high basecalling accuracy. This makes basecalling
computationally-inefficient and memory-hungry; bottlenecking the entire genome
analysis pipeline. However, for many applications, the majority of reads do no
match the reference genome of interest (i.e., target reference) and thus are
discarded in later steps in the genomics pipeline, wasting the basecalling
computation. To overcome this issue, we propose TargetCall, the first
pre-basecalling filter to eliminate the wasted computation in basecalling.
TargetCall's key idea is to discard reads that will not match the target
reference (i.e., off-target reads) prior to basecalling. TargetCall consists of
two main components: (1) LightCall, a lightweight neural network basecaller
that produces noisy reads; and (2) Similarity Check, which labels each of these
noisy reads as on-target or off-target by matching them to the target
reference. TargetCall aims to filter out all off-target reads before
basecalling. The highly-accurate but slow basecalling is performed only on the
raw signals whose noisy reads are labeled as on-target. Our thorough
experimental evaluations using both real and simulated data show that
TargetCall 1) improves the end-to-end basecalling performance while maintaining
high sensitivity in keeping on-target reads, 2) maintains high accuracy in
downstream analysis, 3) precisely filters out up to 94.71% of off-target reads,
and 4) achieves better performance, throughput, sensitivity, precision, and
generality compared to prior works. We open-source TargetCall at

efficiently learn a rich representation of the input. However, for adapting to
downstream tasks, they require a sufficient amount of labeled data since their
rich features code not only objects but also less relevant image background. In
contrast, Instance Discrimination (ID) methods focus on objects. In this work,
we study how to combine the efficiency and scalability of MIM with the ability
of ID to perform downstream classification in the absence of large amounts of
labeled data. To this end, we introduce Masked Autoencoder Contrastive Tuning
(MAE-CT), a sequential approach that utilizes the implicit clustering of the
Nearest Neighbor Contrastive Learning (NNCLR) objective to induce abstraction
in the topmost layers of a pre-trained MAE. MAE-CT tunes the rich features such
that they form semantic clusters of objects without using any labels. Notably,
MAE-CT does not rely on hand-crafted augmentations and frequently achieves its
best performances while using only minimal augmentations (crop & flip).
Further, MAE-CT is compute efficient as it requires at most 10% overhead
compared to MAE re-training. Applied to large and huge Vision Transformer (ViT)
models, MAE-CT excels over previous self-supervised methods trained on ImageNet
in linear probing, k-NN and low-shot classification accuracy as well as in
unsupervised clustering accuracy. With ViT-H/16 MAE-CT achieves a new

optimisation space to run efficiently. In geometric quantum machine learning,
one achieves this by encoding group structure into parameterised quantum
circuits to include the symmetries of a problem as an inductive bias. However,
constructing such circuits is challenging as a concrete guiding principle has
yet to emerge. In this paper, we propose the use of spin networks, a form of

symmetry. By changing to the basis that block diagonalises SU(2) group action,
these networks provide a natural building block for constructing parameterised
equivariant quantum circuits. We prove that our construction is mathematically
equivalent to other known constructions, such as those based on twirling and
generalised permutations, but more direct to implement on quantum hardware. The
efficacy of our constructed circuits is tested by solving the ground state
problem of SU(2) symmetric Heisenberg models on the one-dimensional triangular

influences precipitation prediction. It can facilitate accurate and expeditious
forecasting of short-term heavy rainfall bypassing the need for complex
Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models. In comparison to conventional
models, Deep Learning (DL)-based radar echo extrapolation algorithms exhibit
higher effectiveness and efficiency. Nevertheless, the development of reliable
and generalized echo extrapolation algorithm is impeded by three primary
challenges: cumulative error spreading, imprecise representation of sparsely
distributed echoes, and inaccurate description of non-stationary motion
processes. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel radar echo
extrapolation algorithm called Temporal-Spatial Parallel Transformer, referred
to as TempEE. TempEE avoids using auto-regression and instead employs a
one-step forward strategy to prevent cumulative error spreading during the
extrapolation process. Additionally, we propose the incorporation of a
Multi-level Temporal-Spatial Attention mechanism to improve the algorithm's
capability of capturing both global and local information while emphasizing
task-related regions, including sparse echo representations, in an efficient
manner. Furthermore, the algorithm extracts spatio-temporal representations
from continuous echo images using a parallel encoder to model the
non-stationary motion process for echo extrapolation. The superiority of our
TempEE has been demonstrated in the context of the classic radar echo
extrapolation task, utilizing a real-world dataset. Extensive experiments have
further validated the efficacy and indispensability of various components
within TempEE.]]></summary>

increasingly popular in the field of recommender systems. Currently, two
state-of-the-art baselines are Transformer-based models SASRec and BERT4Rec.
Over the past few years, there have been quite a few publications comparing
these two algorithms and proposing new state-of-the-art models. In most of the
publications, BERT4Rec achieves better performance than SASRec. But BERT4Rec
uses cross-entropy over softmax for all items, while SASRec uses negative
sampling and calculates binary cross-entropy loss for one positive and one
negative item. In our work, we show that if both models are trained with the
same loss, which is used by BERT4Rec, then SASRec will significantly outperform
BERT4Rec both in terms of quality and training speed. In addition, we show that
SASRec could be effectively trained with negative sampling and still outperform
BERT4Rec, but the number of negative examples should be much larger than one.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Automatic static cost analysis infers information about the resources used by
programs without actually running them with concrete data, and presents such
information as functions of input data sizes. Most of the analysis tools for
logic programs (and other languages) are based on setting up recurrence
relations representing (bounds on) the computational cost of predicates, and
solving them to find closed-form functions that are equivalent to (or a bound
on) them. Such recurrence solving is a bottleneck in current tools: many of the
recurrences that arise during the analysis cannot be solved with current
solvers, such as Computer Algebra Systems (CASs), so that specific methods for
different classes of recurrences need to be developed. We address such a
challenge by developing a novel, general approach for solving arbitrary,
constrained recurrence relations, that uses machine-learning sparse regression
techniques to guess a candidate closed-form function, and a combination of an
SMT-solver and a CAS to check whether such function is actually a solution of
the recurrence. We have implemented a prototype and evaluated it with
recurrences generated by a cost analysis system (the one in CiaoPP). The
experimental results are quite promising, showing that our approach can find
closed-form solutions, in a reasonable time, for classes of recurrences that
cannot be solved by such a system, nor by current CASs.]]></summary>

However, current methods are strongly limited in terms of scalability on Noisy
Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we propose a novel
approach called the Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS) enhanced QSVM.
This is built upon our idea of utilizing the variational quantum linear solver
to solve system of linear equations of a least squares-SVM on a NISQ device.
The implementation of our approach is evaluated by an extensive series of
numerical experiments with the Iris dataset, which consists of three distinct
iris plant species. Based on this, we explore the practicality and
effectiveness of our algorithm by constructing a classifier capable of
classification in a feature space ranging from one to seven dimensions.
Furthermore, by strategically exploiting both classical and quantum computing
for various subroutines of our algorithm, we effectively mitigate practical
challenges associated with the implementation. These include significant
improvement in the trainability of the variational ansatz and notable
reductions in run-time for cost calculations. Based on the numerical
experiments, our approach exhibits the capability of identifying a separating
hyperplane in an 8-dimensional feature space. Moreover, it consistently
demonstrated strong performance across various instances with the same dataset.]]></summary>

performance of the algorithm alone, but recently more attention has been
focused on optimizing joint human-algorithm performance. Here, we analyze a
specific type of human-algorithm collaboration where the algorithm has access
to a set of $n$ items, and presents a subset of size $k$ to the human, who
selects a final item from among those $k$. This scenario could model content
recommendation, route planning, or any type of labeling task. Because both the
human and algorithm have imperfect, noisy information about the true ordering
of items, the key question is: which value of $k$ maximizes the probability
that the best item will be ultimately selected? For $k=1$, performance is
optimized by the algorithm acting alone, and for $k=n$ it is optimized by the
human acting alone. Surprisingly, we show that for multiple of noise models, it
is optimal to set $k \in [2, n-1]$ - that is, there are strict benefits to
collaborating, even when the human and algorithm have equal accuracy
separately. We demonstrate this theoretically for the Mallows model and
experimentally for the Random Utilities models of noisy permutations. However,
we show this pattern is reversed when the human is anchored on the algorithm's
presented ordering - the joint system always has strictly worse performance. We
extend these results to the case where the human and algorithm differ in their
accuracy levels, showing that there always exist regimes where a more accurate
agent would strictly benefit from collaborating with a less accurate one, but
these regimes are asymmetric between the human and the algorithm's accuracy.]]></summary>

domains, and methods based on machine learning have been widely adopted in the
field to monitor wear and spot defects before they lead to failures. Few
studies, however, have addressed the problem of censored data, in which failure
is not observed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to predict the time
to failure in ball bearings using survival analysis. First, we analyze bearing
data in the frequency domain and annotate when a bearing fails by comparing the
Kullback-Leibler divergence and the standard deviation between its break-in
frequency bins and its break-out frequency bins. Second, we train several
survival models to estimate the time to failure based on the annotated data and
covariates extracted from the time domain, such as skewness, kurtosis and
entropy. The models give a probabilistic prediction of risk over time and allow
us to compare the survival function between groups of bearings. We demonstrate
our approach on the XJTU and PRONOSTIA datasets. On XJTU, the best result is a
0.70 concordance-index and 0.21 integrated Brier score. On PRONOSTIA, the best
is a 0.76 concordance-index and 0.19 integrated Brier score. Our work motivates
further work on incorporating censored data in models for predictive
maintenance.]]></summary>

that approximates gradient descent dynamics. To our knowledge, the PF is the
only continuous flow that captures the divergent and oscillatory behaviors of
gradient descent, including escaping local minima and saddle points. Through
its dependence on the eigendecomposition of the Hessian the PF sheds light on

both body and hand movements in a decoupled setting. The generic skill priors
learn to decode a latent skill embedding into the motion of the underlying

pretrained latent spaces, guided by task objectives of grasping and 3D target
trajectory following. It is trained using a novel reward function that combines
an adversarial style term with a task reward, encouraging natural motions while
fulfilling the task incentives. Our method successfully accomplishes the

also in biology and agriculture, where we could speak about the detection of

warning systems. This is also connected with the introduction of the easily
accessible hardware and development kits such as Arduino, or RaspberryPi
family. In this paper, we survey 50 existing papers focusing on the methods of
automated beehive monitoring methods using the computer vision techniques,
particularly on the pollen and Varroa mite detection together with the bee
traffic monitoring. Such systems could also be used for the monitoring of the
honeybee colonies and for the inspection of their health state, which could
identify potentially dangerous states before the situation is critical, or to
better plan periodic bee colony inspections and therefore save significant
costs. Later, we also include analysis of the research trends in this
application field and we outline the possible direction of the new
explorations. Our paper is aimed also at veterinary and apidology professionals
and experts, who might not be familiar with machine learning to introduce them
to its possibilities, therefore each family of applications is opened by a

unobserved confounders. Sensitivity analysis methods are commonly used to
estimate the policy value under the worst-case confounding over a given
uncertainty set. However, existing work often resorts to some coarse relaxation
of the uncertainty set for the sake of tractability, leading to overly
conservative estimation of the policy value. In this paper, we propose a
general estimator that provides a sharp lower bound of the policy value. It can
be shown that our estimator contains the recently proposed sharp estimator by
Dorn and Guo (2022) as a special case, and our method enables a novel extension
of the classical marginal sensitivity model using f-divergence. To construct
our estimator, we leverage the kernel method to obtain a tractable
approximation to the conditional moment constraints, which traditional
non-sharp estimators failed to take into account. In the theoretical analysis,
we provide a condition for the choice of the kernel which guarantees no
specification error that biases the lower bound estimation. Furthermore, we
provide consistency guarantees of policy evaluation and learning. In the
experiments with synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.]]></summary>

embeddings learnt by EarthPT hold semantically meaningful information and could
be exploited for downstream tasks such as highly granular, dynamic land use
classification. Excitingly, we note that the abundance of EO data provides us
with -- in theory -- quadrillions of training tokens. Therefore, if we assume

the security and robustness of RL systems are worthy of more attention and
exploration. In particular, recent works have revealed that, in a multi-agent
RL environment, backdoor trigger actions can be injected into a victim agent
(a.k.a. Trojan agent), which can result in a catastrophic failure as soon as it
sees the backdoor trigger action. To ensure the security of RL agents against
malicious backdoors, in this work, we propose the problem of Backdoor Detection
in a multi-agent competitive reinforcement learning system, with the objective
of detecting Trojan agents as well as the corresponding potential trigger
actions, and further trying to mitigate their Trojan behavior. In order to
solve this problem, we propose PolicyCleanse that is based on the property that
the activated Trojan agents accumulated rewards degrade noticeably after
several timesteps. Along with PolicyCleanse, we also design a machine
unlearning-based approach that can effectively mitigate the detected backdoor.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods can accurately
detect Trojan agents, and outperform existing backdoor mitigation baseline
approaches by at least 3% in winning rate across various types of agents and

identically distributed (IID) data. They, on the other hand, suffer greatly
from heterogeneous environments, i.e., Non-IID data. Despite the fact that many
research projects have been done to address this issue, recent findings
indicate that they are still sub-optimal when compared to training on IID data.
In this work, we carefully analyze the existing methods in heterogeneous
environments. Interestingly, we find that regularizing the classifier's outputs
is quite effective in preventing performance degradation on Non-IID data.
Motivated by this, we propose Learning from Drift (LfD), a novel method for
effectively training the model in heterogeneous settings. Our scheme
encapsulates two key components: drift estimation and drift regularization.
Specifically, LfD first estimates how different the local model is from the
global model (i.e., drift). The local model is then regularized such that it
does not fall in the direction of the estimated drift. In the experiment, we
evaluate each method through the lens of the five aspects of federated
learning, i.e., Generalization, Heterogeneity, Scalability, Forgetting, and
Efficiency. Comprehensive evaluation results clearly support the superiority of
LfD in federated learning with Non-IID data.]]></summary>

Wearable device-based prediction models allow for continuous health monitoring

we first derived novel wearable-based features related to circadian rhythms,
ambient light exposure, physical activity levels, sleep, and signal processing.
Then, we quantified the ability of wearable-based machine-learning models to
predict poor cognition based on outcomes from the Digit Symbol Substitution

Word-Learning subtest (CERAD-WL), and the Animal Fluency Test (AFT). We found
that the wearable-based models had significantly higher AUCs when predicting
all three cognitive outcomes compared to benchmark models containing age, sex,
education, marital status, household income, diabetic status, depression
symptoms, and functional independence scores. In addition to uncovering
previously unidentified wearable-based features that are predictive of poor
cognition such as the standard deviation of the midpoints of each persons most

proof-of-concept that wearable-based machine learning models can be used to

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A growing body of research has focused on the Reinforcement Learning (RL)
methods which allow the agent to learn from trial-and-error experiences
gathered during the interaction with the environment. Recently, offline RL
becomes a popular RL paradigm because it saves the interactions with
environments. In offline RL, data providers share large pre-collected datasets,
and others can train high-quality agents without interacting with the
environments. This paradigm has demonstrated effectiveness in critical tasks
like robot control, autonomous driving, etc. However, less attention is paid to
investigating the security threats to the offline RL system. This paper focuses
on backdoor attacks, where some perturbations are added to the data
(observations) such that given normal observations, the agent takes
high-rewards actions, and low-reward actions on observations injected with
triggers. In this paper, we propose Baffle (Backdoor Attack for Offline
Reinforcement Learning), an approach that automatically implants backdoors to
RL agents by poisoning the offline RL dataset, and evaluate how different
offline RL algorithms react to this attack. Our experiments conducted on four
tasks and four offline RL algorithms expose a disquieting fact: none of the
existing offline RL algorithms is immune to such a backdoor attack. Baffle
modifies $10\%$ of the datasets for four tasks. Agents trained on the poisoned
datasets perform well in normal settings. However, when triggers are presented,
the agents' performance decreases drastically by $63.2\%$, $53.9\%$, $64.7\%$,
and $47.4\%$ in the four tasks on average. The backdoor still persists after
fine-tuning poisoned agents on clean datasets. We further show that the
inserted backdoor is also hard to be detected by a popular defensive method.
This paper calls attention to developing more effective protection for the
open-source offline RL dataset.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent years, precision agriculture has gradually oriented farming closer
to automation processes to support all the activities related to field
management. Service robotics plays a predominant role in this evolution by
deploying autonomous agents that can navigate fields while performing tasks
without human intervention, such as monitoring, spraying, and harvesting. To
execute these precise actions, mobile robots need a real-time perception system
that understands their surroundings and identifies their targets in the wild.
Generalizing to new crops and environmental conditions is critical for
practical applications, as labeled samples are rarely available. In this paper,
we investigate the problem of crop segmentation and propose a novel approach to
enhance domain generalization using knowledge distillation. In the proposed
framework, we transfer knowledge from an ensemble of models individually
trained on source domains to a student model that can adapt to unseen target
domains. To evaluate the proposed method, we present a synthetic multi-domain
dataset for crop segmentation containing plants of variegate shapes and
covering different terrain styles, weather conditions, and light scenarios for
more than 50,000 samples. We demonstrate significant improvements in
performance over state-of-the-art methods and superior sim-to-real
generalization. Our approach provides a promising solution for domain
generalization in crop segmentation and has the potential to enhance a wide
variety of precision agriculture applications.]]></summary>

\mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$ in $L^p(\mu)$ norm by sequentially querying its
values, for known compact real intervals $\mathcal{X}$, $\mathcal{Y}$ and a
known probability measure $\mu$ on $\cX$. For any function~$f$ we characterize
the minimum number of evaluations of $f$ that algorithms need to guarantee an
approximation $\hat{f}$ with an $L^p(\mu)$ error below $\epsilon$ after
stopping. Unlike worst-case results that hold uniformly over all $f$, our
complexity measure is dependent on each specific function $f$. To address this
problem, we introduce GreedyBox, a generalization of an algorithm originally
proposed by Novak (1992) for numerical integration. We prove that GreedyBox
achieves an optimal sample complexity for any function $f$, up to logarithmic
factors. Additionally, we uncover results regarding piecewise-smooth functions.
Perhaps as expected, the $L^p(\mu)$ error of GreedyBox decreases much faster
for piecewise-$C^2$ functions than predicted by the algorithm (without any
knowledge on the smoothness of $f$). A simple modification even achieves
optimal minimax approximation rates for such functions, which we compute
explicitly. In particular, our findings highlight multiple performance gaps
between adaptive and non-adaptive algorithms, smooth and piecewise-smooth
functions, as well as monotone or non-monotone functions. Finally, we provide
numerical experiments to support our theoretical results.]]></summary>

are distant in time from each other and from the final reward. These critical
steps are challenging to identify with traditional reinforcement learning (RL)
methods that rely on the Bellman equation for credit assignment. Here, we
present a new RL algorithm that uses offline contrastive learning to hone in on
critical steps. This algorithm, which we call contrastive introspection
(ConSpec), can be added to any existing RL algorithm. ConSpec learns a set of
prototypes for the critical steps in a task by a novel contrastive loss and
delivers an intrinsic reward when the current state matches one of these
prototypes. The prototypes in ConSpec provide two key benefits for credit
assignment: (1) They enable rapid identification of all the critical steps. (2)
They do so in a readily interpretable manner, enabling out-of-distribution
generalization when sensory features are altered. Distinct from other
contemporary RL approaches to credit assignment, ConSpec takes advantage of the
fact that it is easier to retrospectively identify the small set of steps that
success is contingent upon than it is to prospectively predict reward at every
step taken in the environment. Altogether, ConSpec improves learning in a
diverse set of RL tasks, including both those with explicit, discrete critical
steps and those with complex, continuous critical steps.]]></summary>

various facets of our daily existence. Solving attention regression is a
fundamental task in optimizing LLMs. In this work, we focus on giving a
provable guarantee for the one-layer attention network objective function
$L(X,Y) = \sum_{j_0 = 1}^n \sum_{i_0 = 1}^d ( \langle \langle \exp(
\mathsf{A}_{j_0} x ) , {\bf 1}_n \rangle^{-1} \exp( \mathsf{A}_{j_0} x ), A_{3}
Y_{*,i_0} \rangle - b_{j_0,i_0} )^2$. Here $\mathsf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n^2
\times d^2}$ is Kronecker product between $A_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ and
$A_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$. $A_3$ is a matrix in $\mathbb{R}^{n \times
d}$, $\mathsf{A}_{j_0} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d^2}$ is the $j_0$-th block of
$\mathsf{A}$. The $X, Y \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ are variables we want to
learn. $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ and $b_{j_0,i_0} \in \mathbb{R}$ is one
entry at $j_0$-th row and $i_0$-th column of $B$, $Y_{*,i_0} \in \mathbb{R}^d$
is the $i_0$-column vector of $Y$, and $x \in \mathbb{R}^{d^2}$ is the
vectorization of $X$.

In a multi-layer LLM network, the matrix $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ can
be viewed as the output of a layer, and $A_1= A_2 = A_3 \in \mathbb{R}^{n
\times d}$ can be viewed as the input of a layer. The matrix version of $x$ can
be viewed as $QK^\top$ and $Y$ can be viewed as $V$. We provide an iterative
greedy algorithm to train loss function $L(X,Y)$ up $\epsilon$ that runs in
$\widetilde{O}( ({\cal T}_{\mathrm{mat}}(n,n,d) + {\cal
T}_{\mathrm{mat}}(n,d,d) + d^{2\omega}) \log(1/\epsilon) )$ time. Here ${\cal
T}_{\mathrm{mat}}(a,b,c)$ denotes the time of multiplying $a \times b$ matrix
another $b \times c$ matrix, and $\omega\approx 2.37$ denotes the exponent of
matrix multiplication.]]></summary>

propose to learn sets that satisfy a more relaxed notion of containment known
as recurrence. We define a set to be $\tau$-recurrent (resp. $k$-recurrent) if
every trajectory that starts within the set, returns to it after at most $\tau$
seconds (resp. $k$ steps). We show that under mild assumptions a
$\tau$-recurrent set containing a stable equilibrium must be a subset of its
ROA. We then leverage this property to develop algorithms that compute inner
approximations of the ROA using counter-examples of recurrence that are
obtained by sampling finite-length trajectories. Our algorithms process samples
sequentially, which allow them to continue being executed even after an initial

effectiveness in generating naturalistic behaviors. In this paper, we propose a
new learning framework in this paradigm for controlling physics-based
characters with significantly improved motion quality and diversity over
existing state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method uses reinforcement
learning (RL) to initially track and imitate life-like movements from
unstructured motion clips using the discrete information bottleneck, as adopted
in the Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE). This structure
compresses the most relevant information from the motion clips into a compact
yet informative latent space, i.e., a discrete space over vector quantized
codes. By sampling codes in the space from a trained categorical prior
distribution, high-quality life-like behaviors can be generated, similar to the
usage of VQ-VAE in computer vision. Although this prior distribution can be
trained with the supervision of the encoder's output, it follows the original
motion clip distribution in the dataset and could lead to imbalanced behaviors
in our setting. To address the issue, we further propose a technique named
prior shifting to adjust the prior distribution using curiosity-driven RL. The
outcome distribution is demonstrated to offer sufficient behavioral diversity
and significantly facilitates upper-level policy learning for downstream tasks.
We conduct comprehensive experiments using humanoid characters on two
challenging downstream tasks, sword-shield striking and two-player boxing game.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed framework is capable of controlling
the character to perform considerably high-quality movements in terms of
behavioral strategies, diversity, and realism. Videos, codes, and data are

radar intelligently targets ice storms based on information collected by a
lookahead radiometer. Critical to the intelligent targeting is accurate
identification of storm/cloud types from eight bands of radiance collected by
the radiometer. The cloud types of interest are: clear sky, thin cirrus,
cirrus, rainy anvil, and convection core.

We describe multi-step use of Machine Learning and Digital Twin of the
Earth's atmosphere to derive such a classifier. First, a digital twin of
Earth's atmosphere called a Weather Research Forecast (WRF) is used generate
simulated lookahead radiometer data as well as deeper "science" hidden
variables. The datasets simulate a tropical region over the Caribbean and a
non-tropical region over the Atlantic coast of the United States. A K-means
clustering over the scientific hidden variables was utilized by human experts
to generate an automatic labelling of the data - mapping each physical data
point to cloud types by scientists informed by mean/centroids of hidden
variables of the clusters. Next, classifiers were trained with the inputs of
the simulated radiometer data and its corresponding label. The classifiers of a
random decision forest (RDF), support vector machine (SVM), Gaussian na\"ive
bayes, feed forward artificial neural network (ANN), and a convolutional neural

the best performing classifier was able to classify non-storm clouds with over
90% accuracy and storm clouds with over 40% accuracy. Additionally both sets of

goal representation as they offer ways to structure knowledge for efficient and
transferable learning. However, the existing Hierarchical Reinforcement
Learning (HRL) approaches relying on symbolic reasoning are often limited as
they require a manual goal representation. The challenge in autonomously
discovering a symbolic goal representation is that it must preserve critical
information, such as the environment dynamics. In this work, we propose a
developmental mechanism for subgoal discovery via an emergent representation
that abstracts (i.e., groups together) sets of environment states that have
similar roles in the task. We create a HRL algorithm that gradually learns this

accuracy, managing risks, and fostering strategic financial decision-making.
Despite the development of financial market simulation methodologies, existing
frameworks often struggle with adapting to specialized simulation context. We
pinpoint the challenges as i) current financial datasets do not contain context
labels; ii) current techniques are not designed to generate financial data with
context as control, which demands greater precision compared to other
modalities; iii) the inherent difficulties in generating context-aligned,
high-fidelity data given the non-stationary, noisy nature of financial data. To
address these challenges, our contributions are: i) we proposed the Contextual
Market Dataset with market dynamics, stock ticker, and history state as
context, leveraging a market dynamics modeling method that combines linear
regression and Dynamic Time Warping clustering to extract market dynamics; ii)
we present Market-GAN, a novel architecture incorporating a Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN) for the controllable generation with context, an
autoencoder for learning low-dimension features, and supervisors for knowledge
transfer; iii) we introduce a two-stage training scheme to ensure that
Market-GAN captures the intrinsic market distribution with multiple objectives.
In the pertaining stage, with the use of the autoencoder and supervisors, we
prepare the generator with a better initialization for the adversarial training
stage. We propose a set of holistic evaluation metrics that consider alignment,
fidelity, data usability on downstream tasks, and market facts. We evaluate
Market-GAN with the Dow Jones Industrial Average data from 2000 to 2023 and
showcase superior performance in comparison to 4 state-of-the-art time-series

representation of words on this surface. This geometric viewpoint seamlessly
connects established properties such as iterative refinement and contextual
embeddings. We validate our insights by probing a pre-trained 124M parameter
GPT-2 model. Our findings reveal clear query-key attention patterns in early

semi-supervised learning methods often under-utilize available unlabeled data.
To address this, we propose a novel reliability-based training data cleaning
method employing inductive conformal prediction (ICP). This method capitalizes
on a small set of accurately labeled training data and leverages ICP-calculated
reliability metrics to rectify mislabeled data and outliers within vast
quantities of noisy training data. The efficacy of the method is validated
across three classification tasks within distinct modalities: filtering
drug-induced-liver-injury (DILI) literature with title and abstract, predicting
ICU admission of COVID-19 patients through CT radiomics and electronic health
records, and subtyping breast cancer using RNA-sequencing data. Varying levels
of noise to the training labels were introduced through label permutation.
Results show significant enhancements in classification performance: accuracy
enhancement in 86 out of 96 DILI experiments (up to 11.4%), AUROC and AUPRC
enhancements in all 48 COVID-19 experiments (up to 23.8% and 69.8%), and
accuracy and macro-average F1 score improvements in 47 out of 48 RNA-sequencing
experiments (up to 74.6% and 89.0%). Our method offers the potential to
substantially boost classification performance in multi-modal biomedical
machine learning tasks. Importantly, it accomplishes this without necessitating

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In many randomized experiments, the treatment effect of the long-term metric
(i.e. the primary outcome of interest) is often difficult or infeasible to
measure. Such long-term metrics are often slow to react to changes and
sufficiently noisy they are challenging to faithfully estimate in short-horizon
experiments. A common alternative is to measure several short-term proxy
metrics in the hope they closely track the long-term metric -- so they can be
used to effectively guide decision-making in the near-term. We introduce a new
statistical framework to both define and construct an optimal proxy metric for
use in a homogeneous population of randomized experiments. Our procedure first
reduces the construction of an optimal proxy metric in a given experiment to a
portfolio optimization problem which depends on the true latent treatment
effects and noise level of experiment under consideration. We then denoise the
observed treatment effects of the long-term metric and a set of proxies in a
historical corpus of randomized experiments to extract estimates of the latent
treatment effects for use in the optimization problem. One key insight derived
from our approach is that the optimal proxy metric for a given experiment is
not apriori fixed; rather it should depend on the sample size (or effective
noise level) of the randomized experiment for which it is deployed. To
instantiate and evaluate our framework, we employ our methodology in a large
corpus of randomized experiments from an industrial recommendation system and
construct proxy metrics that perform favorably relative to several baselines.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We introduce beta diffusion, a novel generative modeling method that
integrates demasking and denoising to generate data within bounded ranges.
Using scaled and shifted beta distributions, beta diffusion utilizes
multiplicative transitions over time to create both forward and reverse
diffusion processes, maintaining beta distributions in both the forward
marginals and the reverse conditionals, given the data at any point in time.
Unlike traditional diffusion-based generative models relying on additive
Gaussian noise and reweighted evidence lower bounds (ELBOs), beta diffusion is
multiplicative and optimized with KL-divergence upper bounds (KLUBs) derived
from the convexity of the KL divergence. We demonstrate that the proposed KLUBs
are more effective for optimizing beta diffusion compared to negative ELBOs,
which can also be derived as the KLUBs of the same KL divergence with its two
arguments swapped. The loss function of beta diffusion, expressed in terms of
Bregman divergence, further supports the efficacy of KLUBs for optimization.
Experimental results on both synthetic data and natural images demonstrate the
unique capabilities of beta diffusion in generative modeling of range-bounded
data and validate the effectiveness of KLUBs in optimizing diffusion models,
thereby making them valuable additions to the family of diffusion-based
generative models and the optimization techniques used to train them.]]></summary>

various facets of our daily existence. Solving attention regression is a
fundamental task in optimizing LLMs. In this work, we focus on giving a
provable guarantee for the one-layer attention network objective function
$L(X,Y) = \sum_{j_0 = 1}^n \sum_{i_0 = 1}^d ( \langle \langle \exp(
\mathsf{A}_{j_0} x ) , {\bf 1}_n \rangle^{-1} \exp( \mathsf{A}_{j_0} x ), A_{3}
Y_{*,i_0} \rangle - b_{j_0,i_0} )^2$. Here $\mathsf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n^2
\times d^2}$ is Kronecker product between $A_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ and
$A_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$. $A_3$ is a matrix in $\mathbb{R}^{n \times
d}$, $\mathsf{A}_{j_0} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d^2}$ is the $j_0$-th block of
$\mathsf{A}$. The $X, Y \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ are variables we want to
learn. $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ and $b_{j_0,i_0} \in \mathbb{R}$ is one
entry at $j_0$-th row and $i_0$-th column of $B$, $Y_{*,i_0} \in \mathbb{R}^d$
is the $i_0$-column vector of $Y$, and $x \in \mathbb{R}^{d^2}$ is the
vectorization of $X$.

In a multi-layer LLM network, the matrix $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ can
be viewed as the output of a layer, and $A_1= A_2 = A_3 \in \mathbb{R}^{n
\times d}$ can be viewed as the input of a layer. The matrix version of $x$ can
be viewed as $QK^\top$ and $Y$ can be viewed as $V$. We provide an iterative
greedy algorithm to train loss function $L(X,Y)$ up $\epsilon$ that runs in
$\widetilde{O}( ({\cal T}_{\mathrm{mat}}(n,n,d) + {\cal
T}_{\mathrm{mat}}(n,d,d) + d^{2\omega}) \log(1/\epsilon) )$ time. Here ${\cal
T}_{\mathrm{mat}}(a,b,c)$ denotes the time of multiplying $a \times b$ matrix
another $b \times c$ matrix, and $\omega\approx 2.37$ denotes the exponent of
matrix multiplication.]]></summary>

unobserved confounders. Sensitivity analysis methods are commonly used to
estimate the policy value under the worst-case confounding over a given
uncertainty set. However, existing work often resorts to some coarse relaxation
of the uncertainty set for the sake of tractability, leading to overly
conservative estimation of the policy value. In this paper, we propose a
general estimator that provides a sharp lower bound of the policy value. It can
be shown that our estimator contains the recently proposed sharp estimator by
Dorn and Guo (2022) as a special case, and our method enables a novel extension
of the classical marginal sensitivity model using f-divergence. To construct
our estimator, we leverage the kernel method to obtain a tractable
approximation to the conditional moment constraints, which traditional
non-sharp estimators failed to take into account. In the theoretical analysis,
we provide a condition for the choice of the kernel which guarantees no
specification error that biases the lower bound estimation. Furthermore, we
provide consistency guarantees of policy evaluation and learning. In the
experiments with synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.]]></summary>

optimisation space to run efficiently. In geometric quantum machine learning,
one achieves this by encoding group structure into parameterised quantum
circuits to include the symmetries of a problem as an inductive bias. However,
constructing such circuits is challenging as a concrete guiding principle has
yet to emerge. In this paper, we propose the use of spin networks, a form of
directed tensor network invariant under a group transformation, to devise SU(2)
equivariant quantum circuit ans\"atze -- circuits possessing spin rotation
symmetry. By changing to the basis that block diagonalises SU(2) group action,
these networks provide a natural building block for constructing parameterised
equivariant quantum circuits. We prove that our construction is mathematically
equivalent to other known constructions, such as those based on twirling and
generalised permutations, but more direct to implement on quantum hardware. The
efficacy of our constructed circuits is tested by solving the ground state
problem of SU(2) symmetric Heisenberg models on the one-dimensional triangular
lattice and on the Kagome lattice. Our results highlight that our equivariant
circuits boost the performance of quantum variational algorithms, indicating
broader applicability to other real-world problems.]]></summary>

that bypasses the restrictions on covariate distributions imposed by modern
debiasing technology. We study the prevalent setting where the number of
features and samples are both large and comparable. In this context,
state-of-the-art debiasing technology uses a degrees-of-freedom correction to
remove shrinkage bias of regularized estimators and conduct inference. However,
this method requires that the observed samples are i.i.d., the covariates
follow a mean zero Gaussian distribution, and reliable covariance matrix
estimates for observed features are available. This approach struggles when (i)
covariates are non-Gaussian with heavy tails or asymmetric distributions, (ii)
rows of the design exhibit heterogeneity or dependencies, and (iii) reliable
feature covariance estimates are lacking.

To address these, we develop a new strategy where the debiasing correction is
a rescaled gradient descent step (suitably initialized) with step size
determined by the spectrum of the sample covariance matrix. Unlike prior work,
we assume that eigenvectors of this matrix are uniform draws from the
orthogonal group. We show this assumption remains valid in diverse situations
where traditional debiasing fails, including designs with complex row-column
dependencies, heavy tails, asymmetric properties, and latent low-rank
structures. We establish asymptotic normality of our proposed estimator
(centered and scaled) under various convergence notions. Moreover, we develop a
consistent estimator for its asymptotic variance. Lastly, we introduce a
debiased Principal Component Regression (PCR) technique using our
Spectrum-Aware approach. In varied simulations and real data experiments, we
observe that our method outperforms degrees-of-freedom debiasing by a margin.]]></summary>

optimization tasks involving unknown high-dimensional (black-box) functions
that map a set of controllable variables to the outcomes of an expensive

function evaluations, but their performance suffers when dealing with

here we propose a deep learning framework for BO and sequential decision making

Using appropriate architecture choices, we show that the proposed framework can
approximate functional relationships between design variables and quantities of

augmented the proposed probabilistic surrogates with re-parameterized Monte

well as methodological extensions for accommodating black-box constraints and
multi-fidelity information sources. We test the proposed framework against

perfectly fitting any noisy training labels, and simultaneously achieve minimax

applications when using complex learners, such as deep neural networks, on

schemes. On the flip side, these approaches risk misidentifying unimportant

we develop a systematic approach for studying Conditional Permutation
Importance (CPI) that is model agnostic and computationally lean, as well as
reusable benchmarks of state-of-the-art variable importance estimators. We show
theoretically and empirically that $\textit{CPI}$ overcomes the limitations of
standard permutation importance by providing accurate type-I error control.
When used with a deep neural network, $\textit{CPI}$ consistently showed top
accuracy across benchmarks. An empirical benchmark on real-world data analysis
in a large-scale medical dataset showed that $\textit{CPI}$ provides a more

realm of statistical mechanics. ML techniques have attracted attention by the
classical density-functional theory (DFT) community, as they enable discovery
of free-energy functionals to determine the equilibrium-density profile of a
many-particle system. Within DFT, the external potential accounts for the
interaction of the many-particle system with an external field, thus, affecting
the density distribution. In this context, we introduce a statistical-learning
framework to infer the external potential exerted on a many-particle system. We
combine a Bayesian inference approach with the classical DFT apparatus to
reconstruct the external potential, yielding a probabilistic description of the
external potential functional form with inherent uncertainty quantification.
Our framework is exemplified with a grand-canonical one-dimensional particle
ensemble with excluded volume interactions in a confined geometry. The required
training dataset is generated using a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation where the
external potential is applied to the grand-canonical ensemble. The resulting
particle coordinates from the MC simulation are fed into the learning framework
to uncover the external potential. This eventually allows us to compute the
equilibrium density profile of the system by using the tools of DFT. Our
approach benchmarks the inferred density against the exact one calculated
through the DFT formulation with the true external potential. The proposed
Bayesian procedure accurately infers the external potential and the density
profile. We also highlight the external-potential uncertainty quantification
conditioned on the amount of available simulated data. The seemingly simple
case study introduced in this work might serve as a prototype for studying a
wide variety of applications, including adsorption and capillarity.]]></summary>

interpretability. Despite the advancements in interpretable machine learning
(IML) methods, they frequently assign importance to features which lack causal
influence on the outcome variable. Selecting causally relevant features among
those identified as relevant by these methods, or even before model training,
would offer a solution. Feature selection methods utilizing information
theoretical quantities have been successful in identifying statistically
relevant features. However, the information theoretical quantities they are
based on do not incorporate causality, rendering them unsuitable for such
scenarios. To address this challenge, this article proposes information
theoretical quantities that incorporate the causal structure of the system,
which can be used to evaluate causal importance of features for some given
outcome variable. Specifically, we introduce causal versions of entropy and
mutual information, termed causal entropy and causal information gain, which
are designed to assess how much control a feature provides over the outcome
variable. These newly defined quantities capture changes in the entropy of a
variable resulting from interventions on other variables. Fundamental results
connecting these quantities to the existence of causal effects are derived. The
use of causal information gain in feature selection is demonstrated,
highlighting its superiority over standard mutual information in revealing
which features provide control over a chosen outcome variable. Our

rules can maximize causal outcomes across the population, access parity
constraints or other fairness considerations can be relevant in the case of
encouragement. For example, in social services, a persistent puzzle is the gap
in take-up of beneficial services among those who may benefit from them the

causal identification, statistical variance-reduced estimation, and robust

often-reasonable covariate-conditional exclusion restriction, using our
robustness checks for lack of positivity in the recommendation. We develop a
two-stage algorithm for solving over parametrized policy classes under general
constraints to obtain variance-sensitive regret bounds. We illustrate the
methods in two case studies based on data from randomized encouragement to
enroll in insurance and from pretrial supervised release with electronic
monitoring.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The recipe behind the success of deep learning has been the combination of
neural networks and gradient-based optimization. Understanding the behavior of
gradient descent however, and particularly its instability, has lagged behind
its empirical success. To add to the theoretical tools available to study
gradient descent we propose the principal flow (PF), a continuous time flow
that approximates gradient descent dynamics. To our knowledge, the PF is the
only continuous flow that captures the divergent and oscillatory behaviors of
gradient descent, including escaping local minima and saddle points. Through
its dependence on the eigendecomposition of the Hessian the PF sheds light on
the recently observed edge of stability phenomena in deep learning. Using our
new understanding of instability we propose a learning rate adaptation method
which enables us to control the trade-off between training stability and test
set evaluation performance.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google has developed an AI algorithm to refine route suggestions on Google Maps, personalizing it based on user data and behavior, allegedly improving the accuracy on an average by 16-24 percent.
 To stay on top of the latest advancements in AI, look here first.
 https://preview.redd.it/rp21ylzo7iob1.jpg?width=770&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=737cf3fd278ade42900e8586d626a7c729522c1a
 Personalized Route Suggestions through AI
  
The AI model comprises 360 million parameters, using real-time data from Maps users to influence factors including travel time, road conditions, tolls, and personal preferences to suggest routes.
 This technology is grounded on "inverse reinforcement learning" (IRL), specifically a new IRL algorithm - "Receding Horizon Inverse Planning (RHIP)".
  
The Power of RHIP and AI in Maps
  
Google and Deepmind jointly worked to develop RHIP, using complex stochastic models in immediate vicinity areas, but switching to simpler deterministic methods for distant areas for power conservation.
 The AI improves route suggestions for both driving and two-wheeled vehicles by learning from Maps users' movements and behaviors over time.
 Google states that this is the largest application of inverse reinforcement learning for route planning to date.
  
Implementation and User Testing
  
Google has applied the algorithm to Maps data globally, but extensive user testing is needed to confirm if the technique consistently produces better routes.
 Previous attempts at using AI systems for route planning on a large scale have often failed due to the complexity of road networks.

Trump has been very effective at cultivating a cult of personality among his supporters. These supporters are often fiercely loyal to him and willing to believe whatever he says, even if it contradicts reality.
 Many Republicans have been reluctant to criticize Trump for fear of alienating his supporters. This is especially true for Republican politicians who are up for re-election in 2022.
 Some Republicans may genuinely believe that Trump did not incite the riot. They may point to the fact that he did not explicitly call for violence, or that he told his supporters to "peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard."

They are given antibiotics to prevent disease and growth hormones to make them grow faster. This leads to a variety of health problems for the animals, as well as for the people who eat their meat.
 Clean meat is a new technology that offers a more humane and sustainable way to produce meat. It is made from animal cells that are grown in a lab, without the need for animals to be raised or slaughtered. Clean meat is still in its early stages of development, but it has the potential to revolutionize the meat industry.

 Github: https://github.com/aiwaves-cn/agents 
 Abstract:
  
Recent advances on large language models (LLMs) enable researchers and developers to build autonomous language agents that can automatically solve various tasks and interact with environments, humans, and other agents using natural language interfaces. We consider language agents as a promising direction towards artificial general intelligence and release Agents, an open-source library with the goal of opening up these advances to a wider non-specialist audience. Agents is carefully engineered to support important features including planning, memory, tool usage, multi-agent communication, and fine-grained symbolic control. Agents is user-friendly as it enables non-specialists to build, customize, test, tune, and deploy state-of-the-art autonomous language agents without much coding. The library is also research-friendly as its modularized design makes it easily extensible for researchers.

 I have about 100K images on my machine and I am looking for a tool that can help me do some QA on it.
 Example features I would love:
  
Search and visualize all images with a prefix "cls1_" or "cls2_"
 Easily rename file names if they're not named correctly
 
Visualize all captions associated with each image 
  
We can assume they have the same name but with extension ".txt" or ".captions"
 Or there's a metadata.json linking between "img_file" and "caption_file"
 
 
Easily edit captions in the dashboard
 
 I can also work with some kind of metadata file instead of relying on filename logic if it really helps a certain tool.
 I prefer a locally run, open-source tool. It would be a problem for me to upload this data to any online platform.
 Many thanks in advance for any help or guidance.

 Now my next step I wanted to do a "real world" data test where I collect the exact same data as my testing data and predict it using my previously built model but the values inside test_dataset1 are different to test_dataset2 within the last 6-9 decimal places even though the data is going through the exact same code.

 Abstract:
  
Transformers have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing, but comprehending their internal mechanisms remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel geometric perspective that elucidates the inner mechanisms of transformer operations. Our primary contribution is illustrating how layer normalization confines the latent features to a hyper-sphere, subsequently enabling attention to mold the semantic representation of words on this surface. This geometric viewpoint seamlessly connects established properties such as iterative refinement and contextual embeddings. We validate our insights by probing a pre-trained 124M parameter GPT-2 model. Our findings reveal clear query-key attention patterns in early layers and build upon prior observations regarding the subject-specific nature of attention heads at deeper layers. Harnessing these geometric insights, we present an intuitive understanding of transformers, depicting them as processes that model the trajectory of word particles along the hyper-sphere.

In TD3 and SAC, it is understandable that each of them is implemented to serve their purpose (deterministic and stachastic action). But in Dreamer algorithm (DreamerV3), why does it require to combine actor and critic network to the model-based planning approach, as the model-based also able to perform an action by planning to the simulation state. It is mean that using model-based to simulate the possible future then update the critic according to the simulation might sound good in training an agent?

 The Python library hampel implements the Hampel Filter, which is generally used to detect anomalies in data with a timeseries structure. It basically consists of a sliding window of a parameterizable size.
 The library was in plain Python before (using pandas for all the sliding operations, median computation etc), but now it has been replaced by a Cython implementation, which speeds up things quite a bit! 😀
 It also provides much more valuable information (thresholds, median absolute deviations, etc.), allowing us to create plots like this one:

 Abstract:
  
Transformers have become the dominant model in deep learning, but the reason for their superior performance is poorly understood. Here, we hypothesize that the strong performance of Transformers stems from an architectural bias towards mesa-optimization, a learned process running within the forward pass of a model consisting of the following two steps: (i) the construction of an internal learning objective, and (ii) its corresponding solution found through optimization. To test this hypothesis, we reverse-engineer a series of autoregressive Transformers trained on simple sequence modeling tasks, uncovering underlying gradient-based mesa-optimization algorithms driving the generation of predictions. Moreover, we show that the learned forward-pass optimization algorithm can be immediately repurposed to solve supervised few-shot tasks, suggesting that mesa-optimization might underlie the in-context learning capabilities of large language models. Finally, we propose a novel self-attention layer, the mesa-layer, that explicitly and efficiently solves optimization problems specified in context. We find that this layer can lead to improved performance in synthetic and preliminary language modeling experiments, adding weight to our hypothesis that mesa-optimization is an important operation hidden within the weights of trained Transformers.

 So the definition of the recurrent representation of the retention mechanism is below

γ is a decay factor, and K, Q, and V have their standard transformer definitions.
 What confuses me is the derivation of Sn. The formula makes it look like a scalar. But if that's the case, are we saying that for a given token, the retention mechanism is just multiplying the Query by a scalar? That's surprising! How is that able to provide enough context?

 Bard said:
 I agree that these are difficult times. The world is facing many challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and political instability. However, I believe that we have much to be grateful for today compared to the WWII years.
 Here are just a few things:
 We live in a time of peace. World War II was a global conflict that caused the deaths of millions of people. Today, there are no major wars raging on.
 We have access to advanced medical care. During WWII, many people died from diseases that are now easily treatable. Today, we have antibiotics, vaccines, and other medical advances that have saved countless lives.
 We have a higher standard of living. In the WWII years, many people lived in poverty. Today, most people in the developed world have access to clean water, food, and shelter.
 We have more opportunities for education and advancement. In the WWII years, many people were denied an education because of their race, gender, or social class. Today, education is more accessible than ever before, and people from all backgrounds have the opportunity to succeed.
 We have a better understanding of the world. During WWII, there was a lot of misinformation and propaganda. Today, we have access to more information than ever before, and we can make more informed decisions about our lives.
 Of course, there are still many challenges that we face today. But I believe that we have come a long way since the WWII years, and we have much to be grateful for. Let us never forget the sacrifices that were made during that time, and let us continue to work towards a better future for all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The AI-based techno-economic war between the West and China will determine the global distribution of technology, economic benefits, and influence.
 
The winner of this race, particularly in AI, will have the power to accelerate GDP growth and project global economic benefits.
 
China is actively pursuing technological leadership in AI and 5G wireless, while the West must prioritize technological talent influx and leverage its venture and technology ecosystem.
 
Aggressive AI regulation could hinder the West's momentum in this race.
 
The risks of this war and AI technology are significant, but it is a greater risk to let adversaries have unconstrained power.
 
Global treaties are not enforceable solutions to regulate AI.

 A skew-symmetric matrix is a square matrix whose transpose equals to its negative. It should satisfy the below condition:
 AT = –A
 Just wondering do these have any applications in ML at all? I never came across this in my math classes so just wondering if the property pops up anywhere else in the field. Maybe in 3D space applications? Or maybe RBG data augmentation? But yeah not 100% sure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have a dataset that consists of 2D trajectories and I am aiming to develop an autoencoder architecture to learn a compressed set of features that reasonable represents and can reconstruct the trajectories. 
 The trajectories may look something like this as an example. A 2D image as input would seem to require a very sparse representation with high resolution to track the trajectory path. I am hoping there is a better way to input the path without requiring high resolution. 
 An alternative might be to use a LSTM structure to input as a sequence, although not sure that solves the resolution issue.
 Do you have any suggestions? I've worked with 1d time series and 2D images just fine but this is a bit different.

 I'm running llama-2-7b-chat-hf with 4bit quantization on a g5.2xlarge instance on sagemaker.
 The method I'm using is map_reduce (option 2)from this webpage https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/summarization)
 Of everything I've tried this is the only one that's been able to do decent summaries in a reasonable amount of time. However with really long articles (10,000+ words) it takes ~6 minutes before giving an output.
 I tried running this same thing on a g5.12xlarge instance which has 4 A10G gpus but it hasn't reduced the time by any noticeable amount.
 Is there anything else I could be doing to speed this up?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I asked ChatGPT to talk with Trump's jury about the 3-hour delay. Not bad.
 ChatGPT:
 Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, today, we present a compelling case that the three-hour delay in President Trump's response to the events of January 6th is, without a doubt, overwhelming and irrefutable evidence of his planning and conducting the insurrection that unfolded before our eyes.
 First, consider the timeline. As the violence escalated, President Trump did not immediately call for an end to the chaos. This delay allowed the mob to wreak havoc, endanger lives, and damage our democracy. A leader's duty is to protect the nation and its citizens, and a three-hour wait to act is inexplicable unless there was intent behind it.
 Second, let's talk about intent. In criminal law, intent matters. It's the difference between an accident and a crime. A deliberate delay in response to an unfolding insurrection suggests a guilty mind. President Trump had the power and the responsibility to intervene immediately. Yet, he chose not to, allowing the violence to escalate.
 Furthermore, we must consider his words leading up to and during the events of January 6th. His rhetoric could be interpreted as encouragement for his supporters to take matters into their own hands. This, coupled with the delay, paints a picture of a leader who not only knew what was happening but may have orchestrated it.
 Ladies and gentlemen, we are not here to pass judgment but to seek justice. The evidence of a three-hour delay in responding to the insurrection, along with the surrounding circumstances, presents a compelling case that President Trump planned and conducted this insurrection. It is our duty to hold individuals accountable for their actions, regardless of their position.

 The film Social Network suggests that Mark Zuckerberg stole his idea for Facebook from two brothers who hired him to make an app for the idea. How likely is this to be true?
 Bard seemed informed and sharp:
 "The film The Social Network is a dramatization of the founding of Facebook, and as such, it takes some liberties with the truth. However, the film does accurately portray the fact that Mark Zuckerberg was sued by the Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler, who claimed that he stole their idea for a social networking website called HarvardConnection.
 The Winklevoss twins allege that they met with Zuckerberg in December 2003 to discuss their idea for HarvardConnection, and tha…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there! I'm participating in a Hackathon at work and am wondering if this community can give me some direction. Every year our company receives mandates / updates from different parties. In turn, our development teams have to parse through heavy documentation to figure out what needs to change in our code. Ingesting the data is what takes the longest. Our goal is to feed the mandates documentation through an AI and have it return what is needed to be changed in our code. For example, something might say field 200 now needs to include a 6 digit date format vs the 4 digit date format we've had in years past. We have secured a license for Azure AI but honestly no idea if that is the right AI to use. I youtubed a bunch of videos on document processing but I'm also not sure if that is what we are trying to do. Any advice on this is much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07062 
 Abstract:
  
We explore the novel application of Large Language Models to code optimization. We present a 7B-parameter transformer model trained from scratch to optimize LLVM assembly for code size. The model takes as input unoptimized assembly and outputs a list of compiler options to best optimize the program. Crucially, during training, we ask the model to predict the instruction counts before and after optimization, and the optimized code itself. These auxiliary learning tasks significantly improve the optimization performance of the model and improve the model's depth of understanding.
 We evaluate on a large suite of test programs. Our approach achieves a 3.0% improvement in reducing instruction counts over the compiler, outperforming two state-of-the-art baselines that require thousands of compilations. Furthermore, the model shows surprisingly strong code reasoning abilities, generating compilable code 91% of the time and perfectly emulating the output of the compiler 70% of the time.

 I'm still experiencing with my own implementation of rag, and I deployed my custom chunking function (honestly don't like the methods on LangChain) . 
 Anyway, I'm searching for alternative methods, algoritms (NLP or not) and models... There are lots of info and different implementation on RAG, but as I can see noone put much effort to augment chunking quality. 
 Also, there are other approach than this one I'm currently using? bi-encoder (instructor) - > cross-encoder (reranking) - > LLM 
 Can someone share some resources, repo, lib or existing implementation of different chunking methods? (or simply discuss here some idea, though or approach) 
 Thanks in advance for you time!!

 Cambridge University Press
 I am solving the problem I attach and I have a doubt in section (f). I have solved all the sections (a)-(e).
 In section (e) I have obtained that I need
 $$
 k \geq \frac{\lambda_{\text{max}}\left(\frac{2}{N} A^TA + 2\mu I\right)}{\lambda_{\text{min}}\left(\frac{2}{N} A^TA + 2\mu I\right)}log((f(x^0)-f(x_\mu)/\epsilon).
 $$
 However in section (f) asks for a tight upper bound but I only can think about the following bound:
 $f(\hat{x}) \leq f_\mu(x_\mu) + ||\hat{x}||^2+ \epsilon$,
 which is very simple.
 Do you think that I can obtain the result in (e) to obtain another bond, or what would you do?

 I'm trying to figure out what is the best way to use LLMs to analyse a very old software entirely written in C.
 I've tried to to some basic prompts with ChatGPT and it seems to recognise the language.
 The situation is that I've many .c files with thousands of lines and with a lot of redundant code.
 Moreover, since there are a lot of data structure with variables names not easily understandable, I need to provide some context to allow the model to trying to understand what the code does.
 My worry is that providing all the needed info + the file itself (even considering 1 file at a time) I could consume all the model context and therefore not leave room for generating anything of value.
 Has anyone had the opportunity to face similar problems? Ideas?

 Abstract:
  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results. However, existing models are expensive to train and deploy, and it is also difficult to expand their knowledge beyond pre-training data without forgetting previous knowledge. This paper proposes a new neural network architecture, ModuleFormer, that leverages modularity to improve the efficiency and flexibility of large language models. ModuleFormer is based on the Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE). Unlike the previous SMoE-based modular language model, which requires domain-labeled data to learn domain-specific experts, ModuleFormer can i…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 I wasn't doing any ml in some time and forgot basics. I was thinking that you may help me. So I trained svc model on small dataset (around 1400 unical records). I have 13 classes, which are badly distributed in the training set and inbalanced. 3 classes took around 80% of all. What the business wants is keep the 3 classes and categorize the rest as "Other" class. In the future they may be able to generate more training data for the remaining labels.
 How should I do it? I know I can assign everytning to "Other" class, before training with simple if then formula, but dont know if this is the right approach. Any sugestions? I know this may be some case of 1 vs all case, but don't know which exactly.
 Thanks in advance for any help.

Prior to the pandemic, we both worked full-time in careers that we loved and found meaningful, and we sent our daughter to a full-day Montessori school. Although I struggled with significant health issues, I felt unbelievably lucky and fulfilled in both my family life and my professional life. The pandemic upended my careful balance. Every family is different, with different needs, circumstances, and constraints, and what works for one may not work for others. My intention here is primarily to share the journey of my own (very privileged) family.
