        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Purpose of review: Recent advances in sensing, actuation, and computation
have opened the door to multi-robot systems consisting of hundreds/thousands of
robots, with promising applications to automated manufacturing, disaster
relief, harvesting, last-mile delivery, port/airport operations, or search and
rescue. The community has leveraged model-free multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) to devise efficient, scalable controllers for multi-robot
systems (MRS). This review aims to provide an analysis of the state-of-the-art
in distributed MARL for multi-robot cooperation.

Recent findings: Decentralized MRS face fundamental challenges, such as
non-stationarity and partial observability. Building upon the "centralized
training, decentralized execution" paradigm, recent MARL approaches include
independent learning, centralized critic, value decomposition, and
communication learning approaches. Cooperative behaviors are demonstrated
through AI benchmarks and fundamental real-world robotic capabilities such as
multi-robot motion/path planning.

Summary: This survey reports the challenges surrounding decentralized
model-free MARL for multi-robot cooperation and existing classes of approaches.
We present benchmarks and robotic applications along with a discussion on
current open avenues for research.]]></summary>

employed to train the network with stability. Exploration is driven by the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Streamlined qBOLD acquisitions enable experimentally straightforward
observations of brain oxygen metabolism. $R_2^\prime$ maps are easily inferred;
however, the Oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and deoxygenated blood volume
(DBV) are more ambiguously determined from the data. As such, existing
inference methods tend to yield very noisy and underestimated OEF maps, while
overestimating DBV.

This work describes a novel probabilistic machine learning approach that can
infer plausible distributions of OEF and DBV. Initially, we create a model that
produces informative voxelwise prior distribution based on synthetic training
data. Contrary to prior work, we model the joint distribution of OEF and DBV
through a scaled multivariate logit-Normal distribution, which enables the
values to be constrained within a plausible range. The prior distribution model
is used to train an efficient amortized variational Bayesian inference model.
This model learns to infer OEF and DBV by predicting real image data, with few
training data required, using the signal equations as a forward model.

We demonstrate that our approach enables the inference of smooth OEF and DBV
maps, with a physiologically plausible distribution that can be adapted through
specification of an informative prior distribution. Other benefits include
model comparison (via the evidence lower bound) and uncertainty quantification
for identifying image artefacts. Results are demonstrated on a small study
comparing subjects undergoing hyperventilation and at rest. We illustrate that
the proposed approach allows measurement of gray matter differences in OEF and
DBV and enables voxelwise comparison between conditions, where we observe
significant increases in OEF and $R_2^\prime$ during hyperventilation.]]></summary>

contribution is to provide two simple first-order algorithmic frameworks based
on the quadratic penalty method and the augmented Lagrangian method,

provide nonasymptotic theoretical guarantees for these algorithms. More

distill the generative prior to capture a robust coarse-level content
representation that can link objects at an abstract semantic level, based on
which fine-level content features are adaptively learned for more accurate
multi-level content correspondences. Extensive experiments demonstrate the

problem in data mining, which has numerous applications. Existing
autoencoder-based approaches deliver state-of-the-art performance on
challenging real-world data but are vulnerable to outliers and exhibit low
explainability. To address these two limitations, we propose robust and
explainable unsupervised autoencoder frameworks that decompose an input time
series into a clean time series and an outlier time series using autoencoders.
Improved explainability is achieved because clean time series are better
explained with easy-to-understand patterns such as trends and periodicities. We
provide insight into this by means of a post-hoc explainability analysis and
empirical studies. In addition, since outliers are separated from clean time
series iteratively, our approach offers improved robustness to outliers, which
in turn improves accuracy. We evaluate our approach on five real-world datasets
and report improvements over the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of
robustness and explainability.

While deep learning models achieve superior performance, often statistically
better than humans, their adoption into safety-critical settings, such as
healthcare or self-driving cars is hindered by their inability to provide
safety guarantees or to expose the inner workings of the model in a human
understandable form. We present Mo\"ET, a novel model based on Mixture of
Experts, consisting of decision tree experts and a generalized linear model
gating function. Thanks to such gating function the model is more expressive
than the standard decision tree. To support non-differentiable decision trees
as experts, we formulate a novel training procedure. In addition, we introduce
a hard thresholding version, Mo\"ETH, in which predictions are made solely by a
single expert chosen via the gating function. Thanks to that property, Mo\"ETH
allows each prediction to be easily decomposed into a set of logical rules in a
form which can be easily verified. While Mo\"ET is a general use model, we
illustrate its power in the reinforcement learning setting. By training Mo\"ET
models using an imitation learning procedure on deep RL agents we outperform
the previous state-of-the-art technique based on decision trees while
preserving the verifiability of the models. Moreover, we show that Mo\"ET can
also be used in real-world supervised problems on which it outperforms other

trained model without sharing their labeled data. However, potential clients
might even be reluctant to label their own data, which could limit the
applicability of FL in practice. In this paper, we show the possibility of
unsupervised FL whose model is still a classifier for predicting class labels,
if the class-prior probabilities are shifted while the class-conditional
distributions are shared among the unlabeled data owned by the clients. We
propose federation of unsupervised learning (FedUL), where the unlabeled data
are transformed into surrogate labeled data for each of the clients, a modified
model is trained by supervised FL, and the wanted model is recovered from the
modified model. FedUL is a very general solution to unsupervised FL: it is
compatible with many supervised FL methods, and the recovery of the wanted
model can be theoretically guaranteed as if the data have been labeled.
Experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of FedUL. Code is available at https://github.com/lunanbit/FedUL.]]></summary>

GNNs encounter significant performance degradation when the amount of
supervision signals, i.e., number of labeled nodes, is limited, which is
expected as GNNs are trained solely based on the supervision obtained from the
labeled nodes. On the other hand,recent self-supervised learning paradigm aims
to train GNNs by solving pretext tasks that do not require any labeled nodes,
and it has shown to even outperform GNNs trained with few labeled nodes.
However, a major drawback of self-supervised methods is that they fall short of
learning class discriminative node representations since no labeled information
is utilized during training. To this end, we propose a novel semi-supervised
method for graphs, GraFN, that leverages few labeled nodes to ensure nodes that
belong to the same class to be grouped together, thereby achieving the best of
both worlds of semi-supervised and self-supervised methods. Specifically, GraFN
randomly samples support nodes from labeled nodes and anchor nodes from the
entire graph. Then, it minimizes the difference between two predicted class
distributions that are non-parametrically assigned by anchor-supports
similarity from two differently augmented graphs. We experimentally show that
GraFN surpasses both the semi-supervised and self-supervised methods in terms
of node classification on real-world graphs. The source code for GraFN is

increasingly popular. Most RL methods use fixed action interval (denoted as
tduration) and actuate or maintain a phase every tduration, which makes the
phase duration less dynamic and flexible. In addition, the actuated phase can
be arbitrary, affecting the real-world deployment, which requires a fixed
cyclical phase structure. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-level
traffic signal control framework, DynLight, which uses an optimization method
Max-QueueLength (M-QL) to determine the phase and uses a deep Q-network to
determine the corresponding duration. Based on DynLight, we further propose
DynLight-C that adopts a well trained deep Q-network of DynLight and replace
M-QL by a fixed cyclical control policy that actuate a set of phases in fixed
order to realize cyclical phase structure. Comprehensive experiments on
multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that DynLight achives a new
state-of-the-art. Furthermore, the deep Q-network of DynLight can learn well on
determining the phase duration and DynLight-C demonstrates high performance for
deployment.]]></summary>

formulates a new game theoretic framework for this phenomenon, called
"multi-player performative prediction". We focus on two distinct solution
concepts, namely (i) performatively stable equilibria and (ii) Nash equilibria
of the game. The latter equilibria are arguably more informative, but can be
found efficiently only when the game is monotone. We show that under mild
assumptions, the performatively stable equilibria can be found efficiently by a
variety of algorithms, including repeated retraining and the repeated
(stochastic) gradient method. We then establish transparent sufficient
conditions for strong monotonicity of the game and use them to develop
algorithms for finding Nash equilibria. We investigate derivative free methods
and adaptive gradient algorithms wherein each player alternates between
learning a parametric description of their distribution and gradient steps on
the empirical risk. Synthetic and semi-synthetic numerical experiments
illustrate the results.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although evaluation of the expectations on the Ising model is essential in
various applications, this is frequently infeasible because of intractable
multiple summations (or integrations). Spatial Monte Carlo integration (SMCI)
is a sampling-based approximation, and can provide high-accuracy estimations
for such intractable expectations. To evaluate the expectation of a function of
variables in a specific region (called target region), SMCI considers a larger
region containing the target region (called sum region). In SMCI, the multiple
summation for the variables in the sum region is precisely executed, and that
in the outer region is evaluated by the sampling approximation such as the
standard Monte Carlo integration. It is guaranteed that the accuracy of the
SMCI estimator is monotonically improved as the size of the sum region
increases. However, a haphazard expansion of the sum region could cause a
combinatorial explosion. Therefore, we hope to improve the accuracy without
such region expansion. In this study, based on the theory of generalized least
squares, a new effective method is proposed by combining multiple SMCI
estimators. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated theoretically
and numerically. The results indicate that the proposed method can be effective
in the inverse Ising problem (or Boltzmann machine learning).]]></summary>

equations(SDE) is proposed in this paper. The central goal is to solve forward
and inverse stochastic problems more effectively using limited data. Deep
operator network(DeepONet) has been proposed recently for operator learning.
Compared to other neural networks to learn functions, it aims at the problem of
learning nonlinear operators. However, it can be challenging by using the
original model to learn nonlinear operators for high-dimensional stochastic
problems. We propose a new multi-resolution autoencoder DeepONet model referred
to as MultiAuto-DeepONet to deal with this difficulty with the aid of
convolutional autoencoder. The encoder part of the network is designed to
reduce the dimensionality as well as discover the hidden features of
high-dimensional stochastic inputs. The decoder is designed to have a special
structure, i.e. in the form of DeepONet. The first DeepONet in decoder is
designed to reconstruct the input function involving randomness while the
second one is used to approximate the solution of desired equations. Those two
DeepONets has a common branch net and two independent trunk nets. This
architecture enables us to deal with multi-resolution inputs naturally. By
adding $L_1$ regularization to our network, we found the outputs from the
branch net and two trunk nets all have sparse structures. This reduces the
number of trainable parameters in the neural network thus making the model more
efficient. Finally, we conduct several numerical experiments to illustrate the
effectiveness of our proposed MultiAuto-DeepONet model with uncertainty
quantification.]]></summary>

data analysis that involves diagonalizing the covariance matrix of the dataset.
Recently, quantum algorithms have been formulated for PCA based on
diagonalizing a density matrix. These algorithms assume that the covariance
matrix can be encoded in a density matrix, but a concrete protocol for this
encoding has been lacking. Our work aims to address this gap. Assuming
amplitude encoding of the data, with the data given by the ensemble $\{p_i,|
\psi_i \rangle\}$, then one can easily prepare the ensemble average density
matrix $\overline{\rho} = \sum_i p_i |\psi_i\rangle \langle \psi_i |$. We first
show that $\overline{\rho}$ is precisely the covariance matrix whenever the
dataset is centered. For quantum datasets, we exploit global phase symmetry to
argue that there always exists a centered dataset consistent with
$\overline{\rho}$, and hence $\overline{\rho}$ can always be interpreted as a
covariance matrix. This provides a simple means for preparing the covariance
matrix for arbitrary quantum datasets or centered classical datasets. For
uncentered classical datasets, our method is so-called "PCA without centering",
which we interpret as PCA on a symmetrized dataset. We argue that this closely
corresponds to standard PCA, and we derive equations and inequalities that
bound the deviation of the spectrum obtained with our method from that of
standard PCA. We numerically illustrate our method for the MNIST handwritten
digit dataset. We also argue that PCA on quantum datasets is natural and
meaningful, and we numerically implement our method for molecular ground-state
datasets.]]></summary>

parsing Excel Files, reading and writing text files line by line, etc.
Developers can greatly benefit from automatic API usage sequence generation
based on natural language queries for building applications in a faster and
cleaner manner. Existing approaches utilize information retrieval models to
search for matching API sequences given a query or use RNN-based
encoder-decoder to generate API sequences. As it stands, the first approach
treats queries and API names as bags of words. It lacks deep comprehension of
the semantics of the queries. The latter approach adapts a neural language
model to encode a user query into a fixed-length context vector and generate
API sequences from the context vector.

We want to understand the effectiveness of recent Pre-trained Transformer
based Models (PTMs) for the API learning task. These PTMs are trained on large
natural language corpora in an unsupervised manner to retain contextual
knowledge about the language and have found success in solving similar Natural
Language Processing (NLP) problems. However, the applicability of PTMs has not
yet been explored for the API sequence generation task. We use a dataset that
contains 7 million annotations collected from GitHub to evaluate the PTMs
empirically. This dataset was also used to assess previous approaches. Based on
our results, PTMs generate more accurate API sequences and outperform other
related methods by around 11%. We have also identified two different
tokenization approaches that can contribute to a significant boost in PTMs'

Neural Networks (GNNs) with Jumping-Knowledge (JK). Android function call
graphs (FCGs) consist of a set of program functions and their inter-procedural
calls. Thus, this paper proposes a GNN-based method for Android malware
detection by capturing meaningful intra-procedural call path patterns. In
addition, a Jumping-Knowledge technique is applied to minimize the effect of
the over-smoothing problem, which is common in GNNs. The proposed method has
been extensively evaluated using two benchmark datasets. The results
demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art
approaches in terms of key classification metrics, which demonstrates the

machine learning models for human behavior include a dearth of labeled training
data and difficulty of acquiring high quality labels. Active learning is a
paradigm for using algorithms to computationally select a useful subset of data
points to label using metrics for model uncertainty and data similarity. We
explore active learning for naturalistic computer vision emotion data, a
particularly heterogeneous and complex data space due to inherently subjective
labels. Using frames collected from gameplay acquired from a therapeutic
smartphone game for children with autism, we run a simulation of active
learning using gameplay prompts as metadata to aid in the active learning
process. We find that active learning using information generated during
gameplay slightly outperforms random selection of the same number of labeled
frames. We next investigate a method to conduct active learning with subjective
data, such as in affective computing, and where multiple crowdsourced labels
can be acquired for each image. Using the Child Affective Facial Expression
(CAFE) dataset, we simulate an active learning process for crowdsourcing many
labels and find that prioritizing frames using the entropy of the crowdsourced
label distribution results in lower categorical cross-entropy loss compared to
random frame selection. Collectively, these results demonstrate pilot

behind a data generating mechanism (i.e., phenomenon) we happen to be
interested in. Uncovering such relationships allows us to identify the true
working of a phenomenon and, most importantly, articulate a model that may
enable us to further explore the phenomenon on hand and/or allow us to predict
it accurately. Fundamentally, such models are likely to be derived via a causal
approach (as opposed to an observational or empirical mean). In this approach,
causal discovery is required to create a causal model, which can then be
applied to infer the influence of interventions, and answer any hypothetical
questions (i.e., in the form of What ifs? Etc.) that we might have. This paper
builds a case for causal discovery and causal inference and contrasts that
against traditional machine learning approaches; all from a civil and
structural engineering perspective. More specifically, this paper outlines the
key principles of causality and the most commonly used algorithms and packages
for causal discovery and causal inference. Finally, this paper also presents a
series of examples and case studies of how causal concepts can be adopted for

representation space by the variance and covariance loss. However, VICReg would
be ineffective on non-stationary time series where different parts/crops of

have focused on demonstrating how AI energy efficiency can be improved by
tuning the model training strategy. Nevertheless, how modifications applied to
datasets can impact the energy consumption of AI is still an open question. To
fill this gap, in this exploratory study, we evaluate if data-centric
approaches can be utilized to improve AI energy efficiency. To achieve our
goal, we conduct an empirical experiment, executed by considering 6 different
AI algorithms, a dataset comprising 5,574 data points, and two dataset
modifications (number of data points and number of features). Our results show
evidence that, by exclusively conducting modifications on datasets, energy
consumption can be drastically reduced (up to 92.16%), often at the cost of a
negligible or even absent accuracy decline. As additional introductory results,
we demonstrate how, by exclusively changing the algorithm used, energy savings
up to two orders of magnitude can be achieved. In conclusion, this exploratory

we also estimate the camera exposure gap time within the same optimization. To
account for abrupt motion changes like bounces, we model the motion trajectory

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi-institutional efforts can facilitate training of deep MRI
reconstruction models, albeit privacy risks arise during cross-site sharing of
imaging data. Federated learning (FL) has recently been introduced to address
privacy concerns by enabling distributed training without transfer of imaging
data. Existing FL methods for MRI reconstruction employ conditional models to
map from undersampled to fully-sampled acquisitions via explicit knowledge of
the imaging operator. Since conditional models generalize poorly across
different acceleration rates or sampling densities, imaging operators must be
fixed between training and testing, and they are typically matched across
sites. To improve generalization and flexibility in multi-institutional
collaborations, here we introduce a novel method for MRI reconstruction based
on Federated learning of Generative IMage Priors (FedGIMP). FedGIMP leverages a
two-stage approach: cross-site learning of a generative MRI prior, and
subject-specific injection of the imaging operator. The global MRI prior is
learned via an unconditional adversarial model that synthesizes high-quality MR
images based on latent variables. Specificity in the prior is preserved via a
mapper subnetwork that produces site-specific latents. During inference, the
prior is combined with subject-specific imaging operators to enable
reconstruction, and further adapted to individual test samples by minimizing
data-consistency loss. Comprehensive experiments on multi-institutional
datasets clearly demonstrate enhanced generalization performance of FedGIMP
against site-specific and federated methods based on conditional models, as
well as traditional reconstruction methods.]]></summary>

while consuming various modalities of digital information. One avenue of
deepfake creation is aligned with injection and removal of tumors from medical
scans. Failure to detect medical deepfakes can lead to large setbacks on
hospital resources or even loss of life. This paper attempts to address the
detection of such attacks with a structured case study. Specifically, we
evaluate eight different machine learning algorithms, which including three
conventional machine learning methods, support vector machine, random forest,
decision tree, and five deep learning models, DenseNet121, DenseNet201,
ResNet50, ResNet101, VGG19, on distinguishing between tampered and untampered
images.For deep learning models, the five models are used for feature
extraction, then fine-tune for each pre-trained model is performed. The
findings of this work show near perfect accuracy in detecting instances of
tumor injections and removals.]]></summary>

Constrained Markov Decision Processes under probability one constraints. We
argue that stationary policies are not sufficient for solving this problem, and
that a rich class of policies can be found by endowing the controller with a
scalar quantity, so called budget, that tracks how close the agent is to
violating the constraint. We show that the minimal budget required to act
safely can be obtained as the smallest fixed point of a Bellman-like operator,
for which we analyze its convergence properties. We also show how to learn this
quantity when the true kernel of the Markov decision process is not known,
while providing sample-complexity bounds. The utility of knowing this minimal
budget relies in that it can aid in the search of optimal or near-optimal
policies by shrinking down the region of the state space the agent must
navigate. Simulations illustrate the different nature of probability one
constraints against the typically used constraints in expectation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Federated learning is an emerging research paradigm for enabling
collaboratively training deep learning models without sharing patient data.
However, the data from different institutions are usually heterogeneous across
institutions, which may reduce the performance of models trained using
federated learning. In this study, we propose a novel heterogeneity-aware
federated learning method, SplitAVG, to overcome the performance drops from
data heterogeneity in federated learning. Unlike previous federated methods
that require complex heuristic training or hyper parameter tuning, our SplitAVG
leverages the simple network split and feature map concatenation strategies to
encourage the federated model training an unbiased estimator of the target data
distribution. We compare SplitAVG with seven state-of-the-art federated
learning methods, using centrally hosted training data as the baseline on a
suite of both synthetic and real-world federated datasets. We find that the
performance of models trained using all the comparison federated learning
methods degraded significantly with the increasing degrees of data
heterogeneity. In contrast, SplitAVG method achieves comparable results to the
baseline method under all heterogeneous settings, that it achieves 96.2% of the
accuracy and 110.4% of the mean absolute error obtained by the baseline in a
diabetic retinopathy binary classification dataset and a bone age prediction
dataset, respectively, on highly heterogeneous data partitions. We conclude
that SplitAVG method can effectively overcome the performance drops from
variability in data distributions across institutions. Experimental results
also show that SplitAVG can be adapted to different base networks and
generalized to various types of medical imaging tasks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The nonuniform quantization strategy for compressing neural networks usually
achieves better performance than its counterpart, i.e., uniform strategy, due
to its superior representational capacity. However, many nonuniform
quantization methods overlook the complicated projection process in
implementing the nonuniformly quantized weights/activations, which incurs
non-negligible time and space overhead in hardware deployment. In this study,
we propose Nonuniform-to-Uniform Quantization (N2UQ), a method that can
maintain the strong representation ability of nonuniform methods while being
hardware-friendly and efficient as the uniform quantization for model
inference. We achieve this through learning the flexible in-equidistant input
thresholds to better fit the underlying distribution while quantizing these
real-valued inputs into equidistant output levels. To train the quantized
network with learnable input thresholds, we introduce a generalized
straight-through estimator (G-STE) for intractable backward derivative
calculation w.r.t. threshold parameters. Additionally, we consider entropy
preserving regularization to further reduce information loss in weight
quantization. Even under this adverse constraint of imposing uniformly
quantized weights and activations, our N2UQ outperforms state-of-the-art
nonuniform quantization methods by 0.5~1.7 on ImageNet, demonstrating the
contribution of N2UQ design. Code and models are available at:

challenges for neural networks on how to handle the biased predictions between
head and tail classes, i.e., the model tends to classify tail classes as head

engineering, in this paper, we take a different perspective: the classification
margins. We study the relationship between the margins and logits
(classification scores) and empirically observe the biased margins and the
biased logits are positively correlated. We propose MARC, a simple yet
effective MARgin Calibration function to dynamically calibrate the biased
margins for unbiased logits. We validate MARC through extensive experiments on
common long-tailed benchmarks including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, Places-LT, and
iNaturalist-LT. Experimental results demonstrate that our MARC achieves
favorable results on these benchmarks. In addition, MARC is extremely easy to
implement with just three lines of code. We hope this simple method will

Experimental evaluations, using object detection baselines on the Visdrone and
xView aerial object detection datasets show that the proposed inference method
can increase object detection AP by 6.8%, 5.1% and 5.3% for FCOS, VFNet and
TOOD detectors, respectively. Moreover, the detection accuracy can be further
increased with a slicing aided fine-tuning, resulting in a cumulative increase
of 12.7%, 13.4% and 14.5% AP in the same order. Proposed technique has been

agent by manipulating the cost signals. We show that a small falsification of
the cost parameters will only lead to a bounded change in the optimal policy.
The bound is linear on the amount of falsification the attacker can apply to
the cost parameters. We propose an attack model where the attacker aims to
mislead the agent into learning a `nefarious' policy by intentionally
falsifying the cost parameters. We formulate the attack's problem as a convex
optimization problem and develop necessary and sufficient conditions to check
the achievability of the attacker's goal.

We showcase the adversarial manipulation on two types of LQG learners: the
batch RL learner and the other is the adaptive dynamic programming (ADP)
learner. Our results demonstrate that with only 2.296% of falsification on the
cost data, the attacker misleads the batch RL into learning the 'nefarious'
policy that leads the vehicle to a dangerous position. The attacker can also
gradually trick the ADP learner into learning the same `nefarious' policy by
consistently feeding the learner a falsified cost signal that stays close to
the actual cost signal. The paper aims to raise people's awareness of the
security threats faced by RL-enabled control systems.]]></summary>

materials design and automated chemistry, is increasing. A major challenge,
however, lies in fact that measuring the state of the system is often costly
and time consuming in scientific applications, whereas policy learning with RL
requires a measurement after each time step. In this work, we make the
measurement costs explicit in the form of a costed reward and propose a
framework that enables off-the-shelf deep RL algorithms to learn a policy for
both selecting actions and determining whether or not to measure the current
state of the system at each time step. In this way, the agents learn to balance
the need for information with the cost of information. Our results show that
when trained under this regime, the Dueling DQN and PPO agents can learn
optimal action policies whilst making up to 50\% fewer state measurements, and
recurrent neural networks can produce a greater than 50\% reduction in
measurements. We postulate the these reduction can help to lower the barrier to

linear stochastic iterative algorithm and temporal difference (TD) learning.
TD-learning is a linear stochastic iterative algorithm to estimate the value
function of a given policy for a Markov decision process, which is one of the
most popular and fundamental reinforcement learning algorithms. While there has
been a series of successful works in theoretical analysis of TD-learning, it
was not until recently that researchers found some guarantees on its
statistical efficiency. In this paper, we propose a control theoretic
finite-time analysis TD-learning, which exploits standard notions in linear
system control communities. Therefore, the proposed work provides additional
insights on TD-learning and reinforcement learning with simple concepts and
analysis tools in control theory.]]></summary>

demonstrations, without access to an explicit reward signal. A popular class of
approach infers the (unknown) reward function via inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) followed by maximizing this reward function via reinforcement
learning (RL). The policies learned via these approaches are however very
brittle in practice and deteriorate quickly even with small test-time
perturbations due to compounding errors. We propose Imitation with Planning at
Test-time (IMPLANT), a new meta-algorithm for imitation learning that utilizes
decision-time planning to correct for compounding errors of any base imitation
policy. In contrast to existing approaches, we retain both the imitation policy
and the rewards model at decision-time, thereby benefiting from the learning
signal of the two components. Empirically, we demonstrate that IMPLANT
significantly outperforms benchmark imitation learning approaches on standard
control environments and excels at zero-shot generalization when subject to
challenging perturbations in test-time dynamics.]]></summary>

intelligence. It is often inefficient to conduct reasoning and inference
directly in the space of raw sensory representations, such as pixel values of
images. Representation learning allows us to automatically discover suitable
representations from raw sensory data. For example, given raw sensory data, a
deep neural network learns nonlinear representations at its hidden layers,
which are subsequently used for classification at its output layer. This
happens implicitly during training through minimizing a supervised or
unsupervised loss. In this paper, we study the dynamics of such implicit
nonlinear representation learning. We identify a pair of a new assumption and a
novel condition, called the common model structure assumption and the
data-architecture alignment condition. Under the common model structure
assumption, the data-architecture alignment condition is shown to be sufficient
for the global convergence and necessary for the global optimality. Moreover,
our theory explains how and when increasing the network size does and does not
improve the training behaviors in the practical regime. Our results provide
practical guidance for designing a model structure: e.g., the common model
structure assumption can be used as a justification for using a particular
model structure instead of others. We also derive a new training framework,
which satisfies the data-architecture alignment condition by automatically
modifying any given training algorithm. Given a standard training algorithm,
the framework running its modified version is empirically shown to maintain
competitive test performances while providing global convergence guarantees for
deep residual neural networks with convolutions, skip connections, and batch
normalization with datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Semeion,
KMNIST and SVHN.]]></summary>

represent the input data samples through a hierarchy of features, where the
size of the hierarchy is determined by the number of layers. In this paper, we
focus on enforcing the discriminative power of the high-level representations,
that are typically learned by the deeper layers (closer to the output). To this
end, we introduce a new loss term inspired by the Gini impurity, which is aimed
at minimizing the entropy (increasing the discriminative power) of individual
high-level features with respect to the class labels. Although our Gini loss
induces highly-discriminative features, it does not ensure that the
distribution of the high-level features matches the distribution of the
classes. As such, we introduce another loss term to minimize the
Kullback-Leibler divergence between the two distributions. We conduct
experiments on two image classification data sets (CIFAR-100 and Caltech 101),
considering multiple neural architectures ranging from convolutional networks
(ResNet-17, ResNet-18, ResNet-50) to transformers (CvT). Our empirical results

tool in solving tasks across various fields of application. The success of DNNs
is strongly connected to their high complexity in terms of the number of
network layers or of neurons in each layer, which severely complicates to
understand how DNNs solve their learned task. To improve the explainability of
DNNs, we adapt methods from neuroscience because this field has a rich
experience in analyzing complex and opaque systems. In this work, we draw
inspiration from how neuroscience uses topographic maps to visualize the
activity of the brain when it performs certain tasks. Transferring this
approach to DNNs can help to visualize and understand their internal processes
more intuitively, too. However, the inner structures of brains and DNNs differ
substantially. Therefore, to be able to visualize activations of neurons in
DNNs as topographic maps, we research techniques to layout the neurons in a
two-dimensional space in which neurons of similar activity are in the vicinity
of each other. In this work, we introduce and compare different methods to
obtain a topographic layout of the neurons in a network layer. Moreover, we
demonstrate how to use the resulting topographic activation maps to identify
errors or encoded biases in DNNs or data sets. Our novel visualization
technique improves the transparency of DNN-based algorithmic decision-making
systems and is accessible to a broad audience because topographic maps are
intuitive to interpret without expert-knowledge in Machine Learning.]]></summary>

prior biases about the environment it is exploring. Thus the robot assigns
equal importance to the goals which leads to insufficient exploration
efficiency. Alternative, often a hand-tuned policy is used to tweak the value
of goals. In this paper, we present a method to learn how "good" some states
are, measured by the state value function, to provide a hint for the robot to
make exploration decisions. We propose to learn state value functions from
previous offline collected datasets and then transfer and improve the value
function during testing in a new environment. Moreover, the environments
usually have very few and even no extrinsic reward or feedback for the robot.
Therefore in this work, we also tackle the problem of sparse extrinsic rewards
from the environments. We design several intrinsic rewards to encourage the
robot to obtain more information during exploration. These reward functions
then become the building blocks of the state value functions. We test our
method on challenging subterranean and urban environments. To the best of our
knowledge, this work for the first time demonstrates value function prediction
with previous collected datasets to help exploration in challenging
subterranean environments.]]></summary>

presence of covariate information along tensor modes. Our motivation comes from
online advertising where users click-through-rates (CTR) on ads over various
devices form a CTR tensor that has about 96% missing entries and has many zeros
on non-missing entries, which makes the standalone tensor completion method
unsatisfactory. Beside the CTR tensor, additional ad features or user
characteristics are often available. In this paper, we propose
Covariate-assisted Sparse Tensor Completion (COSTCO) to incorporate covariate
information for the recovery of the sparse tensor. The key idea is to jointly
extract latent components from both the tensor and the covariate matrix to
learn a synthetic representation. Theoretically, we derive the error bound for
the recovered tensor components and explicitly quantify the improvements on
both the reveal probability condition and the tensor recovery accuracy due to
covariates. Finally, we apply COSTCO to an advertisement dataset consisting of
a CTR tensor and ad covariate matrix, leading to 23% accuracy improvement over

machine learning models, hyperparameter tuning is becoming increasingly
expensive. However, after assessing 40 tuning methods systematically, we find
that each faces certain limitations. In particular, methods that speed up
tuning via knowledge transfer typically require the final performance of
hyperparameters and do not focus on low-fidelity information. As we demonstrate
empirically, this common practice is suboptimal and can incur an unnecessary
use of resources. It is more cost-efficient to instead leverage low-fidelity
tuning observations to measure inter-task similarity and transfer knowledge
from existing to new tasks accordingly. However, performing multi-fidelity
tuning comes with its own challenges in the transfer setting: the noise in
additional observations and the need for performance forecasting. Therefore, we
propose and conduct a thorough analysis of a multi-task multi-fidelity Bayesian
optimization framework, which leads to the best instantiation--amortized
auto-tuning (AT2). We further present an offline-computed 27-task

computer vision tasks despite large computation overhead against efficient
deployment. Structured (channel) pruning is usually applied to reduce the model
redundancy while preserving the network structure, such that the pruned network
can be easily deployed in practice. However, existing structured pruning
methods require hand-crafted rules which may lead to tremendous pruning space.
In this paper, we introduce Differentiable Annealing Indicator Search (DAIS)
that leverages the strength of neural architecture search in the channel
pruning and automatically searches for the effective pruned model with given
constraints on computation overhead. Specifically, DAIS relaxes the binarized
channel indicators to be continuous and then jointly learns both indicators and
model parameters via bi-level optimization. To bridge the non-negligible
discrepancy between the continuous model and the target binarized model, DAIS
proposes an annealing-based procedure to steer the indicator convergence
towards binarized states. Moreover, DAIS designs various regularizations based
on a priori structural knowledge to control the pruning sparsity and to improve
model performance. Experimental results show that DAIS outperforms

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A two-stage online dereverberation algorithm for hearing devices is presented
in this paper. The approach combines a multi-channel multi-frame linear
filtering approach with a single-channel single-frame post-filter. Both
components rely on power spectral density (PSD) estimates provided by deep
neural networks (DNNs). This contribution extends our prior work, which shows
that directly optimizing for a criterion at the output of the multi-channel
linear filtering stage results in a more efficient dereverberation, as compared
to placing the criterion at the output of the DNN to optimize the PSD
estimation. In the present work, we show that the dereverberation performance
of the proposed first stage particularly improves the early-to-mid
reverberation ratio if trained end-to-end. We thus argue that it can be
combined with a post-filtering stage which benefits from the early-to-mid ratio
improvement and is consequently able to efficiently suppress the residual late
reverberation. This proposed two stage procedure is shown to be both very
effective in terms of dereverberation performance and computational demands.
Furthermore, the proposed system can be adapted to the needs of different types
of hearing-device users by controlling the amount of reduction of early
reflections. The proposed system outperforms the previously proposed end-to-end
DNN-supported linear filtering algorithm, as well as other traditional
approaches, based on an evaluation using the noise-free version of the WHAMR!

the variables are both discrete and continuous. In engineering applications,
the objective function is typically calculated with a numerically costly
black-box simulation.General mixed and costly optimization problems are
therefore of a great practical interest, yet their resolution remains in a
large part an open scientific question. In this article, costly mixed problems
are approached through Gaussian processes where the discrete variables are
relaxed into continuous latent variables. The continuous space is more easily
harvested by classical Bayesian optimization techniques than a mixed space
would. Discrete variables are recovered either subsequently to the continuous
optimization, or simultaneously with an additional continuous-discrete
compatibility constraint that is handled with augmented Lagrangians. Several
possible implementations of such Bayesian mixed optimizers are compared. In
particular, the reformulation of the problem with continuous latent variables
is put in competition with searches working directly in the mixed space. Among
the algorithms involving latent variables and an augmented Lagrangian, a
particular attention is devoted to the Lagrange multipliers for which a local
and a global estimation techniques are studied. The comparisons are based on
the repeated optimization of three analytical functions and a beam design
problem.]]></summary>

concentrate on a subset of these concerning issues by prioritizing them
according to their contributions to motivational indices, e.g., the probability
of winning a game. This idea of concentration offers insights into
reinforcement learning of sophisticated Large-scale Multi-Agent Systems (LMAS)
participated by hundreds of agents. In such an LMAS, each agent receives a long
series of entity observations at each step, which can overwhelm existing
aggregation networks such as graph attention networks and cause inefficiency.
In this paper, we propose a concentration network called ConcNet. First,
ConcNet scores the observed entities considering several motivational indices,
e.g., expected survival time and state value of the agents, and then ranks,
prunes, and aggregates the encodings of observed entities to extract features.
Second, distinct from the well-known attention mechanism, ConcNet has a unique
motivational subnetwork to explicitly consider the motivational indices when
scoring the observed entities. Furthermore, we present a concentration policy
gradient architecture that can learn effective policies in LMAS from scratch.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the presented architecture has excellent
scalability and flexibility, and significantly outperforms existing methods on
LMAS benchmarks.]]></summary>

generative models for weakly-supervised data. Yet, despite their advantage of
weak supervision, they exhibit a gap in generative quality compared to unimodal
VAEs, which are completely unsupervised. In an attempt to explain this gap, we
uncover a fundamental limitation that applies to a large family of
mixture-based multimodal VAEs. We prove that the sub-sampling of modalities
enforces an undesirable upper bound on the multimodal ELBO and thereby limits
the generative quality of the respective models. Empirically, we showcase the
generative quality gap on both synthetic and real data and present the
tradeoffs between different variants of multimodal VAEs. We find that none of
the existing approaches fulfills all desired criteria of an effective
multimodal generative model when applied on more complex datasets than those
used in previous benchmarks. In summary, we identify, formalize, and validate
fundamental limitations of VAE-based approaches for modeling weakly-supervised
data and discuss implications for real-world applications.]]></summary>

then train a calibrator to predict the likelihood of correctness of the model's

Duplicate Detection (DD) tasks and evaluate it in both In-Domain (IID) and
Out-of-Domain (OOD) settings. In (IID, OOD) settings, we show that the

techniques such as data augmentation methods, which generate training samples
that increase the diversity of data and richness of label information. A
popular recent method, mixup, uses convex combinations of pairs of original
samples to generate new samples. However, as we show in our experiments, mixup
can produce undesirable synthetic samples, where the data is sampled off the
manifold and can contain incorrect labels. We propose $\zeta$-mixup, a
generalization of mixup with provably and demonstrably desirable properties
that allows convex combinations of $N \geq 2$ samples, leading to more
realistic and diverse outputs that incorporate information from $N$ original
samples by using a $p$-series interpolant. We show that, compared to mixup,
$\zeta$-mixup better preserves the intrinsic dimensionality of the original
datasets, which is a desirable property for training generalizable models.
Furthermore, we show that our implementation of $\zeta$-mixup is faster than
mixup, and extensive evaluation on controlled synthetic and 24 real-world
natural and medical image classification datasets shows that $\zeta$-mixup
outperforms mixup and traditional data augmentation techniques.]]></summary>

planet with unprecedented accuracy. Radiative transfer models (RTMs) encode the
energy transfer through the atmosphere, and are used to model and understand

performing inference over such simulators is a challenging problem. RTMs are
nonlinear, non-differentiable and computationally costly codes, which adds a
high level of difficulty in inference. In this paper, we introduce two
computational techniques to infer not only point estimates of biophysical
parameters but also their joint distribution. One of them is based on a
variational autoencoder approach and the second one is based on a Monte Carlo
Expectation Maximization (MCEM) scheme. We compare and discuss benefits and

the past decade in Anglo-European research institutions as an attempt to bring
together a critique of the power dynamics that underlie accelerating trends of
datafication with a normative commitment to the principles of social justice-a
commitment to the achievement of a society that is equitable, fair, and capable
of confronting the root causes of injustice.However, despite the seeming
novelty of such a data justice pedigree, this joining up of the critique of the
power imbalances that have shaped the digital and "big data" revolutions with a
commitment to social equity and constructive societal transformation has a
deeper historical, and more geographically diverse, provenance. As the stories
of the data justice initiatives, activism, and advocacy contained in this
volume well evidence, practices of data justice across the globe have, in fact,
largely preceded the elaboration and crystallisation of the idea of data
justice in contemporary academic discourse. In telling these data justice
stories, we hope to provide the reader with two interdependent tools of data
justice thinking: First, we aim to provide the reader with the critical
leverage needed to discern those distortions and malformations of data justice
that manifest in subtle and explicit forms of power, domination, and coercion.
Second, we aim to provide the reader with access to the historically effective
forms of normativity and ethical insight that have been marshalled by data
justice activists and advocates as tools of societal transformation-so that
these forms of normativity and insight can be drawn on, in turn, as
constructive resources to spur future transformative data justice practices.]]></summary>

reference productions from the environment. Early in speech acquisition,
children make articulatory adjustments to match their caregivers' speech.
Grownup learners of a language tweak their speech to match the tutor reference.
This paper proposes a method to synthetically generate correct pronunciation
feedback given incorrect production. Furthermore, our aim is to generate the
corrected production while maintaining the speaker's original voice.

The system prompts the user to pronounce a phrase. The speech is recorded,
and the samples associated with the inaccurate phoneme are masked with zeros.
This waveform serves as an input to a speech generator, implemented as a deep
learning inpainting system with a U-net architecture, and trained to output a
reconstructed speech. The training set is composed of unimpaired proper speech
examples, and the generator is trained to reconstruct the original proper
speech. We evaluated the performance of our system on phoneme replacement of
minimal pair words of English as well as on children with pronunciation
disorders. Results suggest that human listeners slightly prefer our generated

transformer-based Natural Language Processing models. This attention mechanism
calculates a correlation score for each word with respect to the other words in
a sentence. Commonly, only a small subset of words highly correlates with the
word under attention, which is only determined at runtime. As such, a
significant amount of computation is inconsequential due to low attention
scores and can potentially be pruned. The main challenge is finding the
threshold for the scores below which subsequent computation will be
inconsequential. Although such a threshold is discrete, this paper formulates
its search through a soft differentiable regularizer integrated into the loss
function of the training. This formulation piggy backs on the back-propagation
training to analytically co-optimize the threshold and the weights
simultaneously, striking a formally optimal balance between accuracy and
computation pruning. To best utilize this mathematical innovation, we devise a
bit-serial architecture, dubbed LeOPArd, for transformer language models with
bit-level early termination microarchitectural mechanism. We evaluate our
design across 43 back-end tasks for MemN2N, BERT, ALBERT, GPT-2, and Vision
transformer models. Post-layout results show that, on average, LeOPArd yields
1.9x and 3.9x speedup and energy reduction, respectively, while keeping the
average accuracy virtually intact (<0.2% degradation)]]></summary>

semantic segmentation. In spite of this, a model trained on source domain often
fails to work properly in new challenging domains, that is directly concerned
with the generalization capability of the model. In this paper, we present a
novel memory-guided domain generalization method for semantic segmentation
based on meta-learning framework. Especially, our method abstracts the
conceptual knowledge of semantic classes into categorical memory which is
constant beyond the domains. Upon the meta-learning concept, we repeatedly
train memory-guided networks and simulate virtual test to 1) learn how to
memorize a domain-agnostic and distinct information of classes and 2) offer an
externally settled memory as a class-guidance to reduce the ambiguity of
representation in the test data of arbitrary unseen domain. To this end, we
also propose memory divergence and feature cohesion losses, which encourage to
learn memory reading and update processes for category-aware domain
generalization. Extensive experiments for semantic segmentation demonstrate the
superior generalization capability of our method over state-of-the-art works on
various benchmarks.]]></summary>

data and have achieved significant progress in graph analysis tasks (e.g., node
classification) in recent years. However, similar to other deep neural networks
like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs),
GNNs behave like a black box with their details hidden from model developers
and users. It is therefore difficult to diagnose possible errors of GNNs.
Despite many visual analytics studies being done on CNNs and RNNs, little
research has addressed the challenges for GNNs. This paper fills the research
gap with an interactive visual analysis tool, GNNLens, to assist model
developers and users in understanding and analyzing GNNs. Specifically,
Parallel Sets View and Projection View enable users to quickly identify and
validate error patterns in the set of wrong predictions; Graph View and Feature
Matrix View offer a detailed analysis of individual nodes to assist users in
forming hypotheses about the error patterns. Since GNNs jointly model the graph
structure and the node features, we reveal the relative influences of the two
types of information by comparing the predictions of three models: GNN,
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and GNN Without Using Features (GNNWUF). Two case
studies and interviews with domain experts demonstrate the effectiveness of
GNNLens in facilitating the understanding of GNN models and their errors.]]></summary>

machine learning which can be used to reduce the feature dimension without
deteriorating model's performance. Since obtaining annotated data is laborious
or even infeasible in many cases, unsupervised feature selection is more
practical in reality. Though lots of methods for unsupervised feature selection
have been proposed, these methods select features independently, thus it is no
guarantee that the group of selected features is optimal. What's more, the
number of selected features must be tuned carefully to obtain a satisfactory
result. To tackle these problems, we propose a joint adaptive graph and
structured sparsity regularization unsupervised feature selection (JASFS)
method in this paper, in which a $l_{2,0}$-norm regularization term with
respect to transformation matrix is imposed in the manifold learning for
feature selection, and a graph regularization term is incorporated into the
learning model to learn the local geometric structure of data adaptively. An
efficient and simple iterative algorithm is designed to solve the proposed
optimization problem with the analysis of computational complexity. After
optimized, a subset of optimal features will be selected in group, and the
number of selected features will be determined automatically. Experimental
results on eight benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed method compared with several state-of-the-art approaches.]]></summary>

a given design as input they compute an output representing system behavior.
Blackboxes are intended to be run in the forward direction. This paper presents
a new method of solving the inverse design problem namely, given requirements
or constraints on output, find an input that also optimizes an objective
function. This problem is challenging for several reasons. First, blackboxes
are not designed to be run in reverse. Second, inputs and outputs can be
discrete and continuous. Third, finding designs concurrently satisfying a set
of requirements is hard because designs satisfying individual requirements may
conflict with each other. Fourth, blackbox evaluations can be expensive.
Finally, blackboxes can sometimes fail to produce an output. This paper
presents CNMA, a new method of solving the inverse problem that overcomes these
challenges. CNMA tries to sample only the part of the design space relevant to
solving the problem, leveraging the power of neural networks, Mixed Integer
Linear Programs, and a new learning-from-failure feedback loop. The paper also
presents a parallel version of CNMA that improves the efficiency and quality of
solutions over the sequential version, and tries to steer it away from local
optima. CNMA's performance is evaluated against conventional optimization
methods for seven nonlinear design problems of 8 (two problems), 10, 15, 36 and
60 real-valued dimensions and one with 186 binary dimensions. Conventional
methods evaluated are off-the-shelf implementations of Bayesian Optimization
with Gaussian Processes, Nelder Mead and Random Search. The first two do not
solve problems that are high-dimensional, have discrete and continuous
variables or whose blackboxes can fail to return values. CNMA solves all
problems, and surpasses the performance of conventional methods by up to 87%.]]></summary>

decomposition of matrices and tensors using deep generative networks. We
decompose a tensor as the product of low-rank tensor factors (e.g., a matrix as
the outer product of two vectors), where each low-rank tensor is generated by a
deep network (DN) that is trained in a self-supervised manner to minimize the
mean-squared approximation error. Our key observation is that the implicit
regularization inherent in DNs enables them to capture nonlinear signal
structures (e.g., manifolds) that are out of the reach of classical linear
methods like the singular value decomposition (SVD) and principal component
analysis (PCA). Furthermore, in contrast to the SVD and PCA, whose performance
deteriorates when the tensor's entries deviate from additive white Gaussian
noise, we demonstrate that the performance of DeepTensor is robust to a wide
range of distributions. We validate that DeepTensor is a robust and
computationally efficient drop-in replacement for the SVD, PCA, nonnegative
matrix factorization (NMF), and similar decompositions by exploring a range of
real-world applications, including hyperspectral image denoising, 3D MRI
tomography, and image classification. In particular, DeepTensor offers a 6dB
signal-to-noise ratio improvement over standard denoising methods for signals
corrupted by Poisson noise and learns to decompose 3D tensors 60 times faster

environments is critical to the development of hearing aid (HA) devices. For
this, it is important to derive a metric that can fairly predict speech
intelligibility for HA users. A straightforward approach is to conduct a
subjective listening test and use the test results as an evaluation metric.
However, conducting large-scale listening tests is time-consuming and
expensive. Therefore, several evaluation metrics were derived as surrogates for
subjective listening test results. In this study, we propose a multi-branched
speech intelligibility prediction model (MBI-Net), for predicting the
subjective intelligibility scores of HA users. MBI-Net consists of two branches
of models, with each branch consisting of a hearing loss model, a cross-domain
feature extraction module, and a speech intelligibility prediction model, to
process speech signals from one channel. The outputs of the two branches are
fused through a linear layer to obtain predicted speech intelligibility scores.
Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of MBI-Net, which produces
higher prediction scores than the baseline system in Track 1 and Track 2 on the

to be useful for many areas of software engineering (e.g., requirement

extensive efforts to manually curate a labeled dataset. When the classification
purpose changes (e.g. identifying bugs versus usability issues or sentiment),
new datasets should be labeled, which prevents the extensibility of the
developed models for new desired classes/tasks in practice. Recent pre-trained
neural language models (PTM) are trained on large corpora in an unsupervised
manner and have found success in solving similar Natural Language Processing
problems. However, the applicability of PTMs is not explored for app review
classification Objective: We investigate the benefits of PTMs for app review
classification compared to the existing models, as well as the transferability
of PTMs in multiple settings. Method: We empirically study the accuracy and
time efficiency of PTMs compared to prior approaches using six datasets from
literature. In addition, we investigate the performance of the PTMs trained on
app reviews (i.e. domain-specific PTMs) . We set up different studies to
evaluate PTMs in multiple settings: binary vs. multi-class classification,
zero-shot classification (when new labels are introduced to the model),
multi-task setting, and classification of reviews from different resources. The
datasets are manually labeled app review datasets from Google Play Store, Apple
App Store, and Twitter data. In all cases, Micro and Macro Precision, Recall,

privacy. In this problem, we are given a universe $U$ of items, possibly of
infinite size, and a database $D$ of users. Each user $i$ contributes a subset
$W_i \subseteq U$ of items. We want an ($\epsilon$,$\delta$)-differentially
private algorithm which outputs a subset $S \subset \cup_i W_i$ such that the
size of $S$ is as large as possible. The problem arises in countless real world
applications; it is particularly ubiquitous in natural language processing
(NLP) applications as vocabulary extraction. For example, discovering words,
sentences, $n$-grams etc., from private text data belonging to users is an
instance of the set union problem.

Known algorithms for this problem proceed by collecting a subset of items
from each user, taking the union of such subsets, and disclosing the items
whose noisy counts fall above a certain threshold. Crucially, in the above
process, the contribution of each individual user is always independent of the
items held by other users, resulting in a wasteful aggregation process, where
some item counts happen to be way above the threshold. We deviate from the
above paradigm by allowing users to contribute their items in a
$\textit{dependent fashion}$, guided by a $\textit{policy}$. In this new
setting ensuring privacy is significantly delicate. We prove that any policy

their quadratically growing complexity with respect to the input sequence
length impedes their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. We
address this challenge by proposing a dynamic pruning method, which exploits
the temporal stability of data across tokens to reduce inference cost. The
threshold-based method only retains significant differences between the
subsequent tokens, effectively reducing the number of multiply-accumulates, as
well as the internal tensor data sizes. The approach is evaluated on the Google
Speech Commands Dataset for keyword spotting, and the performance is compared
against the baseline Keyword Transformer. Our experiments show that we can
reduce ~80% of operations while maintaining the original 98.4% accuracy.
Moreover, a reduction of ~87-94% operations can be achieved when only degrading
the accuracy by 1-4%, speeding up the multi-head self-attention inference by a
factor of ~7.5-16.]]></summary>

strongly (resp., general) convex regularizers using different sampling schemes,
where $\epsilon$ denote the target accuracy. We further show that the
complexity for computing the gradients of these regularizers, if necessary, can
be bounded by ${\cal O}\{(\log_\gamma \epsilon) [(1-\gamma)L/\mu]^{1/2}\log

adolescence or early adulthood. It reduces the life expectancy of patients by
15 years. Abnormal behavior, perception of emotions, social relationships, and
reality perception are among its most significant symptoms. Past studies have
revealed the temporal and anterior lobes of hippocampus regions of brain get
affected by SZ. Also, increased volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and
decreased volume of white and gray matter can be observed due to this disease.
The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the popular neuroimaging technique used
to explore structural/functional brain abnormalities in SZ disorder owing to
its high spatial resolution. Various artificial intelligence (AI) techniques
have been employed with advanced image/signal processing methods to obtain
accurate diagnosis of SZ. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of
studies conducted on automated diagnosis of SZ using MRI modalities. Main
findings, various challenges, and future works in developing the automated SZ
detection are described in this paper.]]></summary>

human-annotated image-label data or language-image contrastive learning with
webly-crawled image-text pairs. While supervised learning may result in a more
discriminative representation, language-image pretraining shows unprecedented
zero-shot recognition capability, largely due to the different properties of
data sources and learning objectives. In this work, we introduce a new
formulation by combining the two data sources into a common image-text-label
space. In this space, we propose a new learning paradigm, called Unified
Contrastive Learning (UniCL) with a single learning objective to seamlessly
prompt the synergy of two data types. Extensive experiments show that our UniCL
is an effective way of learning semantically rich yet discriminative
representations, universally for image recognition in zero-shot, linear-probe,
fully finetuning and transfer learning scenarios. Particularly, it attains
gains up to 9.2% and 14.5% in average on zero-shot recognition benchmarks over
the language-image contrastive learning and supervised learning methods,
respectively. In linear probe setting, it also boosts the performance over the
two methods by 7.3% and 3.4%, respectively. Our study also indicates that UniCL
stand-alone is a good learner on pure image-label data, rivaling the supervised
learning methods across three image classification datasets and two types of
vision backbones, ResNet and Swin Transformer. Code is available at

variability much inferior to that obtained from three trained evaluators.
Moreover, the proposed solution led to results which are very close to those
obtained using a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented by transfer

Also, we theoretically analyze the method for Gaussian data and provide a bound

matrices that have shared rows and/or columns. For example, cancer studies that
integrate multiple omics platforms across multiple types of cancer, pan-omics
pan-cancer analysis, have extended our knowledge of molecular heterogenity
beyond what was observed in single tumor and single platform studies. However,
these studies have been limited by available statistical methodology. We
propose a flexible approach to the simultaneous factorization and decomposition
of variation across such bidimensionally linked matrices, BIDIFAC+. This
decomposes variation into a series of low-rank components that may be shared
across any number of row sets (e.g., omics platforms) or column sets (e.g.,
cancer types). This builds on a growing literature for the factorization and
decomposition of linked matrices, which has primarily focused on multiple
matrices that are linked in one dimension (rows or columns) only. Our objective
function extends nuclear norm penalization, is motivated by random matrix
theory, gives an identifiable decomposition under relatively mild conditions,
and can be shown to give the mode of a Bayesian posterior distribution. We
apply BIDIFAC+ to pan-omics pan-cancer data from TCGA, identifying shared and

diverse set of tasks, from a given task distribution, to generalize to unseen
tasks, from the same distribution, with a limited amount of labeled data. The
underlying requirement for effective few-shot generalization is to learn a good
representation of the task manifold. One way to encourage this is to preserve
local neighborhoods in the feature space learned by the few-shot learner. To
this end, we introduce the notion of interval bounds from the provably robust
training literature to few-shot learning. The interval bounds are used to
characterize neighborhoods around the training tasks. These neighborhoods can
then be preserved by minimizing the distance between a task and its respective
bounds. We further introduce a novel strategy to artificially form new tasks
for training by interpolating between the available tasks and their respective
interval bounds, to aid in cases with a scarcity of tasks. We apply our
framework to both model-agnostic meta-learning as well as prototype-based
metric-learning paradigms. The efficacy of our proposed approach is evident
from the improved performance on several datasets from diverse domains in

life. Previously, stress levels were determined by speaking with people and
gaining insight into what they had experienced recently or in the past.
Typically, stress is caused by an incidence that occurred a long time ago, but
sometimes it is triggered by unknown factors. This is a challenging and complex
task, but recent research advances have provided numerous opportunities to
automate it. The fundamental features of most of these techniques are electro
dermal activity (EDA) and heart rate values (HRV). We utilized an accelerometer
to measure body motions to solve this challenge. The proposed novel method
employs a test that measures a subject's electrocardiogram (ECG), galvanic skin
values (GSV), HRV values, and body movements in order to provide a low-cost and
time-saving solution for detecting stress lifestyle disease in modern times
using cyber physical systems. This study provides a new hybrid model for
lifestyle disease classification that decreases execution time while picking
the best collection of characteristics and increases classification accuracy.
The developed approach is capable of dealing with the class imbalance problem
by using WESAD (wearable stress and affect dataset) dataset. The new model uses
the Grid search (GS) method to select an optimized set of hyper parameters, and

elimination (CoC-RFE) method for optimal feature selection and gradient
boosting as an estimator to classify the dataset, which achieves high accuracy
and helps to provide smart, accurate, and high-quality healthcare systems. To
demonstrate the validity and utility of the proposed methodology, its

increasingly complex and hence the underlying system dynamics are often unknown
or difficult to characterize. Finding a good network control policy is of
significant importance to achieve desirable network performance (e.g., high
throughput or low delay). In this work, we consider using model-based
reinforcement learning (RL) to learn the optimal control policy for queueing
networks so that the average job delay (or equivalently the average queue
backlog) is minimized. Traditional approaches in RL, however, cannot handle the
unbounded state spaces of the network control problem. To overcome this
difficulty, we propose a new algorithm, called Reinforcement Learning for
Queueing Networks (RL-QN), which applies model-based RL methods over a finite
subset of the state space, while applying a known stabilizing policy for the
rest of the states. We establish that the average queue backlog under RL-QN
with an appropriately constructed subset can be arbitrarily close to the
optimal result. We evaluate RL-QN in dynamic server allocation, routing and
switching problems. Simulation results show that RL-QN minimizes the average
queue backlog effectively.]]></summary>

implied that language models (LMs) can be treated as knowledge bases. To this
end, this phenomena has been effective especially when these LMs are fine-tuned
towards not just data of a specific domain, but also to the style or linguistic
pattern of the prompts themselves. We observe that, satisfying a particular
linguistic pattern in prompts is an unsustainable constraint that unnecessarily
lengthens the probing task, especially because, they are often manually
designed and the range of possible prompt template patterns can vary depending
on the prompting objective and domain. We therefore explore an idea of using a
position-attention mechanism to capture positional information of each word in
a prompt relative to the mask to be filled, hence avoiding the need to
re-construct prompts when the prompts linguistic pattern changes. Using our
approach, we demonstrate the ability of eliciting answers to rare prompt
templates (in a case study on health outcome generation) such as Postfix and
Mixed patterns whose missing information is respectively at the start and in
multiple random places of the prompt. More so, using various biomedical PLMs,
our approach consistently outperforms a baseline in which the default mask
language model (MLM) representation is used to predict masked tokens.]]></summary>

learning models over distributed edge devices, which attracts sustained
attention and has been extensively studied. However, the heterogeneity of
client data severely degrades the performance of FL compared with that in
centralized training. It causes the locally trained models of clients to move
in different directions. On the one hand, it slows down or even stalls the
global updates, leading to inefficient communication. On the other hand, it
enlarges the distances between local models, resulting in an aggregated global
model with poor performance. Fortunately, these shortcomings can be mitigated
by reducing the angle between the directions that local models move in. Based
on this fact, we propose FedCos, which reduces the directional inconsistency of
local models by introducing a cosine-similarity penalty. It promotes the local
model iterations towards an auxiliary global direction. Moreover, our approach
is auto-adapt to various non-IID settings without an elaborate selection of
hyperparameters. The experimental results show that FedCos outperforms the
well-known baselines and can enhance them under a variety of FL scenes,
including varying degrees of data heterogeneity, different number of
participants, and cross-silo and cross-device settings. Besides, FedCos
improves communication efficiency by 2 to 5 times. With the help of FedCos,
multiple FL methods require significantly fewer communication rounds than
before to obtain a model with comparable performance.]]></summary>

on evaluation is based on the idea of statistical model criticism, popular in
Bayesian data analysis, whereby a statistical model is evaluated in terms of
its ability to reproduce statistics of an unknown data generating process from
which we can obtain samples. A VAE learns not one, but two joint distributions
over a shared sample space, each exploiting a choice of factorisation that
makes sampling tractable in one of two directions (latent-to-data,
data-to-latent). We evaluate samples from these distributions, assessing their
(marginal) fit to the observed data and our choice of prior, and we also
evaluate samples through a pipeline that connects the two distributions
starting from a data sample, assessing whether together they exploit and reveal
latent factors of variation that are useful to a practitioner. We show that
this methodology offers possibilities for model selection qualitatively beyond
intrinsic evaluation metrics and at a finer granularity than commonly used
statistics can offer.]]></summary>

low-dimensional subspace. Engineering applications for modeling,
characterization, design, and control of such large-scale systems often rely on
dimensionality reduction to make solutions computationally tractable in
real-time. Common existing paradigms for dimensionality reduction include
linear methods, such as the singular value decomposition (SVD), and nonlinear
methods, such as variants of convolutional autoencoders (CAE). However, these
encoding techniques lack the ability to efficiently represent the complexity
associated with spatio-temporal data, which often requires variable geometry,
non-uniform grid resolution, adaptive meshing, and/or parametric
dependencies.To resolve these practical engineering challenges, we propose a
general framework called Neural Implicit Flow (NIF) that enables a
mesh-agnostic, low-rank representation of large-scale, parametric,
spatial-temporal data. NIF consists of two modified multilayer perceptrons
(MLPs): (i) ShapeNet, which isolates and represents the spatial complexity, and
(ii) ParameterNet, which accounts for any other input complexity, including
parametric dependencies, time, and sensor measurements. We demonstrate the
utility of NIF for parametric surrogate modeling, enabling the interpretable
representation and compression of complex spatio-temporal dynamics, efficient
many-spatial-query tasks, and improved generalization performance for sparse

expert-oriented task to an automatic seamless routine. Since USI accepts any
backbone and trains it to top results, it also enables to perform methodical
comparisons, and identify the most efficient backbones along the speed-accuracy
Pareto curve. Implementation is available

limited amount of foresight. Ewerton et al. attain their best performance using
an agent which only takes the most immediate action under consideration. We are
interested in the ability of their models and training algorithms to accurately
predict long-term Q-Values. To evaluate this ability, we design a new bin

estimate future rewards and therefore use high discount factors in their
Q-Value calculation. We investigate the behaviour of an adaptation of the VPG

identified by Ewerton et al., it suffers from the known Deep Q-Learning problem
of overestimated Q-Values. In an effort to solve our task, we turn to the
Hourglass models and combine them with the Double Q-Learning approach. We show
that this approach enables the models to accurately predict long-term action
sequences when trained with large discount factors. Our results show that the
Double Q-Learning technique is essential for training with very high discount

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The appearance of complex attention-based language models such as BERT,
Roberta or GPT-3 has allowed to address highly complex tasks in a plethora of
scenarios. However, when applied to specific domains, these models encounter
considerable difficulties. This is the case of Social Networks such as Twitter,
an ever-changing stream of information written with informal and complex
language, where each message requires careful evaluation to be understood even
by humans given the important role that context plays. Addressing tasks in this
domain through Natural Language Processing involves severe challenges. When
powerful state-of-the-art multilingual language models are applied to this
scenario, language specific nuances use to get lost in translation. To face
these challenges we present \textbf{BERTuit}, the larger transformer proposed
so far for Spanish language, pre-trained on a massive dataset of 230M Spanish
tweets using RoBERTa optimization. Our motivation is to provide a powerful
resource to better understand Spanish Twitter and to be used on applications
focused on this social network, with special emphasis on solutions devoted to
tackle the spreading of misinformation in this platform. BERTuit is evaluated
on several tasks and compared against M-BERT, XLM-RoBERTa and XLM-T, very
competitive multilingual transformers. The utility of our approach is shown
with applications, in this case: a zero-shot methodology to visualize groups of
hoaxes and profiling authors spreading disinformation.

Misinformation spreads wildly on platforms such as Twitter in languages other
than English, meaning performance of transformers may suffer when transferred
outside English speaking communities.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Various neural network models have been proposed to tackle combinatorial
optimization problems such as the travelling salesman problem (TSP). Existing
learning-based TSP methods adopt a simple setting that the training and testing
data are independent and identically distributed. However, the existing
literature fails to solve TSP instances when training and testing data have
different distributions. Concretely, we find that different training and
testing distribution will result in more difficult TSP instances, i.e., the
solution obtained by the model has a large gap from the optimal solution. To
tackle this problem, in this work, we study learning-based TSP methods when
training and testing data have different distributions using adaptive-hardness,
i.e., how difficult a TSP instance can be for a solver. This problem is
challenging because it is non-trivial to (1) define hardness measurement
quantitatively; (2) efficiently and continuously generate sufficiently hard TSP
instances upon model training; (3) fully utilize instances with different
levels of hardness to learn a more powerful TSP solver. To solve these
challenges, we first propose a principled hardness measurement to quantify the
hardness of TSP instances. Then, we propose a hardness-adaptive generator to
generate instances with different hardness. We further propose a curriculum
learner fully utilizing these instances to train the TSP solver. Experiments
show that our hardness-adaptive generator can generate instances ten times
harder than the existing methods, and our proposed method achieves significant
improvement over state-of-the-art models in terms of the optimality gap.]]></summary>

and the recently proposed notion of Distributional Generalization (DG).
Applying this connection, we introduce new conceptual tools for designing
deep-learning methods that bypass "pathologies" of standard stochastic gradient
descent (SGD). First, we prove that differentially private methods satisfy a
"What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG)" generalization guarantee: whatever a
model does on its train data is almost exactly what it will do at test time.
This guarantee is formally captured by distributional generalization. WYSIWYG
enables principled algorithm design in deep learning by reducing
$\textit{generalization}$ concerns to $\textit{optimization}$ ones: in order to
mitigate unwanted behavior at test time, it is provably sufficient to mitigate
this behavior on the train data. This is notably false for standard (non-DP)
methods, hence this observation has applications even when privacy is not
required. For example, importance sampling is known to fail for standard SGD,
but we show that it has exactly the intended effect for DP-trained models.
Thus, with DP-SGD, unlike with SGD, we can influence test-time behavior by
making principled train-time interventions. We use these insights to construct
simple algorithms which match or outperform SOTA in several distributional
robustness applications, and to significantly improve the privacy vs. disparate
impact trade-off of DP-SGD. Finally, we also improve on known theoretical
bounds relating differential privacy, stability, and distributional
generalization.]]></summary>

machine learning algorithms have been widely applied in high-dimensional
dynamical systems to improve the algorithmic efficiency. In this paper, we
develop a system which combines reduced-order surrogate models with a novel
data assimilation (DA) technique used to incorporate real-time observations
from different physical spaces. We make use of local smooth surrogate functions
which link the space of encoded system variables and the one of current
observations to perform variational DA with a low computational cost. The new
system, named Generalised Latent Assimilation can benefit both the efficiency
provided by the reduced-order modelling and the accuracy of data assimilation.
A theoretical analysis of the difference between surrogate and original
assimilation cost function is also provided in this paper where an upper bound,
depending on the size of the local training set, is given. The new approach is
tested on a high-dimensional CFD application of a two-phase liquid flow with
non-linear observation operators that current Latent Assimilation methods can
not handle. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed assimilation
approach can significantly improve the reconstruction and prediction accuracy
of the deep learning surrogate model which is nearly 1000 times faster than the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[High-contrast imaging of exoplanets hinges on powerful post-processing
methods to denoise the data and separate the signal of a companion from its
host star, which is typically orders of magnitude brighter. Existing
post-processing algorithms do not use all prior domain knowledge that is
available about the problem. We propose a new method that builds on our
understanding of the systematic noise and the causal structure of the
data-generating process. Our algorithm is based on a modified version of
half-sibling regression (HSR), a flexible denoising framework that combines
ideas from the fields of machine learning and causality. We adapt the method to
address the specific requirements of high-contrast exoplanet imaging data
obtained in pupil tracking mode. The key idea is to estimate the systematic
noise in a pixel by regressing the time series of this pixel onto a set of
causally independent, signal-free predictor pixels. We use regularized linear
models in this work; however, other (non-linear) models are also possible. In a
second step, we demonstrate how the HSR framework allows us to incorporate
observing conditions such as wind speed or air temperature as additional
predictors. When we apply our method to four data sets from the VLT/NACO
instrument, our algorithm provides a better false-positive fraction than
PCA-based PSF subtraction, a popular baseline method in the field.
Additionally, we find that the HSR-based method provides direct and accurate
estimates for the contrast of the exoplanets without the need to insert
artificial companions for calibration in the data sets. Finally, we present
first evidence that using the observing conditions as additional predictors can
improve the results. Our HSR-based method provides an alternative, flexible and
promising approach to the challenge of modeling and subtracting the stellar PSF
and systematic noise in exoplanet imaging data.]]></summary>

existing approaches cannot be applied to time-series forecasting because i)
multivariate time-series datasets have different channels and ii) forecasting
is principally different from classification. In this paper we formalize the

data from a similar but different domain than the data it has initially been
trained on. To mitigate this domain shift problem, domain adaptation (DA)
techniques search for an optimal transformation that converts the (current)
input data from a source domain to a target domain to learn a domain-invariant
representations that reduces domain discrepancy.

This paper proposes a novel supervised domain adaptation based on two steps.
First, we search for an optimal class-dependent transformation from the source
to the target domain from a few samples. We consider optimal transport methods
such as the earth mover distance with Laplacian regularization, Sinkhorn
transport and correlation alignment. Second, we use embedding similarity
techniques to select the corresponding transformation at inference. We use
correlation metrics and maximum mean discrepancy with higher-order moment
matching techniques. We conduct an extensive evaluation on time-series datasets
with domain shift including simulated and various online handwriting datasets
to demonstrate the performance.]]></summary>

devices are of great interest in IoT applications, as they can reduce network
pressure and response latency, and improve privacy. An effective way to obtain
energy-efficiency with small accuracy drops is to sequentially execute a set of
increasingly complex models, early-stopping the procedure for "easy" inputs
that can be confidently classified by the smallest models. As a stopping
criterion, current methods employ a single threshold on the output
probabilities produced by each model. In this work, we show that such a
criterion is sub-optimal for datasets that include classes of different
complexity, and we demonstrate a more general approach based on per-classes
thresholds. With experiments on a low-power end-node, we show that our method
can significantly reduce the energy consumption compared to the
single-threshold approach.]]></summary>

range of NLP tasks. Despite their SoTA results, there is practical evidence
that these models may require a different number of computing layers for
different input sequences, since evaluating all layers leads to overconfidence
on wrong predictions (namely overthinking). This problem can potentially be
solved by implementing adaptive computation time approaches, which were first
designed to improve inference speed. Recently proposed PonderNet may be a
promising solution for performing an early exit by treating the exit layers
index as a latent variable. However, the originally proposed exit criterion,
relying on sampling from trained posterior distribution on the probability of
exiting from i-th layer, introduces major variance in model outputs,
significantly reducing the resulting models performance. In this paper, we
propose Ponder ALBERT (PALBERT): an improvement to PonderNet with a novel
deterministic Q-exit criterion and a revisited model architecture. We compared
PALBERT with recent methods for performing an early exit. We observed that the
proposed changes can be considered significant improvements on the original
PonderNet architecture and outperform PABEE on a wide range of GLUE tasks. In
addition, we also performed an in-depth ablation study of the proposed
architecture to further understand Lambda layers and their performance.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nowadays, deep neural networks are being used in many domains because of
their high accuracy results. However, they are considered as "black box", means
that they are not explainable for humans. On the other hand, in some tasks such
as medical, economic, and self-driving cars, users want the model to be
interpretable to decide if they can trust these results or not. In this work,
we present a modified version of an autoencoder-based approach for local
interpretability called ALIME. The ALIME itself is inspired by a famous method
called Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME). LIME generates a
single instance level explanation by generating new data around the instance
and training a local linear interpretable model. ALIME uses an autoencoder to
weigh the new data around the sample. Nevertheless, the ALIME uses a linear
model as the interpretable model to be trained locally, just like the LIME.
This work proposes a new approach, which uses a decision tree instead of the
linear model, as the interpretable model. We evaluate the proposed model in
case of stability, local fidelity, and interpretability on different datasets.
Compared to ALIME, the experiments show significant results on stability and
local fidelity and improved results on interpretability.]]></summary>

1 diabetes (T1D). These devices usually utilise simple control algorithms to
select the optimal insulin dose for maintaining blood glucose levels within a
healthy range. Online reinforcement learning (RL) has been utilised as a method
for further enhancing glucose control in these devices. Previous approaches
have been shown to reduce patient risk and improve time spent in the target
range when compared to classical control algorithms, but are prone to
instability in the learning process, often resulting in the selection of unsafe
actions. This work presents an evaluation of offline RL as a means for
developing clinically effective dosing policies without the need for patient
interaction. This paper examines the utility of BCQ, CQL and TD3-BC in managing
the blood glucose of nine virtual patients within the UVA/Padova glucose
dynamics simulator. When trained on less than a tenth of the data required by
online RL approaches, this work shows that offline RL can significantly
increase time in the healthy blood glucose range when compared to the strongest
state-of-art baseline. This is achieved without any associated increase in low
blood glucose events. Offline RL is also shown to be able to correct for common

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unsupervised Source (data) Free domain adaptation (USFDA) aims to transfer
knowledge from a well-trained source model to a related but unlabeled target
domain. In such a scenario, all conventional adaptation methods that require
source data fail. To combat this challenge, existing USFDAs turn to transfer
knowledge by aligning the target feature to the latent distribution hidden in
the source model. However, such information is naturally limited. Thus, the
alignment in such a scenario is not only difficult but also insufficient, which
degrades the target generalization performance. To relieve this dilemma in
current USFDAs, we are motivated to explore a new perspective to boost their
performance. For this purpose and gaining necessary insight, we look back upon
the origin of the domain adaptation and first theoretically derive a new-brand
target generalization error bound based on the model smoothness. Then,
following the theoretical insight, a general and model-smoothness-guided
Jacobian norm (JN) regularizer is designed and imposed on the target domain to
mitigate this dilemma. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate its
effectiveness. In its implementation, just with a few lines of codes added to
the existing USFDAs, we achieve superior results on various benchmark datasets.]]></summary>

currently hampered by limitations in data availability. Distributed learning
methods such as federated learning (FL) and shared learning (SL) are introduced

split task-agnostic (FeSTA) learning tries to reconcile the distinct merits of
FL and SL by enabling the multi-task collaboration between participants through
Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, but they suffer from higher
communication overhead. To address this, here we present a multi-task
distributed learning using ViT with random patch permutation. Instead of using
a CNN based head as in FeSTA, p-FeSTA adopts a randomly permuting simple patch
embedder, improving the multi-task learning performance without sacrificing

equivalence between two programs made of sequences of statements. We represent
programs using abstract syntax trees (AST), where a given set of
semantics-preserving rewrite rules can be applied on a specific AST pattern to
generate a transformed and semantically equivalent program. In our system, two
programs are equivalent if there exists a sequence of application of these
rewrite rules that leads to rewriting one program into the other. We propose a
neural network architecture based on a transformer model to generate proofs of
equivalence between program pairs. The system outputs a sequence of rewrites,
and the validity of the sequence is simply checked by verifying it can be
applied. If no valid sequence is produced by the neural network, the system
reports the programs as non-equivalent, ensuring by design no programs may be
incorrectly reported as equivalent. Our system is fully implemented for a given
grammar. To efficiently train the system to generate such sequences, we develop
an original incremental training technique, named self-supervised sample
selection. We extensively study the effectiveness of this novel training

for the challenging and underexplored tasks of texture transfer and synthesis.
Previous works either apply spherical texture maps which may lead to large
distortions, or use continuous texture fields that yield smooth outputs lacking
details. We argue that the traditional way of representing textures with images
and linking them to a 3D mesh via UV mapping is more desirable, since
synthesizing 2D images is a well-studied problem. We propose AUV-Net which
learns to embed 3D surfaces into a 2D aligned UV space, by mapping the
corresponding semantic parts of different 3D shapes to the same location in the
UV space. As a result, textures are aligned across objects, and can thus be
easily synthesized by generative models of images. Texture alignment is learned
in an unsupervised manner by a simple yet effective texture alignment module,
taking inspiration from traditional works on linear subspace learning. The
learned UV mapping and aligned texture representations enable a variety of
applications including texture transfer, texture synthesis, and textured single
view 3D reconstruction. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Project page:

of large data volumes by edge devices subject to limited communication
bandwidths, heterogeneity in data distributions and computational resources, as

dual variables to tackle statistical heterogeneity, and accommodates system
heterogeneity by tolerating variable amount of work performed by clients.
FedADMM maintains identical communication costs per round as FedAvg/Prox, and
generalizes them via the augmented Lagrangian. A convergence proof is
established for nonconvex objectives, under no restrictions in terms of data
dissimilarity or number of participants per round of the algorithm. We
demonstrate the merits through extensive experiments on real datasets, under
both IID and non-IID data distributions across clients. FedADMM consistently
outperforms all baseline methods in terms of communication efficiency, with the
number of rounds needed to reach a prescribed accuracy reduced by up to 87%.
The algorithm effectively adapts to heterogeneous data distributions through
the use of dual variables, without the need for hyperparameter tuning, and its
advantages are more pronounced in large-scale systems.]]></summary>

MTI-Net is designed to predict subjective listening test results and word error

prediction performance of MTI-Net. First, we compare different features
(including low-level features and embeddings from self-supervised learning
(SSL) models) and prediction targets of MTI-Net. Second, we explore the effect
of transfer learning and multi-tasking learning on training MTI-Net. Finally,
we examine the potential advantages of fine-tuning SSL embeddings. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of using cross-domain features,
multi-task learning, and fine-tuning SSL embeddings. Furthermore, it is
confirmed that the intelligibility and WER scores predicted by MTI-Net are

presence of covariate information along tensor modes. Our motivation comes from
online advertising where users click-through-rates (CTR) on ads over various

on non-missing entries, which makes the standalone tensor completion method
unsatisfactory. Beside the CTR tensor, additional ad features or user
characteristics are often available. In this paper, we propose
Covariate-assisted Sparse Tensor Completion (COSTCO) to incorporate covariate
information for the recovery of the sparse tensor. The key idea is to jointly
extract latent components from both the tensor and the covariate matrix to
learn a synthetic representation. Theoretically, we derive the error bound for
the recovered tensor components and explicitly quantify the improvements on
both the reveal probability condition and the tensor recovery accuracy due to
covariates. Finally, we apply COSTCO to an advertisement dataset consisting of
a CTR tensor and ad covariate matrix, leading to 23% accuracy improvement over

data analysis that involves diagonalizing the covariance matrix of the dataset.
Recently, quantum algorithms have been formulated for PCA based on
diagonalizing a density matrix. These algorithms assume that the covariance
matrix can be encoded in a density matrix, but a concrete protocol for this
encoding has been lacking. Our work aims to address this gap. Assuming
amplitude encoding of the data, with the data given by the ensemble $\{p_i,|
\psi_i \rangle\}$, then one can easily prepare the ensemble average density
matrix $\overline{\rho} = \sum_i p_i |\psi_i\rangle \langle \psi_i |$. We first
show that $\overline{\rho}$ is precisely the covariance matrix whenever the
dataset is centered. For quantum datasets, we exploit global phase symmetry to
argue that there always exists a centered dataset consistent with
$\overline{\rho}$, and hence $\overline{\rho}$ can always be interpreted as a
covariance matrix. This provides a simple means for preparing the covariance
matrix for arbitrary quantum datasets or centered classical datasets. For
uncentered classical datasets, our method is so-called "PCA without centering",
which we interpret as PCA on a symmetrized dataset. We argue that this closely
corresponds to standard PCA, and we derive equations and inequalities that
bound the deviation of the spectrum obtained with our method from that of
standard PCA. We numerically illustrate our method for the MNIST handwritten
digit dataset. We also argue that PCA on quantum datasets is natural and
meaningful, and we numerically implement our method for molecular ground-state
datasets.]]></summary>

large part an open scientific question. In this article, costly mixed problems
are approached through Gaussian processes where the discrete variables are
relaxed into continuous latent variables. The continuous space is more easily
harvested by classical Bayesian optimization techniques than a mixed space
would. Discrete variables are recovered either subsequently to the continuous
optimization, or simultaneously with an additional continuous-discrete
compatibility constraint that is handled with augmented Lagrangians. Several
possible implementations of such Bayesian mixed optimizers are compared. In
particular, the reformulation of the problem with continuous latent variables
is put in competition with searches working directly in the mixed space. Among
the algorithms involving latent variables and an augmented Lagrangian, a
particular attention is devoted to the Lagrange multipliers for which a local

finding schemes that can effectively alleviate access congestion has become an
important issue. Recently, many traffic control schemes have been studied.
Nevertheless, the dynamics of traffic and the heterogeneous requirements of
different IoV applications are not considered in most existing studies, which
is significant for the random access resource allocation. In this paper, we
consider a hybrid traffic control scheme and use proximal policy optimization
(PPO) method to tackle it. Firstly, IoV devices are divided into various
classes based on delay characteristics. The target of maximizing the successful
transmission of packets with the success rate constraint is established. Then,

demonstrated significant performance on non-trivial tasks such as speech
recognition, image processing, and natural language understanding. However,
this is at the cost of substantial data requirements. Considering the
widespread proliferation of edge devices (e.g. Internet of Things devices) over
the last decade, Deep Learning in the edge paradigm, such as device-cloud
integrated platforms, is required to leverage its superior performance.
Moreover, it is suitable from the data requirements perspective in the edge
paradigm because the proliferation of edge devices has resulted in an explosion
in the volume of generated and collected data. However, there are difficulties
due to other requirements such as high computation, high latency, and high
bandwidth caused by Deep Learning applications in real-world scenarios. In this
regard, this survey paper investigates Deep Learning at the edge, its
architecture, enabling technologies, and model adaption techniques, where edge
servers and edge devices participate in deep learning training and inference.
For simplicity, we call this paradigm the All-in EDGE paradigm. Besides, this
paper presents the key performance metrics for Deep Learning at the All-in EDGE
paradigm to evaluate various deep learning techniques and choose a suitable
design. Moreover, various open challenges arising from the deployment of Deep
Learning at the All-in EDGE paradigm are identified and discussed.]]></summary>

networks. Most of them are computed by iterations and cannot be interpreted
very well. In contrast, little attentions are paid to basic machine learning
models such as support vector machines. In this paper, we investigate the
optimization models and the interpretations for three types of adversarial
perturbations against support vector machines, including sample-adversarial
perturbations (sAP), class-universal adversarial perturbations (cuAP) as well
as universal adversarial perturbations (uAP). For linear binary/multi
classification support vector machines (SVMs), we derive the explicit solutions
for sAP, cuAP and uAP (binary case), and approximate solution for uAP of
multi-classification. We also obtain the upper bound of fooling rate for uAP.
Such results not only increase the interpretability of the three adversarial
perturbations, but also provide great convenience in computation since
iterative process can be avoided. Numerical results show that our method is
fast and effective in calculating three types of adversarial perturbations.]]></summary>

To address this problem, a possible solution is to provide the agent with
information about the past. However, providing complete observations of
numerous steps can be excessive. Inspired by human memory, we propose to
represent history with only important changes in the environment and, in our
approach, to obtain automatically this representation using self-supervision.
Our method (TempAl) aligns temporally-close frames, revealing a general, slowly
varying state of the environment. This procedure is based on contrastive loss,
which pulls embeddings of nearby observations to each other while pushing away
other samples from the batch. It can be interpreted as a metric that captures
the temporal relations of observations. We propose to combine both common
instantaneous and our history representation and we evaluate TempAl on all
available Atari games from the Arcade Learning Environment. TempAl surpasses
the instantaneous-only baseline in 35 environments out of 49. The source code

information between multiple correlated tasks, then it produces better
generalization performance. However, it contains matrix inversion operation
when solving the dual problems, so it costs much running time. Moreover, kernel
trick cannot be directly utilized in the nonlinear case. To effectively avoid
above problems, a novel multi-task nonparallel support vector machine (MTNPSVM)
including linear and nonlinear cases is proposed in this paper. By introducing
epsilon-insensitive loss instead of square loss in DMTSVM, MTNPSVM effectively
avoids matrix inversion operation and takes full advantage of the kernel trick.
Theoretical implication of the model is further discussed. To further improve
the computational efficiency, the alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) is employed when solving the dual problem. The computational complexity
and convergence of the algorithm are provided. In addition, the property and
sensitivity of the parameter in model are further explored. The experimental
results on fifteen benchmark datasets and twelve image datasets demonstrate the
validity of MTNPSVM in comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms.
Finally, it is applied to real Chinese Wine dataset, and also verifies its

spectrum with incumbent users and support various spectrum monitoring tasks
such as anomaly detection, fault diagnostics, user equipment identification,
and authentication. A network of wireless sensors is needed to monitor the
spectrum for signal transmissions of interest over a large deployment area.
Each sensor receives signals under a specific channel condition depending on
its location and trains an individual model of a deep neural network (DNN)
accordingly to classify signals. To improve the accuracy, individual sensors
may exchange sensing data or sensor results with each other or with a fusion
center (such as in cooperative spectrum sensing). In this paper, distributed
federated learning over a multi-hop wireless network is considered to
collectively train a DNN for signal identification. In distributed federated
learning, each sensor broadcasts its trained model to its neighbors, collects
the DNN models from its neighbors, and aggregates them to initialize its own
model for the next round of training. Without exchanging any spectrum data,
this process is repeated over time such that a common DNN is built across the
network while preserving the privacy associated with signals collected at
different locations. Signal classification accuracy and convergence time are
evaluated for different network topologies (including line, star, ring, grid,
and random networks) and packet loss events. Then, the reduction of
communication overhead and energy consumption is considered with random
participation of sensors in model updates. The results show the feasibility of
extending cooperative spectrum sensing over a general multi-hop wireless
network through federated learning and indicate its robustness to wireless
network effects, thereby sustaining high accuracy with low communication
overhead and energy consumption.]]></summary>

improve generalization performances by constraining a model's complexity.
Current Deep Networks heavily rely on regularizers such as Data-Augmentation
(DA) or weight-decay, and employ structural risk minimization, i.e.
cross-validation, to select the optimal regularization hyper-parameters. In
this study, we demonstrate that techniques such as DA or weight decay produce a
model with a reduced complexity that is unfair across classes. The optimal
amount of DA or weight decay found from cross-validation leads to disastrous
model performances on some classes e.g. on Imagenet with a resnet50, the "barn
spider" classification test accuracy falls from $68\%$ to $46\%$ only by
introducing random crop DA during training. Even more surprising, such
performance drop also appears when introducing uninformative regularization
techniques such as weight decay. Those results demonstrate that our search for
ever increasing generalization performance -- averaged over all classes and
samples -- has left us with models and regularizers that silently sacrifice
performances on some classes. This scenario can become dangerous when deploying
a model on downstream tasks e.g. an Imagenet pre-trained resnet50 deployed on
INaturalist sees its performances fall from $70\%$ to $30\%$ on class \#8889
when introducing random crop DA during the Imagenet pre-training phase. Those
results demonstrate that designing novel regularizers without class-dependent
bias remains an open research question.]]></summary>

amount of knowledge from the pre-training corpora; however, they are still
limited in recalling factually correct knowledge given a certain context.
Hence, they tend to suffer from counterfactual or hallucinatory generation when
used in knowledge-intensive natural language generation (NLG) tasks. Recent
remedies to this problem focus on modifying either the pre-training or task
fine-tuning objectives to incorporate knowledge, which normally require
additional costly training or architecture modification of LMs for practical
applications. We present Knowledge Infused Decoding (KID) -- a novel decoding
algorithm for generative LMs, which dynamically infuses external knowledge into
each step of the LM decoding. Specifically, we maintain a local knowledge
memory based on the current context, interacting with a dynamically created
external knowledge trie, and continuously update the local memory as a
knowledge-aware constraint to guide decoding via reinforcement learning. On six
diverse knowledge-intensive NLG tasks, task-agnostic LMs (e.g., GPT-2 and BART)
armed with KID outperform many task-optimized state-of-the-art models, and show
particularly strong performance in few-shot scenarios over seven related
knowledge-infusion techniques. Human evaluation confirms KID's ability to
generate more relevant and factual language for the input context when compared
with multiple baselines. Finally, KID also alleviates exposure bias and
provides stable generation quality when generating longer sequences. Code for

paper first proposes a time-frequency framework for the representation learning
of the electroencephalogram (EEG) following the definition of the American

the defining characteristics of sleep stages, we further design a
context-sensitive flexible pipeline that automatically adapts to the attributes
of data itself. That is, the input EEG spectrogram is partitioned into a
sequence of patches in the time and frequency axes, and then input to a
delicate deep learning network for further representation learning to extract
the stage-dependent features, which are used in the classification step
finally. The proposed pipeline is validated against a large database, i.e., the
Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS), and the results demonstrate that the
competitive performance for the wake, N2, and N3 stages outperforms the
state-of-art works, with the F1 scores being 0.93, 0.88, and 0.87,
respectively, and the proposed method has a high inter-rater reliability of
0.80 kappa. Importantly, we visualize the stage scoring process of the model
decision with the Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) method, which shows
that the proposed pipeline is more sensitive and perceivable in the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rapid advancements in deep learning have led to many recent breakthroughs.
While deep learning models achieve superior performance, often statistically
better than humans, their adoption into safety-critical settings, such as
healthcare or self-driving cars is hindered by their inability to provide
safety guarantees or to expose the inner workings of the model in a human
understandable form. We present Mo\"ET, a novel model based on Mixture of
Experts, consisting of decision tree experts and a generalized linear model
gating function. Thanks to such gating function the model is more expressive
than the standard decision tree. To support non-differentiable decision trees
as experts, we formulate a novel training procedure. In addition, we introduce
a hard thresholding version, Mo\"ETH, in which predictions are made solely by a
single expert chosen via the gating function. Thanks to that property, Mo\"ETH
allows each prediction to be easily decomposed into a set of logical rules in a
form which can be easily verified. While Mo\"ET is a general use model, we
illustrate its power in the reinforcement learning setting. By training Mo\"ET
models using an imitation learning procedure on deep RL agents we outperform
the previous state-of-the-art technique based on decision trees while
preserving the verifiability of the models. Moreover, we show that Mo\"ET can
also be used in real-world supervised problems on which it outperforms other
verifiable machine learning models.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the surge in the number of hyperparameters and training times of modern
machine learning models, hyperparameter tuning is becoming increasingly
expensive. However, after assessing 40 tuning methods systematically, we find
that each faces certain limitations. In particular, methods that speed up
tuning via knowledge transfer typically require the final performance of
hyperparameters and do not focus on low-fidelity information. As we demonstrate
empirically, this common practice is suboptimal and can incur an unnecessary
use of resources. It is more cost-efficient to instead leverage low-fidelity
tuning observations to measure inter-task similarity and transfer knowledge
from existing to new tasks accordingly. However, performing multi-fidelity
tuning comes with its own challenges in the transfer setting: the noise in
additional observations and the need for performance forecasting. Therefore, we
propose and conduct a thorough analysis of a multi-task multi-fidelity Bayesian
optimization framework, which leads to the best instantiation--amortized
auto-tuning (AT2). We further present an offline-computed 27-task
hyperparameter recommendation (HyperRec) database to serve the community.
Extensive experiments on HyperRec and other real-world databases illustrate the
effectiveness of our AT2 method.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We study the basic operation of set union in the global model of differential
privacy. In this problem, we are given a universe $U$ of items, possibly of
infinite size, and a database $D$ of users. Each user $i$ contributes a subset
$W_i \subseteq U$ of items. We want an ($\epsilon$,$\delta$)-differentially
private algorithm which outputs a subset $S \subset \cup_i W_i$ such that the
size of $S$ is as large as possible. The problem arises in countless real world
applications; it is particularly ubiquitous in natural language processing
(NLP) applications as vocabulary extraction. For example, discovering words,
sentences, $n$-grams etc., from private text data belonging to users is an
instance of the set union problem.

Known algorithms for this problem proceed by collecting a subset of items
from each user, taking the union of such subsets, and disclosing the items
whose noisy counts fall above a certain threshold. Crucially, in the above
process, the contribution of each individual user is always independent of the
items held by other users, resulting in a wasteful aggregation process, where
some item counts happen to be way above the threshold. We deviate from the
above paradigm by allowing users to contribute their items in a
$\textit{dependent fashion}$, guided by a $\textit{policy}$. In this new
setting ensuring privacy is significantly delicate. We prove that any policy
which has certain $\textit{contractive}$ properties would result in a
differentially private algorithm. We design two new algorithms, one using
Laplace noise and other Gaussian noise, as specific instances of policies
satisfying the contractive properties. Our experiments show that the new
algorithms significantly outperform previously known mechanisms for the
problem.]]></summary>

tool in solving tasks across various fields of application. The success of DNNs
is strongly connected to their high complexity in terms of the number of
network layers or of neurons in each layer, which severely complicates to
understand how DNNs solve their learned task. To improve the explainability of
DNNs, we adapt methods from neuroscience because this field has a rich
experience in analyzing complex and opaque systems. In this work, we draw
inspiration from how neuroscience uses topographic maps to visualize the
activity of the brain when it performs certain tasks. Transferring this
approach to DNNs can help to visualize and understand their internal processes
more intuitively, too. However, the inner structures of brains and DNNs differ
substantially. Therefore, to be able to visualize activations of neurons in
DNNs as topographic maps, we research techniques to layout the neurons in a
two-dimensional space in which neurons of similar activity are in the vicinity
of each other. In this work, we introduce and compare different methods to
obtain a topographic layout of the neurons in a network layer. Moreover, we
demonstrate how to use the resulting topographic activation maps to identify
errors or encoded biases in DNNs or data sets. Our novel visualization
technique improves the transparency of DNN-based algorithmic decision-making
systems and is accessible to a broad audience because topographic maps are
intuitive to interpret without expert-knowledge in Machine Learning.]]></summary>

improve generalization performances by constraining a model's complexity.
Current Deep Networks heavily rely on regularizers such as Data-Augmentation
(DA) or weight-decay, and employ structural risk minimization, i.e.
cross-validation, to select the optimal regularization hyper-parameters. In
this study, we demonstrate that techniques such as DA or weight decay produce a
model with a reduced complexity that is unfair across classes. The optimal
amount of DA or weight decay found from cross-validation leads to disastrous
model performances on some classes e.g. on Imagenet with a resnet50, the "barn
spider" classification test accuracy falls from $68\%$ to $46\%$ only by
introducing random crop DA during training. Even more surprising, such
performance drop also appears when introducing uninformative regularization
techniques such as weight decay. Those results demonstrate that our search for
ever increasing generalization performance -- averaged over all classes and
samples -- has left us with models and regularizers that silently sacrifice
performances on some classes. This scenario can become dangerous when deploying
a model on downstream tasks e.g. an Imagenet pre-trained resnet50 deployed on
INaturalist sees its performances fall from $70\%$ to $30\%$ on class \#8889
when introducing random crop DA during the Imagenet pre-training phase. Those
results demonstrate that designing novel regularizers without class-dependent
bias remains an open research question.]]></summary>

observations of brain oxygen metabolism. $R_2^\prime$ maps are easily inferred;
however, the Oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and deoxygenated blood volume
(DBV) are more ambiguously determined from the data. As such, existing
inference methods tend to yield very noisy and underestimated OEF maps, while
overestimating DBV.

This work describes a novel probabilistic machine learning approach that can
infer plausible distributions of OEF and DBV. Initially, we create a model that
produces informative voxelwise prior distribution based on synthetic training
data. Contrary to prior work, we model the joint distribution of OEF and DBV
through a scaled multivariate logit-Normal distribution, which enables the
values to be constrained within a plausible range. The prior distribution model
is used to train an efficient amortized variational Bayesian inference model.
This model learns to infer OEF and DBV by predicting real image data, with few
training data required, using the signal equations as a forward model.

We demonstrate that our approach enables the inference of smooth OEF and DBV
maps, with a physiologically plausible distribution that can be adapted through
specification of an informative prior distribution. Other benefits include
model comparison (via the evidence lower bound) and uncertainty quantification
for identifying image artefacts. Results are demonstrated on a small study
comparing subjects undergoing hyperventilation and at rest. We illustrate that
the proposed approach allows measurement of gray matter differences in OEF and
DBV and enables voxelwise comparison between conditions, where we observe
significant increases in OEF and $R_2^\prime$ during hyperventilation.]]></summary>

reducing the dimensionality of multi-view unlabeled data with high dimensions.
The previous methods assume all of the views are complete. However, in real
applications, the multi-view data are often incomplete, i.e., some views of
instances are missing, which will result in the failure of these methods.
Besides, while the data arrive in form of streams, these existing methods will
suffer the issues of high storage cost and expensive computation time. To
address these issues, we propose an Incremental Incomplete Multi-view
Unsupervised Feature Selection method (I$^2$MUFS) on incomplete multi-view
streaming data. By jointly considering the consistent and complementary
information across different views, I$^2$MUFS embeds the unsupervised feature
selection into an extended weighted non-negative matrix factorization model,
which can learn a consensus clustering indicator matrix and fuse different
latent feature matrices with adaptive view weights. Furthermore, we introduce
the incremental leaning mechanisms to develop an alternative iterative
algorithm, where the feature selection matrix is incrementally updated, rather
than recomputing on the entire updated data from scratch. A series of
experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method by
comparing with several state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results

a given natural language query. Recently, large-scale code pre-trained models
such as CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT learn generic representations of source code
and have achieved substantial improvement on code search task. However, the
high-quality sequence-level representations of code snippets have not been
sufficiently explored. In this paper, we propose a new approach with multimodal
contrastive learning and soft data augmentation for code search. Multimodal
contrastive learning is used to pull together the representations of code-query
pairs and push apart the unpaired code snippets and queries. Moreover, data
augmentation is critical in contrastive learning for learning high-quality
representations. However, only semantic-preserving augmentations for source
code are considered in existing work. In this work, we propose to do soft data
augmentation by dynamically masking and replacing some tokens in code sequences
to generate code snippets that are similar but not necessarily
semantic-preserving as positive samples for paired queries. We conduct
extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on a
large-scale dataset with six programming languages. The experimental results
show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
We also adapt our techniques to several pre-trained models such as RoBERTa and
CodeBERT, and significantly boost their performance on the code search task.]]></summary>

which is shown to produce high quality speech representations when specific

to achieve multispeaker speech synthesis without utilizing additional speaker
features. This method enables us to train our model in an unlabeled

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gradient-enhanced Kriging (GE-Kriging) is a well-established surrogate
modelling technique for approximating expensive computational models. However,
it tends to get impractical for high-dimensional problems due to the large
inherent correlation matrix and the associated high-dimensional hyper-parameter
tuning problem. To address these issues, we propose a new method in this paper,
called sliced GE-Kriging (SGE-Kriging) for reducing both the size of the
correlation matrix and the number of hyper-parameters. Firstly, we perform a
derivative-based global sensitivity analysis to detect the relative importance
of each input variable with respect to model response. Then, we propose to
split the training sample set into multiple slices, and invoke Bayes' theorem
to approximate the full likelihood function via a sliced likelihood function,
in which multiple small correlation matrices are utilized to describe the
correlation of the sample set. Additionally, we replace the original
high-dimensional hyper-parameter tuning problem with a low-dimensional
counterpart by learning the relationship between the hyper-parameters and the
global sensitivity indices. Finally, we validate SGE-Kriging by means of
numerical experiments with several benchmarks problems. The results show that
the SGE-Kriging model features an accuracy and robustness that is comparable to
the standard one but comes at much less training costs. The benefits are most
evident in high-dimensional problems.]]></summary>

family with unknown parameters. We ask the following question: when is it
possible to split $X$ into two parts $f(X)$ and $g(X)$ such that neither part
is sufficient to reconstruct $X$ by itself, but both together can recover $X$
fully, and the joint distribution of $(f(X),g(X))$ is tractable? As one
example, if $X=(X_1,\dots,X_n)$ and $P$ is a product distribution, then for any
$m<n$, we can split the sample to define $f(X)=(X_1,\dots,X_m)$ and
$g(X)=(X_{m+1},\dots,X_n)$. Rasines and Young (2021) offers an alternative
route of accomplishing this task through randomization of $X$ with additive
Gaussian noise which enables post-selection inference in finite samples for
Gaussian distributed data and asymptotically for non-Gaussian additive models.
In this paper, we offer a more general methodology for achieving such a split
in finite samples by borrowing ideas from Bayesian inference to yield a
(frequentist) solution that can be viewed as a continuous analog of data
splitting. We call our method data blurring, as an alternative to data
splitting, data carving and p-value masking. We exemplify the method on a few
prototypical applications, such as post-selection inference for trend filtering
and other regression problems.]]></summary>

robust statistical inference methods for the parameter estimates computed using

are restricted to settings involving independently sampled observations, while
existing statistical inference methods in reinforcement learning (RL) are
limited to the batch setting. The online bootstrap is a flexible and efficient
approach for statistical inference in linear stochastic approximation
algorithms, but its efficacy in settings involving Markov noise, such as RL,
has yet to be explored. In this paper, we study the use of the online bootstrap
method for statistical inference in RL. In particular, we focus on the temporal
difference (TD) learning and Gradient TD (GTD) learning algorithms, which are
themselves special instances of linear stochastic approximation under Markov

intelligence. It is often inefficient to conduct reasoning and inference
directly in the space of raw sensory representations, such as pixel values of
images. Representation learning allows us to automatically discover suitable
representations from raw sensory data. For example, given raw sensory data, a
deep neural network learns nonlinear representations at its hidden layers,
which are subsequently used for classification at its output layer. This
happens implicitly during training through minimizing a supervised or
unsupervised loss. In this paper, we study the dynamics of such implicit
nonlinear representation learning. We identify a pair of a new assumption and a
novel condition, called the common model structure assumption and the
data-architecture alignment condition. Under the common model structure
assumption, the data-architecture alignment condition is shown to be sufficient
for the global convergence and necessary for the global optimality. Moreover,
our theory explains how and when increasing the network size does and does not
improve the training behaviors in the practical regime. Our results provide
practical guidance for designing a model structure: e.g., the common model
structure assumption can be used as a justification for using a particular
model structure instead of others. We also derive a new training framework,
which satisfies the data-architecture alignment condition by automatically
modifying any given training algorithm. Given a standard training algorithm,
the framework running its modified version is empirically shown to maintain
competitive test performances while providing global convergence guarantees for
deep residual neural networks with convolutions, skip connections, and batch
normalization with datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Semeion,
KMNIST and SVHN.]]></summary>

be ineffective on non-stationary time series where different parts/crops of

these studies have been limited by available statistical methodology. We
propose a flexible approach to the simultaneous factorization and decomposition
of variation across such bidimensionally linked matrices, BIDIFAC+. This
decomposes variation into a series of low-rank components that may be shared
across any number of row sets (e.g., omics platforms) or column sets (e.g.,
cancer types). This builds on a growing literature for the factorization and
decomposition of linked matrices, which has primarily focused on multiple
matrices that are linked in one dimension (rows or columns) only. Our objective
function extends nuclear norm penalization, is motivated by random matrix
theory, gives an identifiable decomposition under relatively mild conditions,
and can be shown to give the mode of a Bayesian posterior distribution. We
apply BIDIFAC+ to pan-omics pan-cancer data from TCGA, identifying shared and

system identification techniques. They may be applied to linear and nonlinear
systems, and they require fewer modeling assumptions. However, these neural
network models may also need larger amounts of data to learn and generalize.
Furthermore, neural networks training is a time-consuming process. Hence,
building upon long-short term memory neural networks (LSTM), this paper
proposes using two types of deep transfer learning, namely parameter
fine-tuning and freezing, to reduce the data and computation requirements for
system identification. We apply these techniques to identify two dynamical
systems, namely a second-order linear system and a Wiener-Hammerstein nonlinear
system. Results show that compared with direct learning, our method accelerates
learning by 10% to 50%, which also saves data and computing resources.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DeepTensor is a computationally efficient framework for low-rank
decomposition of matrices and tensors using deep generative networks. We
decompose a tensor as the product of low-rank tensor factors (e.g., a matrix as
the outer product of two vectors), where each low-rank tensor is generated by a
deep network (DN) that is trained in a self-supervised manner to minimize the
mean-squared approximation error. Our key observation is that the implicit
regularization inherent in DNs enables them to capture nonlinear signal
structures (e.g., manifolds) that are out of the reach of classical linear
methods like the singular value decomposition (SVD) and principal component
analysis (PCA). Furthermore, in contrast to the SVD and PCA, whose performance
deteriorates when the tensor's entries deviate from additive white Gaussian
noise, we demonstrate that the performance of DeepTensor is robust to a wide
range of distributions. We validate that DeepTensor is a robust and
computationally efficient drop-in replacement for the SVD, PCA, nonnegative
matrix factorization (NMF), and similar decompositions by exploring a range of
real-world applications, including hyperspectral image denoising, 3D MRI
tomography, and image classification. In particular, DeepTensor offers a 6dB
signal-to-noise ratio improvement over standard denoising methods for signals
corrupted by Poisson noise and learns to decompose 3D tensors 60 times faster
than a single DN equipped with 3D convolutions.]]></summary>

equations(SDE) is proposed in this paper. The central goal is to solve forward
and inverse stochastic problems more effectively using limited data. Deep
operator network(DeepONet) has been proposed recently for operator learning.
Compared to other neural networks to learn functions, it aims at the problem of
learning nonlinear operators. However, it can be challenging by using the
original model to learn nonlinear operators for high-dimensional stochastic
problems. We propose a new multi-resolution autoencoder DeepONet model referred
to as MultiAuto-DeepONet to deal with this difficulty with the aid of
convolutional autoencoder. The encoder part of the network is designed to
reduce the dimensionality as well as discover the hidden features of
high-dimensional stochastic inputs. The decoder is designed to have a special
structure, i.e. in the form of DeepONet. The first DeepONet in decoder is
designed to reconstruct the input function involving randomness while the
second one is used to approximate the solution of desired equations. Those two
DeepONets has a common branch net and two independent trunk nets. This
architecture enables us to deal with multi-resolution inputs naturally. By
adding $L_1$ regularization to our network, we found the outputs from the
branch net and two trunk nets all have sparse structures. This reduces the
number of trainable parameters in the neural network thus making the model more
efficient. Finally, we conduct several numerical experiments to illustrate the
effectiveness of our proposed MultiAuto-DeepONet model with uncertainty
quantification.]]></summary>

statistical learning algorithms primarily because they yield unbiased or nearly
unbiased estimators for the parameters in the model. Nonconvex penalties
existing in the literature such as SCAD, MCP, Laplace and arctan have a
singularity at origin which makes them useful also for variable selection.
However, in several high-dimensional frameworks such as deep learning, variable
selection is less of a concern. In this paper, we present a nonconvex penalty
which is smooth at origin. The paper includes asymptotic results for ordinary
least squares estimators regularized with the new penalty function, showing
asymptotic bias that vanishes exponentially fast. We also conducted an
empirical study employing deep neural network architecture on three datasets
and convolutional neural network on four datasets. The empirical study showed
better performance for the new regularization approach in five out of the seven
datasets.]]></summary>

auto-encoders (VAEs) and test two instances of this framework in the context of

on evaluation is based on the idea of statistical model criticism, popular in
Bayesian data analysis, whereby a statistical model is evaluated in terms of
its ability to reproduce statistics of an unknown data generating process from
which we can obtain samples. A VAE learns not one, but two joint distributions
over a shared sample space, each exploiting a choice of factorisation that
makes sampling tractable in one of two directions (latent-to-data,
data-to-latent). We evaluate samples from these distributions, assessing their
(marginal) fit to the observed data and our choice of prior, and we also
evaluate samples through a pipeline that connects the two distributions
starting from a data sample, assessing whether together they exploit and reveal
latent factors of variation that are useful to a practitioner. We show that
this methodology offers possibilities for model selection qualitatively beyond
intrinsic evaluation metrics and at a finer granularity than commonly used
statistics can offer.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We investigate and leverage a connection between Differential Privacy (DP)
and the recently proposed notion of Distributional Generalization (DG).
Applying this connection, we introduce new conceptual tools for designing
deep-learning methods that bypass "pathologies" of standard stochastic gradient
descent (SGD). First, we prove that differentially private methods satisfy a
"What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG)" generalization guarantee: whatever a
model does on its train data is almost exactly what it will do at test time.
This guarantee is formally captured by distributional generalization. WYSIWYG
enables principled algorithm design in deep learning by reducing
$\textit{generalization}$ concerns to $\textit{optimization}$ ones: in order to
mitigate unwanted behavior at test time, it is provably sufficient to mitigate
this behavior on the train data. This is notably false for standard (non-DP)
methods, hence this observation has applications even when privacy is not
required. For example, importance sampling is known to fail for standard SGD,
but we show that it has exactly the intended effect for DP-trained models.
Thus, with DP-SGD, unlike with SGD, we can influence test-time behavior by
making principled train-time interventions. We use these insights to construct
simple algorithms which match or outperform SOTA in several distributional
robustness applications, and to significantly improve the privacy vs. disparate
impact trade-off of DP-SGD. Finally, we also improve on known theoretical
bounds relating differential privacy, stability, and distributional
generalization.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although evaluation of the expectations on the Ising model is essential in
various applications, this is frequently infeasible because of intractable
multiple summations (or integrations). Spatial Monte Carlo integration (SMCI)
is a sampling-based approximation, and can provide high-accuracy estimations
for such intractable expectations. To evaluate the expectation of a function of
variables in a specific region (called target region), SMCI considers a larger
region containing the target region (called sum region). In SMCI, the multiple
summation for the variables in the sum region is precisely executed, and that
in the outer region is evaluated by the sampling approximation such as the
standard Monte Carlo integration. It is guaranteed that the accuracy of the
SMCI estimator is monotonically improved as the size of the sum region
increases. However, a haphazard expansion of the sum region could cause a
combinatorial explosion. Therefore, we hope to improve the accuracy without
such region expansion. In this study, based on the theory of generalized least
squares, a new effective method is proposed by combining multiple SMCI
estimators. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated theoretically
and numerically. The results indicate that the proposed method can be effective
in the inverse Ising problem (or Boltzmann machine learning).]]></summary>

 Abstract: " Large foundation models can exhibit unique capabilities depending on the domain of data they are trained on. While these domains are generic, they may only barely overlap. For example, visual-language models (VLMs) are trained on Internet-scale image captions, but large language models (LMs) are further trained on Internet-scale text with no images (e.g. from spreadsheets, to SAT questions). As a result, these models store different forms of commonsense knowledge across different domains. In this work, we show that this model diversity is symbiotic, and can be leveraged to build AI systems with structured Socratic dialogue -- in whi…]]></summary>

 I am following this website and considered an already published model (5 convolutional and 1 fully connected layer) which is trained on a similar dataset and same task.
 For the sake of sanity check, as per the website, I have trained the model on a subset of trainset (3 months) and tried to overfit it (while evaluating on complete val set), which works fine.
 However, I am not sure what to do next from this point on? Shall I just train on the complete trainset now? Or do I increase the layers or play with other hyper params to find more details about my regression problem/data? I would really appreciate your comments. Thank you.
 PS. The target value is sparse i.e. more than 85% of the time it is zero.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm keen to hear from people who have made the transition from ML Research/Engineering positions to software engineering roles (or who are considering it). What were your reasons for doing it and did you regret it? I see so many articles about transition from software to ML but none about going the opposite direction.
 Context: I've been working as an ML Engineer for a little over a year, and I'm just... not enjoying it. I want to love my job so badly as I like my boss, my colleagues, and the company (and I'm paid quite well for my level), but I just don't. I feel like the type of work I'm doing is not very smart and yet it's extremely draining: I spend so many hours just looking at loss curves, tweaking features and parameters. I'm somehow bored and stressed at the same time, because I don't enjoy the work and yet I feel the pressure to produce good models, and when they don't work as expected I can't help but take it personally as if if I just tried hard enough they would work. I find that the days were I end up having to take care of more purely engineering tasks I just have a lot more fun and I finish the day more satisfied and less drained. I think I just want to build something instead of spending hours banging my head against shit data. I would love to hear from people who feel or have felt the same way because whenever I speak about this with friends who are in ML they look at me like I'm a lunatic for wanting to leave it for software engineering.
 I'm obviously aware that swe roles are not all fun and games, but I just feel like there's been an excessive push for so many people to move to ML as it's "cool" and "smart" when in reality they're just different things who are going to suit different people.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Posted by Harsh Mehta, Software Engineer, Google Research 
Matrix factorization is one of the oldest, yet still widely used, techniques for learning how to recommend items such as songs or movies from user ratings. In its basic form, it approximates a large, sparse (i.e., mostly empty) matrix of user-item interactions with a product of two smaller, denser matrices representing learned item and user features. These dense matrices, in turn, can be used to recommend items to a user with which they haven't interacted before. 
Despite its algorithmic simplicity, matrix factorization can still achieve competitive performance in recommender benchmarks. Alternating least squares (ALS), and especially its implicit variation, is a fundamental algorithm to learn the parameters of matrix factorization…]]></summary>

 If the format supports 3D annotation types that is even better. Thanks for your insights in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working on a project in which a robots learns its motion. for example Bipedal robot learns to walk on a straight line by learning to adjust the torque and angular velocity of each joint. However, the robot I am working on has complex architecture. It has 10 joints instead of 2, most importantly all of these joints work simultaneously and coherently to produce a desired motion.
 The Problem I am facing is that, the robot has ten joints and each joint can move between -450 to +450
 for simplicity let me define State and Actions of the system
 State = -450 to +450 -------------> normalization ------------------> -10 to 10
 Actions = choose an angle between -10 to 10 for each joint 
 Total Action space for each State at each time step = 10 (no of joints each can move between -10 to 10 at each time step) * 360 (total time steps for a single motion) = 3600 (Output: No of angles required to generate a motion)
 I am using TD3 to solve this conundrum. The Action space is too large how can I reduce the action space?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently sitting at a difficult machine-learning problem that I have found no literature on how to solve it. 
 I am given n datapoints x_1,...,x_n that are ordered according to a ranking preference rank(x_1)<rank(x_2)<...<rank(x_n). I am assuming there exists a function f, such, that f(x_i)<f(x_i+1). I am now searching a Bayesian non-parametric model that gives the posterior probability of functions f that abide f(x_i)<f(x_i+1), so that i can estimate the relative rank preferences at new points.
 I have tried out a few things. The naive approach is using a GP prior on f. Unfortunately, computing the posterior distribution p(f(x_1), ... f(x_n)| f(x_1)<...<f(x_n)) has no closed form solution (it is a normal distribution with N linear constraints, which is absolutely terrible to sample from). This makes computing conditional distributions for predictions very challenging. 
 I am currently approximating the solution by using a GP regression model with label y_i = rank(x_i)=i. But this is systematically under-estimating the shape-variation, due to the fact that it adds the assumption that function values between ranks are equidistant. 
 Is there any known approach how to do this?

 We present results on video generation using diffusion models. We propose an architecture for video diffusion models which is a natural extension of the standard image architecture. We show that this architecture is effective for jointly training from image and video data. To generate long and higher resolution videos we introduce a new conditioning technique that performs better than previously proposed methods. We present results on text-conditioned video generation and state-of-the-art results on an unconditional video generation benchmark.

 The most common diagnostic imaging test conducted in emergency rooms is chest radiography. Providing automated preliminary read helpers to physicians might speed up surgery, enhance accuracy, and lower healthcare costs.
 An artificial intelligence tool that interprets chest X-rays without the intervention of a radiologist received regulatory approval in the European Union this week, marking a first for a wholly autonomous medical imaging AI, according to ‘Oxipit‘, the developer of this tool. It’s a watershed moment for AI, and it’s more than likely to spark debate, given that radiologists have spent the last few years working to fully automate parts of their jobs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am doing a project and there is a problem with dynamic action space
 A complete action space can be divided into four parts. In each state, the action to be selected is one of them
 For example, the total discrete action space length is 1000, which can be divided into four parts, [0:300], [301:500],[501:900],[901:1000]
 For state 1, action_ space is [0:300], State2, action_ space is [301:500], etc
 For this idea, I have several ideas at present:
  
There is no restriction at all. The legal actions of all States are [1:1000], but it may take longer train time and there is not much innovation
 Soft constraint, for example, if state1 selects an illegal action, such as one action in [251: 500], reward gives a negative value, but it is also not innovative
 Hard constraint, use action space mask in each state, but I don't know how to do it.. Is there any relevant article？
 It is directly divided into four action spaces and uses multi-agent cooperative relationship learning
  
​
 Any suggestions？
 thanks！

 [1912.04321] Learning to Code: Coded Caching via Deep Reinforcement Learning (arxiv.org)
 In short, we are trying to achieve the minimum number of transmission of bits from the server to all users
 Now, after 500 episodes of training the number of transmissions does decrease. But when I implement the same actor critic algorithm this does not happen. In fact, the results seem to be completely random. 
 Here is the plot of the same :

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a two part question:
  
If a neural network can overfit the a large dataset is this a sign that a neural network has high learning capacity? 
 If a neural network can overfit a dataset with substantially less parameters than other neural networks developed for the same learning task is this a sign that the neural network has a high learning capacity relative to other datasets?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone,
 We have recently published the code for our AISTATS 2022 paper -
 Sampling in Dirichlet Process Mixture Models for Clustering Streaming Data
 ​
 Video Segmentation Example
 In our work, we have proposed a solution for clustering streaming data. Unlike 'standard' clustering scenarios, in the streaming case the data stream is possibly infinite, you cannot backtrack to previously processed points, and the data statistics are dynamic and change over time.
 Our solution is based on the Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM), can work with different types of observations, and is very fast, outperforming other methods both in the quality of the results and the speed with which it achieves them.
 It can even be distributed across several processes and/or machines!

 Code (Python wrapper): https://github.com/BGU-CS-VIL/dpmmpythonStreaming

Also, I am currently studying Game Development to make a VR Game that hopefully will have humanlike AI in it. I have read a LOT of articles about the future of AI, and Cybersecurity keeps popping up because superintelligent AI needs to be CONTROLLED from hackers (based on the articles) otherwise it is over.

 But what’s hype, and what’s realistic? And how can you get involved?
 The first step is to understand the technology - where it’s well-suited to healthcare (and where it isn’t).
 When it comes to health care, especially for life and death situations AI has made things very easy for us. However, it is still expected to drastically change the way medicine is practised. It will also replace the surgeries done by the doctors with the surgeries done using Artificial intelligence, making diagnosing complex diseases, genetic issues and many other health problems extremely easy in the future. Here are the best Artificial Intelligence courses for healthcare you can learn in 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our work "AdaTime: A Systematic Evaluation of Domain Adaptation Algorithms on Time Series Data" is now public. We provide a benchmarking framework named "AdaTime" to fairly evaluate Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approaches on time-series data. We find that UDA approaches proposed for visual data can be directly applied to time-series data, and still achieve excellent performance, even better than methods specially proposed for time-series UDA. Se were impressed by the consistently superior performance of "DIRT-T" method on all the datasets. We provide the code publicly on github https://github.com/emadeldeen24/AdaTime

 We have released the preprint and google colab demo for our paper FaceSigns. FaceSigns embeds a secret bit-string as a semi-fragile watermark in the image pixels. The message is recoverable if benign image operations such as color/contrast adjustment, JPEG compression, Instagram filters are applied. However, the message cannot be decoded if the image is facially tampered (eg. DeepFake manipulation) . This selective fragility allows reliable detection of DeepFake manipulations applied on images signed using FaceSigns. 
 Try out our google colab demo to see message encoding and decoding using FaceSigns!

 I work in house and I’m part of our Google search team. Our ad spend is pretty large (9 figures per year, in USD). We build/manage stuff at scale using SQL, R, Javascript, and so on. So everything is pretty much “big data” in flavour.
 Lately I’ve been more and more interested in data science, and I’m looking to take things to the next level by incorporating machine learning into our workflow. I’d really love to build some useful machine learning models using popular Python libraries such as Pandas, SciKit Learn, NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and so on.
 Any suggestions on cool, and most importantly useful machine learning models I could build? (By “useful”, I mean something that could help increase the profits.) I think some classification, predictive, or recommender models would be great to start with. Cheers! 😄

Major comments by the reviewers include: more justification on the assumptions, discussion on choices of parameters, and experiments in more complex and different environments. 
 We want to address all the major and minor comments as best as we can but given that the response is limited to one page we cannot explain everything in detail. I am not sure what is the acceptable norm here. Do reviewers expect the authors to conduct some experiments during the rebuttal and provide sample results or just explain what additional experiment we will conduct and how we will do it. Justification and reasoning should be in details or a brief explanation with an assurance to add a detailed discussion in the final version suffices.

 Currently, I am doing some research with the UCI Adult dataset(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult). This first step is to build a high-accuracy classifier model. 
 Does anyone know any high accuracy model on this dataset (more than 90%)? I use many machine learning models like logistic regression and neural network. But no matter how complex the model is, I can only get an accuracy of about 85% on the test set. I tried to google but I found many others also have similar results of about 85%.
 Any posts or papers will be helpful! Thanks in advance for your help!

Suppose I am not using multiple workers then I have to collect episodes N times of fixed length T. But these episode lengths are variable i.e. some episodes end much before T and some much after T. So my question is how do we calculated advantage because according to the PPO paper, for generalized advantage estimate, we have to observe the reward of terminal state.

 So how should I calculate GAE in this ?

 I just wanted to share a project I've been working on for the past year - using deep RL to learn to play the board game Settlers of Catan.
 I expect everyone is aware of the results that DeepMind/OpenAI have got recently on Go, DOTA 2, Starcraft 2 etc, but I was motivated to see how much progress could be made with existing RL techniques on a reasonably complex game - but with access to significantly less computational resources.
 Whilst I didn't end up with an agent that performs at a super-human level, there was clear learning progress and the results were quite interesting. I decided to do a full write-up of the project here, which I figured could be useful for anyone else who is interested in trying to apply DRL to a new, complicated environment. I also open-sourced all the code here for anyone interested.
 If anyone has any feedback or any questions at all that'd be great!

 We just submitted to ICML 2022 and got our reviews back. We were excited to see that 4/4 reviews were positive and acknowledged the contribution of the paper. However, there were some minor criticisms (e.g. didn't do good enough lit reviews, could use a few more experiments) across several reviews.
 I was wondering if it is ever acceptable to not submit a rebuttal? Can a rebuttal in this case actually hurt us by rocking the boat---or for ICML is the norm that you should always submit a rebuttal that addresses all the reviewers' criticisms.
 We were wondering what the norm is for ICML specifically?

 Abstract
  
Contrastive models like CLIP have been shown to learn robust representations of images that capture both semantics and style. To leverage these representations for image generation, we propose a two-stage model: a prior that generates a CLIP image embedding given a text caption, and a decoder that generates an image conditioned on the image embedding. We show that explicitly generating image representations improves image diversity with minimal loss in photorealism and caption similarity. Our decoders conditioned on image representations can also produce variations of an image that preserve both its semantics and style, while varying the non-essential details absent from the image representation. We use diffusion models for the decoder and experiment with both autoregressive and diffusion models for the prior, finding that the latter are computationally more efficient and produce higher-quality samples.
  
OpenAI's Sam Altman used DALL-E 2 to generate ~20 text prompt requests from Twitter users. The results are here, with individual result links and other samples in this comment from another Reddit user in a different post.

Hopefully this summer, we’ll do a product launch and people will be able to use it for all sorts of things.

Reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to train a policy to perform a task via trial and error, but a major challenge in RL is learning policies from scratch in environments with hard exploration challenges. For example, consider the setting depicted in the door-binary-v0 environment from the adroit manipulation suite, where an RL agent must control a hand in 3D space to open a door placed in front of it. 
   


An RL agent must control a hand in 3D space to open a door placed in front of it. The agent receives a reward signal only when the door is completely open.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm curious about wether this unusual learning trajectory observed in humans has also been observed in artificial neural nets. A well known phenomenon in the 'dark souls' video game series is that ones first attempt at a boss is often much better than subsequent attempts. Boss hp at time of death by attempt might go something like: 35%, 55%, 85%, 87%, 75%, 54%, , 60%, 43%, 27%, 38%, 12%, 0%. This sounds very anecdotal, but its know to the community of these games to be a real thing. See this thread for evidence. Have NN playing games been known to exhibit a similar pattern, with peak in success early on, followed by a step descent , then a slow gradual climb? Or is this a purely human phenomenon?
 My hypothesis as to why this happens is that over the course of the first couple attempts, the player learns a bunch of bad strategies which must be slowly unlearned, whereas on attempt one, the player has no defined strategies good or bad.

 abstract: "The Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) model is an ensemble method extensively and successfully used in regression tasks due to its consistently strong predictive performance and its ability to quantify uncertainty. BART combines "weak" tree models through a set of shrinkage priors, whereby each tree explains a small portion of the variability in the data. However, the lack of smoothness and the absence of a covariance structure over the observations in standard BART can yield poor performance in cases where such assumptions would be necessary. We propose Gaussian processes Bayesian additive regression trees (GP-BART) as an extension of BART which assumes Gaussian process (GP) priors for the predictions of each terminal node among all trees. We illustrate our model on simulated and real data and compare its performance to traditional modelling approaches, outperforming them in many scenarios. An implementation of our method is available in the \textsf{R} package \texttt{rGPBART} available at: https://github.com/MateusMaiaDS/gpbart."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am relatively new in the area of machine learning/reinforcement learning. I have this basic question regarding practical implementations. I just want to know, what does it look like the output of a reinforcement learning agent/algorithm in practice? Is it like a 'look-up table' that will set the weights/parameters of the ML model based on the input data? 
 Note that I am asking after the offline training of the agent. How to implement the trained agent in practice, like in an embedded system? Do you guys have references or clues to help me to clarify?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I am using SAC(Soft Actor-Critic) to complete a reinforcement learning task with only four steps, each action is from one of four different action spaces. These four action spaces are essentially the same, and they are all chemical compound. I just want the agent to take different types of compounds at each step.
 I have the following questions：
  
Whether the different four steps can be trained? In fact, there is a paper that only has four steps in a reinforcement learning process, but his action space only has one discrete action space.
 Is there any article I can learn from? because I know that for the handle control of the game, there are usually multiple discrete action spaces, but each discrete space dimension of my task is larger, such as [800, 700, 500, 600]
  
Thanks！

I noticed that i get really different questions and feedback in comparison to my peers. I’m a female and my peers are male… I didn’t start out with this outlook but I’m starting to search for reasons why I often get questioned about my capabilities to preform a project ( which is normal enough but I get questioned to the point where explaining my approach isn’t enough and they ask me for examples of codes) and my peers definitely do not get asked about there capabilities, rather they tell them what they can do and they don’t get questioned. …………… really frustrating.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a project in the course of my PhD, I had to create a prototype for a project. My PhD is application of machine learning in health care. The project definition and scope was faaaar too wide. However, I managed to create a working demo which encompasses some use cases of the project. At best, it can be called a framework, where I have put in different DL components and it works okay for those use cases only. Most of the components, I have used are pre-trained language models (maybe fine tuned them to my use case). However, there is no active training or learning involved. This is because I created this for a demo only. I also created a very small dataset and tested the framework over the dataset and the results were ok. However, my supervisor now wants me to write a paper, as he is confident, that the use case is rather unique and my working framework is a good first step. I believe, his aim is to get me started on the paper writing process, which I appreciate. However, I am not confident about it at all.
 My question is, can a 'framework' composed of pre-trained models with the end goal of solving a problem in health care is good enough? Are there precedents of any such paper? And if I trust my supervisor's instincts, are there any fancy ways to frame the framework so that it does not look so basic?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At my company we use RL to solve our problem. The thing is : our problem is rather complex, and this is the core of our product (so clients rely on the results produced). 
 In order to reach satisfying results despite an agent that doesn't learn very well, we use sampling at inference time : instead of taking the best trajectory according to the agent, we take X trajectories and keep only the one with the best reward.
 This seems completely fine at first (similar things are done in NLP for example, with beam search), but in our case the sampling size is huge : 1024. Usually when using beam search, we use maybe a beam size of 6. Maybe 10 if you have good hardware ?
 ​
 Now, the agent seems to be learning : the mean return is slightly increasing over time, the entropies for the actions are steadily decreasing, etc...
 Now the goal of the ML team is to improve agent's learning to decrease the sampling size at inference time (because it's costly to run 1024 trajectories through the environment...).
 But whatever we try, the improvements are not reflected (we compare all our experiments with 1024 sampling in order to see what the customers will see).
 ​
 IMO this is because our sampling size is way too huge, even a random agent can produce okay-ish results...
 Is my intuition the right one ?

I'm interested in the emergence of language in multi-agent reinforcement environments but I can't see how this would be important down the line when there are large language models that are completely dominating language and communication. 
 Should this stop me from pursuing this idea or should I let my interest in the idea take precedence?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ll give an example to better explain my question (don’t get hung up on the numbers, it’s all made up). Say you are using a tree based model trying to project how many points a player will score in a given basketball game.
 Most players shoot free throws at a slightly lower percentage on the road, than they do at home. However, the magnitude varies player to player. Let’s assume for 95% of players with significant data, the ratio of home free throw percentage to away is 1 to 1.15. Generally speaking, older players are closer to 1 and younger players are around 1.1 (since older players get used to the opposing crowd).
 Now also say it takes 100 home and 100 away free throws to get a stable reliable ratio.
 Now say a young player only has 50 home, and 50 away free throws. With this amount of data he has a ratio of 1, however the sample size is not enough to be fully stable.
 Which would be better…
 5 features into this model, his home away ratio, average ratio for players his age, home free throw count, and away free throw attempts.
 1 feature. His ‘projected’ home away ratio, which is a weighted average of his ratio with the average for plaeyrs his age. Since he’s 50% of the way to significance, 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 1.1 = 1.05
 The benefit of the of the first choice is that it may find other interactions that I never conceived of, however, it could incorporate noise. Is there a general consensus, or is this just a try both and see what works?

 Meta-Learning Machines in a Single Lifelong Trial: lecture video (24 min) presented at meta-learning workshops at ICML 2020 and NeurIPS 2021. URL of talk: https://youtu.be/2GgGVdkq2bU
 Abstract
 The most widely used machine learning algorithms were designed by humans and thus are hindered by our cognitive biases and limitations. Can we also construct meta-learning algorithms that can learn better learning algorithms so that our self-improving AIs have no limits other than those inherited from computability and physics? This question has been a main driver of my research since I wrote a thesis on it in 1987. In the past decade, it has become a driver of many other people's research as well. Here I summarize our work starting in 1994 on meta-reinforcement learning with self-modifying policies in a single lifelong trial, and - since 2003 - mathematically optimal meta-learning through the self-referential Gödel Machine. This talk was previously presented at meta-learning workshops at ICML 2020 and NeurIPS 2021. Many additional publications on meta-learning can be found at https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/metalearning.html

 I've been working for the last 5 years as Data Scientist. During this time I have tried dozens of times to improve my models via hyperparameter tuning, but I've never got improvements from there. I've tried all the possible approaches: grid search, random search, bayesian search, etc. But in no case did I get satisfactory results.
 Does this happen to anyone else? Have you ever got robust improvements via HP tuning?

Allen Institute researchers propose MERLOT Reserve, a model that learns to represent videos over time and across several modalities, including audio, subtitles, and video frames. It was trained using a new learning objective and more than 20 million YouTube videos.
 MERLOT Reserve is a unique, cutting-edge methodology for solving video-related inquiries. MERLOT Reserve can dependably choose the correct answer from a selection of multiple-choice answers when given a video and a question. This forecast is made by MERLOT Reserve jointly reasoning over the visual frames of the video, the video subtitles, and the audio in the movie.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I'm a first-year Grad Student in Computer Vision and I am trying to get caught up on the latest research in my field. It seems like everyone in CS has heard about all of the latest papers but I just have no idea how. My knowledge is limited to general ideas and doesn't know any specific papers unless they have like 20000+ citations.
 So my question is: how do you hear about these papers and get caught up? Is there a reference somewhere that puts together a list of all the "must-read" papers that have come out? I feel like I am already 5 years behind in my knowledge. It would be great if there was something like "Top 5 papers of the week" that I could read to stay on top of things.
 Also, this doesn't just apply to Vision. I would like to have an idea of the other major developments in other fields (like NLP, general ML/DL, etc.) since I think that can carry over to my field.
 Thanks! Looking forward to your replies

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Based on my experiences in both academia and industry, I see that many researchers get listed as authors on papers solely for having attended the relevant project meetings, despite not contributing anything substantial to the work. I know of several people who've gotten on dozens of papers this way, despite not being able to explain the main details behind many of the papers they "co-authored." Of course, they can then claim credit for the work publicly as well as have their academic profile benefit from the citations accrued by the work.
 I've noticed that typically, these people are initially invited onto the project because they are on chummy terms with someone on the project. Concerningly, the more someone successfully "paper-rides" this way, the stronger their publication record looks, which makes it easier for them to find their way onto more projects to paper ride in the future.
 It seems that the obsessive focus on paper counts and citations has encouraged the rise of intellectually dishonest strategies for maximizing one's academic footprint. The huge research scientist salaries at top industry labs, which similarly obsess over paper counts and citations in their hiring process, only amplifies the incentive for paper riding.
 The reason I think it is bad: As more people paper ride, co-authorship on a paper gradually becomes a worse indication of expertise. Not to mention, paper riders are intellectually dishonest, by claiming credit for research that they didn't significantly contribute to. In a sense, it seems like a roundabout form of plagiarism.
 I know some might disagree with this take, as some people believe in being as generous about co-authorship as possible. I find that mindset to create the perfect environment for paper riders to flourish. I'm wondering if you've also seen paper riding happen and whether you think this behavior is good or bad.

Ever queried a recommender system and found that the same search only a few moments later or on a different device yields very different results? This is not uncommon and can be frustrating if a person is looking for something specific. As a designer of such a system, it is also not uncommon for the metrics measured to change from design and testing to deployment, bringing into question the utility of the experimental testing phase. Some level of such irreproducibility can be expected as the world changes and new models are deployed. However, this also happens regularly as requests hit duplicates of the same model or models are being refreshed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. I've been stuck on this problem for a while and I thought I might be able to find some help here. Any kind of assistance would be greatly appreciated. 
 My setup is as follows. I have an environment with 3 agents. All 3 agents have a single policy network, and it is based on CommNet. My goal is to implement a replay buffer for this environment. I verified that my replay buffer logic is good. I tried running 3 different types of runs:
  
Normal on-policy run: The agents perform an episode, and at the end of each episode the data (such as the states, actions, etc) from this episode are used to calculate the loss
 Using just the last episode from the replay buffer: The agents perform an episode, and the data is stored in the replay buffer. At the end of each episode, the last episode is sampled from the replay buffer (which is the episode that was just performed). This is just to confirm that my replay buffer is working properly, and the reward curve for this case matches that from (1).
 Using 1 random episode from the replay buffer: The agents perform an episode, and the data is stored in the replay buffer. At the end of each episode, a random episode is sampled from the replay buffer and used to calculate the loss. The performance is terrible in this case, and the environment times out each time
  
For some reason, as soon as I turn on random sampling, progress is really bad. I'm sorry to pose such an open-ended question, but what are some things I could check to pinpoint the source of this problem? What could be a reason as to why performance is as expected when just sampling the last episode, whereas it is terrible when randomly sampling episodes? I've tried some things thus far but nothing has worked, and I turned to this community in hopes of getting some help. I'm new to the area of reinforcement learning, so I would be very grateful for any kind of help you can offer. Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some time down the road, when AutoML becomes more established, it can help us determine the best ML model and hyperparameters for a particular problem. This will not replace data scientist, as we still need data scientists for their domain knowledge, which is critical for scoping business problems, pre-processing data, and deriving business insights from the trained model. However, since data scientists no longer need to deal with the technicalities of a model in the near future (i.e. they no longer have to tune hyperparameters, determine the best opitmistion function etc), is there still a need for aspiring data scientists to learn about the intricacies and nuances behind the various models (maybe by coding the model from scratch)? Or is it enough for them to learn how to operate an AutoML system? (My question is referring to the corporate world in general and not to academia) Thanks in advance for your answers :)

 We've just launched a competition at the AutoML-Conf 2022, the DAC4AutoML competition. It has two tracks, one for configuring a Computer Vision model and one for a RL pipeline: https://automl.github.io/dac4automlcomp/ 
 And what is DAC exactly? It means we want to find well-performing hyperparameter configurations like in Algorithm Configuration, but we do it dynamically - thus DAC, Dynamic Algorithm Configuration. As to how that is supposed to happen? We don't put any restrictions on the solutions for the competitions, so you can submit your hand-tuned static hyperparameter setting if you want. Or you can use some sort of heuristic, a regression model, reinforcement learning, ... whatever works. 
 If you're interested in participating, you can submit from now on until the 18.06. AOE, the winners will be announced at the AutoML-Conf.

 Output from using model.learn(env) on both Envs
 On the left I have a simple dummy CustomEnv (Using Stable-Baselines3 with Gym) for testing, and on the right I have my actual CustomEnv that I am working on in a project.
 As you can see, the dummy environment gives me the rollout monitoring, whereas there is no rollout monitoring for the actual environment (just time + train statistics/monitoring). 
 I am using very similar code when setting up the training of the model, however the complexity of the actual model is significantly higher than the dummy. In theory, the complexity of the environment shouldnt make a big difference to the monitoring right? All of the key parts are still there (reward function, step function, reset function etc.).
 In both cases it says that the environments are being wrapped by the 'Moniter' wrapper so that cant be it.
 Does anyone know why this might be happening?

 That may be about to change with the rollout release of Stylegan-XL weights trained on Imagenet. This notebook (https://github.com/CasualGANPapers/StyleGANXL-CLIP) has had nice results with objects never seen by the model, such as "apple" and "ant", as well as scenes such as "judo athletes fighting"
 Please note that the Stylegan-XL weights are currently available for 128x128 pixels. ETA for the 256 resolution is 14.04.22

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, all. I got accepted into my top choice of college as an undecided major. Recently, I have decided to pursue artificial intelligence! Unfortunately, it is near impossible to transfer into computer science at my particular university. I was wondering if I can still pursue AI as a career if I complete one of the following majors:
 -Mathematics
 -Information or Data Science
 -Statistics
 -Linguistics
 Additionally, I could pursue one of these and minor in another. I should be able to minor in computer science as well if necessary. Hopefully, my choice of major would allow me to pursue research or an internship in artificial intelligence. I am willing to take additional summer courses and pursue relevant certifications to ensure that I am up to par with my computer science colleagues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My post is inspired by this discussion.
 In that thread, OP asked why support vector machines are still taught. People offered several thoughts: they're easier to think about, they're still perfectly good for some real-world problems, and for some problems they apparently rival deep networks.
 I did a project for a class around six years ago using an SVM as implemented in scikit-learn. I was pretty satisfied with the project, but I also experienced some frustrations, and came away with some questions. I started working with Tensorflow and DNNs in earnest soon after finishing that project, and I largely stopped thinking about SVM. I would like to revive the questions I asked, but never answered, here.
  
A DNN with multiple outputs can potentially use a single neuron in the prediction of more than one output. For multiple, mutually-exclusive categories, this makes good sense. An SVM with multiple outputs in scikit-learn was implemented as pairs of one-vs-one SVMs, each of which was independently fit to data. This gets inefficient quickly. Has this changed? Can it be changed?
 DNN training at scale is a problem that many people have worked hard to make practical. Even non-experts like myself use our home GPUs to accelerate training of DNNs on large data sets. In scikit-learn, SVM training was implemented in a single thread on one CPU core. If you are performing cross-validation or a hyperparameter optimization study, it might be practical to parallelize fitting; one thread for each distinct condition. But can you parallelize the SVM fitting algorithm for a single condition? I went looking for software, but I couldn't find anything.
  
Over to you folks. Cheers.

 I am interested in knowing whether hyperparameters such as dropout, or recurrent dropout, batchnorm, etc etc, are even necessary in the usage of seq2seq model, but couldn’t find anything on it for weeks.
 In the case, let’s say, using gridsearchCV, what hyperparameters do you tweak for ur seq2seq model? (Other than the usual stuff like number of neurons, etc). There is absolutely zero information for that on seq2seq model, and everyone just assumes that putting an attention mechanism solves everything without hyperparameters tunings. I have also looked up on codes on seq2seq, and no hyperparameters tunings were shown whatsoever. 
 FYI, this is in the context of time series data, using seq2seq, if that matters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I read the paper and several tutorials, I am quite confused about the details.
  
I see many implementations scale the running cumulative discounted reward in a certain way. However, each of them does it in a different way. let R be the running cumulative discounted reward, which is considered the best? Or is there a source of the method to use? implementations I saw from different places include: 
  
 directly use R to calculate the advantage and training value network (most PPO tutorials use this)
 use (R / std(R)), where std is the mini-batch standard deviation
 use (R / std(R)), where std is the running standard deviation
 use ((R - mean(R)) / std(R)), where both mean and std are mini-batch wise
 use ((R - mean(R)) / std(R)), where both mean and std are running stats.
 do the above and clip to a certain range ([-10, 10] or [-1, 1])
  
 I also see several different ways for the value network, let V be the output of the value network:
  
 output raw logit, without any scaling/output activation (most PPO tutorials use this)
 output raw logit, but use the same scaling as discussed above for running cumulative discounted reward, for example, if return value is (R / std(R)), value output will be (V / std(R))
 do the same as 2, but use the stat of V instead of R for scaling, for example, if the return value is (R / std(R)), the value output will be (V / std(V))
 output with tanh activation at the last layer
 output with tanh activation at the last layer, and multiply by a constant to match the range of the return
  
any help would be appreciated, thanks!

 This paper finds what seems to be a new phenomenon when working in the continual learning/life-long learning domain. If new tasks are continually introduced to an agent, it seems to loose it's ability to learn the more time progresses. Intuitively it's similar to this idea that "an old dog can't learn new tricks". They propose a fairly simple method of overcoming this limitation that involves resetting weights that are not contributing much to the outcome of the network. They call the method Continual Backprop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 As the title describes, I’ll be making my first model as part of my final project. I still have a pretty high-level understanding of everything, so forgive any inaccuracies as I describe what I’m going for.
 The problem I’m attempting to solve is known as the traveling salesman problem. Essentially, a route needs to be formulated that stops at n given locations. Finding the most efficient route with many stops algorithmically is impractical because the number of possible routes increases exponentially with each added location. 
 The environment will simulate travel on city roads. Speed will be a constant, set to whatever the roads speed limit is. I am using .pbf format vector GIS data from OSM so that the environment consists of real-world pathways. I’m using GeoPandas and Pyrosm to work with the data, and I’m collecting nodes for the location of gas stations so that the environment can simulate needing to fuel the vehicle. Gas price will be a constant, as well as vehicle fuel-efficiency.
 Scoring will be based on the calculated time it would take to complete a route and the calculated cost (in gas). The goal will be to find the most efficient route to take when n = some large number. 
 I’ve never worked with spatial data either, so I’m not sure what kind of challenges that poses. I worry that adding nodes for the locations of gas stations might be difficult. I’m also wondering if I’m better off using Tensorflow and Keras for this, but I’m not really aware of all the technical considerations I should be making before deciding on that.
 Do you have any tips that might help me out? Solutions to problems I haven’t hit just yet, but likely will? 
 Thanks for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As far as I am aware, StableBaselines3 is the gold standard for reliable implementations of most popular / SOTA deep RL methods. However working with them in the past, I don't find them to be the most usable when looking for extensibility (making changes to the provided implementations) due to how the code base is structured in the behind the scenes (inheritance, lots of helper methods & utilities, etc.).
 For example, if I wish to change some portion of a method's training update with SB3 it would probably involve overloading a class method before initialization, making sure al the untouched portions of the original method are carried over, etc.
 Could anyone point me in the direction of any implementations that are more workable from the perspective of extensibility? Ideally implementations that are largely self contained to a single class / file, aren't heavily abstracted aware across multiple interfaces, don't rely heavily on utility functions, etc.

 - New transfer learning capabilities, outperforms fine-tuned models with 50x less data (Codex-12B)
 - The interesting part is how it meta-learns techy geeky jokes and is able to correlate concepts, and explain jokes suggesting starting doing a bit more meta-learning than GPT3 ever could.... But still not enough to generate decent ones (though the joke wasn't particularly humorous, so I may be underestimating)
 SoTA on various tasks, chain-of-thought-reasoning still holds up to scaling and outperforms some reasoning benchmarks, BIG-bench sees a huge improvement and general LLM thingys :)

Every developer in the world might benefit from these automated models, which have the potential to increase productivity. However, because the models may fail to understand program semantics, the quality of the generated code cannot be guaranteed.
 Microsoft researchers introduce Jigsaw, a new tool that can help these big language models perform better. Jigsaw is a Python Pandas API code generator that accepts multi-modal inputs. Jigsaw uses post-processing techniques to decipher the syntax and semantics of programs and then uses user feedback to improve future performance.

But I don't see the goal is actually achieved when done returned is True. I copied the code from here (https://openai.com/blog/ingredients-for-robotics-research/). I even let it sleep every step to watch more closely. Another related thing that I can't explain is that it always returns done==True rather quickly with very few sampled actions. These all make me worried about using it as my task environment.

In recent years, large neural networks trained for language understanding and generation have achieved impressive results across a wide range of tasks. GPT-3 first showed that large language models (LLMs) can be used for few-shot learning and can achieve impressive results without large-scale task-specific data collection or model parameter updating. More recent LLMs, such as GLaM, LaMDA, Gopher, and Megatron-Turing NLG, achieved state-of-the-art few-shot results on many tasks by scaling model size, using sparsely activated modules, and training on larger datasets from more diverse sources. Yet much work remains in understanding the capabilities that emerge with few-shot learning as we push the limits of …]]></summary>

 ​
 I really love creating music algorithmically, which is why I have dedicated my master’s thesis to the generation of music patterns by the use of artificial intelligence.
 In the course of the past 12 months, I have programmed a deep recurrent neural network in Python, which I have trained on 200 self-made music patterns in order to generate somehow novel motifs.
 ​
 In order to evaluate my model, I have set up a short online listening experiment.
 I’m looking for test subjects right now, so if you are interested in participating, I would really appreciate it.
 The listening experiment will take you just about 5 to 8 minutes to complete and the only thing you need is a pair of headphones.
 You can partake on your computer as well as on your smartphone or tablet.
 ​
 Here is the link which gets you to the listening experiment:
 https://forms.gle/rx1FUQ7RgpjMu1xx9

 Thank you very much for taking the time to help me reach my goal.
 Really appreciate it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello /r/reinforcementlearning. I have to choose electives pretty soon, and as i am interested in reinforcement learning, I wanted to know which of these would be the most beneficial. 
  
Monte Carlo Simulation
 Computational Learning Theory
  
The year after I will also take a course on Reinforcement Learning, but it has not been created yet. 
 Note: I can also take both if recommended, if I do so, I will take one of the courses before taking the RL course, and the other would be at the same time. 
 Some further thought I've had:
  
CLT includes Bandits, which is surely were useful to know, but it seems to be only a rather small part, and I'm unsure whether all the other topics like PAC Learning and Rademacher Bounds are useful?
 
MC is more practical while CLT is more theoretic (Apparently VERY theoretic according to the course description above). I am not afraid of theoretic courses, but I struggle more with them than more practical courses.
 
The sentiment around the MC course, is that it is pretty good. I don't know anyone who have taken the CLT course.
 
If I choose both, which order would you take them in?

 By creating a costum environment ray wants you to create an observationspace. That would be a gym box in my case. Anyway idk the exact high and low values. My values lay between -1 and 1 more or less. 
 My fear is now that ray would normalize the Observation values to a new range although they are already processed. Does ray normalized observationspace? If yes how can i turn it off?

My question is suppose one episode ends much before T. If I run that episode upto lenth T then it will only collect negative rewards in each timestep which in turn makes the training impossible as the return if very big negative number. So what can be done instead of this?
 I might be getting it wrong, so please correct me by commenting.

I need to test a model, based loosely on BERT, that classifies a piece of text as having right or left political ideology leaning and whether it promotes any racial or religious stereotypes.
 For training purpose we used SBIC, IBC, and Stereoset. Though these only contain short sentences which are labeled as belonging to only one of the above categories.
 Is anyone aware of any other Dataset which can be used for this purpose, which hopefully contains text labeled as promoting or containing a political leaning (left/right, conservative/liberal, neutral) and further either any racial or religious stereotypes?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm making a custom openAI gym environment to train various algorithms on it. I have encountered some issues. 
 My .flatten() method on the state class returns a large integer which can be converted back into the same state as the object. However when I try to do this as the returned observation for environment.reset() and environment.step(), when testing it I get: "AssertionError: The observation returned by the `reset()` method does not match the given observation space" which I can fix by having it just return a 0. How do I go about resolving this? and are there any better approaches for wanting to train RL agents on an environment? ty!

 Don't know if this is the right subreddit, but here goes....
 I'm looking to voice clone my father. He has passed recently, and despite being difficult for all, it's been especially hard for my mother, married early to him and together for 50 years. Her birthday is coming up, I'd love to be able to create a 5-10 second sound byte of him for her.
 Fortunately, there's likely to be lots of his voice recording around, part of his job was speaking and instructing.
 So, is there any way this is possible, to be done without great difficulty, and produce an accurate result?
 I am understanding the moralities of crafting something with his deceased voice. I thought about it quite a bit. However, I feel that it's for his soulmate who's struggling, who he had no qualms spending his life with and travelling abroad with, spent his last days with. I'm certain he would want to help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given that most benchmarks for image classification are based on regular, everyday world objects RGB images (or grayscale), what are some unconventional science cases where 2D inputs are substantially different from what we are used to perceive by eye? 
 For example, I'm interested in cases where spatial information can't be constrained to narrow pixel value ranges, such as exponential signals. Or that any standard normalisation (say min-max, zscore) and normalisation layers are not applicable and could lead to the loss of information.
 One of these cases is Astronomy. However, most practitioners try to to adapt the problem to established standards (say fake RGB images, log scaling flux images, etc). What are other cases out there where the nature of the 2D inputs are very distinct to what we are used to parse through our eyes and what deep nets are benchmarked on? I'm curious about tailored solutions that would intrinsically change the way the deep nets are constructed to solve the research question.

 I'm Atindriyo Sanyal, one of the founders of the ML company Galileo (https://rungalileo.io/). We're building a cool new tool/framework for ML practitioners that helps shine a light on the data you are training your models with.
 I'd love to get some feedback on the product, and since we're still in private beta, I'm looking for folks to try out the product on their datasets and models. It's easy to use and hooks into popular frameworks such as pyTorch, Tensorflow, Keras, SpaCy etc. 
 Caveat: Currently the tool only works for NLP use cases (think text classification, NER etc).
 I'll be giving $100 to folks who are willing to give some time to this and provide feedback on the usability of the product. If you're interested, here's a really tiny form (should take <1 minute to fill) for you to fill out. I'll review the applications and send you an email for a follow up Zoom chat where I'll share the software artifacts with you!
 https://docs.google.com/forms/d/11V20C_J_SyNaX7QL6DasnTe7f0UiueUyaKdmt3xL1oI/edit
 Look forward and happy (machine) learning!

 It’s relatively easy to formulate and use DQN type algorithms by using neural network and say pytorch + stochastic optimization but I want to try out some tree based methods. (at least to reproduce papers which claim to use them)
 But I don’t know 1) If we have to design the structures and learning algorithms by hand or is there any package I can use? 
 2) How should the learning be done? We obviously can’t go regression type learning because of the bootstrapping nature of the Bellman equation?

I'm not trying to sell anyone anything, but I want to look for feedback that will help me to build a better product.
 My current thoughts are
  
Ease of getting data into the platform
 Ease of getting data off of the platform
 Automation for spinning up and down instances
 Availability of the type of instance you want
 Price too high
 Not enough/too many abstractions
  
TIA and I look forward to some good discussions!

 We have released last week our paper "Efficient-VDVAE: Less is more" with code!
 We present simple modifications to the Very Deep VAE to make it converge up to 2.6x times faster and save up to 20x times memory load. We also introduce a gradient smoothing technique to improve stability during training. Our model achieves comparable or better negative log-likelihood (NLL) on 7 commonly used datasets.
 Additionally, we make an argument against existing 5-bit benchmarks. We empirically show as well that 3% of the latent space is enough to encode the data information without any performance loss. Thus, indicating the potential to efficiently leverage the Hierarchical VAE's latent space in downstream tasks.

Using a split/merge framework to change the clusters number adaptively and a novel loss, our proposed method outperforms existing (both classical and deep) nonparametric methods.
 While the few existing deep nonparametric methods lack scalability, we show ours by being the first such method that reports its performance on ImageNet.

 According to Salesforce AI Research, conversational AI programming is a new paradigm that brings this vision to life, thanks to an AI system that builds software.
 Introducing CodeGen: Creating Programs from Prompts
 The large-scale language model, CodeGen, which converts simple English prompts into executable code, is the first step toward this objective. The person doesn’t write any code; instead, (s)he describes what (s)he wants the code to perform in normal language, and the computer does the rest.
 Conversational AI refers to technologies that allow a human and a computer to engage naturally through a conversation. Chatbots, voice assistants, and virtual agents are examples of conversational AI.

 I'm wondering if there are some real life scenarios that I could use to create my own personal projects. Otherwise, I'd be fine with games. 
 I want to try all of it out from Dynamic Programming to crazy ass stuff like A3C, PPO and so on. I like RL, more so than any other form of ML, and I want to play around with it as a hobby. 
 This is really the area of ML for me. For starters, there are fundamentals behind it, so you can mostly explain why agents do one thing or another. Additionally, there isn't a need to have massive amounts of data. It's also the only type of ML that I've been able to successfully use with software engineering. 
 Designing the agent and the API it uses to take actions in an environment is as much a software engineering project as is creating a REST API. 
 I feel there is a lot of potential for me to go crazy with this, and I was wondering if people have any cool suggestions. Anything that is real time is anything that I want to do. Real time systems and RL are exactly the sort of thing I love to do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Confidence regions are the 2D version of a confidence interval. Almost everywhere in the literature, the shape is elliptic, but no justification is provided. You would think that a confidence region of level γ is defined as the domain of minimum area, covering a mass γ of the underlying probability distribution. That sounds perfectly logical, but it is mentioned nowhere. Based on this definition, the boundary of a confidence region is obtained by solving an optimization problem: it is a problem in calculus of variations -- finding a boundary curve encompassing a domain of minimum area. These problems are usually hard to solve, but in this case, the solution seems trivial: it must be a contour line. And if the underlying distribution is Gaussian, contour lines are obviously ellipses. This would be a solid justification as to why ellipses are so widespread.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The sensor to shooter timeline is affected by two main variables: satellite
positioning and asset positioning. Speeding up satellite positioning by adding
more sensors or by decreasing processing time is important only if there is a
prepared shooter, otherwise the main source of time is getting the shooter into
position. However, the intelligence community should work towards the
exploitation of sensors to the highest speed and effectiveness possible.
Achieving a high effectiveness while keeping speed high is a tradeoff that must
be considered in the sensor to shooter timeline. In this paper we investigate
two main ideas, increasing the effectiveness of satellite imagery through image
manipulation and how on-board image manipulation would affect the sensor to
shooter timeline. We cover these ideas in four scenarios: Discrete Event
Simulation of onboard processing versus ground station processing, quality of
information with cloud cover removal, information improvement with super
resolution, and data reduction with image to caption. This paper will show how
image manipulation techniques such as Super Resolution, Cloud Removal, and
Image to Caption will improve the quality of delivered information in addition
to showing how those processes effect the sensor to shooter timeline.]]></summary>

 What is amazing is its speed and memory efficiency after some optimization:
 With a single 2080Ti GPU and a 8 core AMD CPU, the training speed of rainbow for Atari could achieve 3000FPS, which means it can finish training of 10M frames within 1 hour. With compression of image frames, replay memory's RAM usage is down by 20%.
 I have tested several algorithms and games on Atari and get some initial result. Welcome to use and contribute!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am searching for regularization methods applied to DRL algorithms (either value or policy-based) to understand what has been done so far in the field. I cannot find any valid reference that studies the effect of applying a soft constraint to the reward function instead of to the policy objective. This may seem useless for some applications, but it is highly relevant for finance, which is my domain of application,
 The idea I have so far is that if you constrain the reward, it is like you are imposing limits on the agent's behavior. On the other hand, if you constrain the objective, you are not limiting the behavior, but you are correcting the ex-post the undesired behavior. The latter way does not allow the agent to learn not to behave in a certain way.
 ​
 Did anyone ever think about it? Are they good references that analyze the different effects of a constraint to whatever DRL algorithm?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Artificial Intelligence is being used in almost every aspect of life. AI symbolizes growth and productivity in the minds of some, but it is raising questions as well on the fairness, privacy, and security of these systems. Many legitimate issues exist, including biased choices, labor replacement, and a lack of security. When it comes to robots, this is very frightening. Self-driving automobiles, for example, can cause injury or death if they make mistakes. Responsible AI addresses these difficulties and makes AI systems more accountable.
 Responsible AI should fulfill the following aims:
  
Interpretability: We obtain an explanation for how a model makes predictions when we interpret it. An AI system makes predictions for a user. Even if these selections are correct, a user is likely to seek an explanation. Responsible AI can describe how we create interpretable models.
 Fairness: AI systems have the potential to make judgments that are biased towards particular groups of people. Bias in the training data is the source of this bias. The easier it is to assure fairness and rectify any bias in a model, the more interpretable it is. As a result, we need a Responsible AI framework to explain how we evaluate fairness and what to do if a model makes unjust predictions.
 Safety and Security: AI systems aren’t deterministic. When confronted with new situations, they are prone to making poor choices. The systems can even be tampered with to make unwise decisions. Therefore, we need to ensure safety and security in these systems.
 Data Governance: The data used must be of high quality. If the data used by AI has errors, the system may make wrong decisions.

 And they train LR model on Covid19 dataset [death/ didn't die] so it's binary classification problem However later on, they construct nomogram, which determines whether there is low/moderate/high risk of covid19 mortality. What I don't undestand is how they calculate the score the establish chances of death. E.G. If the score is <0.05 there is low possibility that patient will die.
 My general question is, how they constructed this nomogram from the binary classifier they had?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 there is a lot of work in the field of geometric deep learning for combinatorial optimization that yields good approximation algorithms for "hard" problems on graphs (see here), with the most prominent example being the TSP problem. However, as far as I can see, all these considered problems share the fact that the computed solution is a subset of the vertices/edges of the original graph. In my field (graph drawing), one of the most important considered properties is the crossing number). Hence, the solution would not consists of a labeling of the edges/vertices, but is rather a regression task on the whole graph. I have a dataset that consists of roughly 10000 graphs together with their crossing number. Treating the above problem as a supervised regression task and simply inserting the graph into a GNN does not work for me at all - is this a problem of my choice of architecture or is this sort of "function" that maps a graph to its crossing number something we can expect no current architecture to find.
 I appreciate any comment, even if it is just your intuition on the problem.
 Best regards,
 MrLemming

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was looking at this paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf) and came across this graph:
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/49ydy9bo61r81.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&s=729743449d6a99d2b84b81610e7e32d87ea4dfeb
 I am trying to understand the following two things about this graph:
 ​
  
What is PetaFLOP/s-days? I read that a PetaFLOP is 1,000,000,000,000,000 calculations (e.g. addition, subtraction). I am guessing that 10^2 would imply 100 * 1,000,000,000,000,000 calculations per day - is this correct? Is there any difference between PetaFLOP/days and PetaFLOP/s-days? (I also find it interesting they are probably referring to "computer resources" as simply "compute")
 What does "C" stand for in L = 2.57 * C^-0.048? I am guessing that the "dotted line" probably refers to the "average loss" for different Neural Networks with differing amounts of Parameters - but what exactly does "C" stand for?
 Finally, is there a reason that "Validation Loss" is not expressed as a percentage? For instance, what is a Validation Loss of 3? Is a Validation Loss of 3 the same as a Loss of 30%? Or does Validation Loss simply refer to the value of the Loss Function obtained during the Validation stage of Cross Validation?
  
Thank you!

 Are there papers, blogs, articles etc. that use more complex/deep models? Or maybe some methods that can deal with complicated scenes without deep models?

shots of an individual. MyStyle allows to reconstruct, enhance and edit images
of a specific person, such that the output is faithful to the person's key
facial characteristics. Given a small reference set of portrait images of a
person (~100), we tune the weights of a pretrained StyleGAN face generator to
form a local, low-dimensional, personalized manifold in the latent space. We
show that this manifold constitutes a personalized region that spans latent
codes associated with diverse portrait images of the individual. Moreover, we
demonstrate that we obtain a personalized generative prior, and propose a
unified approach to apply it to various ill-posed image enhancement problems,
such as inpainting and super-resolution, as well as semantic editing. Using the
personalized generative prior we obtain outputs that exhibit high-fidelity to
the input images and are also faithful to the key facial characteristics of the
individual in the reference set. We demonstrate our method with fair-use images
of numerous widely recognizable individuals for whom we have the prior
knowledge for a qualitative evaluation of the expected outcome. We evaluate our
approach against few-shots baselines and show that our personalized prior,
quantitatively and qualitatively, outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives.]]></summary>

meta-learning and relation networks for this use case. We propose improved
relation networks for speaker verification and few-shot (unseen) speaker
identification. The use of relation networks facilitates joint training of the
frontend speaker encoder and the backend model. Inspired by the use of
prototypical networks in speaker verification and to increase the
discriminability of the speaker embeddings, we train the model to classify
samples in the current episode amongst all speakers present in the training
set. Furthermore, we propose a new training regime for faster model convergence
by extracting more information from a given meta-learning episode with
negligible extra computation. We evaluate the proposed techniques on VoxCeleb,
SITW and VCTK datasets on the tasks of speaker verification and unseen speaker
identification. The proposed approach outperforms the existing approaches

for computer networks against adversarial transferability. Furthermore, we
investigate whether the transferability property issue holds in computer
networks applications. In our experiments, we first consider five different
attacks: the Iterative Fast Gradient Method (I-FGSM), the Jacobian-based
Saliency Map (JSMA), the Limited-memory Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shanno BFGS
(L- BFGS), the Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), and the DeepFool attack. Then,
we perform these attacks against three well- known datasets: the Network-based
Detection of IoT (N-BaIoT) dataset, the Domain Generating Algorithms (DGA)
dataset, and the RIPE Atlas dataset. Our experimental results show clearly that
the transferability happens in specific use cases for the I- FGSM, the JSMA,
and the LBFGS attack. In such scenarios, the attack success rate on the target
network range from 63.00% to 100%. Finally, we suggest two shielding strategies
to hinder the attack transferability, by considering the Most Powerful Attacks
(MPAs), and the mismatch LSTM architecture.]]></summary>

diversified applications that demand real-time interaction. However, due to the
mobility of the end-users and the dynamic edge environment, it becomes
challenging to handle the task offloading with high performance. Moreover,
since each application in mobile devices has different characteristics, a task
orchestrator must be adaptive and have the ability to learn the dynamics of the
environment. For this purpose, we develop a deep reinforcement learning based
task orchestrator, DeepEdge, which learns to meet different task requirements
without needing human interaction even under the heavily-loaded stochastic
network conditions in terms of mobile users and applications. Given the dynamic
offloading requests and time-varying communication conditions, we successfully
model the problem as a Markov process and then apply the Double Deep Q-Network
(DDQN) algorithm to implement DeepEdge. To evaluate the robustness of DeepEdge,
we experiment with four different applications including image rendering,
infotainment, pervasive health, and augmented reality in the network under
various loads. Furthermore, we compare the performance of our agent with the
four different task offloading approaches in the literature. Our results show
that DeepEdge outperforms its competitors in terms of the percentage of
satisfactorily completed tasks.]]></summary>

model-based reinforcement learning. Model-based RL has two main steps. First,
we systematically cover approaches to dynamics model learning, including
challenges like dealing with stochasticity, uncertainty, partial observability,
and temporal abstraction. Second, we present a systematic categorization of
planning-learning integration, including aspects like: where to start planning,
what budgets to allocate to planning and real data collection, how to plan, and
how to integrate planning in the learning and acting loop. After these two
sections, we also discuss implicit model-based RL as an end-to-end alternative
for model learning and planning, and we cover the potential benefits of
model-based RL. Along the way, the survey also draws connections to several
related RL fields, like hierarchical RL and transfer learning. Altogether, the
survey presents a broad conceptual overview of the combination of planning and

editing. To address its core challenge of attribute decoupling in a single
latent space, attempts have been made to adopt dual-space GAN for better
disentanglement of style and content representations. Nonetheless, these
methods are still incompetent to obtain plausible editing results with high
controllability, especially for complicated attributes. In this study, we
highlight the importance of interaction in a dual-space GAN for more
controllable editing. We propose TransEditor, a novel Transformer-based
framework to enhance such interaction. Besides, we develop a new dual-space

Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework in

representing high-dimensional distributions with structure. Recent years have
also seen big advances in designing multi-item mechanisms. Akin to overfitting,
however, these mechanisms can be extremely sensitive to the Bayesian prior that
they target, which becomes problematic when that prior is only approximately
known. At the same time, even if access to the exact Bayesian prior is given,
it is known that optimal or even approximately optimal multi-item mechanisms
run into sample, computational, representation and communication intractability
barriers.

We consider a natural class of multi-item mechanism design problems with very
large numbers of items, but where the bidders' value distributions can be
well-approximated by a topic model akin to those used in recommendation systems
with very large numbers of possible recommendations. We propose a mechanism
design framework for this setting, building on a recent robustification
framework by Brustle et al., which disentangles the statistical challenge of
estimating a multi-dimensional prior from the task of designing a good
mechanism for it, and robustifies the performance of the latter against the
estimation error of the former. We provide an extension of this framework
appropriate for our setting, which allows us to exploit the expressive power of
topic models to reduce the effective dimensionality of the mechanism design
problem and remove the dependence of its computational, communication and
representation complexity on the number of items.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi-agent reinforcement learning has made substantial empirical progresses
in solving games with a large number of players. However, theoretically, the
best known sample complexity for finding a Nash equilibrium in general-sum
games scales exponentially in the number of players due to the size of the
joint action space, and there is a matching exponential lower bound. This paper
investigates what learning goals admit better sample complexities in the
setting of $m$-player general-sum Markov games with $H$ steps, $S$ states, and
$A_i$ actions per player. First, we design algorithms for learning an
$\epsilon$-Coarse Correlated Equilibrium (CCE) in
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^5S\max_{i\le m} A_i / \epsilon^2)$ episodes, and an
$\epsilon$-Correlated Equilibrium (CE) in
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^6S\max_{i\le m} A_i^2 / \epsilon^2)$ episodes. This
is the first line of results for learning CCE and CE with sample complexities
polynomial in $\max_{i\le m} A_i$. Our algorithm for learning CE integrates an
adversarial bandit subroutine which minimizes a weighted swap regret, along
with several novel designs in the outer loop. Second, we consider the important
special case of Markov Potential Games, and design an algorithm that learns an
$\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibrium within
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(S\sum_{i\le m} A_i / \epsilon^3)$ episodes (when only
highlighting the dependence on $S$, $A_i$, and $\epsilon$), which only depends
linearly in $\sum_{i\le m} A_i$ and significantly improves over existing
efficient algorithm in the $\epsilon$ dependence. Overall, our results shed
light on what equilibria or structural assumptions on the game may enable
sample-efficient learning with many players.]]></summary>

recently emerge as a scalable alternative to reinforcement learning (RL)
approaches such as Q-learning or policy gradient, and are much faster when many
central processing units (CPUs) are available due to better parallelization. In
this paper, we propose a systematic incremental learning method for ES in
dynamic environments. The goal is to adjust previously learned policy to a new
one incrementally whenever the environment changes. We incorporate an instance
weighting mechanism with ES to facilitate its learning adaptation, while
retaining scalability of ES. During parameter updating, higher weights are
assigned to instances that contain more new knowledge, thus encouraging the
search distribution to move towards new promising areas of parameter space. We
propose two easy-to-implement metrics to calculate the weights: instance
novelty and instance quality. Instance novelty measures an instance's
difference from the previous optimum in the original environment, while
instance quality corresponds to how well an instance performs in the new
environment. The resulting algorithm, Instance Weighted Incremental Evolution
Strategies (IW-IES), is verified to achieve significantly improved performance
on challenging RL tasks ranging from robot navigation to locomotion. This paper
thus introduces a family of scalable ES algorithms for RL domains that enables
rapid learning adaptation to dynamic environments.]]></summary>

it comes to targeting the right candidates for reprocessing. This especially
applies when the underlying data collection is of considerable size and rather

Luxembourg to support those targeting decisions. They are crucial in order to
guarantee low computational overhead and reduced quality degradation risks,
combined with a more quantifiable OCR improvement. In particular, this work
explains the methodology of the library with respect to text block level

computationally expensive and adding new speakers to the dataset requires the
model to be re-trained. The naive solution of sequential fine-tuning of a model
for new speakers can lead to poor performance of older speakers. This
phenomenon is known as catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we look at TTS
modeling from a continual learning perspective, where the goal is to add new
speakers without forgetting previous speakers. Therefore, we first propose an
experimental setup and show that serial fine-tuning for new speakers can cause
the forgetting of the earlier speakers. Then we exploit two well-known
techniques for continual learning, namely experience replay and weight
regularization. We reveal how one can mitigate the effect of degradation in
speech synthesis diversity in sequential training of new speakers using these
methods. Finally, we present a simple extension to experience replay to improve
the results in extreme setups where we have access to very small buffers.]]></summary>

learning models to adversarial examples. Recent theoretical work proved that
adversarial examples are ubiquitous in two-layers networks with sub-exponential
width and ReLU or smooth activations, and multi-layer ReLU networks with
sub-exponential width. We present a result of the same type, with no
restriction on width and for general locally Lipschitz continuous activations.

More precisely, given a neural network $f(\,\cdot\,;{\boldsymbol \theta})$
with random weights ${\boldsymbol \theta}$, and feature vector ${\boldsymbol
x}$, we show that an adversarial example ${\boldsymbol x}'$ can be found with
high probability along the direction of the gradient $\nabla_{{\boldsymbol
x}}f({\boldsymbol x};{\boldsymbol \theta})$. Our proof is based on a Gaussian
conditioning technique. Instead of proving that $f$ is approximately linear in
a neighborhood of ${\boldsymbol x}$, we characterize the joint distribution of
$f({\boldsymbol x};{\boldsymbol \theta})$ and $f({\boldsymbol x}';{\boldsymbol

NLP field, but also vision and multimodal systems. However, although
visualization and interpretability tools have become available for NLP models,
internal mechanisms of vision and multimodal transformers remain largely
opaque. With the success of these transformers, it is increasingly critical to
understand their inner workings, as unraveling these black-boxes will lead to
more capable and trustworthy models. To contribute to this quest, we propose
VL-InterpreT, which provides novel interactive visualizations for interpreting
the attentions and hidden representations in multimodal transformers.
VL-InterpreT is a task agnostic and integrated tool that (1) tracks a variety
of statistics in attention heads throughout all layers for both vision and
language components, (2) visualizes cross-modal and intra-modal attentions
through easily readable heatmaps, and (3) plots the hidden representations of
vision and language tokens as they pass through the transformer layers. In this
paper, we demonstrate the functionalities of VL-InterpreT through the analysis
of KD-VLP, an end-to-end pretraining vision-language multimodal
transformer-based model, in the tasks of Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) and
WebQA, two visual question answering benchmarks. Furthermore, we also present a
few interesting findings about multimodal transformer behaviors that were
learned through our tool.]]></summary>

in addressing the challenge of climate change. One of the drawbacks of
wind-generated energy is the large space necessary to install a wind farm; this
arises from the fact that placing wind turbines in a limited area would hinder
their productivity and therefore not be economically convenient. This naturally
leads to an optimisation problem, which has three specific challenges: (1)
multiple conflicting objectives (2) computationally expensive simulation models
and (3) optimisation over design sets instead of design vectors. The first and
second challenges can be addressed by using surrogate-assisted e.g.\ Bayesian
multi-objective optimisation. However, the traditional Bayesian optimisation
cannot be applied as the optimisation function in the problem relies on design
sets instead of design vectors. This paper extends the applicability of
Bayesian multi-objective optimisation to set based optimisation for solving the
wind farm layout problem. We use a set-based kernel in Gaussian process to
quantify the correlation between wind farms (with a different number of
turbines). The results on the given data set of wind energy and direction
clearly show the potential of using set-based Bayesian multi-objective
optimisation.]]></summary>

identically distributed (i.i.d.) data. However, the performance of neural
networks often degenerates drastically when encountering out-of-distribution
(OoD) data, i.e., when training and test data are sampled from different
distributions. While a plethora of algorithms have been proposed for OoD
generalization, our understanding of the data used to train and evaluate these
algorithms remains stagnant. In this work, we first identify and measure two
distinct kinds of distribution shifts that are ubiquitous in various datasets.
Next, through extensive experiments, we compare OoD generalization algorithms
across two groups of benchmarks, each dominated by one of the distribution
shifts, revealing their strengths on one shift as well as limitations on the
other shift. Overall, we position existing datasets and algorithms from
different research areas seemingly unconnected into the same coherent picture.
It may serve as a foothold that can be resorted to by future OoD generalization
research. Our code is available at https://github.com/ynysjtu/ood_bench.]]></summary>

making deepfake detection a much-needed area of research. While researchers
have presented various techniques for detecting audio spoofs, it is often
unclear exactly why these architectures are successful: Preprocessing steps,
hyperparameter settings, and the degree of fine-tuning are not consistent
across related work. Which factors contribute to success, and which are
accidental? In this work, we address this problem: We systematize audio
spoofing detection by re-implementing and uniformly evaluating architectures
from related work. We identify overarching features for successful audio
deepfake detection, such as using cqtspec or logspec features instead of
melspec features, which improves performance by 37% EER on average, all other
factors constant. Additionally, we evaluate generalization capabilities: We
collect and publish a new dataset consisting of 37.9 hours of found audio
recordings of celebrities and politicians, of which 17.2 hours are deepfakes.
We find that related work performs poorly on such real-world data (performance
degradation of up to one thousand percent). This may suggest that the community
has tailored its solutions too closely to the prevailing ASVSpoof benchmark and
that deepfakes are much harder to detect outside the lab than previously
thought.]]></summary>

generalization performance in changing scenarios. In this paper, we aim to

transformer architecture, which is a relatively new and revolutionizing deep
learning model. The proposed hybrid architecture, referred to as the
Transformer for Hand Gesture Recognition (TraHGR), consists of two parallel
paths followed by a linear layer that acts as a fusion center to integrate the
advantage of each module and provide robustness over different scenarios. We
evaluated the proposed architecture TraHGR based on the commonly used second
Ninapro dataset, referred to as the DB2. The sEMG signals in the DB2 dataset
are measured in the real-life conditions from 40 healthy users, each performing
49 gestures. We have conducted extensive set of experiments to test and
validate the proposed TraHGR architecture, and have compared its achievable
accuracy with more than five recently proposed HGR classification algorithms
over the same dataset. We have also compared the results of the proposed TraHGR
architecture with each individual path and demonstrated the distinguishing
power of the proposed hybrid architecture. The recognition accuracies of the
proposed TraHGR architecture are 86.18%, 88.91%, 81.44%, and 93.84%, which are
2.48%, 5.12%, 8.82%, and 4.30% higher than the state-ofthe-art performance for
DB2 (49 gestures), DB2-B (17 gestures), DB2-C (23 gestures), and DB2-D (9
gestures), respectively.]]></summary>

6D pose and a grasp reference, our goal is to generate motions that move the
object to a target 6D pose. This is challenging, because it requires reasoning
about the complex articulation of the human hand and the intricate physical
interaction with the object. We propose a novel method that frames this problem
in the reinforcement learning framework and leverages a physics simulation,
both to learn and to evaluate such dynamic interactions. A hierarchical
approach decomposes the task into low-level grasping and high-level motion
synthesis. It can be used to generate novel hand sequences that approach,
grasp, and move an object to a desired location, while retaining
human-likeness. We show that our approach leads to stable grasps and generates
a wide range of motions. Furthermore, even imperfect labels can be corrected by
our method to generate dynamic interaction sequences.]]></summary>

achieve promising performance via end-to-end phoneme recognition. One challenge
of such end-to-end solutions is the scarcity of human-annotated phonemes on
natural L2 speech. In this work, we leverage unlabeled L2 speech via a
pseudo-labeling (PL) procedure and extend the fine-tuning approach based on
pre-trained self-supervised learning (SSL) models. Specifically, we use Wav2vec
2.0 as our SSL model, and fine-tune it using original labeled L2 speech samples
plus the created pseudo-labeled L2 speech samples. Our pseudo labels are
dynamic and are produced by an ensemble of the online model on-the-fly, which
ensures that our model is robust to pseudo label noise. We show that
fine-tuning with pseudo labels gains a 5.35% phoneme error rate reduction and
2.48% MDD F1 score improvement over a labeled-samples-only fine-tuning
baseline. The proposed PL method is also shown to outperform conventional
offline PL methods. Compared to the state-of-the-art MDD systems, our MDD
solution achieves a more accurate and consistent phonetic error diagnosis. In
addition, we conduct an open test on a separate UTD-4Accents dataset, where our
system recognition outputs show a strong correlation with human perception,

data; hence, label noise is inevitable. Training with such noisy data
negatively impacts the generalization performance of deep neural networks. To
combat label noise, recent state-of-the-art methods employ some sort of sample
selection mechanism to select a possibly clean subset of data. Next, an
off-the-shelf semi-supervised learning method is used for training where
rejected samples are treated as unlabeled data. Our comprehensive analysis
shows that current selection methods disproportionately select samples from
easy (fast learnable) classes while rejecting those from relatively harder
ones. This creates class imbalance in the selected clean set and in turn,
deteriorates performance under high label noise. In this work, we propose
UNICON, a simple yet effective sample selection method which is robust to high
label noise. To address the disproportionate selection of easy and hard
samples, we introduce a Jensen-Shannon divergence based uniform selection
mechanism which does not require any probabilistic modeling and hyperparameter
tuning. We complement our selection method with contrastive learning to further
combat the memorization of noisy labels. Extensive experimentation on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of UNICON; we obtain an 11.4%
improvement over the current state-of-the-art on CIFAR100 dataset with a 90%
noise rate. Our code is publicly available]]></summary>

focus on bad-classified examples and ignore well-classified examples that are
far from the decision boundary. For instance, when training with cross-entropy
loss, examples with higher likelihoods (i.e., well-classified examples)
contribute smaller gradients in back-propagation. However, we theoretically
show that this common practice hinders representation learning, energy
optimization, and margin growth. To counteract this deficiency, we propose to
reward well-classified examples with additive bonuses to revive their
contribution to the learning process. This counterexample theoretically
addresses these three issues. We empirically support this claim by directly
verifying the theoretical results or significant performance improvement with
our counterexample on diverse tasks, including image classification, graph
classification, and machine translation. Furthermore, this paper shows that we
can deal with complex scenarios, such as imbalanced classification, OOD
detection, and applications under adversarial attacks because our idea can
solve these three issues. Code is available at:

Omnivore is simple to train, uses off-the-shelf standard datasets, and performs
at-par or better than modality-specific models of the same size. A single
Omnivore model obtains 86.0% on ImageNet, 84.1% on Kinetics, and 67.1% on SUN

multi-label classification problem. In this paper, we reformulate this task as
a single-label prediction problem by encoding multiple binary labels into a
single label with the power set, which represents the possible combinations of
target speakers. This formulation has two benefits. First, the overlaps of
target speakers are explicitly modeled. Second, threshold selection is no
longer needed. Through this formulation, we propose the speaker embedding-aware
neural diarization (SEND) framework, where a speech encoder, a speaker encoder,
two similarity scorers, and a post-processing network are jointly optimized to
predict the encoded labels according to the similarities between speech
features and speaker embeddings. Experimental results show that SEND has a
stable learning process and can be trained on highly overlapped data without

perception. These two problems, however, are largely studied in isolation by
the community. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end approach for detection
and motion forecasting based on raw sensor measurement as opposed to ground
truth tracks. Instead of predicting the current frame locations and forecasting
forward in time, we directly predict future object locations and backcast to
determine where each trajectory began. Our approach not only improves overall
accuracy compared to other modular or end-to-end baselines, it also prompts us
to rethink the role of explicit tracking for embodied perception. Additionally,
by linking future and current locations in a many-to-one manner, our approach
is able to reason about multiple futures, a capability that was previously
considered difficult for end-to-end approaches. We conduct extensive
experiments on the popular nuScenes dataset and demonstrate the empirical
effectiveness of our approach. In addition, we investigate the appropriateness
of reusing standard forecasting metrics for an end-to-end setup, and find a
number of limitations which allow us to build simple baselines to game these
metrics. We address this issue with a novel set of joint forecasting and
detection metrics that extend the commonly used AP metrics from the detection
community to measuring forecasting accuracy. Our code is available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Motivated by the poor performance of cross-validation in settings where data
are scarce, we propose a novel estimator of the out-of-sample performance of a
policy in data-driven optimization.Our approach exploits the optimization
problem's sensitivity analysis to estimate the gradient of the optimal
objective value with respect to the amount of noise in the data and uses the
estimated gradient to debias the policy's in-sample performance. Unlike
cross-validation techniques, our approach avoids sacrificing data for a test
set, utilizes all data when training and, hence, is well-suited to settings
where data are scarce. We prove bounds on the bias and variance of our
estimator for optimization problems with uncertain linear objectives but known,
potentially non-convex, feasible regions. For more specialized optimization
problems where the feasible region is "weakly-coupled" in a certain sense, we
prove stronger results. Specifically, we provide explicit high-probability
bounds on the error of our estimator that hold uniformly over a policy class
and depends on the problem's dimension and policy class's complexity. Our
bounds show that under mild conditions, the error of our estimator vanishes as
the dimension of the optimization problem grows, even if the amount of
available data remains small and constant. Said differently, we prove our
estimator performs well in the small-data, large-scale regime. Finally, we
numerically compare our proposed method to state-of-the-art approaches through
a case-study on dispatching emergency medical response services using real
data. Our method provides more accurate estimates of out-of-sample performance
and learns better-performing policies.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spatial clustering has been widely used for spatial data mining and knowledge
discovery. An ideal multivariate spatial clustering should consider both
spatial contiguity and aspatial attributes. Existing spatial clustering
approaches may face challenges for discovering repeated geographic patterns
with spatial contiguity maintained. In this paper, we propose a Spatial
Toeplitz Inverse Covariance-Based Clustering (STICC) method that considers both
attributes and spatial relationships of geographic objects for multivariate
spatial clustering. A subregion is created for each geographic object serving
as the basic unit when performing clustering. A Markov random field is then
constructed to characterize the attribute dependencies of subregions. Using a
spatial consistency strategy, nearby objects are encouraged to belong to the
same cluster. To test the performance of the proposed STICC algorithm, we apply
it in two use cases. The comparison results with several baseline methods show
that the STICC outperforms others significantly in terms of adjusted rand index
and macro-F1 score. Join count statistics is also calculated and shows that the
spatial contiguity is well preserved by STICC. Such a spatial clustering method
may benefit various applications in the fields of geography, remote sensing,
transportation, and urban planning, etc.]]></summary>

statement's underlying accounting journal entries. Driven by advances in
artificial intelligence, deep-learning inspired audit techniques emerged to
examine vast quantities of journal entry data. However, in regular audits, most
of the proposed methods are applied to learn from a comparably stationary
journal entry population, e.g., of a financial quarter or year. Ignoring
situations where audit relevant distribution changes are not evident in the
training data or become incrementally available over time. In contrast, in
continuous auditing, deep-learning models are continually trained on a stream

where previous knowledge interferes with new information and will be entirely
overwritten. This work proposes a continual anomaly detection framework to
overcome both challenges and designed to learn from a stream of journal entry

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In classification problems, supervised machine-learning methods outperform
traditional algorithms, thanks to the ability of neural networks to learn
complex patterns. However, in two-class classification tasks like anomaly or
fraud detection, unsupervised methods could do even better, because their
prediction is not limited to previously learned types of anomalies. An
intuitive approach of anomaly detection can be based on the distances from the
centers of mass of the two respective classes. Autoencoders, although trained
without supervision, can also detect anomalies: considering the center of mass
of the normal points, reconstructions have now radii, with largest radii most
likely indicating anomalous points. Of course, radii-based classification were
already possible without interposing an autoencoder. In any space, radial
classification can be operated, to some extent. In order to outperform it, we
proceed to radial deformations of data (i.e. centric compression or expansions
of axes) and autoencoder training. Any autoencoder that makes use of a data
center is here baptized a centric autoencoder (cAE). A special type is the cAE
trained with a uniformly compressed dataset, named the centripetal autoencoder
(cpAE). The new concept is studied here in relation with a schematic artificial
dataset, and the derived methods show consistent score improvements. But tested
on real banking data, our radial deformation supervised algorithms alone still
perform better that cAEs, as expected from most supervised methods;
nonetheless, in hybrid approaches, cAEs can be combined with a radial
deformation of space, improving its classification score. We expect that
centric autoencoders will become irreplaceable objects in anomaly live
detection based on geometry, thanks to their ability to stem naturally on
geometrical algorithms and to their native capability of detecting unknown
anomaly types.]]></summary>

wireless setting is considered here. In our setup, the available limited
bandwidth resources are allocated in order to serve randomly arriving service
demands, which in turn belong to different classes in terms of payload data
requirement, delay tolerance, and importance/priority. In addition to
heterogeneous traffic, another major challenge stems from random service rates
due to time-varying wireless communication channels. Various approaches for
scheduling and resource allocation can be used, ranging from simple greedy
heuristics and constrained optimization to combinatorics. Those methods are
tailored to specific network or application configuration and are usually
suboptimal. To this purpose, we resort to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and
propose a distributional Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm
combined with Deep Sets to tackle the aforementioned problem. Furthermore, we

Standalone capsule networks have shown good results on comparatively simple

introducing deeper convolutional layers to extract important features before
passing through modules of capsule layers strategically to improve the

includes blocks of Squeeze-Excitation networks which use a stochastic sampling
approach for progressively reducing the spatial size thereby dynamically
recalibrating the channels by reconstructing their interdependencies without
much loss of important feature information. Extensive experimentation was done
using commonly used datasets demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed

in deep representation learning due to the data scarcity issues such as data
imbalance, unseen distribution, and domain shift. To address the
above-mentioned issues, a variety of methods have been devised to explore the
sample relationships in a vanilla way (i.e., from the perspectives of either
the input or the loss function), failing to explore the internal structure of
deep neural networks for learning with sample relationships. Inspired by this,
we propose to enable deep neural networks themselves with the ability to learn
the sample relationships from each mini-batch. Specifically, we introduce a
batch transformer module or BatchFormer, which is then applied into the batch
dimension of each mini-batch to implicitly explore sample relationships during
training. By doing this, the proposed method enables the collaboration of
different samples, e.g., the head-class samples can also contribute to the
learning of the tail classes for long-tailed recognition. Furthermore, to
mitigate the gap between training and testing, we share the classifier between
with or without the BatchFormer during training, which can thus be removed
during testing. We perform extensive experiments on over ten datasets and the
proposed method achieves significant improvements on different data scarcity
applications without any bells and whistles, including the tasks of long-tailed
recognition, compositional zero-shot learning, domain generalization, and
contrastive learning. Code will be made publicly available at

compositional generalisation. Whether neural networks exhibit this ability is
usually studied by training models on highly compositional synthetic data.
However, compositionality in natural language is much more complex than the
rigid, arithmetic-like version such data adheres to, and artificial
compositionality tests thus do not allow us to determine how neural models deal
with more realistic forms of compositionality. In this work, we re-instantiate
three compositionality tests from the literature and reformulate them for
neural machine translation (NMT). Our results highlight that: i) unfavourably,
models trained on more data are more compositional; ii) models are sometimes
less compositional than expected, but sometimes more, exemplifying that
different levels of compositionality are required, and models are not always
able to modulate between them correctly; iii) some of the non-compositional
behaviours are mistakes, whereas others reflect the natural variation in data.
Apart from an empirical study, our work is a call to action: we should rethink
the evaluation of compositionality in neural networks and develop benchmarks
using real data to evaluate compositionality on natural language, where

task-specific architectures and training objectives. As a result, it is hard to
transfer the learned knowledge and representations from one task to another,
thus restricting the generalization ability of existing recommendation
approaches, e.g., a sequential recommendation model can hardly be applied or
transferred to a review generation method. To deal with such issues,
considering that language grounding is a powerful medium to describe and
represent various problems or tasks, we present a flexible and unified
text-to-text paradigm called "Pretrain, Personalized Prompt, and Predict
Paradigm" (P5) for recommendation, which unifies various recommendation tasks
in a shared framework. In P5, all data such as user-item interactions, item
metadata, and user reviews are converted to a common format -- natural language
sequences. The rich information from natural language assist P5 to capture
deeper semantics for recommendation. P5 learns different tasks with the same
language modeling objective during pretraining. Thus, it possesses the
potential to serve as the foundation model for downstream recommendation tasks,
allows easy integration with other modalities, and enables instruction-based
recommendation, which will revolutionize the technical form of recommender
system towards universal recommendation engine. With adaptive personalized
prompt for different users, P5 is able to make predictions in a zero-shot or
few-shot manner and largely reduces the necessity for extensive fine-tuning. On
several recommendation benchmarks, we conduct experiments to show the
effectiveness of our generative approach. We will release our prompts and
pretrained P5 language model to help advance future research on Recommendation
as Language Processing (RLP) and Personalized Foundation Models.]]></summary>

effective in shape analysis and reconstruction tasks. Existing INRs require
point coordinates to learn the implicit level sets of the shape. When a normal
vector is available for each point, a higher fidelity representation can be
learned, however normal vectors are often not provided as raw data.
Furthermore, the method's initialization has been shown to play a crucial role
for surface reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a divergence guided shape
representation learning approach that does not require normal vectors as input.
We show that incorporating a soft constraint on the divergence of the distance
function favours smooth solutions that reliably orients gradients to match the
unknown normal at each point, in some cases even better than approaches that
use ground truth normal vectors directly. Additionally, we introduce a novel
geometric initialization method for sinusoidal INRs that further improves
convergence to the desired solution. We evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach on the task of surface reconstruction and shape space learning and
show SOTA performance compared to other unoriented methods. Code and model

objects using tools. Previous works have shown that differentiable physics
simulators provide gradients to the environment state and help trajectory
optimization to converge orders of magnitude faster than model-free
reinforcement learning algorithms for deformable object manipulation. However,
such gradient-based trajectory optimization typically requires access to the
full simulator states and can only solve short-horizon, single-skill tasks due
to local optima. In this work, we propose a novel framework, named DiffSkill,
that uses a differentiable physics simulator for skill abstraction to solve
long-horizon deformable object manipulation tasks from sensory observations. In
particular, we first obtain short-horizon skills using individual tools from a
gradient-based optimizer, using the full state information in a differentiable
simulator; we then learn a neural skill abstractor from the demonstration
trajectories which takes RGBD images as input. Finally, we plan over the skills
by finding the intermediate goals and then solve long-horizon tasks. We show
the advantages of our method in a new set of sequential deformable object
manipulation tasks compared to previous reinforcement learning algorithms and
compared to the trajectory optimizer.]]></summary>

drawn from a distribution similar to that of the training set. However, DNNs'
predictions are brittle and unreliable when the test samples are drawn from a
dissimilar distribution. This is a major concern for deployment in real-world
applications, where such behavior may come at a considerable cost, such as
industrial production lines, autonomous vehicles, or healthcare applications.
Contributions. We frame Out Of Distribution (OOD) detection in DNNs as a
statistical hypothesis testing problem. Tests generated within our proposed
framework combine evidence from the entire network. Unlike previous OOD
detection heuristics, this framework returns a $p$-value for each test sample.
It is guaranteed to maintain the Type I Error (T1E - incorrectly predicting OOD
for an actual in-distribution sample) for test data. Moreover, this allows to
combine several detectors while maintaining the T1E. Building on this
framework, we suggest a novel OOD procedure based on low-order statistics. Our
method achieves comparable or better results than state-of-the-art methods on
well-accepted OOD benchmarks, without retraining the network parameters or
assuming prior knowledge on the test distribution -- and at a fraction of the
computational cost.]]></summary>

mathematical models. More specifically, the weighted programs we investigate
are like usual imperative programs with two additional features: (1)
nondeterministic branching and (2) weighting execution traces. Weights can be

power series, or cardinal numbers. We argue that weighted programming as a
paradigm can be used to specify mathematical models beyond probability
distributions (as is done in probabilistic programming).

We develop weakest-precondition- and weakest-liberal-precondition-style

weighted programs. We present several case studies. For instance, we use
weighted programming to model the ski rental problem - an optimization problem.
We model not only the optimization problem itself, but also the best
deterministic online algorithm for solving this problem as weighted programs.
By means of weakest-precondition-style reasoning, we can determine the

making domains such as education, employment and driving automation. The
continued success of ML largely depends on our ability to trust the model we
are using. Recently, a new class of attacks called Backdoor Attacks have been
developed. These attacks undermine the user's trust in ML models. In this work,
we present NEO, a model agnostic framework to detect and mitigate such backdoor
attacks in image classification ML models. For a given image classification
model, our approach analyses the inputs it receives and determines if the model
is backdoored. In addition to this feature, we also mitigate these attacks by
determining the correct predictions of the poisoned images. An appealing
feature of NEO is that it can, for the first time, isolate and reconstruct the
backdoor trigger. NEO is also the first defence methodology, to the best of our
knowledge that is completely blackbox.

We have implemented NEO and evaluated it against three state of the art
poisoned models. These models include highly critical applications such as
traffic sign detection (USTS) and facial detection. In our evaluation, we show
that NEO can detect $\approx$88% of the poisoned inputs on average and it is as

requirement for safely deploying machine learning models. As reported in
RobustBench, even the state-of-the-art adversarially trained models struggle to

complementary way towards robustness is to introduce a rejection option,
allowing the model to not return predictions on uncertain inputs, where
confidence is a commonly used certainty proxy. Along with this routine, we find
that confidence and a rectified confidence (R-Con) can form two coupled
rejection metrics, which could provably distinguish wrongly classified inputs

coupling strategies to better detect and reject adversarial examples. We

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stochastic bilevel optimization generalizes the classic stochastic
optimization from the minimization of a single objective to the minimization of
an objective function that depends the solution of another optimization
problem. Recently, stochastic bilevel optimization is regaining popularity in
emerging machine learning applications such as hyper-parameter optimization and
model-agnostic meta learning. To solve this class of stochastic optimization
problems, existing methods require either double-loop or two-timescale updates,
which are sometimes less efficient. This paper develops a new optimization
method for a class of stochastic bilevel problems that we term Single-Timescale
stochAstic BiLevEl optimization (STABLE) method. STABLE runs in a single loop
fashion, and uses a single-timescale update with a fixed batch size. To achieve
an $\epsilon$-stationary point of the bilevel problem, STABLE requires ${\cal
O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ samples in total; and to achieve an $\epsilon$-optimal
solution in the strongly convex case, STABLE requires ${\cal O}(\epsilon^{-1})$
samples. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first bilevel optimization
algorithm achieving the same order of sample complexity as the stochastic
gradient descent method for the single-level stochastic optimization.]]></summary>

irregular glottal opening and low pitch. It occurs in diverse languages and is
prevalent in American English, where it is used not only to mark phrase
finality, but also sociolinguistic factors and affect. Due to its irregular
periodicity, creaky voice challenges automatic speech processing and
recognition systems, particularly for languages where creak is frequently used.

This paper proposes a deep learning model to detect creaky voice in fluent
speech. The model is composed of an encoder and a classifier trained together.
The encoder takes the raw waveform and learns a representation using a
convolutional neural network. The classifier is implemented as a multi-headed
fully-connected network trained to detect creaky voice, voicing, and pitch,
where the last two are used to refine creak prediction. The model is trained
and tested on speech of American English speakers, annotated for creak by
trained phoneticians.

We evaluated the performance of our system using two encoders: one is
tailored for the task, and the other is based on a state-of-the-art
unsupervised representation. Results suggest our best-performing system has
improved recall and F1 scores compared to previous methods on unseen data.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We propose Continuous Scene Representations (CSR), a scene representation
constructed by an embodied agent navigating within a space, where objects and
their relationships are modeled by continuous valued embeddings. Our method
captures feature relationships between objects, composes them into a graph
structure on-the-fly, and situates an embodied agent within the representation.
Our key insight is to embed pair-wise relationships between objects in a latent
space. This allows for a richer representation compared to discrete relations
(e.g., [support], [next-to]) commonly used for building scene representations.
CSR can track objects as the agent moves in a scene, update the representation
accordingly, and detect changes in room configurations. Using CSR, we
outperform state-of-the-art approaches for the challenging downstream task of
visual room rearrangement, without any task specific training. Moreover, we
show the learned embeddings capture salient spatial details of the scene and
show applicability to real world data. A summery video and code is available at

periodically generate a massive amount of time-series data yielding few million

it allows us to simultaneously identify anomalies present in the electricity

global sustainability. However, to date, the lack of large-scale annotated
energy consumption datasets hinders the ongoing research in anomaly detection.
We contribute to this effort by releasing a well-annotated version of a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We initiate a study of supervised learning from many independent sequences
("trajectories") of non-independent covariates, reflecting tasks in sequence
modeling, control, and reinforcement learning. Conceptually, our
multi-trajectory setup sits between two traditional settings in statistical
learning theory: learning from independent examples and learning from a single
auto-correlated sequence. Our conditions for efficient learning generalize the
former setting--trajectories must be non-degenerate in ways that extend
standard requirements for independent examples. They do not require that
trajectories be ergodic, long, nor strictly stable.

For linear least-squares regression, given $n$-dimensional examples produced
by $m$ trajectories, each of length $T$, we observe a notable change in
statistical efficiency as the number of trajectories increases from a few
(namely $m \lesssim n$) to many (namely $m \gtrsim n$). Specifically, we
establish that the worst-case error rate this problem is $\Theta(n / m T)$
whenever $m \gtrsim n$. Meanwhile, when $m \lesssim n$, we establish a (sharp)
lower bound of $\Omega(n^2 / m^2 T)$ on the worst-case error rate, realized by
a simple, marginally unstable linear dynamical system. A key upshot is that, in
domains where trajectories regularly reset, the error rate eventually behaves
as if all of the examples were independent altogether, drawn from their
marginals. As a corollary of our analysis, we also improve guarantees for the
linear system identification problem.]]></summary>

their repositories. An issue is a rich source of software information that
contains different reports including a problem, a request for new features, or
merely a question about the software product. As the number of these issues
increases, it becomes harder to manage them manually. Thus, automatic
approaches are proposed to help facilitate the management of issue reports.

This paper describes CatIss, an automatic CATegorizer of ISSue reports which
is built upon the Transformer-based pre-trained RoBERTa model. CatIss
classifies issue reports into three main categories of Bug reports,
Enhancement/feature requests, and Questions. First, the datasets provided for
the NLBSE tool competition are cleaned and preprocessed. Then, the pre-trained
RoBERTa model is fine-tuned on the preprocessed dataset. Evaluating CatIss on
about 80 thousand issue reports from GitHub, indicates that it performs very
well surpassing the competition baseline, TicketTagger, and achieving 87.2%
F1-score (micro average). Additionally, as CatIss is trained on a wide set of
repositories, it is a generic prediction model, hence applicable for any unseen
software project or projects with little historical data. Scripts for cleaning
the datasets, training CatIss, and evaluating the model are publicly available.]]></summary>

transfer knowledge in previous and related labeled datasets (sources) to a new
unlabeled dataset (target). Despite impressive progress, prior methods always
need to access the raw source data and develop data-dependent alignment
approaches to recognize the target samples in a transductive learning manner,
which may raise privacy concerns from source individuals. Several recent
studies resort to an alternative solution by exploiting the well-trained
white-box model from the source domain, yet, it may still leak the raw data
through generative adversarial learning. This paper studies a practical and
interesting setting for UDA, where only black-box source models (i.e., only
network predictions are available) are provided during adaptation in the target
domain. To solve this problem, we propose a new two-step knowledge adaptation
framework called DIstill and fine-tuNE (DINE). Taking into consideration the
target data structure, DINE first distills the knowledge from the source
predictor to a customized target model, then fine-tunes the distilled model to
further fit the target domain. Besides, neural networks are not required to be
identical across domains in DINE, even allowing effective adaptation on a
low-resource device. Empirical results on three UDA scenarios (i.e.,
single-source, multi-source, and partial-set) confirm that DINE achieves highly
competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art data-dependent approaches.

an infinite-dimensional ordinary differential equation (ODE) as the number of

monotone operators, which may be nonlinear), despite the lack of a spectral gap
in the NTK, we then prove that the limit neural network, which satisfies the
infinite-dimensional ODE, converges in $L^2$ to the PDE solution as the
training time $\rightarrow \infty$. More generally, we can prove that any fixed

of classification due to high quantization errors. Interestingly, however, we
observe that the quantization could provide comparable and often superior
accuracy, as the data to be quantized are sparse features generated with common

recommendation platform, to steer a population. We relate performative power to
the economic theory of market power. Traditional economic concepts are well
known to struggle with identifying anti-competitive patterns in digital
platforms--a core challenge is the difficulty of defining the market, its
participants, products, and prices. Performative power sidesteps the problem of
market definition by focusing on a directly observable statistical measure
instead. High performative power enables a platform to profit from steering
participant behavior, whereas low performative power ensures that learning from
historical data is close to optimal.

Our first general result shows that under low performative power, a firm
cannot do better than standard supervised learning on observed data. We draw an
analogy with a firm being a price-taker, an economic condition that arises
under perfect competition in classical market models. We then contrast this
with a market where performative power is concentrated and show that the
equilibrium state can differ significantly. We go on to study performative
power in a concrete setting of strategic classification where participants can
switch between competing firms. We show that monopolies maximize performative
power and disutility for the participant, while competition and outside options
decrease performative power. We end on a discussion of connections to measures
of market power in economics and of the relationship with ongoing antitrust
debates.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dealing with non-stationarity in environments (i.e., transition dynamics) and
objectives (i.e., reward functions) is a challenging problem that is crucial in
real-world applications of reinforcement learning (RL). Most existing
approaches only focus on families of stationary MDPs, in which the
non-stationarity is episodic, i.e., the change is only possible across
episodes. The few works that do consider non-stationarity without a specific
boundary, i.e., also allow for changes within an episode, model the changes
monolithically in a single shared embedding vector. In this paper, we propose
Factored Adaptation for Non-Stationary RL (FANS-RL), a factored adaption
approach that explicitly learns the individual latent change factors affecting
the transition dynamics and reward functions. FANS-RL learns jointly the
structure of a factored MDP and a factored representation of the time-varying
change factors, as well as the specific state components that they affect, via
a factored non-stationary variational autoencoder. Through this general
framework, we can consider general non-stationary scenarios with different
changing function types and changing frequency. Experimental results
demonstrate that FANS-RL outperforms existing approaches in terms of rewards,
compactness of the latent state representation and robustness to varying
degrees of non-stationarity.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Continual learning describes a setting where machine learning models learn
novel concepts from continuously shifting training data, while simultaneously
avoiding degradation of knowledge on previously seen classes (a phenomenon
known as the catastrophic forgetting problem) which may disappear from the
training data for extended periods of time. Current approaches for continual
learning of a single expanding task (aka class-incremental continual learning)
require extensive rehearsal of previously seen data to avoid this degradation
of knowledge. Unfortunately, rehearsal comes at a sharp cost to memory and
computation, and it may also violate data-privacy. Instead, we explore
combining knowledge distillation and parameter regularization in new ways to
achieve strong continual learning performance without rehearsal. Specifically,
we take a deep dive into common continual learning techniques: prediction
distillation, feature distillation, L2 parameter regularization, and EWC
parameter regularization. We first disprove the common assumption that
parameter regularization techniques fail for rehearsal-free continual learning
of a single, expanding task. Next, we explore how to leverage knowledge from a
pre-trained model in rehearsal-free continual learning and find that vanilla L2
parameter regularization outperforms EWC parameter regularization and feature
distillation. We then highlight the impact of the rehearsal-free continual
learning settings with a classifier expansion benchmark, showing that a
strategy based on our findings combined with a positive/negative label
balancing heuristic can close the performance gap between the upper bound and
the existing strategies by up to roughly 50%. Finally, we show that a simple
method consisting of pre-training, L2 regularization, and prediction
distillation can even outperform rehearsal-based methods on the common
CIFAR-100 benchmark.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Schizophrenia is a severe mental health condition that requires a long and
complicated diagnostic process. However, early diagnosis is vital to control
symptoms. Deep learning has recently become a popular way to analyse and
interpret medical data. Past attempts to use deep learning for schizophrenia
diagnosis from brain-imaging data have shown promise but suffer from a large
training-application gap - it is difficult to apply lab research to the real
world. We propose to reduce this training-application gap by focusing on
readily accessible data. We collect a data set of psychiatric observations of
patients based on DSM-5 criteria. Because similar data is already recorded in
all mental health clinics that diagnose schizophrenia using DSM-5, our method
could be easily integrated into current processes as a tool to assist
clinicians, whilst abiding by formal diagnostic criteria. To facilitate
real-world usage of our system, we show that it is interpretable and robust.
Understanding how a machine learning tool reaches its diagnosis is essential to
allow clinicians to trust that diagnosis. To interpret the framework, we fuse
two complementary attention mechanisms, 'squeeze and excitation' and
'self-attention', to determine global attribute importance and attribute
interactivity, respectively. The model uses these importance scores to make
decisions. This allows clinicians to understand how a diagnosis was reached,
improving trust in the model. Because machine learning models often struggle to
generalise to data from different sources, we perform experiments with
augmented test data to evaluate the model's applicability to the real world. We
find that our model is more robust to perturbations, and should therefore
perform better in a clinical setting. It achieves 98% accuracy with 10-fold
cross-validation.]]></summary>

gathered particular attention for human computer interaction. Radar sensors
possess multiple intrinsic properties, such as their ability to work in low
illumination, harsh weather conditions, and being low-cost and compact, making
them highly preferable for a gesture recognition solution. However, most
literature work focuses on solutions with a limited range that is lower than a
meter. We propose a novel architecture for a long-range (1m - 2m) gesture
recognition solution that leverages a point cloud-based cross-learning approach
from camera point cloud to 60-GHz FMCW radar point cloud, which allows learning
better representations while suppressing noise. We use a variant of Dynamic
Graph CNN (DGCNN) for the cross-learning, enabling us to model relationships
between the points at a local and global level and to model the temporal
dynamics a Bi-LSTM network is employed. In the experimental results section, we
demonstrate our model's overall accuracy of 98.4% for five gestures and its
generalization capability.]]></summary>

variety of downstream tasks, these models have been observed to overfit to the
domain from which the unlabelled data originates. To alleviate this issue, we
propose PADA (Pruning Assisted Domain Adaptation) and zero out redundant
weights from models pre-trained on large amounts of out-of-domain (OOD) data.
Intuitively, this helps to make space for the target-domain ASR finetuning. The
redundant weights can be identified through various pruning strategies which
have been discussed in detail as a part of this work. Specifically, we
investigate the effect of the recently discovered Task-Agnostic and Task-Aware
pruning on PADA and propose a new pruning paradigm based on the latter, which
we call Cross-Domain Task-Aware Pruning (CD-TAW). CD-TAW obtains the initial
pruning mask from a well fine-tuned OOD model, which makes it starkly different
from the rest of the pruning strategies discussed in the paper. Our proposed
CD-TAW methodology achieves up to 20.6% relative WER improvement over our
baseline when fine-tuned on a 2-hour subset of Switchboard data without
language model (LM) decoding. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed analysis to
highlight the key design choices of our proposed method.]]></summary>

However, we often lack the ability to explain why a specific architecture
attains superior predictive accuracy for a given data set. Often, validation
accuracy is used as a performance heuristic quantifying how well a network
generalizes to unseen data, but it does not capture anything about the
information flow in the model. Mutual information can be used as a measure of
the quality of internal representations in deep learning models, and the
information plane may provide insights into whether the model exploits the
available information in the data. The information plane has previously been
explored for fully connected neural networks and convolutional architectures.
We present an architecture-agnostic method for tracking a network's internal
representations during training, which are then used to create the mutual
information plane. The method is exemplified for graph-based neural networks
fitted on citation data. We compare how the inductive bias introduced in
graph-based architectures changes the mutual information plane relative to a

are less likely to be examined - and thus clicked - by users, in spite of their

Inverse-Propensity-Scoring (IPS) estimation. Unique about LTR is the fact that
standard Doubly-Robust (DR) estimation - which combines IPS with regression

a user examined an item - cannot be observed in the data. In this paper, we
introduce a novel DR estimator that uses the expectation of treatment per rank
instead. Our novel DR estimator has more robust unbiasedness conditions than
the existing IPS approach, and in addition, provides enormous decreases in
variance: our experimental results indicate it requires several orders of

approach to accelerating autoregressive translation with no quality loss,
through the collaboration of autoregressive and non-autoregressive translation

a number of tokens in parallel as a draft through NAT and then verifies them in
the autoregressive manner, where only the tokens that pass the verification are
kept as decoded tokens. GAD can achieve the same performance as autoregressive
translation but much more efficiently because both NAT drafting and
autoregressive verification are fast due to parallel computing. We conduct
experiments in the WMT14 English-German translation task and confirm that the
vanilla GAD yields exactly the same results as greedy decoding with an around
3x speedup, and that its variant (GAD++) with an advanced verification strategy
not only outperforms the greedy translation and even achieves the comparable

scaling up the size of training datasets and the number of parameters in the

the need to distribute computation on supercomputer clusters (e.g., TPUs),
prevent bottlenecks when infeeding data, and ensure reproducible results. In
this work, we present two software libraries that ease these issues:
$\texttt{t5x}$ simplifies the process of building and training large language
models at scale while maintaining ease of use, and $\texttt{seqio}$ provides a
task-based API for simple creation of fast and reproducible training data and
evaluation pipelines. These open-source libraries have been used to train
models with hundreds of billions of parameters on datasets with multiple
terabytes of training data.

Along with the libraries, we release configurations and instructions for
T5-like encoder-decoder models as well as GPT-like decoder-only architectures.

Speech2C, for encoder-decoder based automatic speech recognition (ASR). Within
a multi-task learning framework, we introduce two pre-training tasks for the
encoder-decoder network using acoustic units, i.e., pseudo codes, derived from
an offline clustering model. One is to predict the pseudo codes via masked
language modeling in encoder output, like HuBERT model, while the other lets
the decoder learn to reconstruct pseudo codes autoregressively instead of
generating textual scripts. In this way, the decoder learns to reconstruct
original speech information with codes before learning to generate correct
text. Comprehensive experiments on the LibriSpeech corpus show that the
proposed Speech2C can relatively reduce the word error rate (WER) by 19.2% over
the method without decoder pre-training, and also outperforms significantly the
state-of-the-art wav2vec 2.0 and HuBERT on fine-tuning subsets of 10h and 100h.]]></summary>

learn reusable locomotion skills for real legged robots. Our approach builds
upon previous work on imitating human or dog Motion Capture (MoCap) data to
learn a movement skill module. Once learned, this skill module can be reused
for complex downstream tasks. Importantly, due to the prior imposed by the
MoCap data, our approach does not require extensive reward engineering to
produce sensible and natural looking behavior at the time of reuse. This makes
it easy to create well-regularized, task-oriented controllers that are suitable
for deployment on real robots. We demonstrate how our skill module can be used
for imitation, and train controllable walking and ball dribbling policies for
both the ANYmal quadruped and OP3 humanoid. These policies are then deployed on
hardware via zero-shot simulation-to-reality transfer. Accompanying videos are

implicit probabilistic models in discrete spaces, supporting distributions that
are practically infeasible to sample from using classical means. One of the
possible applications of such models, also known as Born machines, is
probabilistic inference, which is at the core of Bayesian methods. This paper
studies the use of Born machines for the problem of training binary Bayesian
neural networks. In the proposed approach, a Born machine is used to model the
variational distribution of the binary weights of the neural network, and data
from multiple tasks is used to reduce training data requirements on new tasks.
The method combines gradient-based meta-learning and variational inference via
Born machines, and is shown in a prototypical regression problem to outperform
conventional joint learning strategies.]]></summary>

neural networks can successfully predict future traffic conditions 1 hour into
the future on simply aggregated GPS probe data in time and space bins. We thus
reinterpreted the challenge of forecasting traffic conditions as a movie
completion task. U-Nets proved to be the winning architecture, demonstrating an
ability to extract relevant features in this complex real-world geo-spatial
process. Building on the previous competitions, Traffic4cast 2021 now focuses
on the question of model robustness and generalizability across time and space.
Moving from one city to an entirely different city, or moving from pre-COVID
times to times after COVID hit the world thus introduces a clear domain shift.
We thus, for the first time, release data featuring such domain shifts. The
competition now covers ten cities over 2 years, providing data compiled from
over 10^12 GPS probe data. Winning solutions captured traffic dynamics
sufficiently well to even cope with these complex domain shifts. Surprisingly,
this seemed to require only the previous 1h traffic dynamic history and static
road graph as input.]]></summary>

demonstrated to flexibly generate singing with better qualities, compared to
conventional statistical parametric based methods. However, neural systems are
generally data-hungry and have difficulty to reach reasonable singing quality

data augmentation methods to boost the training of SVS systems, including
several strategies customized to SVS based on pitch augmentation and mix-up
augmentation. To further stabilize the training, we introduce the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent advances in neural text-to-speech research have been dominated by
two-stage pipelines utilizing low-level intermediate speech representation such
as mel-spectrograms. However, such predetermined features are fundamentally
limited, because they do not allow to exploit the full potential of a
data-driven approach through learning hidden representations. For this reason,
several end-to-end methods have been proposed. However, such models are harder
to train and require a large number of high-quality recordings with
transcriptions. Here, we propose WavThruVec - a two-stage architecture that
resolves the bottleneck by using high-dimensional Wav2Vec 2.0 embeddings as
intermediate speech representation. Since these hidden activations provide
high-level linguistic features, they are more robust to noise. That allows us
to utilize annotated speech datasets of a lower quality to train the
first-stage module. At the same time, the second-stage component can be trained
on large-scale untranscribed audio corpora, as Wav2Vec 2.0 embeddings are
time-aligned and speaker-independent. This results in an increased
generalization capability to out-of-vocabulary words, as well as to a better
generalization to unseen speakers. We show that the proposed model not only
matches the quality of state-of-the-art neural models, but also presents useful
properties enabling tasks like voice conversion or zero-shot synthesis.]]></summary>

task first proposed by Cui et al. (2021) in the Who's Waldo dataset. Given an
image and a caption, PCVG requires pairing up a person's name mentioned in a
caption with a bounding box that points to the person in the image. We find
that the original Who's Waldo dataset compiled for this task contains a large
number of biased samples that are solvable simply by heuristic methods; for
instance, in many cases the first name in the sentence corresponds to the
largest bounding box, or the sequence of names in the sentence corresponds to
an exact left-to-right order in the image. Naturally, models trained on these
biased data lead to over-estimation of performance on the benchmark. To enforce
models being correct for the correct reasons, we design automated tools to
filter and debias the original dataset by ruling out all examples of
insufficient context, such as those with no verb or with a long chain of
conjunct names in their captions. Our experiments show that our new sub-sampled
dataset contains less bias with much lowered heuristic performances and widened
gaps between heuristic and supervised methods. We also demonstrate the same
benchmark model trained on our debiased training set outperforms that trained
on the original biased (and larger) training set on our debiased test set. We
argue our debiased dataset offers the PCVG task a more practical baseline for
reliable benchmarking and future improvements.]]></summary>

interest in ESG grows, so does the need for investors to have access to
consumable ESG information. Since most of it is in text form in reports,

NLP techniques for classification tasks for ESG text. We hypothesize that an
ESG domain-specific pre-trained model will help with such and study building of
the same in this paper. We explored doing this by fine-tuning BERTs pre-trained

to its promising performance when compared to convolutional neural networks
(CNNs). As a result, many researchers have tried to incorporate ViT models in
hyperspectral image (HSI) classification tasks, but without achieving
satisfactory performance. To this paper, we introduce a new multimodal fusion
transformer (MFT) network for HSI land-cover classification, which utilizes
other sources of multimodal data in addition to HSI. Instead of using
conventional feature fusion techniques, other multimodal data are used as an
external classification (CLS) token in the transformer encoder, which helps
achieving better generalization. ViT and other similar transformer models use a
randomly initialized external classification token {and fail to generalize
well}. However, the use of a feature embedding derived from other sources of
multimodal data, such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR), offers the
potential to improve those models by means of a CLS. The concept of
tokenization is used in our work to generate CLS and HSI patch tokens, helping
to learn key features in a reduced feature space. We also introduce a new
attention mechanism for improving the exchange of information between HSI
tokens and the CLS (e.g., LiDAR) token. Extensive experiments are carried out
on widely used and benchmark datasets i.e., the University of Houston, Trento,
University of Southern Mississippi Gulfpark (MUUFL), and Augsburg. In the
results section, we compare the proposed MFT model with other state-of-the-art
transformer models, classical CNN models, as well as conventional classifiers.
The superior performance achieved by the proposed model is due to the use of
multimodal information as external classification tokens.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Model quantization is considered as a promising method to greatly reduce the
resource requirements of deep neural networks. To deal with the performance
drop induced by quantization errors, a popular method is to use training data
to fine-tune quantized networks. In real-world environments, however, such a
method is frequently infeasible because training data is unavailable due to
security, privacy, or confidentiality concerns. Zero-shot quantization
addresses such problems, usually by taking information from the weights of a
full-precision teacher network to compensate the performance drop of the
quantized networks. In this paper, we first analyze the loss surface of
state-of-the-art zero-shot quantization techniques and provide several
findings. In contrast to usual knowledge distillation problems, zero-shot
quantization often suffers from 1) the difficulty of optimizing multiple loss
terms together, and 2) the poor generalization capability due to the use of
synthetic samples. Furthermore, we observe that many weights fail to cross the
rounding threshold during training the quantized networks even when it is
necessary to do so for better performance. Based on the observations, we
propose AIT, a simple yet powerful technique for zero-shot quantization, which
addresses the aforementioned two problems in the following way: AIT i) uses a
KL distance loss only without a cross-entropy loss, and ii) manipulates
gradients to guarantee that a certain portion of weights are properly updated
after crossing the rounding thresholds. Experiments show that AIT outperforms
the performance of many existing methods by a great margin, taking over the
overall state-of-the-art position in the field.]]></summary>

networks, is a well-known technical and theoretical challenge. Recent work by
Mellor et al (2021) showed that there may exist correlations between the
accuracies of trained networks and the values of some easily computable
measures defined on randomly initialised networks which may enable to search
tens of thousands of neural architectures without training. Mellor et al used
the Hamming distance evaluated over all ReLU neurons as such a measure.
Motivated by these findings, in our work, we ask the question of the existence
of other and perhaps more principled measures which could be used as
determinants of success of a given neural architecture. In particular, we
examine, if the dimensionality and quasi-orthogonality of neural networks'
feature space could be correlated with the network's performance after
training. We showed, using the setup as in Mellor et al, that dimensionality
and quasi-orthogonality may jointly serve as network's performance
discriminants. In addition to offering new opportunities to accelerate neural
architecture search, our findings suggest important relationships between the
networks' final performance and properties of their randomly initialised

that using PINNs in comparison with purely data-driven neural networks is not
only favorable for training performance but allows us to extract significant

underlying differential equation for the PINN training is an ordinary
differential equation, we derive a rigorous upper limit on the PINN prediction
error. This bound is applicable even for input data not included in the

Therefore, our a posteriori error estimation is an essential step to certify

topic in advanced machine learning. There are several unanswered questions
about how learning under stochastic optimization really works and why certain
strategies are better than others. In this paper, we address the following
question: \textit{can we probe intermediate layers of a deep neural network to
identify and quantify the learning quality of each layer?} With this question
in mind, we propose new explainability metrics that measure the redundant
information in a network's layers using a low-rank factorization framework and
quantify a complexity measure that is highly correlated with the generalization
performance of a given optimizer, network, and dataset. We subsequently exploit
these metrics to augment the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer by
adaptively adjusting the learning rate in each layer to improve in

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Objective: The use of routinely-acquired medical data for research purposes
requires the protection of patient confidentiality via data anonymisation. The
objective of this work is to calculate the risk of re-identification arising
from a malicious attack to an anonymised dataset, as described below. Methods:
We first present an analytical means of estimating the probability of
re-identification of a single patient in a k-anonymised dataset of Electronic
Health Record (EHR) data. Second, we generalize this solution to obtain the
probability of multiple patients being re-identified. We provide synthetic
validation via Monte Carlo simulations to illustrate the accuracy of the
estimates obtained. Results: The proposed analytical framework for risk
estimation provides re-identification probabilities that are in agreement with
those provided by simulation in a number of scenarios. Our work is limited by
conservative assumptions which inflate the re-identification probability.
Discussion: Our estimates show that the re-identification probability increases
with the proportion of the dataset maliciously obtained and that it has an
inverse relationship with the equivalence class size. Our recursive approach
extends the applicability domain to the general case of a multi-patient
re-identification attack in an arbitrary k-anonymisation scheme. Conclusion: We
prescribe a systematic way to parametrize the k-anonymisation process based on
a pre-determined re-identification probability. We observed that the benefits
of a reduced re-identification risk that come with increasing k-size may not be
worth the reduction in data granularity when one is considering benchmarking
the re-identification probability on the size of the portion of the dataset
maliciously obtained by the adversary.]]></summary>

practice for learning a wide range of downstream tasks. The typical approach of
fine-tuning different models for each task is performant, but incurs a
substantial memory cost. To efficiently learn multiple downstream tasks we
introduce Task Adaptive Parameter Sharing (TAPS), a general method for tuning a
base model to a new task by adaptively modifying a small, task-specific subset
of layers. This enables multi-task learning while minimizing resources used and
competition between tasks. TAPS solves a joint optimization problem which
determines which layers to share with the base model and the value of the
task-specific weights. Further, a sparsity penalty on the number of active
layers encourages weight sharing with the base model. Compared to other
methods, TAPS retains high accuracy on downstream tasks while introducing few
task-specific parameters. Moreover, TAPS is agnostic to the model architecture
and requires only minor changes to the training scheme. We evaluate our method
on a suite of fine-tuning tasks and architectures (ResNet, DenseNet, ViT) and
show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance while being simple to
implement.]]></summary>

RNN-Transducer (RNN-T) for speech recognition is challenging. Recently, a class
of methods such as density ratio (DR) and ILM estimation (ILME) have been
developed, outperforming the classic shallow fusion (SF) method. The basic idea
behind these methods is that RNN-T posterior should first subtract the
implicitly learned ILM prior, in order to integrate the external LM. While
recent studies suggest that RNN-T only learns some low-order language model
information, the DR method uses a well-trained ILM. We hypothesize that this
setting is appropriate and may deteriorate the performance of the DR method,
and propose a low-order density ratio method (LODR) by training a low-order
weak ILM for DR. Extensive empirical experiments are conducted on both
in-domain and cross-domain scenarios on English LibriSpeech & Tedlium-2 and
Chinese WenetSpeech & AISHELL-1 datasets. It is shown that LODR consistently
outperforms SF in all tasks, while performing generally close to ILME and

based on accuracy and F1 score have become the de facto standard to measure the
performance of lane detection methods. While they have played a major role in
improving the performance of lane detection methods, the validity of this
evaluation method in downstream tasks has not been adequately researched. In
this study, we design 2 new driving-oriented metrics for lane detection:
End-to-End Lateral Deviation metric (E2E-LD) is directly formulated based on
the requirements of autonomous driving, a core downstream task of lane
detection; Per-frame Simulated Lateral Deviation metric (PSLD) is a lightweight
surrogate metric of E2E-LD. To evaluate the validity of the metrics, we conduct
a large-scale empirical study with 4 major types of lane detection approaches
on the TuSimple dataset and our newly constructed dataset Comma2k19-LD. Our
results show that the conventional metrics have strongly negative correlations
($\leq$-0.55) with E2E-LD, meaning that some recent improvements purely
targeting the conventional metrics may not have led to meaningful improvements
in autonomous driving, but rather may actually have made it worse by
overfitting to the conventional metrics. As autonomous driving is a
security/safety-critical system, the underestimation of robustness hinders the
sound development of practical lane detection models. We hope that our study
will help the community achieve more downstream task-aware evaluations for lane
detection.]]></summary>

Hankel nuclear norm regularization. Hankel regularization encourages the
low-rankness of the Hankel matrix, which maps to the low-orderness of the
system. We provide novel statistical analysis for this regularization and
carefully contrast it with the unregularized ordinary least-squares (OLS)
estimator. Our analysis leads to new bounds on estimating the impulse response
and the Hankel matrix associated with the linear system. We first design an
input excitation and show that Hankel regularization enables one to recover the
system using optimal number of observations in the true system order and
achieve strong statistical estimation rates. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that
the input design indeed matters, by showing that intuitive choices such as
i.i.d. Gaussian input leads to provably sub-optimal sample complexity. To
better understand the benefits of regularization, we also revisit the OLS
estimator. Besides refining existing bounds, we experimentally identify when
regularized approach improves over OLS: (1) For low-order systems with slow
impulse-response decay, OLS method performs poorly in terms of sample
complexity, (2) Hankel matrix returned by regularization has a more clear
singular value gap that ease identification of the system order, (3) Hankel
regularization is less sensitive to hyperparameter choice. Finally, we
establish model selection guarantees through a joint train-validation procedure
where we tune the regularization parameter for near-optimal estimation.]]></summary>

correspond to the set of dyadic subrectangles of the domain. The resulting
algorithms are near linear time computable in the sample size. We specifically
focus on the performance of these online algorithms in the context of
estimating piecewise polynomial and bounded variation function classes in the
fixed design setup. The simultaneous oracle risk bounds we obtain for these
estimators in this context provide new and improved (in certain aspects)
guarantees even in the batch setting and are not available for the state of the

performance for tasks in a wide task distribution. However, conventional
meta-RL, which learns meta-policies by randomly sampling tasks, has been
reported to show meta-overfitting for certain tasks, especially for easy tasks
where an agent can easily get high scores. To reduce effects of the
meta-overfitting, we considered meta-RL with curriculum-based task sampling.
Our method is Robust Meta Reinforcement Learning with Guided Task Sampling
(RMRL-GTS), which is an effective method that restricts task sampling based on
scores and epochs. We show that in order to achieve robust meta-RL, it is
necessary not only to intensively sample tasks with poor scores, but also to
restrict and expand the task regions of the tasks to be sampled.]]></summary>

controllable, moveable, and learnable masks as the observation area for the

POMDPs. Given that one does not yet exist, Mask Atari provides a challenging,
efficient benchmark for evaluating the methods that focus on the above problem.
Moreover, the mask operation is a trial for introducing the receptive field in
the human vision system into a simulation environment for an agent, which means
the evaluations are not biased from the sensing ability and purely focus on the
cognitive performance of the methods when compared with the human baseline. We
describe the challenges and features of our benchmark and evaluate several

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We introduce HyperMorph, a framework that facilitates efficient
hyperparameter tuning in learning-based deformable image registration.
Classical registration algorithms perform an iterative pair-wise optimization
to compute a deformation field that aligns two images. Recent learning-based
approaches leverage large image datasets to learn a function that rapidly
estimates a deformation for a given image pair. In both strategies, the
accuracy of the resulting spatial correspondences is strongly influenced by the
choice of certain hyperparameter values. However, an effective hyperparameter
search consumes substantial time and human effort as it often involves training
multiple models for different fixed hyperparameter values and may lead to
suboptimal registration. We propose an amortized hyperparameter learning
strategy to alleviate this burden by learning the impact of hyperparameters on
deformation fields. We design a meta network, or hypernetwork, that predicts
the parameters of a registration network for input hyperparameters, thereby
comprising a single model that generates the optimal deformation field
corresponding to given hyperparameter values. This strategy enables fast,
high-resolution hyperparameter search at test-time, reducing the inefficiency
of traditional approaches while increasing flexibility. We also demonstrate
additional benefits of HyperMorph, including enhanced robustness to model
initialization and the ability to rapidly identify optimal hyperparameter
values specific to a dataset, image contrast, task, or even anatomical region,
all without the need to retrain models. We make our code publicly available at
this http URL]]></summary>

Self-Supervised Audio Spectrogram Transformer (SSAST) model for speech and
audio classification. Specifically, we leverage the insight that the SSAST uses
a very high masking ratio (75%) during pretraining, meaning that the vast
majority of self-attention compute is performed on mask tokens. We address this
by integrating the encoder-decoder architecture from Masked Autoencoders are
Scalable Vision Learners (MAE) into the SSAST, where a deep encoder operates on
only unmasked input, and a shallow decoder operates on encoder outputs and mask
tokens. We find that MAE-like pretraining can provide a 3x speedup and 2x
memory usage reduction over the vanilla SSAST using current audio pretraining
strategies with ordinary model and input sizes. When fine-tuning on downstream
tasks, which only uses the encoder, we find that our approach outperforms the
SSAST on a variety of downstream tasks. We further conduct comprehensive
evaluations into different strategies of pretraining and explore differences in
MAE-style pretraining between the visual and audio domains.]]></summary>

Network (CNN) applied over SRP-PHAT power maps computed from the signals

rotational symmetries of the icosahedron, which represent a good approximation
of the continuous space of spherical rotations, and can be implemented using
standard 2D convolutional layers, having a lower computational cost than most
of the spherical CNNs. In addition, instead of using fully connected layers
after the icosahedral convolutions, we propose a new soft-argmax function that
can be seen as a differentiable version of the argmax function and allows us to
solve the DOA estimation as a regression problem interpreting the output of the
convolutional layers as a probability distribution. We prove that using models
that fit the equivariances of the problem allows us to outperform other

the collaborative training of a global model over decentralized local datasets
without sharing them. It spans a wide scope of applications from
Internet-of-Things (IoT) to biomedical engineering and drug discovery. To
support low-latency and high-privacy FL over wireless networks, in this paper,
we propose a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) empowered over-the-air FL
system to alleviate the dilemma between learning accuracy and privacy. This is
achieved by simultaneously exploiting the channel propagation reconfigurability
with RIS for boosting the receive signal power, as well as waveform
superposition property with over-the-air computation (AirComp) for fast model
aggregation. By considering a practical scenario where high-dimensional local
model updates are transmitted across multiple communication blocks, we
characterize the convergence behaviors of the differentially private federated
optimization algorithm. We further formulate a system optimization problem to
optimize the learning accuracy while satisfying privacy and power constraints
via the joint design of transmit power, artificial noise, and phase shifts at
RIS, for which a two-step alternating minimization framework is developed.
Simulation results validate our systematic, theoretical, and algorithmic
achievements and demonstrate that RIS can achieve a better trade-off between
privacy and accuracy for over-the-air FL systems.]]></summary>

65536 in MoCo for instance, for which the performance of a dictionary-free
framework is often inferior because the negative sample size (NSS) is limited
by its mini-batch size (MBS). To decouple the NSS from the MBS, a dynamic
dictionary has been adopted in a large volume of CL frameworks, among which
arguably the most popular one is MoCo family. In essence, MoCo adopts a
momentum-based queue dictionary, for which we perform a fine-grained analysis
of its size and consistency. We point out that InfoNCE loss used in MoCo
implicitly attract anchors to their corresponding positive sample with various
strength of penalties and identify such inter-anchor hardness-awareness
property as a major reason for the necessity of a large dictionary. Our
findings motivate us to simplify MoCo v2 via the removal of its dictionary as
well as momentum. Based on an InfoNCE with the proposed dual temperature, our
simplified frameworks, SimMoCo and SimCo, outperform MoCo v2 by a visible
margin. Moreover, our work bridges the gap between CL and non-CL frameworks,

to crack in condition monitoring of wind farms. Existing methods focus on
mechanism analysis of icing process, deviation degree analysis of feature
engineering. However, there have not been deep researches of neural networks
applied in this field at present. Supervisory control and data acquisition
(SCADA) makes it possible to train networks through continuously providing not
only operation parameters and performance parameters of wind turbines but also
environmental parameters and operation modes. This paper explores the
possibility that using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), generative
adversarial networks (GANs) and domain adaption learning to establish
intelligent diagnosis frameworks under different training scenarios.
Specifically, PGANC and PGANT are proposed for sufficient and non-sufficient
target wind turbine labeled data, respectively. The basic idea is that we
consider a two-stage training with parallel GANs, which are aimed at capturing
intrinsic features for normal and icing samples, followed by classification CNN
or domain adaption module in various training cases. Model validation on three
wind turbine SCADA data shows that two-stage training can effectively improve
the model performance. Besides, if there is no sufficient labeled data for a
target turbine, which is an extremely common phenomenon in real industrial
practices, the addition of domain adaption learning makes the trained model
show better performance. Overall, our proposed intelligent diagnosis frameworks
can achieve more accurate detection on the same wind turbine and more
generalized capability on a new wind turbine, compared with other machine
learning models and conventional CNNs.]]></summary>

of nonlinear systems with polynomial nonlinearities. Using the system's
input-output data, the proposed method computes a set that guarantees the
inclusion of the system's state in real-time. Although the system is assumed to
be a polynomial type, the exact polynomial functions, and their coefficients
are assumed to be unknown. To this end, the estimator relies on offline and
online phases. The offline phase utilizes past input-output data to estimate a
set of possible coefficients of the polynomial system. Then, using this
estimated set of coefficients and the side information about the system, the
online phase provides a set estimate of the state. Finally, the proposed
methodology is evaluated through its application on SIR (Susceptible, Infected,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Subgraph matching is a fundamental problem in various fields that use graph
structured data. Subgraph matching algorithms enumerate all isomorphic
embeddings of a query graph q in a data graph G. An important branch of
matching algorithms exploit the backtracking search approach which recursively
extends intermediate results following a matching order of query vertices. It
has been shown that the matching order plays a critical role in time efficiency
of these backtracking based subgraph matching algorithms. In recent years, many
advanced techniques for query vertex ordering (i.e., matching order generation)
have been proposed to reduce the unpromising intermediate results according to
the preset heuristic rules. In this paper, for the first time we apply the
Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) techniques to
generate the high-quality matching order for subgraph matching algorithms.
Instead of using the fixed heuristics to generate the matching order, our model
could capture and make full use of the graph information, and thus determine
the query vertex order with the adaptive learning-based rule that could
significantly reduces the number of redundant enumerations. With the help of
the reinforcement learning framework, our model is able to consider the
long-term benefits rather than only consider the local information at current
ordering step.Extensive experiments on six real-life data graphs demonstrate
that our proposed matching order generation technique could reduce up to two
orders of magnitude of query processing time compared to the state-of-the-art
algorithms.]]></summary>

real-life ATC test sets. It reaches up to 0.90/0.95 F1-score on ATCO/pilot SRD,
which means a 27% relative improvement on diarization error rate (DER) compared

in building today's best automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for
production. Similarly to the connectionist temporal classification (CTC)
objective, the RNN-T loss uses specific rules that define how a set of
alignments is generated to form a lattice for the full-sum training. However,
it is yet largely unknown if these rules are optimal and do lead to the best
possible ASR results. In this work, we present a new transducer objective
function that generalizes the RNN-T loss to accept a graph representation of
the labels, thus providing a flexible and efficient framework to manipulate
training lattices, e.g., for studying different transition rules, implementing
different transducer losses, or restricting alignments. We demonstrate that
transducer-based ASR with CTC-like lattice achieves better results compared to
standard RNN-T, while also ensuring a strictly monotonic alignment, which will
allow better optimization of the decoding procedure. For example, the proposed
CTC-like transducer achieves an improvement of 4.8% on the test-other condition

domain labeled data. To further facilitate labeling efficiency, we design a
dynamic scheduling policy to adjust the labeling budgets between domain
exploration and model uncertainty over time. Extensive experiments show that

optimization, are being explored across experimental sciences as an efficient
alternative to traditional design of experiment. When combined with automated
laboratory hardware and high-performance computing, these strategies enable
next-generation platforms for autonomous experimentation. However, the
practical application of these approaches is hampered by a lack of flexible
software and algorithms tailored to the unique requirements of chemical
research. One such aspect is the pervasive presence of constraints in the
experimental conditions when optimizing chemical processes or protocols, and in
the chemical space that is accessible when designing functional molecules or
materials. Although many of these constraints are known a priori, they can be
interdependent, non-linear, and result in non-compact optimization domains. In
this work, we extend our experiment planning algorithms Phoenics and Gryffin
such that they can handle arbitrary known constraints via an intuitive and
flexible interface. We benchmark these extended algorithms on continuous and
discrete test functions with a diverse set of constraints, demonstrating their
flexibility and robustness. In addition, we illustrate their practical utility
in two simulated chemical research scenarios: the optimization of the synthesis
of o-xylenyl Buckminsterfullerene adducts under constrained flow conditions,
and the design of redox active molecules for flow batteries under synthetic
accessibility constraints. The tools developed constitute a simple, yet

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our goal is to recover the 3D shape and pose of dogs from a single image.
This is a challenging task because dogs exhibit a wide range of shapes and
appearances, and are highly articulated. Recent work has proposed to directly
regress the SMAL animal model, with additional limb scale parameters, from
images. Our method, called BARC (Breed-Augmented Regression using
Classification), goes beyond prior work in several important ways. First, we
modify the SMAL shape space to be more appropriate for representing dog shape.
But, even with a better shape model, the problem of regressing dog shape from
an image is still challenging because we lack paired images with 3D ground
truth. To compensate for the lack of paired data, we formulate novel losses
that exploit information about dog breeds. In particular, we exploit the fact
that dogs of the same breed have similar body shapes. We formulate a novel
breed similarity loss consisting of two parts: One term encourages the shape of
dogs from the same breed to be more similar than dogs of different breeds. The
second one, a breed classification loss, helps to produce recognizable
breed-specific shapes. Through ablation studies, we find that our breed losses
significantly improve shape accuracy over a baseline without them. We also
compare BARC qualitatively to WLDO with a perceptual study and find that our
approach produces dogs that are significantly more realistic. This work shows
that a-priori information about genetic similarity can help to compensate for
the lack of 3D training data. This concept may be applicable to other animal
species or groups of species. Our code is publicly available for research
purposes at https://barc.is.tue.mpg.de/.]]></summary>

optimization from the minimization of a single objective to the minimization of
an objective function that depends the solution of another optimization
problem. Recently, stochastic bilevel optimization is regaining popularity in
emerging machine learning applications such as hyper-parameter optimization and
model-agnostic meta learning. To solve this class of stochastic optimization
problems, existing methods require either double-loop or two-timescale updates,
which are sometimes less efficient. This paper develops a new optimization
method for a class of stochastic bilevel problems that we term Single-Timescale
stochAstic BiLevEl optimization (STABLE) method. STABLE runs in a single loop
fashion, and uses a single-timescale update with a fixed batch size. To achieve
an $\epsilon$-stationary point of the bilevel problem, STABLE requires ${\cal
O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ samples in total; and to achieve an $\epsilon$-optimal
solution in the strongly convex case, STABLE requires ${\cal O}(\epsilon^{-1})$
samples. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first bilevel optimization
algorithm achieving the same order of sample complexity as the stochastic

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scene Graph Generation (SGG) remains a challenging visual understanding task
due to its compositional property. Most previous works adopt a bottom-up
two-stage or a point-based one-stage approach, which often suffers from high
time complexity or sub-optimal designs. In this work, we propose a novel SGG
method to address the aforementioned issues, formulating the task as a
bipartite graph construction problem. To solve the problem, we develop a
transformer-based end-to-end framework that first generates the entity and
predicate proposal set, followed by inferring directed edges to form the
relation triplets. In particular, we develop a new entity-aware predicate
representation based on a structural predicate generator that leverages the
compositional property of relationships. Moreover, we design a graph assembling
module to infer the connectivity of the bipartite scene graph based on our
entity-aware structure, enabling us to generate the scene graph in an
end-to-end manner. Extensive experimental results show that our design is able
to achieve the state-of-the-art or comparable performance on two challenging
benchmarks, surpassing most of the existing approaches and enjoying higher
efficiency in inference. We hope our model can serve as a strong baseline for
the Transformer-based scene graph generation. Code is available:

graph learning model. However, it can be notoriously challenging to inference
GCNs over large graph datasets, limiting their application to large real-world
graphs and hindering the exploration of deeper and more sophisticated GCN
graphs. This is because real-world graphs can be extremely large and sparse.
Furthermore, the node degree of GCNs tends to follow the power-law distribution
and therefore have highly irregular adjacency matrices, resulting in
prohibitive inefficiencies in both data processing and movement and thus
substantially limiting the achievable GCN acceleration efficiency. To this end,
this paper proposes a GCN algorithm and accelerator Co-Design framework dubbed
GCoD which can largely alleviate the aforementioned GCN irregularity and boost
GCNs' inference efficiency. Specifically, on the algorithm level, GCoD
integrates a split and conquer GCN training strategy that polarizes the graphs
to be either denser or sparser in local neighborhoods without compromising the
model accuracy, resulting in graph adjacency matrices that (mostly) have merely
two levels of workload and enjoys largely enhanced regularity and thus ease of
acceleration. On the hardware level, we further develop a dedicated two-pronged
accelerator with a separated engine to process each of the aforementioned
denser and sparser workloads, further boosting the overall utilization and
acceleration efficiency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate
that our GCoD consistently reduces the number of off-chip accesses, leading to
speedups of 15286x, 294x, 7.8x, and 2.5x as compared to CPUs, GPUs, and
prior-art GCN accelerators including HyGCN and AWB-GCN, respectively, while
maintaining or even improving the task accuracy. Codes are available at

encouraging potential to represent complex scenes with neural networks. One
major drawback of NeRF is its prohibitive inference time: Rendering a single
pixel requires querying the NeRF network hundreds of times. To resolve it,
existing efforts mainly attempt to reduce the number of required sampled
points. However, the problem of iterative sampling still exists. On the other
hand, Neural Light Field (NeLF) presents a more straightforward representation
over NeRF in novel view synthesis -- the rendering of a pixel amounts to one
single forward pass without ray-marching. In this work, we present a deep
residual MLP network (88 layers) to effectively learn the light field. We show
the key to successfully learning such a deep NeLF network is to have sufficient
data, for which we transfer the knowledge from a pre-trained NeRF model via
data distillation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
scenes show the merits of our method over other counterpart algorithms. On the
synthetic scenes, we achieve 26-35x FLOPs reduction (per camera ray) and 28-31x
runtime speedup, meanwhile delivering significantly better (1.4-2.8 dB average
PSNR improvement) rendering quality than NeRF without any customized
implementation tricks.]]></summary>

model-based reinforcement learning. Model-based RL has two main steps. First,
we systematically cover approaches to dynamics model learning, including
challenges like dealing with stochasticity, uncertainty, partial observability,
and temporal abstraction. Second, we present a systematic categorization of
planning-learning integration, including aspects like: where to start planning,
what budgets to allocate to planning and real data collection, how to plan, and
how to integrate planning in the learning and acting loop. After these two
sections, we also discuss implicit model-based RL as an end-to-end alternative
for model learning and planning, and we cover the potential benefits of
model-based RL. Along the way, the survey also draws connections to several
related RL fields, like hierarchical RL and transfer learning. Altogether, the
survey presents a broad conceptual overview of the combination of planning and

discovery. An ideal multivariate spatial clustering should consider both
spatial contiguity and aspatial attributes. Existing spatial clustering
approaches may face challenges for discovering repeated geographic patterns
with spatial contiguity maintained. In this paper, we propose a Spatial
Toeplitz Inverse Covariance-Based Clustering (STICC) method that considers both
attributes and spatial relationships of geographic objects for multivariate
spatial clustering. A subregion is created for each geographic object serving
as the basic unit when performing clustering. A Markov random field is then
constructed to characterize the attribute dependencies of subregions. Using a
spatial consistency strategy, nearby objects are encouraged to belong to the
same cluster. To test the performance of the proposed STICC algorithm, we apply
it in two use cases. The comparison results with several baseline methods show
that the STICC outperforms others significantly in terms of adjusted rand index
and macro-F1 score. Join count statistics is also calculated and shows that the
spatial contiguity is well preserved by STICC. Such a spatial clustering method
may benefit various applications in the fields of geography, remote sensing,
transportation, and urban planning, etc.]]></summary>

in the NTK, we then prove that the limit neural network, which satisfies the
infinite-dimensional ODE, converges in $L^2$ to the PDE solution as the
training time $\rightarrow \infty$. More generally, we can prove that any fixed

computationally and/or financially expensive. Mono-surrogate Bayesian
optimisation (BO) is a popular model-based approach for optimising such
black-box functions. It combines objective values via scalarisation and builds
a Gaussian process (GP) surrogate of the scalarised values. The location which
maximises a cheap-to-query acquisition function is chosen as the next location
to expensively evaluate. While BO is an effective strategy, the use of GPs is
limiting. Their performance decreases as the problem input dimensionality
increases, and their computational complexity scales cubically with the amount
of data. To address these limitations, we extend previous work on BO by
density-ratio estimation (BORE) to the multi-objective setting. BORE links the
computation of the probability of improvement acquisition function to that of
probabilistic classification. This enables the use of state-of-the-art
classifiers in a BO-like framework. In this work we present MBORE:
multi-objective Bayesian optimisation by density-ratio estimation, and compare
it to BO across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks. We find that
MBORE performs as well as or better than BO on a wide variety of problems, and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We initiate a study of supervised learning from many independent sequences
("trajectories") of non-independent covariates, reflecting tasks in sequence
modeling, control, and reinforcement learning. Conceptually, our
multi-trajectory setup sits between two traditional settings in statistical
learning theory: learning from independent examples and learning from a single
auto-correlated sequence. Our conditions for efficient learning generalize the
former setting--trajectories must be non-degenerate in ways that extend
standard requirements for independent examples. They do not require that
trajectories be ergodic, long, nor strictly stable.

For linear least-squares regression, given $n$-dimensional examples produced
by $m$ trajectories, each of length $T$, we observe a notable change in
statistical efficiency as the number of trajectories increases from a few
(namely $m \lesssim n$) to many (namely $m \gtrsim n$). Specifically, we
establish that the worst-case error rate this problem is $\Theta(n / m T)$
whenever $m \gtrsim n$. Meanwhile, when $m \lesssim n$, we establish a (sharp)
lower bound of $\Omega(n^2 / m^2 T)$ on the worst-case error rate, realized by
a simple, marginally unstable linear dynamical system. A key upshot is that, in
domains where trajectories regularly reset, the error rate eventually behaves
as if all of the examples were independent altogether, drawn from their
marginals. As a corollary of our analysis, we also improve guarantees for the
linear system identification problem.]]></summary>

that its time-varying spectral envelope becomes close to the conditioning
log-mel spectrogram. This adaptation by time-varying filtering improves the
sound quality especially in the high-frequency bands. It is processed in the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi-agent reinforcement learning has made substantial empirical progresses
in solving games with a large number of players. However, theoretically, the
best known sample complexity for finding a Nash equilibrium in general-sum
games scales exponentially in the number of players due to the size of the
joint action space, and there is a matching exponential lower bound. This paper
investigates what learning goals admit better sample complexities in the
setting of $m$-player general-sum Markov games with $H$ steps, $S$ states, and
$A_i$ actions per player. First, we design algorithms for learning an
$\epsilon$-Coarse Correlated Equilibrium (CCE) in
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^5S\max_{i\le m} A_i / \epsilon^2)$ episodes, and an
$\epsilon$-Correlated Equilibrium (CE) in
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^6S\max_{i\le m} A_i^2 / \epsilon^2)$ episodes. This
is the first line of results for learning CCE and CE with sample complexities
polynomial in $\max_{i\le m} A_i$. Our algorithm for learning CE integrates an
adversarial bandit subroutine which minimizes a weighted swap regret, along
with several novel designs in the outer loop. Second, we consider the important
special case of Markov Potential Games, and design an algorithm that learns an
$\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibrium within
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(S\sum_{i\le m} A_i / \epsilon^3)$ episodes (when only
highlighting the dependence on $S$, $A_i$, and $\epsilon$), which only depends
linearly in $\sum_{i\le m} A_i$ and significantly improves over existing
efficient algorithm in the $\epsilon$ dependence. Overall, our results shed
light on what equilibria or structural assumptions on the game may enable
sample-efficient learning with many players.]]></summary>

that has found widespread applications. Examples include selecting offers,
prices, advertisements to send to customers, as well as selecting which
medication to prescribe to a patient. However, existing literature rests on the
crucial assumption that the future environment where the learned policy will be
deployed is the same as the past environment that has generated the data -- an
assumption that is often false or too coarse an approximation. In this paper,
we lift this assumption and aim to learn a distributionally robust policy with
incomplete observational data. We first present a policy evaluation procedure
that allows us to assess how well the policy does under the worst-case
environment shift. We then establish a central limit theorem type guarantee for
this proposed policy evaluation scheme. Leveraging this evaluation scheme, we
further propose a novel learning algorithm that is able to learn a policy that
is robust to adversarial perturbations and unknown covariate shifts with a
performance guarantee based on the theory of uniform convergence. Finally, we
empirically test the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in synthetic
datasets and demonstrate that it provides the robustness that is missing using
standard policy learning algorithms. We conclude the paper by providing a
comprehensive application of our methods in the context of a real-world voting

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background. Commonly, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) generalize well on samples
drawn from a distribution similar to that of the training set. However, DNNs'
predictions are brittle and unreliable when the test samples are drawn from a
dissimilar distribution. This is a major concern for deployment in real-world
applications, where such behavior may come at a considerable cost, such as
industrial production lines, autonomous vehicles, or healthcare applications.
Contributions. We frame Out Of Distribution (OOD) detection in DNNs as a
statistical hypothesis testing problem. Tests generated within our proposed
framework combine evidence from the entire network. Unlike previous OOD
detection heuristics, this framework returns a $p$-value for each test sample.
It is guaranteed to maintain the Type I Error (T1E - incorrectly predicting OOD
for an actual in-distribution sample) for test data. Moreover, this allows to
combine several detectors while maintaining the T1E. Building on this
framework, we suggest a novel OOD procedure based on low-order statistics. Our
method achieves comparable or better results than state-of-the-art methods on
well-accepted OOD benchmarks, without retraining the network parameters or
assuming prior knowledge on the test distribution -- and at a fraction of the
computational cost.]]></summary>

subsets of features. We use group testing to improve the complexity of the
approach. We theoretically prove the correctness of the proposed algorithm to
identify features that ensure interventional fairness and show that sub-linear
conditional independence tests are sufficient to identify these variables. A

commonly used for multi-object matching, often involve computation-intensive
and memory-demanding matrix operations. These operations become intractable for
large scale structure-from-motion datasets. For pure permutation
synchronization, the recent Cycle-Edge Message Passing (CEMP) framework
suggests a memory-efficient and fast solution. Here we overcome the restriction
of CEMP to compact groups and propose an improved algorithm, CEMP-Partial, for
estimating the corruption levels of the observed partial permutations. It
allows us to subsequently implement a nonconvex weighted projected power method
without the need of spectral initialization. The resulting new PPS algorithm,
MatchFAME (Fast, Accurate and Memory-Efficient Matching), only involves sparse
matrix operations, and thus enjoys lower time and space complexities in
comparison to previous PPS algorithms. We prove that under adversarial
corruption, though without additive noise and with certain assumptions,
CEMP-Partial is able to exactly classify corrupted and clean partial
permutations. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art accuracy, speed and memory

neural networks (DNNs) and improve performances in single-channel and
user-independent brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) with small data lengths.
Approach: We propose the utilization of filter banks (creating sub-band
components of the EEG signal) in conjunction with DNNs. In this context, we
created three different models: a recurrent neural network (FBRNN) analyzing
the time domain, a 2D convolutional neural network (FBCNN-2D) processing
complex spectrum features and a 3D convolutional neural network (FBCNN-3D)
analyzing complex spectrograms, which we introduce in this study as possible
input for SSVEP classification. We tested our neural networks on three open
datasets and conceived them so as not to require calibration from the final
user, simulating a user-independent BCI. Results: The DNNs with the filter
banks surpassed the accuracy of similar networks without this preprocessing
step by considerable margins, and they outperformed common SSVEP classification
methods (SVM and FBCCA) by even higher margins. Conclusion and significance:
Filter banks allow different types of deep neural networks to more efficiently
analyze the harmonic components of SSVEP. Complex spectrograms carry more
information than complex spectrum features and the magnitude spectrum, allowing
the FBCNN-3D to surpass the other CNNs. The performances obtained in the
challenging classification problems indicates a strong potential for the
construction of portable, economical, fast and low-latency BCIs.]]></summary>

privacy-preserving, distributed learning with a network of clients (i.e., edge
devices). However, the data distribution among clients is often non-IID in
nature, making efficient optimization difficult. To alleviate this issue, many
FL algorithms focus on mitigating the effects of data heterogeneity across
clients by introducing a variety of proximal terms, some incurring considerable
compute and/or memory overheads, to restrain local updates with respect to the
global model. Instead, we consider rethinking solutions to data heterogeneity
in FL with a focus on local learning generality rather than proximal
restriction. To this end, we first present a systematic study informed by
second-order indicators to better understand algorithm effectiveness in FL.
Interestingly, we find that standard regularization methods are surprisingly
strong performers in mitigating data heterogeneity effects. Based on our
findings, we further propose a simple and effective method, FedAlign, to
overcome data heterogeneity and the pitfalls of previous methods. FedAlign

computationally and/or financially expensive. Mono-surrogate Bayesian
optimisation (BO) is a popular model-based approach for optimising such
black-box functions. It combines objective values via scalarisation and builds
a Gaussian process (GP) surrogate of the scalarised values. The location which
maximises a cheap-to-query acquisition function is chosen as the next location
to expensively evaluate. While BO is an effective strategy, the use of GPs is
limiting. Their performance decreases as the problem input dimensionality
increases, and their computational complexity scales cubically with the amount
of data. To address these limitations, we extend previous work on BO by
density-ratio estimation (BORE) to the multi-objective setting. BORE links the
computation of the probability of improvement acquisition function to that of
probabilistic classification. This enables the use of state-of-the-art
classifiers in a BO-like framework. In this work we present MBORE:
multi-objective Bayesian optimisation by density-ratio estimation, and compare
it to BO across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks. We find that
MBORE performs as well as or better than BO on a wide variety of problems, and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In transportation networks, users typically choose routes in a decentralized
and self-interested manner to minimize their individual travel costs, which, in
practice, often results in inefficient overall outcomes for society. As a
result, there has been a growing interest in designing road tolling schemes to
cope with these efficiency losses and steer users toward a system-efficient
traffic pattern. However, the efficacy of road tolling schemes often relies on
having access to complete information on users' trip attributes, such as their
origin-destination (O-D) travel information and their values of time, which may
not be available in practice.

Motivated by this practical consideration, we propose an online learning
approach to set tolls in a traffic network to drive heterogeneous users with
different values of time toward a system-efficient traffic pattern. In
particular, we develop a simple yet effective algorithm that adjusts tolls at
each time period solely based on the observed aggregate flows on the roads of
the network without relying on any additional trip attributes of users, thereby
preserving user privacy. In the setting where the O-D pairs and values of time
of users are drawn i.i.d. at each period, we show that our approach obtains an
expected regret and road capacity violation of $O(\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the
number of periods over which tolls are updated. Our regret guarantee is
relative to an offline oracle that has complete information on users' trip
attributes. We further establish a $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ lower bound on the regret
of any algorithm, which establishes that our algorithm is optimal up to
constants. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of our approach
relative to several benchmarks on a real-world transportation network, thereby
highlighting its practical applicability.]]></summary>

learn the probability density function of data via a sequence of invertible
transformations. Yet, learning attentions in generative flows remains
understudied, while it has made breakthroughs in other domains. To fill the
gap, this paper introduces two types of invertible attention mechanisms, i.e.,
map-based and transformer-based attentions, for both unconditional and
conditional generative flows. The key idea is to exploit a masked scheme of
these two attentions to learn long-range data dependencies in the context of
generative flows. The masked scheme allows for invertible attention modules
with tractable Jacobian determinants, enabling its seamless integration at any
positions of the flow-based models. The proposed attention mechanisms lead to
more efficient generative flows, due to their capability of modeling the
long-term data dependencies. Evaluation on multiple image synthesis tasks shows
that the proposed attention flows result in efficient models and compare
favorably against the state-of-the-art unconditional and conditional generative
flows.]]></summary>

topics in social media and new types of products in e-commerce. A model should
recognize new classes and meanwhile maintain discriminability over old classes.
Under severe circumstances, only limited novel instances are available to
incrementally update the model. The task of recognizing few-shot new classes
without forgetting old classes is called few-shot class-incremental learning
(FSCIL). In this work, we propose a new paradigm for FSCIL based on
meta-learning by LearnIng Multi-phase Incremental Tasks (LIMIT), which
synthesizes fake FSCIL tasks from the base dataset. The data format of fake
tasks is consistent with the `real' incremental tasks, and we can build a
generalizable feature space for the unseen tasks through meta-learning.
Besides, LIMIT also constructs a calibration module based on transformer, which
calibrates the old class classifiers and new class prototypes into the same
scale and fills in the semantic gap. The calibration module also adaptively
contextualizes the instance-specific embedding with a set-to-set function.
LIMIT efficiently adapts to new classes and meanwhile resists forgetting over
old classes. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (CIFAR100, miniImageNet,
and CUB200) and large-scale dataset, i.e., ImageNet ILSVRC2012 validate that
LIMIT achieves state-of-the-art performance.]]></summary>

bachelor selects his wife from a pool of approximately 30 female contestants
over eight weeks of filming (American Broadcasting Company 2002). We collected
the following data on all 422 contestants that participated in seasons 11
through 25: their Age, Hometown, Career, Race, Week they got their first 1-on-1
date, whether they got the first impression rose, and what "place" they ended
up getting. We then trained three machine learning models to predict the ideal
characteristics of a successful contestant on $\textit{The Bachelor}$. The
three algorithms that we tested were: random forest classification, neural
networks, and linear regression. We found consistency across all three models,
although the neural network performed the best overall. Our models found that a
woman has the highest probability of progressing far on $\textit{The Bachelor}$
if she is: 26 years old, white, from the Northwest, works as an dancer,
received a 1-on-1 in week 6, and did not receive the First Impression Rose. Our
methodology is broadly applicable to all romantic reality television, and our
results will inform future $\textit{The Bachelor}$ production and contestant
strategies. While our models were relatively successful, we still encountered
high misclassification rates. This may be because: (1) Our training dataset had
fewer than 400 points or (2) Our models were too simple to parameterize the
complex romantic connections contestants forge over the course of a season.]]></summary>

affect cognition, emotion and behaviour with potentially detrimental effects on
health in the case of sustained exposure. Since the affective content of speech
is inherently modulated by an individual's physical and mental state, a
substantial body of research has been devoted to the study of paralinguistic
correlates of stress-inducing task load. Historically, voice stress analysis
(VSA) has been conducted using conventional digital signal processing (DSP)
techniques. Despite the development of modern methods based on deep neural
networks (DNNs), accurately detecting stress in speech remains difficult due to
the wide variety of stressors and considerable variability in the individual
stress perception. To that end, we introduce a set of five datasets for task
load detection in speech. The voice recordings were collected as either
cognitive or physical stress was induced in the cohort of volunteers, with a
cumulative number of more than a hundred speakers. We used the datasets to
design and evaluate a novel self-supervised audio representation that leverages
the effectiveness of handcrafted features (DSP-based) and the complexity of
data-driven DNN representations. Notably, the proposed approach outperformed
both extensive handcrafted feature sets and novel DNN-based audio

decision making. However, true rewards can contain action-independent
redundancies that are not relevant for decision making and only increase the
statistical complexity of accurate estimation. It is sufficient and more
data-efficient to estimate the simplest function that explains the reward
differences between actions, that is, the heterogeneous treatment effect,
commonly understood to be more structured and simpler than the reward.
Motivated by this observation, building on recent work on oracle-based
algorithms, we design a statistically optimal and computationally efficient
algorithm using heterogeneous treatment effect estimation oracles. Our results
provide the first universal reduction of contextual bandits to a
general-purpose heterogeneous treatment effect estimation method. We show that
our approach is more robust to model misspecification than reward estimation
methods based on squared error regression oracles. Experimentally, we show the

Hankel nuclear norm regularization. Hankel regularization encourages the
low-rankness of the Hankel matrix, which maps to the low-orderness of the
system. We provide novel statistical analysis for this regularization and
carefully contrast it with the unregularized ordinary least-squares (OLS)
estimator. Our analysis leads to new bounds on estimating the impulse response
and the Hankel matrix associated with the linear system. We first design an
input excitation and show that Hankel regularization enables one to recover the
system using optimal number of observations in the true system order and
achieve strong statistical estimation rates. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that
the input design indeed matters, by showing that intuitive choices such as
i.i.d. Gaussian input leads to provably sub-optimal sample complexity. To
better understand the benefits of regularization, we also revisit the OLS
estimator. Besides refining existing bounds, we experimentally identify when
regularized approach improves over OLS: (1) For low-order systems with slow
impulse-response decay, OLS method performs poorly in terms of sample
complexity, (2) Hankel matrix returned by regularization has a more clear
singular value gap that ease identification of the system order, (3) Hankel
regularization is less sensitive to hyperparameter choice. Finally, we
establish model selection guarantees through a joint train-validation procedure
where we tune the regularization parameter for near-optimal estimation.]]></summary>

a method to improve few-shot classification performance. We perform an
exploration into how a GAN can be fine-tuned for such a task (one of which is
in a class-incremental manner), as well as a rigorous empirical investigation
into how well these models can perform to improve few-shot classification. We
identify issues related to the difficulty of training such generative models
under a purely supervised regime with very few examples, as well as issues
regarding the evaluation protocols of existing works. We also find that in this
regime, classification accuracy is highly sensitive to how the classes of the
dataset are randomly split. Therefore, we propose a semi-supervised fine-tuning
approach as a more pragmatic way forward to address these problems.]]></summary>

Deep neural networks are also appropriate to locate the sound source, but in

conversation have been introduced over the past couple of years. These include
neural architectures for detecting emotion, dialogue acts, and sentiment
polarity. They take advantage of some of the key attributes of contemporary
machine learning, such as recurrent neural networks with attention mechanisms
and transformer-based approaches. However, while the architectures themselves
are extremely promising, the phenomena they have been applied to to date are
but a small part of what makes conversation engaging. In this paper we survey
these neural architectures and what they have been applied to. On the basis of
the social science literature, we then describe what we believe to be the most
fundamental and definitional feature of conversation, which is its
co-construction over time by two or more interlocutors. We discuss how neural
architectures of the sort surveyed could profitably be applied to these more
fundamental aspects of conversation, and what this buys us in terms of a better
analysis of conversation and even, in the longer term, a better way of
generating conversation for a conversational system.]]></summary>

capacity in representing complex and high-order relationships. However, current

limiting their ability to extract information from high-order neighbors. In
this paper, we show both theoretically and empirically, that the performance of
hypergraph neural networks does not improve as the number of layers increases,
which is known as the over-smoothing problem. To tackle this issue, we develop
a new deep hypergraph convolutional network called Deep-HGCN, which can
maintain the heterogeneity of node representation in deep layers. Specifically,
we prove that a $k$-layer Deep-HGCN simulates a polynomial filter of order $k$
with arbitrary coefficients, which can relieve the problem of over-smoothing.
Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the superior performance
of the proposed model comparing to the state-of-the-art hypergraph learning
approaches.]]></summary>

great destruction and damage to critical systems and business operations.
Attackers are unfailingly finding innovative ways to bypass detection

most research summarizes the general features of AI and induces many false
positives, as the behavior of ransomware constantly differs to bypass
detection. Focusing on the key indicating features of ransomware becomes vital
as this guides the investigator to the inner workings and main function of
ransomware itself. By utilizing access privileges in process memory, the main
function of the ransomware can be detected more easily and accurately.
Furthermore, new signatures and fingerprints of ransomware families can be
identified to classify novel ransomware attacks correctly. The current research
used the process memory access privileges of the different memory regions of
the behavior of an executable to quickly determine its intent before serious
harm can occur. To achieve this aim, several well-known machine learning
algorithms were explored with an accuracy range of 81.38 to 96.28 percents. The

behaviors, which are more suitable to be described by stochastic differential
equations under non-Gaussian L\'evy noise. Among these complex phenomena, the
most likely transition paths between metastable states are important since
these rare events may have high impact in certain scenarios. Based on the large
deviation principle, the most likely transition path could be treated as the
minimizer of the rate function upon paths that connect two points. One of the
challenges to calculate the most likely transition path for stochastic
dynamical systems under non-Gaussian L\'evy noise is that the associated rate
function can not be explicitly expressed by paths. For this reason, we
formulate an optimal control problem to obtain the optimal state as the most

FastSpeech2 transforms an input text to a mel-spectrogram and then HiFi-GAN

Specifically, our proposed model is jointly trained FastSpeech2 and HiFi-GAN
with an alignment module. Since there is no acoustic feature mismatch between
training and inference, it does not requires fine-tuning. Furthermore, we
remove dependency on an external speech-text alignment tool by adopting an

a sequence of smaller problems, it is often possible to avoid the complexity of
considering all scenarios simultaneously. A key ingredient for the performance
of the iterative methods is a good selection of start scenarios. In this paper
we propose a data-driven heuristic to seed the iterative solution method with a
set of starting scenarios that provide a strong lower bound early in the
process, and result in considerably smaller overall solution times compared to
other benchmark methods. Our heuristic learns the relevance of a scenario by
extracting information from training data based on a combined similarity

learning. The difference is most pronounced when the data distribution is
long-tailed, with many queries having only few training examples: Impeding
general memorization prevents effective learning, while impeding only
relational memorization still allows learning general properties of the
underlying concepts. We formalize the notion of Relational Privacy (RP) and,
inspired by Differential Privacy (DP), we provide a possible definition of
Differential Relational Privacy (DrP). These notions can be used to describe
and compute bounds on the amount of RM in a trained model. We illustrate
Relational Privacy concepts in experiments with large-scale models for Question
Answering.]]></summary>

in addressing the challenge of climate change. One of the drawbacks of
wind-generated energy is the large space necessary to install a wind farm; this
arises from the fact that placing wind turbines in a limited area would hinder
their productivity and therefore not be economically convenient. This naturally
leads to an optimisation problem, which has three specific challenges: (1)
multiple conflicting objectives (2) computationally expensive simulation models
and (3) optimisation over design sets instead of design vectors. The first and
second challenges can be addressed by using surrogate-assisted e.g.\ Bayesian
multi-objective optimisation. However, the traditional Bayesian optimisation
cannot be applied as the optimisation function in the problem relies on design
sets instead of design vectors. This paper extends the applicability of
Bayesian multi-objective optimisation to set based optimisation for solving the
wind farm layout problem. We use a set-based kernel in Gaussian process to
quantify the correlation between wind farms (with a different number of
turbines). The results on the given data set of wind energy and direction
clearly show the potential of using set-based Bayesian multi-objective
optimisation.]]></summary>

are scarce, we propose a novel estimator of the out-of-sample performance of a
policy in data-driven optimization.Our approach exploits the optimization
problem's sensitivity analysis to estimate the gradient of the optimal
objective value with respect to the amount of noise in the data and uses the
estimated gradient to debias the policy's in-sample performance. Unlike
cross-validation techniques, our approach avoids sacrificing data for a test
set, utilizes all data when training and, hence, is well-suited to settings
where data are scarce. We prove bounds on the bias and variance of our
estimator for optimization problems with uncertain linear objectives but known,
potentially non-convex, feasible regions. For more specialized optimization
problems where the feasible region is "weakly-coupled" in a certain sense, we
prove stronger results. Specifically, we provide explicit high-probability
bounds on the error of our estimator that hold uniformly over a policy class
and depends on the problem's dimension and policy class's complexity. Our
bounds show that under mild conditions, the error of our estimator vanishes as
the dimension of the optimization problem grows, even if the amount of
available data remains small and constant. Said differently, we prove our
estimator performs well in the small-data, large-scale regime. Finally, we
numerically compare our proposed method to state-of-the-art approaches through
a case-study on dispatching emergency medical response services using real

that has found widespread applications. Examples include selecting offers,
prices, advertisements to send to customers, as well as selecting which
medication to prescribe to a patient. However, existing literature rests on the
crucial assumption that the future environment where the learned policy will be
deployed is the same as the past environment that has generated the data -- an
assumption that is often false or too coarse an approximation. In this paper,
we lift this assumption and aim to learn a distributionally robust policy with
incomplete observational data. We first present a policy evaluation procedure
that allows us to assess how well the policy does under the worst-case
environment shift. We then establish a central limit theorem type guarantee for
this proposed policy evaluation scheme. Leveraging this evaluation scheme, we
further propose a novel learning algorithm that is able to learn a policy that
is robust to adversarial perturbations and unknown covariate shifts with a
performance guarantee based on the theory of uniform convergence. Finally, we
empirically test the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in synthetic
datasets and demonstrate that it provides the robustness that is missing using
standard policy learning algorithms. We conclude the paper by providing a
comprehensive application of our methods in the context of a real-world voting

representing high-dimensional distributions with structure. Recent years have
also seen big advances in designing multi-item mechanisms. Akin to overfitting,
however, these mechanisms can be extremely sensitive to the Bayesian prior that
they target, which becomes problematic when that prior is only approximately
known. At the same time, even if access to the exact Bayesian prior is given,
it is known that optimal or even approximately optimal multi-item mechanisms
run into sample, computational, representation and communication intractability
barriers.

We consider a natural class of multi-item mechanism design problems with very
large numbers of items, but where the bidders' value distributions can be
well-approximated by a topic model akin to those used in recommendation systems
with very large numbers of possible recommendations. We propose a mechanism
design framework for this setting, building on a recent robustification
framework by Brustle et al., which disentangles the statistical challenge of
estimating a multi-dimensional prior from the task of designing a good
mechanism for it, and robustifies the performance of the latter against the
estimation error of the former. We provide an extension of this framework
appropriate for our setting, which allows us to exploit the expressive power of
topic models to reduce the effective dimensionality of the mechanism design
problem and remove the dependence of its computational, communication and
representation complexity on the number of items.]]></summary>

paper is computationally efficient, suitable for irregular geometric domains,
and readily ingests displacement data without the need for interpolation onto a
computational grid. A selection of canonical hyperelastic materials models
suitable for different material classes is considered including the
Neo-Hookean, Gent, and Blatz-Ko constitutive models as exemplars for general
hyperelastic behavior, polymer behavior with lock-up, and compressible foam

particular, the algorithm applies the Nesterov's momentum to accelerate the
computation of the implicit gradient involved in AID. We provide a

formally establish the convergence of the model parameters to a critical point
of the bi-level problem, and obtain an improved computation complexity
$\mathcal{O}(\kappa^{3.5}\epsilon^{-2})$ over the state-of-the-art result.
Moreover, we analyze the asymptotic convergence rates of this algorithm under a

inspired by Differential Privacy (DP), we provide a possible definition of
Differential Relational Privacy (DrP). These notions can be used to describe
and compute bounds on the amount of RM in a trained model. We illustrate
Relational Privacy concepts in experiments with large-scale models for Question

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many popular contextual bandit algorithms estimate reward models to inform
decision making. However, true rewards can contain action-independent
redundancies that are not relevant for decision making and only increase the
statistical complexity of accurate estimation. It is sufficient and more
data-efficient to estimate the simplest function that explains the reward
differences between actions, that is, the heterogeneous treatment effect,
commonly understood to be more structured and simpler than the reward.
Motivated by this observation, building on recent work on oracle-based
algorithms, we design a statistically optimal and computationally efficient
algorithm using heterogeneous treatment effect estimation oracles. Our results
provide the first universal reduction of contextual bandits to a
general-purpose heterogeneous treatment effect estimation method. We show that
our approach is more robust to model misspecification than reward estimation
methods based on squared error regression oracles. Experimentally, we show the
benefits of heterogeneous treatment effect estimation in contextual bandits
over reward estimation.]]></summary>

by the generalized quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). However,
the hybrid discrete-continuous optimization problem in the generalized QAOA

are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However recent research has pointed out
differences between attacks and defenses on ASR models compared to image
models. Improving the robustness of ASR models requires a paradigm shift from
evaluating attacks on one or a few models to a systemic approach in evaluation.
We lay the ground for such research by evaluating on various architectures a
representative set of adversarial attacks: targeted and untargeted,
optimization and speech processing-based, white-box, black-box and targeted
attacks. Our results show that the relative strengths of different attack
algorithms vary considerably when changing the model architecture, and that the
results of some attacks are not to be blindly trusted. They also indicate that
training choices such as self-supervised pretraining can significantly impact
robustness by enabling transferable perturbations. We release our source code

the computational load assigned to subdomains must be equally distributed.
Usually computational cost is proportional to the amount of data entities
assigned to partitions. Good quality partitioning also requires the volume of
communication during calculation to be kept at its minimum. In order to deal
with DD-DA problems where the observations are nonuniformly distributed and
general sparse, in the present work we employ a parallel load balancing
algorithm based on adaptive and dynamic defining of boundaries of DD -- which
is aimed to balance workload according to data location. We call it DyDD. As
the numerical model underlying DA problems arising from the so-called

critical for predicting and explaining observed properties. Binary population
synthesis with full stellar-structure and evolution simulations are
computationally expensive requiring a large number of mass-transfer sequences.
The recently developed binary population synthesis code POSYDON incorporates
grids of MESA binary star simulations which are then interpolated to model
large-scale populations of massive binaries. The traditional method of
computing a high-density rectilinear grid of simulations is not scalable for
higher-dimension grids, accounting for a range of metallicities, rotation, and
eccentricity. We present a new active learning algorithm, psy-cris, which uses
machine learning in the data-gathering process to adaptively and iteratively
select targeted simulations to run, resulting in a custom, high-performance
training set. We test psy-cris on a toy problem and find the resulting training
sets require fewer simulations for accurate classification and regression than
either regular or randomly sampled grids. We further apply psy-cris to the
target problem of building a dynamic grid of MESA simulations, and we
demonstrate that, even without fine tuning, a simulation set of only $\sim 1/4$
the size of a rectilinear grid is sufficient to achieve the same classification
accuracy. We anticipate further gains when algorithmic parameters are optimized
for the targeted application. We find that optimizing for classification only
may lead to performance losses in regression, and vice versa. Lowering the
computational cost of producing grids will enable future versions of POSYDON to
cover more input parameters while preserving interpolation accuracies.]]></summary>

load monitoring (NILM) to predict and optimize appliance load distribution in
real-time. NILM, or energy disaggregation, refers to the decomposition of
electricity usage conditioned on the aggregated power signals (i.e., smart
sensor on the main channel). Based on real-time appliance power prediction
using sensory technology, energy disaggregation has great potential to increase
electricity efficiency and reduce energy expenditure. With the introduction of
transformer models, NILM has achieved significant improvements in predicting
device power readings. Nevertheless, transformers are less efficient due to
O(l^2) complexity w.r.t. sequence length l. Moreover, transformers can fail to
capture local signal patterns in sequence-to-point settings due to the lack of
inductive bias in local context. In this work, we propose an efficient
localness transformer for non-intrusive load monitoring (ELTransformer).
Specifically, we leverage normalization functions and switch the order of
matrix multiplication to approximate self-attention and reduce computational
complexity. Additionally, we introduce localness modeling with sparse local
attention heads and relative position encodings to enhance the model capacity
in extracting short-term local patterns. To the best of our knowledge,
ELTransformer is the first NILM model that addresses computational complexity

regime, classification accuracy is highly sensitive to how the classes of the
dataset are randomly split. Therefore, we propose a semi-supervised fine-tuning
approach as a more pragmatic way forward to address these problems.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Continually learning new classes from fresh data without forgetting previous
knowledge of old classes is a very challenging research problem. Moreover, it
is imperative that such learning must respect certain memory and computational
constraints such as (i) training samples are limited to only a few per class,
(ii) the computational cost of learning a novel class remains constant, and
(iii) the memory footprint of the model grows at most linearly with the number
of classes observed. To meet the above constraints, we propose C-FSCIL, which
is architecturally composed of a frozen meta-learned feature extractor, a
trainable fixed-size fully connected layer, and a rewritable dynamically
growing memory that stores as many vectors as the number of encountered
classes. C-FSCIL provides three update modes that offer a trade-off between
accuracy and compute-memory cost of learning novel classes. C-FSCIL exploits
hyperdimensional embedding that allows to continually express many more classes
than the fixed dimensions in the vector space, with minimal interference. The
quality of class vector representations is further improved by aligning them
quasi-orthogonally to each other by means of novel loss functions. Experiments
on the CIFAR100, miniImageNet, and Omniglot datasets show that C-FSCIL
outperforms the baselines with remarkable accuracy and compression. It also
scales up to the largest problem size ever tried in this few-shot setting by
learning 423 novel classes on top of 1200 base classes with less than 1.6%
accuracy drop. Our code is available at

first resolves the referential expression in the sentence and associates the
novel concept with particular objects in the scene. Next, our model interprets
supplemental sentences to relate the novel concept with other known concepts,
such as "X has property Y" or "X is a kind of Y". Finally, it infers an optimal
box embedding for the novel concept that jointly 1) maximizes the likelihood of
the observed instances in the image, and 2) satisfies the relationships between
the novel concepts and the known ones. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our

Identifying whether or not the residents of the house are present, is important
in numerous scenarios. Possible scenarios include but are not limited to:
elderly people living alone, people suffering from dementia, home quarantine.
The majority of published papers focus on either pressure / door sensors or
cameras in order to detect outing events. Although the aforementioned
approaches provide solid results, they are intrusive and require modifications
for sensor placement. In our work, appliance electrical use is investigated as
a means for detecting the presence or absence of residents. The energy use is
the result of power disaggregation, a non intrusive / non invasive sensing
method. Since a dataset providing energy data and ground truth for home absence
is not available, artificial outing events were introduced on the UK-DALE
dataset, a well known dataset for Non Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM). Several
machine learning algorithms were evaluated using the generated dataset.
Benchmark results have shown that home absence detection using appliance power
consumption is feasible.]]></summary>

 Assume you have a simulation or access to an environment. There are certain parameters you can set to control the performance of a system which lives in this simulation/environment. Naturally, one wants to find the optimal parameters or optimal policy to set the parameter that can result the most reward, however that is defined. 
 For example, in the stock market, I may want to find the optimal market price to buy and sell, or the optimal policy. In a car driving game, I may want to determine the optimal policy to set speed and direction. 
 Do we know if there is formal way to study this type of problem? Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pretraining of BERT-type large language models, which may scale up to billions of parameters, is essential to achieving best-in-class performance on various natural language processing (NLP) applications. However, the pretraining procedure is costly, and it has become a hurdle for the industrial deployment of big language models.
 In a research paper, researchers from Google, New York University, and the University of Maryland recommend a simple but effective “token dropping” method that drastically reduces the pretraining cost of transformer models like BERT while maintaining downstream fine-tuning performance.
 Token dropping is a technique for speeding up the pretraining of transformer models like BERT without sacrificing their performance on downstream tasks. Starting with an intermediate layer in the model, they eliminate uninteresting tokens to let the model focus on key tokens more effectively, given its limited computing resources. The model’s last layer then picks up the dropped tokens, producing full-length sequences. They use the built-in masked language modeling (MLM) loss and its dynamics to detect non-essential tokens with little computing complexity. According to their tests, this straightforward strategy decreases BERT’s pretraining cost by 25% while yielding somewhat higher overall fine-tuning performance on conventional downstream tasks.

 Exploration is one of the oldest challenges for Reinforcement Learning algorithms, with no clear solution to date. Especially in environments with sparse rewards, agents face significant challenges in deciding which parts of the environment to explore further. Providing intrinsic motivation in form of a pseudo-reward is sometimes used to overcome this challenge, but often relies on hand-crafted heuristics, and can lead to deceptive dead-ends. This paper proposes to use language descriptions of encountered states as a method of assessing novelty. In two procedurally generated environments, they demonstrate the usefulness of language, which is in itself highly concise and abstractive, which lends itself well for this task.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Benchmarks are an important way to measure progress in AI research – but artificial intelligence is constantly achieving new bests. Are we running out of AI benchmarks? 
 ...
 Researchers at the Medical University of Vienna and the University of Oxford now show in a meta-study of AI benchmarks that saturated or stagnant benchmarks are common. The researchers examined 1,688 benchmarks with 406 tasks in computer vision and natural language processing since 2013, and draw the following conclusions:
  
In some cases, there would be continuous growth, such as in the ImageNet benchmark.
 However, a majority of all benchmarks quickly reach technological stagnation or saturation.
 In some cases, a lack of research interest is also a cause of stagnation. The researchers cite the UCF101 action recognition benchmark as an example of saturation.
 However, the dynamics of performance improvement do not follow a clearly discernible pattern: in some cases, phases of stagnation are followed by unpredictable leaps. This is what happened in the PROTEINS benchmark.
  
...
 Moreover, of the 1,688 benchmarks, only 66 percent have more than three results at different points in time – so in practice, 33 percent of all AI benchmarks are not used and therefore useless. 
 ...
 In the future, new benchmarks should be developed by large, collaborative teams from many institutions, knowledge domains, and cultures to ensure high-quality benchmarks and avoid fragmentation of the benchmark landscape, the researchers conclude.

 Meta’s speech AI can now mimic emotional sounds such as laughing, yawning, or crying – which it says is important in communication to better convey the intention and context of a statement. 
 ...
 the new GSML model dGSML, which is optimized for dialogs, generates more natural-sounding audio dialogs using AI agents that can pause for thought or process overlaps in conversations. 
 ...
 dGSML was trained with about 2000 hours of unlabeled audio dialogues from the Fisher dataset, which contains about 16000 English-language telephone conversations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Integrating machine learning capabilities to MySQL systems is prohibitively difficult and time-consuming. The process involves extracting data from the database and into another system to construct and deploy machine learning models. As data flows around, this strategy produces silos for applying machine learning to application data and causes latency. This results in data leakage, making the database more open to security attacks. Moreover, existing machine learning (ML) solutions lack the ability to explain why the model developers build delivers specific predictions.
 Recently, Oracle released MySQL HeatWave, the only MySQL cloud database service that supports in-database machine learning (ML). It automates the ML lifecycle and saves all trained models in the MySQL database, removing the need to migrate data or models to a machine learning tool or service. This decreases application complexity, saves costs, and increases data and model security. It produces a model with the best algorithm, features, and hyper-parameters for a specific data collection and application.

Automatic translation of speech from one language to speech in another language, called speech-to-speech translation (S2ST), is important for breaking down the communication barriers between people speaking different languages. Conventionally, automatic S2ST systems are built with a cascade of automatic speech recognition (ASR), text-to-text machine translation (MT), and text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis sub-systems, so that the system overall is text-centric. Recently, work on S2ST that doesn’t rely on intermediate text representation is emerging, such as end-to-end direct S2ST (e.g., Translatotron) and cascade S2ST based on learned discrete representations of speech (e.g., Tjandra et al.).

 I have a two step custom gym env which is a graph network optimisation task (two steps due to high dimension action space).

The training loop now has a new graph state (edges changed between nodes) plus a vector of the first action selected. 
 The agent is able to learn well however, even with a negative reward provided to the agent if it takes illegal actions (choosing the same node in each step and thus creating a self connection), even when it learns to maximise reward, it still take illegal actions…]]></summary>

 This is my first time trying reinforcement learning and Unity and wanted some help. 
 I am trying to train a quadcopter to hover and keep a stationary ball in its camera frame using just visual inputs by a camera sensor. So the input to the network would be an 84*84 grayscale image and the output would be the four forces to the rotor.
 My reward function is 
 ​
 Reward Function
 where x and y is the position of the drone and a is the rotation of the drone with respect to the target. I have set A, d and c to 3 and lambda as 1/180. I have also added a condition where if the quadcopter drops below a certain height from the platform, it punishes it by a reward of -1 and resets the episode.
 The network I am using is the ppop network used by the coin-collector example in mlagents. 
 My training log is below: 
 Training log
 The cumulative reward and episode length just drops after a while and the value loss explodes. I think something maybe wrong with my rewards or network. 
 If anyone has any ideas what might be going wrong and tell me, that would be great. 
 Thanks

 I have also checked other activation functions, but sigmoid for example is for classification, and hyperbolic tangent returns values that can be negative.

 The code is up on GitHub, and the preprint should be up soon, too: https://github.com/rasbt/cyclemoid-pytorch

 - comma.ai self-driving system.
 - Weather nowcasting
 - Tokamak fision reactor feeedback control
 - Hardware design: New gen. TPU
 - Datacenter cooling optimization
 - Adaptive locomotion for quadrupedal robots *
 - Portfolio optimization (financial instruments)
 There is a lot of work in games, particularly board games, but these do not really solve something "useful" for society. I have seen also lots of toy examples with libraries like gym and some robotics but in general these are rather proof-of-concept models or just models that do not work at all. One that actually does work is Solving Rubik’s Cube with a Robot Hand, not regarding the solution of the cube but its dexterous manipulation with a robotic hand. This is pretty cool, but again, the domain of the problem is too narrow to be considered actually a successful application to a real-world problem. So my question is, am I missing some examples? For example, is any company out there trying to apply deep RL to self-driving vehicles or to NLP, and have they had any success?
 * Boston dynamics solves this without ML, just good'ol control theory so this is a 50-50 win for RL.
 ​
 Edit: Thanks everyone for the responses, I have updated the list with more projects from the comments.
 Edit 2: Took Alphafold out because the current version (2.x) does not use RL.

 Retailers can take advantage of the ability to engage potential customers through virtual attendants. Along with this opportunity is a growing range of new and exciting ways to utilize chatbots within retail spaces. A lack of customer engagement through mobile messaging costs retailers around $1 trillion annually, as customers are increasingly becoming reluctant to contact mainstream outlets for recommendations due to their negative experiences, or because they have already made up their mind on what they want.
 This can be potentially overcome by utilizing Chatbots; in-store systems powered by AI that can be utilized across multiple channels, including the outlet's website and branded social media profiles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In both TRPO and PPO, we have r which is ration of new_policy/old_policy. Here we collect data from old_policy and improve new policy. I am confused on how to implement this. Correct me If I am wrong but I have two ways in mind.
 1) I collect prob while running simulation. When optimizing, I use same neural network to sample another action and its prob, this new and its probability becomes my new_policy and then I optimize for L_clip function. 
 2) I collect prob while running simulation. Before optimizing the ppo objective, I first run a simple policy gradient by using the original prob I collected. After updating the NN, I once more get new_prob which I use in L_clip function.
 Can someone please tell me which should I do and why?

 The thing is that I want to study text-to-image synthesis; but I see that there are lots of work already done up until now. I am kind of confused about how I should start studying.
 About my experience, I am trying to learn as much as I can. I started by following Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning course on Coursera; and now I continue with Deep Learning Specialization (almost finished). Apart from these, I check NVIDIA blog, some YouTube channels, Slack communities and of course here on Reddit along with a few other channels. As I said, I am trying to follow what’s going on. 
 To tell the truth, I didn’t do much in terms of building models. I mean, not a real-life project or something like that. My experience is more based on projects for the courses that I attend/attended. By the way, I don’t know how it will affect things’ turning out; but I have recently begun a graduate program as well in artificial intelligence. Moreover, during my undergraduate program, I took some courses that might help (at least I guess so) including Calculus and Linear Algebra.
 I also want to mention that as for hardware there is an NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit available to me.
 I hope that what I am asking is clear and information I provided help you answering. If not, please ask me.
 Best regards.

 Do you have experience with data pipeline tools/frameworks and data validation tools/frameworks?
 For example I just found "Great Expectations" and "Kedro", "Flyte" and I was wondering at which point in time and project complexity should we choose one of these tools instead of the ancient cave man way?
 Any success/failure stories?

 I am working on an extension of this implementation https://github.com/philtabor/Youtube-Code-Repository/tree/master/ReinforcementLearning/ICM of the intrinsic curiosity module. It uses A3C(Actor -critic) as a policy and the ICM is a bolt on module.
 I need to fix the seeds for reproducibility but no matter what i have tried I cannot achieve it.
 The implementation uses multithreading on cpu and plays on the oepnai gym cartpole or atari environments.
 I believe that it has something to do with multithreading but im not sure.
 Could someone know what is the solution?

In experimental work, surprise can take the form of not knowing how the experiment will turn out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Folks,
 I'm in a bit of a dilemma here on a specific fine grained classification problem that we have. The task at hand is to classify the subspecies of plant seeds. Firstly, the seeds are super tiny, but we have camera setup to take zoomed images of the seeds. Secondly, even the experts can't tell the exact difference between 2 subspecies of seeds. They go by their experience and intuition. All the subspecies put together looks similar but the data points within the same subspecies are vastly different. The requirement being classifying the subspecies based on their morphological properties. Here is the catch, the requirement is 98%+ accuracy. I tried few preprocessing and models (transformers, resnets, inception and other sort) but can't hit the 98% accuracy mark. Even if I could, the model sometimes fail on external sets or on production.
 I would like some expert (ML side) take on this issue on how to approach this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, Reddit!
 Excited to share with you guys, Nix-TTS 🐤! Our latest research in lightweight neural Text-to-Speech.
 We've seen how synthetic voices generated by recent neural TTS are getting more and more natural, but most of the time the models suffer from slow CPU inference and are not end-to-end, which requires an additional vocoder model.
 Nix-TTS 🐤 is an incredibly lightweight end-to-end TTS model achieved by applying non end-to-end knowledge distillation to a powerful yet large-sized generative TTS teacher model.
 Our proposed model is end-to-end (vocoder-free) with only 5.23M parameters or up to 82% reduction of the teacher model. We also employed a stochastic duration predictor to improve its expressiveness.
 It is capable to run 10x faster than real-time on Intel i7 CPU and 0.5 times faster than real-time on Raspberry Pi Model 3B. Making it suitable for deployment in resource-constrained settings. Here we attached the complexity and speedup detail from the paper.
 ​

 However some deep learning models output embeddings instead of category scores.You can then match these embeddings against other embeddings and measure their similarity. For example: in face recognition models, or in self supervised networks.
 In this case to apply pixel attribution, we could create embeddings of concepts, and then for new query images we would be asking: "what parts of the image have feature representations that match the concept features?"
 Or in other words: "where in the query image do we see the concepts?"
 ​
 I wrote a tutorial that shows how to use the pytorch-grad-cam project, to adapt pixel attribution for the embedding case, and visualize where different concept feature representations match the image:
 https://github.com/jacobgil/pytorch-grad-cam/blob/master/tutorials/Pixel%20Attribution%20for%20embeddings.ipynb
 An example is the image below. The two left images are "concept" images of clouds, and a car.
 Then given a new query image, we can try to see where in the image do we feature representations that match these concepts.
 Given images of concepts and a query image, attribute what parts of the query image match the concepts
 I hope someone finds this useful !

 What data-centric techniques can you use to resolve it? Could some form of cropping augmentation do the trick?Classic example is ruler beside melanoma, while there may be a correlation between presence of ruler and presence of melanoma you don't want to the model to depend on that information because it may not exist 'in production'. Below is a quotation describing another similar problem.
 "In another paper a similar issue was found because doctors sometimes use purple markers to highlight potentially-malignant skin cancers for easier examination. Some argue that the purple marks are a real signal that should be incorporated in the model just as the visual appearance of the tumor itself is incorporated. However, if your goal is robust generalizability over time it is probably best to not have your AI incorporate the human applied purple marks as signal, as the standards for applying those marks may vary across teams and across time." https://menloml.com/2020/01/11/recognizing-a-ruler-instead-of-a-cancer/

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05483
 TL;DR; from LeCun: Recurrent nets in which the weight matrix is unitary are interesting beasts: they are invertible, they don't suffer from vanishing/exploding gradient, and they perform computation akin to what happens in quantum computers. training them can be difficult or expensive. We propose a low-rank (low-cost) update method to update unitary weight matrices with gradient descent.
 Abstract: In learning with recurrent or very deep feed-forward networks, employing unitary matrices in each layer can be very effective at maintaining long-range stability. However, restricting network parameters to be unitary typically comes at the cost of expensive parameterizations or increased training runtime. We propose instead an efficient method based on rank-k updates -- or their rank-k approximation -- that maintains performance at a nearly optimal training runtime. We introduce two variants of this method, named Direct (projUNN-D) and Tangent (projUNN-T) projected Unitary Neural Networks, that can parameterize full N-dimensional unitary or orthogonal matrices with a training runtime scaling as O(kN^2). Our method either projects low-rank gradients onto the closest unitary matrix (projUNN-T) or transports unitary matrices in the direction of the low-rank gradient (projUNN-D). Even in the fastest setting (k=1), projUNN is able to train a model's unitary parameters to reach comparable performances against baseline implementations. By integrating our projUNN algorithm into both recurrent and convolutional neural networks, our models can closely match or exceed benchmarked results from state-of-the-art algorithms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi-object tracking aims to locate and track all objects in a video feed. It’s a fundamental component in domains like mobile robots, where an autonomous system must navigate dynamic surroundings populated by other mobile agents. Thanks to breakthroughs in deep learning and object detection, tracking-by-detection has become the dominant tracking paradigm in recent years.
 Tracking-by-detection simplifies the process by reducing it to just two steps: detection and association. First, an object detector searches each video stream frame for probable items. The second phase is an association step, which connects detections over time. Local trackers are greedy when it comes to pairwise relationships. They keep track of each trajectory’s state based on its position and/or identity traits and correlate current-frame detections with it based on its last visible status.

 I guess I'm unclear about what defines tabular data in this context, and if it makes sense to use a different model (like XBGboost) for the classification task, vs having it as a final layer in the embedding network.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm having a doubt that may be a little stupid, but I ask to be sure.
 Assume that in my environment rewards are delayed by a random number n of steps, i.e. the agent takes an action but receives the reward n steps after taking that action. At every step a reward is produced, therefore the reward r_t in transitions s_t, a_t, r_t, s_{t+1} collected by the agent is actually the reward corresponding to the transition at time t-n. 
 An example scenario: the RL agent control a transportation network, and a reward is generated only when a package reach its destination. Thus, the reward arrives with possibly several steps of delay with respect to when the relevant actions were taken. 
 Now, I know that delayed rewards are not generally an issue, e.g. all those settings in which there is only one reward +1 at the end, but I am wondering if this case is equivalent. What makes me wonder is that here, for a state s_t onwards to state s_{t+n}, there are n rewards in the middle that depend on states previous to s_t. 
 Does this make the problem non-markovian? How can one learn the value function V(s_t) if its estimation is always affected by unrelated rewards r_{t-n} ... r_{t-1}?

 Abstract: A fundamental goal of scientific research is to learn about causal relationships. However, despite its critical role in the life and social sciences, causality has not had the same importance in Natural Language Processing (NLP), which has traditionally placed more emphasis on predictive tasks. This distinction is beginning to fade, with an emerging area of interdisciplinary research at the convergence of causal inference and language processing. Still, research on causality in NLP remains scattered across domains without unified definitions, benchmark datasets and clear articulations of the remaining challenges. In this survey, we consolidate research across academic areas and situate it in the broader NLP landscape. We introduce the statistical challenge of estimating causal effects, encompassing settings where text is used as an outcome, treatment, or as a means to address confounding. In addition, we explore potential uses of causal inference to improve the performance, robustness, fairness, and interpretability of NLP models. We thus provide a unified overview of causal inference for the computational linguistics community.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Working on a group project for college, utilizing a AIY Vision kit and implementing some variation of machine learning with it. The initial idea was to use the camera to identify playing cards and sorting them into groups, like different suits, odd/even, face and non face, but after meeting with the professor in charge, was informed that this idea of identifying and sorting is not really marketable. I tried explaining that sorting in the different ways could be used in many different applications and businesses, but still was told it was not really marketable. I was wondering if maybe there was a way to tweak it a bit to make it so, or if maybe turning it into an API would help. Any ideas and/or opinions on the project would be very helpful. Thank you very much.
 I understand this may fall under beginner related questions and project, but was curious to know if my group and I are on a right track or not, as we haven’t had any sort of guidance up to date.

We have a few use cases, only see the list growing, and would like to have a dedicated group rather than having disparate teams each trying to roll their own algorithms for their own applications. I am starting to look at what the costs might be, and I can see some pushback and lowballing (eg onshore/offshore, skill set, % junior/senior), but I don’t have a lot of stories to start my thoughts with, let alone data. So, I’m interested to know what your teams are like to start thinking about it, and any other data or literature would also be appreciated!

 In China, the state and companies are researching AI models with trillions of parameters. They want to prove that they can develop “brain-scale” AI.
 In the race to build ever-larger AI models, China is showing that cooperation between the state, universities and the private sector holds the potential for gigantic AI models. The researchers are talking about “brain-scale” AI: according to their definition, these are AI models with parameters beyond the 100-trillion mark.
 ...
 In a new paper, researchers from Tsinghua University, Alibaba Group, Zhejiang Lab and Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence present BaGuaLu, a framework that enables the training of large AI models using the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture.
 ...
 In an initial test, the researchers trained a 1.93 trillion model with their framework, outperforming Google’s Switch Transformer. They also demonstrate that their framework enables models with 14.5 trillion and a full 174 trillion parameters.
 ...
 BaGuaLu could soon be used to train the first models beyond 100 trillion parameters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello reddit hivemind,
 This might be a quite specific question but im not sure where else to go and ask. I'm currently an intern and charged with implementing and comparing different active learning algorithms to see which work best for our specific usecase. Since the coreset approach ( [1708.00489] Active Learning for Convolutional Neural Networks: A Core-Set Approach (arxiv.org) ) is now around for a long time, one of the best documented and shows promising results in a variety of papers I implemented it and ran some experiments with it. The results were a bit dissappointing. It got even outperformed by the random baseline .... To understand the bad performance I dug a bit deeper since I spend a significant amount of time implementing it. What I made out now as the issue is using the l_2 norm of penultimate layer as the metric. This leads to an oversampling of data samples with a certain softmax output due to the way the softmax function behaves. Has someone experienced the same issues? The only point where I could see coreset to be of some use is with a dataset that has a ton of redundant/similar images.
 Thank's a lot

 During the project implementation for my bachelor's thesis [1], a software (named dike, as the Greek goddess of justice) capable of analyzing malicious programs using artificial intelligence techniques, I was unable to locate an open source dataset with labeled malware samples in the public domain. As a result, I created DikeDataset, a dataset with labeled PE and OLE samples [2]. Because it was not the main focus of my thesis, the samples attributes are not evenly distributed (the benign-malicious and OLE-PE ratios are quite low), but the dataset aided greatly in the research process.
 This week, I was surprised to see that the public GitHub repository (which was used only for storage, without any promotion on communities like this) gained some organic reach (views, clones and stars). Furthermore, I was thrilled to learn that it was used in a research article published in 2021 [3]!
 As a result, I'd like to share this project with the community in the hopes that it will be useful to some members of the community.

 Some time ago, we had the idea to start building tools to facilitate 3D computer vision development. We started by looking at some of the 3D tools out there and realized that there wasn't anything that fit our needs or could be extended to do some of the things we wanted to do. 
 We started working on a tool to annotate point clouds with different label types (bounding box, rectangles, keypoints) to use as a base for our projects. We recently open sourced the tool, which you can find here: https://github.com/StrayRobots/3d-annotation-tool
 In the future we might add more tools, for example to paint point clouds or a polygon label type. 
 We would love to hear your feedback on the tool. Has anyone here built any 3D vision datasets? What kind of tools did you use?

 My input is a image and long text and output will be a summary of the text pertaining to the image.

 For extracting image features, I'm using pretrained resnet model. It gives me a [49 * 2048] vector for an image.
 For extracting paragraph features, I'm getting embeddings for each sentence, so the data_dimension will be [no_of_sentences * 512]

 I need to attend to both these set of features and generate output. I have gone through tutorials to understand the working of transformers but couldn't understand how to combine these into a single input so that the encoder can attend over both image and the paragraph together at the same time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, an anonymous open letter and accompanying Financial Times (paywall) article were published accusing DeepMind of mishandling allegations of sexual abuse by a senior member of the research team. 
 The FT article (reported on here in Fortune) goes on to suggest that the mishandling may have been deliberate in order to exploit legal loopholes in the UK where victims have a limited amount of time to take a case to employment tribunal. 
 This comes shortly after Mustafa Suleyman, one of the cofounders was quietly shuffled out to Google (he has subsequently left and founded a new startup with another DeepMind alum) after he was found to have bullied and humiliated staff for years.
 Google itself also has a poor record when it comes to sexual harassment, bullying and retaliation at the highest levels resulting in payouts of hundreds of millions of dollars. 
 Given that DeepMind and Google have a pretty strong grip on the development of AI in terms of employing many of the key people across many of the various subfields, having access to unparalleled data and compute and pushing forward more and more into health (for example the DeepMind offshoot Isomorphic Labs which itself is headed by Demis and staffed by DeepMinders, and the various Google healthcare bets and projects), can we really trust them to be stewards of fair and responsible AI development? 
 Bad things happen in all large organizations. But DeepMind isn’t that big and in the past five years, DeepMind leadership have presided over a steady stream of sexual harassment, bullying and other scandals and handled them all extremely poorly and showed little signs that things have changed. This points to something rotten in the culture and leadership there and at it’s parent organization.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Surveillance cameras have an identity crisis exacerbated by a conflict between function and privacy. Machine learning techniques have automated video content analysis on a vast scale as these sophisticated small sensors have shown up seemingly everywhere. Still, with increased mass monitoring, there are currently no legally enforceable standards to curb privacy invasions.
 Security cameras have evolved into wiser and more capable tools than the grainy images of the past, which were frequently used as the “hero tool” in crime dramas. Video surveillance can now assist health regulators in determining the percentage of persons using masks, transportation departments in monitoring the density and flow of automobiles, cyclists and walkers, and businesses in gaining a better understanding of buying habits. But why has privacy remained a second-class citizen?
 Privid
 Currently, the footage is retrofitted with blurred faces or black boxes. This prevents analysts from asking some legitimate questions (for example, are people wearing masks? ). Dissatisfied with the present status quo, MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) developed a system with other institutions to better guarantee privacy in surveillance video footage. The system, dubbed “Privid,” allows analysts to input video data searches and then adds a tiny amount of noise (additional data) to the result to ensure that no one can be identified. The method is based on a formal notion of privacy known as “differential privacy,” which permits without having access to aggregate statistics about private data disclosing individually identifying information.

One oddity I have noticed when training a few models is that a model with a lower MPJPE then some methods does not alwayshave a higher PCK (higher is better for this metric) but the mean joint precsion error is substantially below the threshold used for PCK (I do recognize that this metric is an average).

 Does anyone have any experience with this, seen the same behavior, or have any intuition why this would be occurring?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today Google had a webinar on Tensorflow Quantum for big data, which I attended. I was surprised that it was almost all quantum computing theory, but there was a link in the talk resources to Tensorflow Quantum where I was told I could find a tutorial with demo code for a classifier system to compare it to my classical approaches -- I use logistic regression, support vector machine, and Tensorflow DNN classifiers; mostly SVM because it works almost as accurately on my job's data sets as DNNs but takes a tiny fraction of the time to train.
 So, I took a look at it: https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum/tutorials/mnist
 This was the first sign that quantum classification might not be a viable alternative:
  
An image size of 28x28 is much too large for current quantum computers.
 -- https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum/tutorials/mnist#12_downscale_the_images
  
You really have to see it to believe it, but this demo requires downscaling legible digits for handwriting recognition to 4-by-4 pixel completely indiscernible blobs! Resulting in, as you might expect, terrible accuracy. A classical model using the full resolution images achieves 99.9%+ accuracy in relatively almost no time to train.
 So I scrolled down to the "Comparison" section and saw this:
  
a classical model of similar power (~32 parameters) trains to a similar accuracy in a fraction of the time. One way or the other, the classical neural network easily outperforms the quantum neural network. For classical data, it is difficult to beat a classical neural network.
  
The remainder of the tutorial didn't offer any improvement. The "quantum convolutional" NN classifier wasn't any better in speed or accuracy.
  
So, am I correct in assuming that I am best off ignoring quantum computing for classification tasks for the foreseeable future?
 How long do you think it will be until quantum ML can compete on real-world problems?

 after testing a bit I found it helps training if you modify how many N steps you reset epsilon as you train, e.g. I start on 3k for 100k frames and then 10k for 100k frames and then no resetting.
 I can't be the first and I understand there are much more mathematically stronger exploration techniques but is this a poorman's exploration technique?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Training datasets are very important for experimenting with varied data to train new AI models. However, many commonly used public data sets contain labeling errors. This makes it challenging to train robust models, particularly for novel tasks. Many researchers use techniques such as employing a variety of data quality control procedures to overcome these shortcomings. However, there is no centralized repository consisting of examples of using these strategies.
 Meta AI researchers have recently released Mephisto. It is a new platform to collect, share, and iterate on the most promising approaches to collecting training datasets for AI models. Researchers can exchange unique collecting strategies with Mephisto in a reusable and iterable format. It also allows them to change out components and quickly locate the exact annotations required, minimizing the barrier to custom task creation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello All,
 I am currently working on the project wherein I have to apply DL to CFD simulations. The simulation data is basically a set of 2d points (x,y) and their corresponding velocity and pressure values. I have such data for a 100 timesteps. The goal is to predict the flow(i.e. velocity and pressure) for each grid point for the last time step. I was thinking of reshaping the data in the form of a square so that I can use a CNN, but using a CNN wouldn't take care of the time dependence between the data. Is there a hybrid approach I can use that can take care of both temporal and spatial dependencies?
 ​
 Really need some guidance. Even any unrelated advice would be much appreciated. Thank you in advance!
 ​
 Edit: Also needed some help with regards to making the dataset. I have 100 csv files, each file corresponding to one time step. Each file contains the pressure and velocities of around 900 points. How do I make a dataset out of this either in pytorch or tensorflow?

 This is meant to be a drop in replacement for torch.Conv. It should be performant on kernel sizes above 20, depending on implementation. 
 One interesting thing, even if a person already had one of these, is the way the bias and bias gradient were calculated. It only cost O(out_channels), ignoring the data size entirely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pretty much as the title says. I work in research with electroencephalography (EEG) classification (those electrodes they stick on peoples heads). EEG is notoriously noisy and prone to overfitting, I have generally used validation accuracy as an optimization metric for a Bayesian HP tuning approach, but I find this tends to result in fairly unreliable models, even using cross validation approaches. These models are really noisy and while they may reach pretty good accuracy, that is a single epoch where it got a decent spike. I was wondering if there are common resolutions for this that I have missed, or if anyone has had luck with a custom metric that takes into account not just the validation accuracy, but the consistency and the difference between validation and training accuracy to better account for overfitting. Thanks!

 Recently I'm on research about neural architecture search. While reading through tons of papers about neural architecture search, I just got curious about 'how do we predefine primitive operations?' Because most of the paper goes like 'we have these ops in candidates, and we searched through candidates so elegantly...' I mean, how do we know we've predefined our candidates well? Is there any reference to 'good ops candidates'? I know certain cells and ops are often used in certain tasks, but still, I want to find a robust reference about 'The ops candidates for NAS'.
 It will cure my high blood pressure if you guys give your precious opinions about it.

These could be reports, reviews, briefs, policies, etc. Nowadays, readers wish to have a concise summary including major elements of their document, helping them prioritize their work efficiently. However, writing a document summary from scratch manually is a time-consuming task.
 To aid document writers in writing content summaries, Google announced a new feature enabling Google Docs to generate ideas automatically when they are available. The team employs a machine learning (ML) model to understand document text and provide a one- to two-sentence natural language description of the material. On the other hand, the document writer retains complete control, choosing whether to accept the proposal as-is, make necessary adjustments to better capture the document summary, or ignore it entirely. This section, combined with the outline, can help readers understand and navigate the work at a high level. While anybody can contribute summaries, only Google Workspace business customers have access to auto-generated ideas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had an idea recently for a ML regression strategy and I'm just wondering if something like this already exists. It has similarities with both boosting and bagging, but I think it's ultimately different from both.
 The basic idea is that you start with a subset of input features and train a model on that subset. Any common model will do as long as it doesn't just spit out the exact target value when making a prediction on the training set (i.e., you couldn't use a 1-neighbor KNN). After fitting the model, you make predictions on the training set (with the same subset of features) and calculate the prediction errors.
 Then using another subset of features (I would think it should be mutually exclusive from the first subset but maybe it doesn't have to be), you train a separate model, but rather than training on the original Y training data, you use the error of the previous model as the target for the second model.
 You repeat this process until all features have been used or as many times as desired. To make a prediction, the parent model would simply sum the predictions of the child models.
 As an additional thought, you might use more regularization, larger leaf size for decision trees, etc. for each additional model. You could also use bagging to create multiple instances of the strategy with different feature subsets in order to create multiple "pathways" through the data.
 A few questions:
  
Is this sufficiently different from existing boosting/bagging techniques?
 If yes to #1, are there any existing packages (preferably in Python) that implement this kind of technique?
 Could this be used to reduce overfitting for higher dimensional datasets? If so, would additional steps need to be taken (e.g., like the iterative regularization scheme I mentioned)? My thought is that it's a kind of divide-and-conquer strategy where each subsequent model is asked to do a little less than the previous model.
  
Any thoughts are appreciated.

 Abstract: Representation learning constructs low-dimensional representations to summarize essential features of high-dimensional data. This learning problem is often approached by describing various desiderata associated with learned representations; e.g., that they be non-spurious, efficient, or disentangled. It can be challenging, however, to turn these intuitive desiderata into formal criteria that can be measured and enhanced based on observed data. In this paper, we take a causal perspective on representation learning, formalizing non-spuriousness and efficiency (in supervised representation learning) and disentanglement (in unsupervised representation learning) using counterfactual quantities and observable consequences of causal assertions. This yields computable metrics that can be used to assess the degree to which representations satisfy the desiderata of interest and learn non-spurious and disentangled representations from single observational datasets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was hoping I could get some insight into the tooling that you use (or would use) for some production RL work? I'm mostly doing it all on my home machine as a fun side project. 
 I've got the following existing infrastructure: 
 - An interface based loosely on the standard RL setup. I'm thinking about adapting it to fit Acme to let it do more heavy lifting since I quite like `Haiku`, `rlax` and the rest of what they do.
 - I've got some models across languages (Pytorch and Jax) and this has been causing me some headache trying to make sure everything is abstract enough. Should I just stick to one language and make sure all my friends just use that same language? 
 - I'm currently using comet-ml for my experiment tracking, and for the most part I like it. However, I'm now looking around to see what's out there and I'm a little overwhelmed by (1) how many tools there are and (2) how some of them seem to "overlap" so I don't really know how to compose them.
 - configs all stored in a python file in a separate repo that is kept synced between my other repos.
 - I currently store my agent experiences (off policy) in a database that I later query to rapidly fill up the replay buffer. The limitation is that this is for a single agent. What drew me to Acme is that it seems to allow multiple agents to all use the same buffer? 
 _____________
 tl;dr
 1) Has anyone used Acme? I'm thinking of moving my project to it, but it might end up being a lot of effort for very little reward
 2) How do you and your teams handle multiple languages? Do you just have abstract gym wrappers that convert data? 
 3) What tools do you use and how do you compose them together? I'm so so lost trying to navigate this space
 4) How do you keep your configs synced when they are used between repos?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flower is an end-to-end federated learning framework that allows for a smoother transition from simulation-based experimental research to system research on many real-world edge devices. Flower has individual strengths in both domains (i.e., simulation and real-world devices) and the capacity to switch back and forth between the two extremes as needed throughout exploration and development. Researchers present use cases that drive our viewpoint, design goals, the resultant framework architecture, and comparisons to other frameworks in this part.
 Federated Learning (FL) has shown to be a viable option for enabling edge devices to develop a shared prediction model cooperatively while maintaining their training data on the device, divorcing the capacity to execute machine learning from the requirement to store data in the cloud. However, FL is challenging to implement practically in size and system heterogeneity. Although there are several research frameworks for simulating FL algorithms, none of them facilitate the investigation of scalable FL workloads on heterogeneous edge devices.
 Flower 0.18 released
 Thanks to a longer gap than usual, the latest Flower release has more upgrades than any previous release. Also, thanks to the wonderful community for your continuing support and generosity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm trying to run QAT on a MobileNetV2 based model but having some issues hitting the same training losses in the QAT phase as I did in the not-QAT phase.
 As a test, I'd trained the network for 1 epoch, then trained the QAT phase for 5 epochs and managed to get the same loss (actually lower). However, after training the model (non-QAT part) for 150 epochs, the QAT phase is really struggling to get down to the same loss.
 In my first test it dropped then completely levelled off for 2-3 epochs then nosedived again for another epoch, I'm not seeing the same in this longer train though.
 I was wondering if anyone has any advice on things like, should the learning rate be reset at the start of the QAT phase or should it carry on from where the training left off? I'm using Adam as the optimiser in the first phase, is that still ok in the second phase. Any other things that I could try? I did read a paper on improving quantization loss in MobileNet by L2 weighting the separable conv weights and swapping out ReLU6 for ReLU but I wasn't really seeing the same benefit as the paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08607.pdf) did in my tests, I was getting a worse initial network.
 Thanks for any insight that anyone can provide!

The 'now' part is a trivial problem, but the inference is something I'm struggling with. I could use regex but all the possible edge cases are tricky. 
 The inference would need to work on unstructured cases like "April 23rd", "Next Sunday", etc. It would need to work forwards and backward (5 days ago etc.)

 Any great papers/resources? I searched for date inference, but nothing similar to what I'm looking for

What is the best way to approach this problem, what is a good model structure (high level) and what can I do to be a step above the competition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a researcher who is deeply interested in deep generative models. There are excellent textbooks I want to read if time allows, such as:
 Probabilistic ML: https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html
 PRML: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf
 However, there are also many papers I have to read, new theories I have to learn, and works I need to finish. The problem is that reading textbooks could deepen the fundamental understanding of the field but rarely gives an immediate reward. Practically, reading a textbook from start to end can take > 1000 hours, in which one can read more than a hundred papers. Given the situation, I have studied basic stuff only when I need them for my research (you know, publish or perish).
 ​
 However, I think the time to read textbooks will decrease rather than increase, and only junior researchers will be able to afford to read them. It means that if I don't read them now, I won't be able to read later. Is there any general advice on this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a project featuring 5+ years of data detailing mechanic reports. Essentially, I want to use ML to build a model that can make suggested actions to fix an issue based on these mechanic reports. For example, if a user typed in that a car “makes a squeaky sound” then it suggests three courses of action that may fix the issue based on similar issues and solutions detailed in the mechanic reports. 
 Furthermore, when returning these suggestions, I want the user to see some sort of score indicating how likely it is to fix the issue (i.e. option A worked 97% of the time, option B 2% of the time, and option C 1% of the time). I also want the user to be able to try the options and give feedback on if they fixed the issue. 
 My brain immediately went to a recommender system, but I don’t have much experience with creating them. Can they do all of the above (recommend solutions, score solutions, and allow for user input to keep training the model) or do I need to somehow pair with another method/model? I’m just not sure where to start.

Machine learning, in simple terms, is a sort of artificial intelligence (AI) that lets software applications improve their accuracy at predicting events without having to be explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use past data as input to forecast new output values.
 The world changed with the introduction of vaccinations, revisions to mask regulations, and new COVID variations in 2021. Accordingly, their Maps community updated Google Maps with further information about their nearby areas. Their contributions have helped Google provide updated company information, such as a location’s hours of operation or its health and safety regulations, for 30% more firms in 2021 than 2020.

 For iterative pruning algorithms referring to research papers like:
 ​
  
Learning both Weights and Connections for Efficient Neural Networks
 Deep Compression
 Comparing Rewinding and Fine-Tuning in Neural Network Pruning
  
I have found that during these pruning rounds, the pruned sub-network starts to overfit excessively, with training accuracy approaching almost 100%. This can be attributed to the fact that the surviving trained parameters are not reinitialized to either the randomly initialized values or to a previous value from earlier in the training.
 Whereas, for "The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis" and it's family of related research papers such as:
  
The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis
 Stabilizing the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis
 One ticket to win them all
 Deconstructing Lottery Tickets
  
such overfitting is usually not observed due to the weight rewinding scheme.
 Since, the original & unpruned deep learning architecture is already trained with strategies such as: data augmentation, weight decay, learning rate schedule, etc., the resulting iterative pruning rounds result in overfitting.
 Can you suggest a way to avoid these overfitting during these iterative pruning rounds?

 I'm a student at the University of Glasgow building a linux app that is trying to use CNNs to teach people the ASL (american sign language) alphabet. We just released the first version of our software which (although admittedly buggy) is worth sharing with interested communities. In brief, a MobileNetv2 model is trained on kaggle data for each sign in the ASL alphabet, this is executed within the OpenCV framework and run on camera frames of the user in real time. The user is challenged to make different signs and rewarded when the correct sign is made. We would love for interested people to try out our software and let us know about enhancement ideas or any bugs they may find.
 If you are interested in the project, please head over to our GitHub to have a look:

 ​
 i am an EE student, i am currently taking a class (my first) in machine learning, also i am enjoying it so much, now we have reached the point where we are studying neural networks.. back propgation, CNN, RNN, Autoencoders, Deep Learning etc..
 ​
 and my prof wants us to get working with some projects (using neural network)
 ​
 basically he wants us to get some already written code in Gethub (((written with Pytorch))) and understand it, understand the task, the motivation, the structure and the math, and modify it if needed, and implement it, and this will be the project, no one starts from scratch
 ​
 for example:
 image classification
 object detection
 ​
 also he said that the code that identify numbers is simple for a project, it will be an assignment.
 ​
 so any ideas?
 or links
 or any advice in general
 ​
 thanks guys and all the best

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. Our DS & DA team open sourced a Python library that helps in dealing with categorical variables for machine learning algorithms.
 It leverages Tensorflow/Keras embedding layers and builds a neural network that learns a dense representation of each unique class. This is all packaged inside a regular scikit-learn transformer that can be used within pipelines and can have its hyperparameters optimized with regular sklearn methods.
 Just do pip install embedding-encoder[tf]. Check out the readme at Github or the blog post for examples.
 Github: https://github.com/cpa-analytics/embedding-encoder
 PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/embedding-encoder/
 Blog post: https://cpa-analytics.github.io/embedding-encoder-intro/
 This was inspired by the 3rd place solution in the Rossmann Store Sales Kaggle competition. Some implementations have surfaced over the years but we are not aware of working one that integrates well with existing libraries.
 This is just another preprocessing technique. It can be optimal for your task or not. As always, try multiple approaches and evaluate the results!

 Problem: Each binary has a variable amount of functions. Some may have 40 functions while others may have over 1000. Most will have between 50 and 200. The order of the functions is not important.
 Question: What is the best way to deal with these variable amount of input. Hashing trick? Or Deep sets? What would you recommend?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone!
 I'd like to use a large language model like T0pp or GPT-NeoX-20B to take a natural-language input from a user and map it to one of ~2000 possible VS Code command palette commands. Essentially, this is a classification problem of the form "NLP input -> command".
 The idea is to let users give voice input in natural language and then have the model figure out what command they most likely want to activate.
 Given the number of possible commands I clearly can't rely on prompt design to solve this. It might be a good fit for a model with explicit retrieval augmentation like a memorizing transformer. But that's still a very active area of research without high-quality pre-trained models.
 Given that, I'm thinking that doing some kind of fine tuning to an existing model is the best bet. But it's unclear to me what the training data should look like... should I just generate a few examples of each command of the form input: "vscode command: 'open new file'", output: "explorer.newFile", and then fine-tune on those? Is there some way to ensure that the model understands that I *always* want it to return one of the commands provided in fine-tuning, instead of arbitrary text?
 Interested in others' experiences with similar tasks! 
 Background: I'm working on an open source VS Code extension called Clippy AI. Currently it only performs code modifications to the current file and is a thin wrapper around the OpenAI API. But I'd like to use it to automate other editor actions as well!

And when I plotted the data, it had no clear trend. This pitcher for the graph looks like my dataset here! dataset (sorry I cannot share the dataset because of privacy). So, I started to take the difference in the data to remove the seasonality and log transformation and after that, I bullied the model using the Arima algorithm and LSTM, and prophet. And I applied a prediction interval for the predicted number to get periods and expect the number will be inside this interval. But unfortunately, the actual number (for this month) was out of the interval. So, I decided to look back in a database and I found a feature I think that may help and have a high correlation with the main feature now becoming a multivariate time series problem. so, I tried to use the VAR algorithm but unfortunately, the model also filed and the actual number for each feature was out of interval. This first time for me to build a time series model in the industry for a real dataset and I worked alone. So, there is an approach that can help me to build a better model that I do not follow in my step. Or I should go to my boss tell him cannot build a model for this dataset, especially the data is impacted by a coronavirus.

 I am a german student and currently writing my masters thesis. It is a rather simple ML task but for my thesis I need to describe the methodology and which process models are used and I am new to this. I found CRISP-DM and its successor ASUM-DM. However, I know that sounds stupid, I am not able to find information on these or useful pdfs. Like the general information and descriptions are accessable but I need an officisl source that I can cite. IBM itself has a link: ftp: //ftp.software.ibm.com/software/data/ sw-library/services/ASUM.pdf However, its not working for me as I have no ftp access. 
 So my question is, does anyone have a link where I can find relevant official information to these models and furthermore are there any other standards or process models to describe the approach of working with data that are rather used in the industry.

 In China, the state and companies are researching AI models with trillions of parameters. They want to prove that they can develop “brain-scale” AI.
 ...
 In a new paper, researchers from Tsinghua University, Alibaba Group, Zhejiang Lab and Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence present BaGuaLu, a framework that enables the training of large AI models using the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture.
 In an initial test, the researchers trained a 1.93 trillion model with their framework, outperforming Google’s Switch Transformer. They also demonstrate that their framework enables models with 14.5 trillion and a full 174 trillion parameters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently build a PPO agent for OpenAI gym's Pong environment using Pytorch and I had a question:
 So typically the workflow is:
  
Use the state as the input for a CNN and output the action probabilities
 Sample the action distribution for an action and perform env.step(action) with it
 Obtain there rewards and calculate some reward / loss function such as log probs*rewards
 Backpropogate this loss/reward using reward/loss.backward() and optimizer.step()
  
Now, Pytorch's loss.backward() and optimizer.step() only calculates and updates gradients for pyTorch Variable objects where requires_grad=True.
 So how does Pytorch backpropogate through env.step() ? env.step() outputs numpy arrays (if you're using a parallel environment) or integers (not tensors)...
 Secondly, if I try to convert a Tensor output to a numpy array to input to env.step() - say an array of actions for parallel environments, it breaks my backpropogation right?
 Thirdly, does that mean that env.step() is a differentiable function?
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google researchers created JAX to conduct NumPy computations on GPUs and TPUs. DeepMind uses it to help and expedite its research, and it is increasingly gaining popularity. Differentiation with grad(), vectorization with map(), and JIT-compilation (just-in-time) with jit are some of the composable functions required for machine learning research in JAX (). As a result, adding a JAX-based workload to the Flower code samples is a must-have. The combination of JAX and Flower allows ML and FL researchers to employ the deep learning framework that their projects demand. The updated code example now serves as a template for migrating existing JAX projects to a federated environment.
 It’s pretty simple to put up a centralized machine learning architecture, and the JAX developer documentation has multiple examples. Because the ML model parameters are stored in the DeviceArray data format, setting up the federated workload requires some knowledge of JAX. To be compatible with the Flower NumPyClient, those arguments must be converted to NumPy ndarrays. The JAX meets Flower example below demonstrates how a Flower setup might work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I have been interested in a field called pattern theory for some time now. Its a mathematical formalism to describe patterns in the world, as well as a framework for developing ai.
 As far as I can tell, pattern theory seems to be somewhat of a dead field. I'm not sure who is possibly still thinking about it other than a single digit number of academics (e.g. David Mumford). I find this a bit unfortunate, since while I'm still a bit naïve about the field, I'd like to find people I could talk to about it.
 Does anyone have any recommendations for where I could find people I could talk to about pattern theory/bounce ideas off of relating to pattern theory?
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am looking at having a neural network take inputs of 8 objects that all have different features/attributes and then an input of the different features/attributes of the environment the objects are in. The output of this would be the rank of each object. The attached image demonstrates a diagram of the neural network. The objects actively interact/compete with each other. I thought about inputting a single object's features and the environment into a neural network with the output as a performance score of the object. However, the object does worse or better depending on what other objects it is competing against. The objects also get better or worse over time, so it may be good to backpropagate and analyze the objects also as a time series.
 Is it possible to input the object/object features as a matrix? I have not figured out a way to group this data. I was thinking maybe a convolution neural network may work. I am somewhat new to the machine learning world. Any recommendation or help would be great. Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everybody,
 around half a year ago, I created a simple job aggregator called datajoblist.com, which fetches/scrapes remote jobs in data science, data engineering and AI from multiple sources and presents them in a simple, unified interface. The jobs are collected both directly from interesting (to me) companies like Stripe or Shopify, as well as filtered from job boards such as weworkremotely.com.
 I have not touched the site since when I first built it half a year ago, but it seems that people are finding it helpful, as it is now getting rather stable lower few thousand unique visitors per month, and has facilitated thousands of “apply” click-throughs to company sites. A few dozen people even signed up for the mailing list. So, I was thinking about investing a little more time now and adding some improvements.
 Is there any information/functionality that you would like to see there?
 Shortly, I will be adding the possibility to post jobs for a small fee (till now, all jobs on the site have been aggregated from elsewhere), but would love to add some usability improvements that are reasonably simple to implement for me. (Perhaps salary ranges, where available?)
 Thanks for any feedback and have a great day!

For example, decision trees can also be universal approximators, but they don't seem to have nearly as much success. Why is this? What do neural networks have beyond just being universal approximators that makes them special?
 ​
 Is this a question that is currently well understood or is the answer to this question still an area of research?

 Large language models such as GPT-3 have enabled many breakthroughs and new applications recently, but they come with an important downside: Training them is very expensive, and even fine-tuning is often difficult. This paper presents an adaptive method to improve performance of such models after deployment, without ever changing the model itself. This is done by maintaining a memory of interactions and then dynamically adapting new prompts by augmenting them with memory content. This has many applications, from non-intrusive fine-tuning to personalization.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there 👋🏻,
 We’re happy to announce that Edward Beeching from Hugging Face has integrated Decision Transformers an Offline Reinforcement Learning method, into the 🤗 transformers library and the Hugging Face Hub.
 In addition, we share nine pre-trained model checkpoints for continuous control tasks in the Gym environment.
 If you want to know more about Decision Transformers and how to start using it, we wrote a tutorial 👉 https://huggingface.co/blog/decision-transformers
 We would love to hear your feedback about it,
 In the coming weeks and months, we will be extending the reinforcement learning ecosystem by:
  
Being able to train your own Decision Transformers from scratch.
 Integrating RL-baselines3-zoo
 Uploading RL-trained-agents models into the Hub: a big collection of pre-trained Reinforcement Learning agents using stable-baselines3
 Integrating other Deep Reinforcement Learning libraries
 Implementing Convolutional Decision Transformers for Atari
  
And more to come 🥳, so 📢 The best way to keep in touch is to join our discord server to exchange with us and with the community.
 Thanks,

 I assume that they are the same program with the same run time but I can’t be too sure of that. Thanks.

During the time the agent is unavailable, several rewards are produced by the environment, and they need to be given to the agent whenever it becomes available again. 
 One easy way to deal with this is to just store them and set the reward at the next available state as the sum of the accumulated rewards. But in the discounted reward framework with temporal difference (e.g. DQN) this does not discount rewards properly. How can I set the reward for the next state such that it contains all the accumulated rewards but it is correct in the DQN setting?

 This work systematically explores t-SNE hyperparameters using almost 700 data sets. We replicate past studies, proving that some t-SNE guidelines generalize beyond their original context. But we find that some guidelines do not appear to generalize. We also show a proof of concept neural network system for featurizing data sets and automatically recommending good t-SNE hyperparameters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey ML Reddit!
 I just released the initial version of MLbot (https://github.com/thecooltechguy/mlbot): a new open-source tool that I’ve been working on for running distributed ML training jobs in your cloud, with a single command.
 How it works:
 In short, it allows you to run your training script in the cloud by simply swapping “python” for “mlbot run”.
 For example, if ``python train.py … can run your training script locally, then mlbot run --instance-type p3dn.24xlarge --num-nodes 2 train.py … should be able to run your code in the cloud across 2 GPU machines.
 Since this tool runs entirely inside your cloud environment, you don’t have to transfer your training data to a 3rd party, while having full observability into the underlying infrastructure.
 Why I built this:

The Applied Research Track aims at attracting submissions from both industry and academia that either solve or advance the understanding of issues related to deploying AI, Information Retrieval (IR), and big data technologies as part of actual applications.
  
My paper is roughly related to applying deep learning for time series anomaly detection. Should I go for the research track or the applied research track?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have excelled at solving complex real-world problems, however, training a good DNN has become more complex. It is challenging to ensure that the optimizers used will converge to reliable minima with acceptable model performance when only minimizing the conventional empirical loss.
 Tsinghua University’s research team proposes Stochastic Scheduled SAM (SS-SAM), a novel and effective DNN training strategy. In SS-SAM, the optimizer is set up by a predetermined scheduling function to run a random trial at each update step, which selects whether to perform the SGD or SAM optimization at random. The overall number of propagation pairs could be significantly decreased in this approach. The team’s approach provides equivalent or higher model training performance at a lower computational cost than baseline sharpness-aware minimization (SAM).

 One particular problem we really want to solve is to have more brain cancer patients to be accessible to stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) which has a lot better treatment outcome and much better quality of life (QoL) for the patient than whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) which is more common for patients with multiple brainiest (say more than 5 or 10).

 Well, I'm not familiar with other cloud services like Azure or AWS but I used Google Colab a lot, and right at this moment I also use it. But it's constantly asking if I'm "there". It always wants an interaction otherwise it shutdowns the session and my time gets wasted, just gotta do everything from the start.
 So if I pay for the colab pro (unpluss) version, will my experience get better? Will I need to interact with colab every hour again? Or should I consider other alternatives?

The economics are making it untenable for most people except the most well-funded organizations to invest in large language models. I will make the comparison to the semiconductor ecosystem. If you look at fabrication economics for semiconductor chips, they cost tens to hundreds of millions of dollars and have relatively short lifetimes. One needs very large volume usage to justify manufacturing a custom ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuits). Thus, we do not have that many companies fabricating chips. However, we have an entire software and systems eco-system which relies on these chips that have built massive industries around them. And, if you look at the biggest companies in the world (maybe, except Apple), they have very little to do with ASIC design and fabrication as part of their core business. I think a similar eco-system would pan out in the large-scale modeling space as well. We would have a few well-funded companies that would be training these extremely large and reusable models and other companies would build applications and services reusing and customizing these models.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I have a question regarding optimizing a policy represented by a neural network. In Supervised Learning, the intermediate activations created during the forward pass are needed during backpropagation in order to compute weight gradients. This has led to a number of memory management techniques such as offloading and checkpointing being created.
 My question is whether the same is true in DRL. For policy-gradient methods for example, learning starts from an objective computed from the trajectory such as the discounted returns, but are the intermediate activations created during action inference needed when optimizing the policy (i.e. learning)? 
 Is there any academic source that covers this topic? 
 Thanks!

 Then, give it some basic code or responses that you had at different ages.
 Also, getting a bunch of 3D images of yourself.
 Then coding it with some basic "values" and creating some sort of generic conditional statement for the 3 basic values that it has that match yours.
 Then, over time, actually diving into artificial intelligence and slowly updating and replacing those to continue improving it to match you (and your growth)?
 Hmmm, I wonder if there would be a way to preserve it. Everything changes (like sites -> VR and so on). So some sort of "survival" instinct (which seems impossible to code but would be fun to try undertaking).

and demanding task. Often after initially released, it undergoes several
revisions later (maybe due to human or technical constraints) - as a result, it
may take weeks until the data reaches to a stable value. This so-called
'backfill' phenomenon and its effect on model performance has been barely
studied in the prior literature. In this paper, we introduce the multi-variate
backfill problem using COVID-19 as the motivating example. We construct a
detailed dataset composed of relevant signals over the past year of the
pandemic. We then systematically characterize several patterns in backfill
dynamics and leverage our observations for formulating a novel problem and
neural framework Back2Future that aims to refines a given model's predictions
in real-time. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our method refines the
performance of top models for COVID-19 forecasting, in contrast to non-trivial
baselines, yielding 18% improvement over baselines, enabling us obtain a new
SOTA performance. In addition, we show that our model improves model evaluation
too; hence policy-makers can better understand the true accuracy of forecasting
models in real-time.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, I am wondering about the losses of conditional GANs, particularly their magnitude. Due to the amount of classes/identities, the classification loss will usually be significantly higher than discrimination loss (data identified as real or generated). When using traditional multitask learning where losses are simply summed up, how is the generator supposed to learn to generate realistic-appearing data when the loss that would encourage that is so low in comparison to the classification loss?

In my opinion, the value function is used as a baseline since it assign high value to state with high expected return, and every action in this state have the same baseline. 
 Pseudocode in sutton's book
 But I also see a Q-version of AC algorithm, which use Q function as the baseline. In this algorithm, the Q function is used to update the policy, and the TD error is used to update the Q function. How could we get this?
 Q Actor-critic
 Another question is about AC and A2C. Is expected return (G) minus baseline the same as the advantage function in A2C? If so, is that AC with baseline the same as A2C?

Why do all of the code examples train the model on its own discounted prediction plus the reward, if they could just record all of the rewards in an episode and then calculate the total discounted rewards from the actual rewards the agent got in the episode? At least in my Implementations, the latter strategy seems to outperform the former, both in regard to the time it took the model to converge and the quality of the learned policy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 ​
 I'm trying to train a GAN to generate video game portraits (think Baldur's Gate, Divinity, that kind of stuff).
 My GAN is trained on 4096 portraits, 128x192 pixels in size.
 Batch size is 64, 64 features, 128 dim noise vector.
 ​
 After a few epochs of the expected low quality random stuff, my Generator starts generating images where you can kind of imagine silhouettes and faces. Here's after 250 epochs:
 ​

 But after 500 the results are pretty much the same:
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/k9ikn9k7zpp81.png?width=568&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ec106e5ef5d54c3a8162bb45941fb3f3f9af4a2
 Losses seem be mostly stable fairly quickly too (sorry, lost the graph after I accidentally shutdown my computer - I save the model every 25 epochs but not the losses graph):
 Epoch 255 Step 16320: Generator loss: 7.4651877045631405, critic loss: -9.97341676712036
 ...
 Epoch 310 Step 19840: Generator loss: 7.401800179481507, critic loss: -9.479909801483156
 ...
 Epoch 511 Step 32720: Generator loss: 11.518763446807862, critic loss: -8.105796337127687
 (The 7.5 -> 11.5 GLoss looks pretty much flat on the graph. Maybe the huge initial losses puts it out of perspective?)
 ​
 Is my GAN "stuck" or do I just need to keep training, and quality gains from that point on are going to be slower?

 Is there any guideline about how skip connections should be implemented in GANs? I'm using a very normal resnet type skip connection. The FID score keeps worsening since the start of training, and I've tweaked a lot of hyperparameters, but I still don't have see any improvements. Although I could not train that many epochs because I'm training this on colab.
 You can find the codes here to see the architecture: Generator and Critic.
 Another info: The dataset is roughly 100K book covers I've scraped from internet.

 do I treat it like an image without the processing being necessary. can I reshape it into a matrix the size of the raw image output, and throw it into a series of convolutional layers? or do I treat it as positional data like the location of all the objects?

This should make predicting properties of drugs particularly problematic because we are not drawing further testing samples from a distribution that is similar to the training distribution, but we’re completely changing the input as we wish. Why is machine learning/deep learning successful at predicting these properties when the wider research community is struggling to make deep learning models robust, never mind causal, in general.

However, while looking into different vendors, I notice that workstations cost less than a rack-mount server even they have better specifications (I saw a gpu workstation with a 48-core 3.8 GHz processor and its cost still a few thousands less than a rack server with similar specifications and the same number and type of GPUs but with a lower grade processor with only 24-core 2.5 GHz). I was really surprised. Is there an advantage for buying a rack-mount GPU server over a GPU Workstation given it cost more for similar or lower specifications?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When making zero-shot inference, large pre-trained models like CLIP or ALIGN provide consistent accuracy across various data distributions (i.e., without fine-tuning on a specific dataset). While existing fine-tuning methods vastly improve accuracy on a given target distribution, they frequently compromise robustness to distribution shifts. This conflict can be resolved by presenting a simple and effective strategy for enhancing robustness while fine-tuning: assembling the zero-shot and fine-tuned models (WiSE-FT). 
 An approach for fine-tuning AI models that enhance robustness during distribution shift has been open-sourced by researchers from the University of Washington (UW), Google Brain, and Columbia University. According to tests, WISE-FT improves accuracy by up to 6% on specific computer vision (CV) benchmarks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, a surge of interest in visual transformers is to reduce the
computational cost by limiting the calculation of self-attention to a local
window. Most current work uses a fixed single-scale window for modeling by
default, ignoring the impact of window size on model performance. However, this
may limit the modeling potential of these window-based models for multi-scale
information. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named Dynamic Window
Vision Transformer (DW-ViT). The dynamic window strategy proposed by DW-ViT
goes beyond the model that employs a fixed single window setting. To the best
of our knowledge, we are the first to use dynamic multi-scale windows to
explore the upper limit of the effect of window settings on model performance.
In DW-ViT, multi-scale information is obtained by assigning windows of
different sizes to different head groups of window multi-head self-attention.
Then, the information is dynamically fused by assigning different weights to
the multi-scale window branches. We conducted a detailed performance evaluation
on three datasets, ImageNet-1K, ADE20K, and COCO. Compared with related
state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods, DW-ViT obtains the best performance.
Specifically, compared with the current SoTA Swin Transformers
\cite{liu2021swin}, DW-ViT has achieved consistent and substantial improvements
on all three datasets with similar parameters and computational costs. In
addition, DW-ViT exhibits good scalability and can be easily inserted into any
window-based visual transformers.]]></summary>

widely used in reinforcement learning to improve the robustness of a learned

this robust set of adversarial reward perturbations under KL and
alpha-divergence regularization, which includes Shannon and Tsallis entropy
regularization as special cases. Importantly, generalization guarantees can be
given within this robust set. We provide detailed discussion of the worst-case
reward perturbations, and present intuitive empirical examples to illustrate
this robustness and its relationship with generalization. Finally, we discuss
how our analysis complements and extends previous results on adversarial reward
robustness and path consistency optimality conditions.]]></summary>

applications, including many applications in the sectors of aeronautics and
commercial aviation. These models are in charge of providing key insights, such
as which parameters are important on a specific measured outcome or which
parameter values we should expect to observe given a set of input parameters.
At the same time, however, these models rely heavily on assumptions (e.g.,
stationarity) or are "black box" (e.g., deep neural networks), meaning that
they lack interpretability of their internal working and can be viewed only in
terms of their inputs and outputs. An interpretable alternative to the "black
box" models and with considerably less assumptions is symbolic regression (SR).
SR searches for the optimal model structure while simultaneously optimizing the
model's parameters without relying on an a-priori model structure. In this
work, we apply SR on real-life exhaust gas temperature (EGT) data, collected at
high frequencies through the entire flight, in order to uncover meaningful
algebraic relationships between the EGT and other measurable engine parameters.
The experimental results exhibit promising model accuracy, as well as
explainability returning an absolute difference of 3{\deg}C compared to the
ground truth and demonstrating consistency from an engineering perspective.]]></summary>

fully utilise available data for selfsupervised identification of atypical
scenes or objects. State-of-the-art augmentation methods arbitrarily embed
"structural" peculiarity on typical images so that classifying these artefacts
can provide guidance for learning representations for the detection of
anomalous visual signals. In this paper, however, we argue that learning such
structure-sensitive representations can be a suboptimal approach to some
classes of anomaly (e.g., unhealthy fruits) which could be better recognised by
a different type of visual element such as "colour". We thus propose Channel
Randomisation as a novel data augmentation method for restricting neural
networks to learn encoding of "colour irregularity" whilst predicting
channel-randomised images to ultimately build reliable fruit-monitoring robots
identifying atypical fruit qualities. Our experiments show that (1) this
colour-based alternative can better learn representations for consistently
accurate identification of fruit anomalies in various fruit species, and also,
(2) unlike other methods, the validation accuracy can be utilised as a
criterion for early stopping of training in practice due to positive
correlation between the performance in the self-supervised
colour-differentiation task and the subsequent detection rate of actual
anomalous fruits. Also, the proposed approach is evaluated on a new
agricultural dataset, Riseholme-2021, consisting of 3.5K strawberry images
gathered by a mobile robot, which we share online to encourage active
agri-robotics research.]]></summary>

strategy, we consider the regression between combinatorial spaces, aiming to
infer high-quality optimization solutions from samples of input-solution pairs
-- without the need to learn the objective function. Our main deliverable is a
universal solver that is able to handle abstract undetermined stochastic

learning-error analysis under the PAC-Bayesian framework using a new
margin-based analysis. In empirical studies, we demonstrate our design using

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cortical surface registration is a fundamental tool for neuroimaging analysis
that has been shown to improve the alignment of functional regions relative to
volumetric approaches. Classically, image registration is performed by
optimizing a complex objective similarity function, leading to long run times.
This contributes to a convention for aligning all data to a global average
reference frame that poorly reflects the underlying cortical heterogeneity. In
this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised learning-based framework that
converts registration to a multi-label classification problem, where each point
in a low-resolution control grid deforms to one of fixed, finite number of
endpoints. This is learned using a spherical geometric deep learning
architecture, in an end-to-end unsupervised way, with regularization imposed
using a deep Conditional Random Field (CRF). Experiments show that our proposed
framework performs competitively, in terms of similarity and areal distortion,
relative to the most popular classical surface registration algorithms and
generates smoother deformations than other learning-based surface registration
methods, even in subjects with atypical cortical morphology.]]></summary>

as controlling prosthetic hands or robotic arms. Gesture recognition exploiting
surface electromyographic (sEMG) signals is one of the most promising
approaches, given that sEMG signal acquisition is non-invasive and is directly
related to muscle contraction. However, the analysis of these signals still
presents many challenges since similar gestures result in similar muscle
contractions. Thus the resulting signal shapes are almost identical, leading to
low classification accuracy. To tackle this challenge, complex neural networks
are employed, which require large memory footprints, consume relatively high
energy and limit the maximum battery life of devices used for classification.
This work addresses this problem with the introduction of the Bioformers. This
new family of ultra-small attention-based architectures approaches
state-of-the-art performance while reducing the number of parameters and
operations of 4.9X. Additionally, by introducing a new inter-subjects
pre-training, we improve the accuracy of our best Bioformer by 3.39%, matching
state-of-the-art accuracy without any additional inference cost. Deploying our
best performing Bioformer on a Parallel, Ultra-Low Power (PULP) microcontroller
unit (MCU), the GreenWaves GAP8, we achieve an inference latency and energy of
2.72 ms and 0.14 mJ, respectively, 8.0X lower than the previous
state-of-the-art neural network, while occupying just 94.2 kB of memory.]]></summary>

measurements (CMs) to estimate accurate positions even in multipath propagation
scenarios. State-of-the art CM fingerprinting(FP)-based methods employ
convolutional neural networks (CNN) to extract the spatial information.
However, they need spatially dense data sets (associated with high acquisition
and maintenance efforts) to work well -- which is rarely the case in practical
applications. If such data is not available (or its quality is low), we cannot
compensate the performance degradation of CNN-based FP as they do not provide
statistical position estimates, which prevents a fusion with other sources of
information on the observation level.

We propose a novel localization framework that adapts well to sparse datasets
that only contain CMs of specific areas within the environment with strong
multipath propagation. Our framework compresses CMs into informative features
to unravel spatial information. It then regresses Gaussian processes (GPs) for
each of them, which imply statistical observation models based on
distance-dependent covariance kernels. Our framework combines the trained GPs
with line-of-sight ranges and a dynamics model in a particle filter. Our
measurements show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art CNN
fingerprinting (0.52 m vs. 1.3 m MAE) on spatially sparse data collected in a
realistic industrial indoor environment.]]></summary>

provided huge improvements on vision-and-language (V&L) tasks as well as on
pure language tasks. However, fine-tuning the entire parameter set of
pre-trained models becomes impractical since the model size is growing rapidly.
Hence, in this paper, we introduce adapter-based parameter-efficient transfer
learning techniques to V&L models such as VL-BART and VLT5. We evaluate our
methods in a unified multi-task setup on both image-text and video-text
benchmarks. For the image-text tasks, we use four diverse V&L datasets: VQAv2,
GQA, NLVR2 , and MSCOCO image captioning. For video-text tasks, we use TVQA,
How2QA, TVC, and YC2C. With careful training and thorough experiments, we
benchmark three popular adapter-based methods (Adapter, Hyperformer, Compacter)
against the standard full fine-tuning and the recently proposed prompt-tuning
approach. We also enhance the efficiency and performance of adapters by sharing
their weights to attain knowledge across tasks. Our results demonstrate that
training the adapter with the weight-sharing technique (4.18% of total
parameters for image-text tasks and 3.39% for video-text tasks) can match the
performance of fine-tuning the entire model. Lastly, we present a comprehensive
analysis including the combination of adapter and task-specific prompts and the
impact of V&L pre-training on adapters. Our code is available at:

perceptual scale. This is mostly done directly by rating, e.g. using single or
double stimulus methodologies, or indirectly by ranking or pairwise comparison.
All these methods estimate the perceptual magnitudes of the stimuli on a scale.
However, procedures such as Maximum Likelihood Difference Scaling (MLDS) have
shown that considering perceptual distances can bring benefits in terms of
discriminatory power, observers' cognitive load, and the number of trials
required. One of the disadvantages of the MLDS method is that the perceptual
scales obtained for stimuli created from different source content are generally
not comparable. In this paper, we propose an extension of the MLDS method that
ensures inter-content comparability of the results and shows its usefulness
especially in the presence of observer errors.]]></summary>

convergence speedup properties on very large problems. However, they inherently
suffer from communication related slowdowns and communication topology becomes
a crucial design choice. Common approaches supported by most machine learning
frameworks are: 1) Synchronous decentralized algorithms relying on a
peer-to-peer All Reduce topology that is sensitive to stragglers and
communication delays. 2) Asynchronous centralised algorithms with a server
based topology that is prone to communication bottleneck. Researchers also
suggested asynchronous decentralized algorithms designed to avoid the
bottleneck and speedup training, however, those commonly use inexact sparse
averaging that may lead to a degradation in accuracy. In this paper, we propose
Local Asynchronous SGD (LASGD), an asynchronous decentralized algorithm that
relies on All Reduce for model synchronization.

We empirically validate LASGD's performance on image classification tasks on
the ImageNet dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that LASGD accelerates
training compared to SGD and state of the art gossip based approaches.]]></summary>

well they perform. Without this frame of reference, the performance score of a
model is basically meaningless. What does it mean when a model achieves an
$F_1$ of 0.8 on a test set? A proper baseline is needed to evaluate the
`goodness' of a performance score. Comparing with the latest state-of-the-art
model is usually insightful. However, being state-of-the-art can change rapidly
when newer models are developed. Contrary to an advanced model, a simple dummy
classifier could be used. However, the latter could be beaten too easily,
making the comparison less valuable. This paper presents a universal baseline
method for all binary classification models, named the Dutch Draw (DD). This
approach weighs simple classifiers and determines the best classifier to use as
a baseline. We theoretically derive the DD baseline for many commonly used
evaluation measures and show that in most situations it reduces to (almost)
always predicting either zero or one. Summarizing, the DD baseline is: (1)
general, as it is applicable to all binary classification problems; (2) simple,
as it is quickly determined without training or parameter-tuning; (3)
informative, as insightful conclusions can be drawn from the results. The DD
baseline serves two purposes. First, to enable comparisons across research
papers by this robust and universal baseline. Secondly, to provide a sanity
check during the development process of a prediction model. It is a major
warning sign when a model is outperformed by the DD baseline.]]></summary>

for designing coherent continual learning methods in ViTs. We first carry out
an evaluation of established continual learning regularization techniques. We
then examine the effect of regularization when applied to two key enablers of
SAM: (a) the contextualized embedding layers, for their ability to capture
well-scaled representations with respect to the values, and (b) the prescaled
attention maps, for carrying value-independent global contextual information.
We depict the perks of each distilling strategy on two image recognition
benchmarks (CIFAR100 and ImageNet-32) -- while (a) leads to a better overall
accuracy, (b) helps enhance the rigidity by maintaining competitive
performances. Furthermore, we identify the limitation imposed by the symmetric
nature of regularization losses. To alleviate this, we propose an asymmetric
variant and apply it to the pooled output distillation (POD) loss adapted for
ViTs. Our experiments confirm that introducing asymmetry to POD boosts its

Demand-Driven Services (DDS) into urban lives, including ridesharing, on-demand
delivery, express systems and warehousing. In DDS, a service loop is an
elemental structure, including its service worker, the service providers and
corresponding service targets. The service workers should transport either
humans or parcels from the providers to the target locations. Various planning
tasks within DDS can thus be classified into two individual stages: 1)
Dispatching, which is to form service loops from demand/supply distributions,
and 2)Routing, which is to decide specific serving orders within the
constructed loops. Generating high-quality strategies in both stages is
important to develop DDS but faces several challenging. Meanwhile, deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) has been developed rapidly in recent years. It is
a powerful tool to solve these problems since DRL can learn a parametric model
without relying on too many problem-based assumptions and optimize long-term
effect by learning sequential decisions. In this survey, we first define DDS,
then highlight common applications and important decision/control problems
within. For each problem, we comprehensively introduce the existing DRL
solutions. We also introduce open simulation environments for development and

approximation approach. These models construct a moment-based system of
equations that approximate the particle-based physics as a fluid, but as a
result lack the small-scale physical processes available to fully kinetic
models. Traditionally, empirical closure relations are used to close the
moment-based system of equations, which typically approximate the pressure
tensor or heat flux. The more accurate the closure relation, the stronger the
simulation approaches kinetic-based results. In this paper, new closure terms
are constructed using machine learning techniques. Two different machine
learning models, a multi-layer perceptron and a gradient boosting regressor,
synthesize a local closure relation for the pressure tensor and heat flux
vector from fully kinetic simulations of a 2D magnetic reconnection problem.
The models are compared to an existing closure relation for the pressure
tensor, and the applicability of the models is discussed. The initial results
show that the models can capture the diagonal components of the pressure tensor
accurately, and show promising results for the heat flux, opening the way for
new experiments in multi-scale modeling. We find that the sampling of the
points used to train both models play a capital role in their accuracy.]]></summary>

and fail at generalizing, especially when facing heterogeneous scenarios. In
this work, we investigate such behavior through the lens of geometry of the

capacity to the sharpness of the solution. Motivated by prior studies
connecting the sharpness of the loss surface and the generalization gap, we
show that i) training clients locally with Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)
or its adaptive version (ASAM) and ii) averaging stochastic weights (SWA) on
the server-side can substantially improve generalization in Federated Learning
and help bridging the gap with centralized models. By seeking parameters in
neighborhoods having uniform low loss, the model converges towards flatter
minima and its generalization significantly improves in both homogeneous and
heterogeneous scenarios. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of
those optimizers across a variety of benchmark vision datasets (e.g.
CIFAR10/100, Landmarks-User-160k, IDDA) and tasks (large scale classification,

compare the CheckList generated by AMCG with CheckLists generated with
different levels of human intervention. Through in-depth crosslingual

to gradient-based inversion attacks. During this attack, the original data
batch is reconstructed given model weights and the corresponding gradients. We
introduce a method, named GradViT, that optimizes random noise into naturally
looking images via an iterative process. The optimization objective consists of
(i) a loss on matching the gradients, (ii) image prior in the form of distance
to batch-normalization statistics of a pretrained CNN model, and (iii) a total
variation regularization on patches to guide correct recovery locations. We
propose a unique loss scheduling function to overcome local minima during
optimization. We evaluate GadViT on ImageNet1K and MS-Celeb-1M datasets, and
observe unprecedentedly high fidelity and closeness to the original (hidden)
data. During the analysis we find that vision transformers are significantly
more vulnerable than previously studied CNNs due to the presence of the
attention mechanism. Our method demonstrates new state-of-the-art results for
gradient inversion in both qualitative and quantitative metrics. Project page

touch or overlap. In an attempt to automate the process, previous studies
turned to Deep Learning methods, with some formulating the task as a semantic
segmentation problem. These models treat separate chromosome instances as
semantic classes, which we show to be problematic, since it is uncertain which
chromosome should be classed as #1 and #2. Assigning class labels based on
comparison rules, such as the shorter/longer chromosome alleviates, but does
not fully resolve the issue. Instead, we separate the chromosome instances in a
second stage, predicting the orientation of the chromosomes by the model and
use it as one of the key distinguishing factors of the chromosomes. We
demonstrate this method to be effective. Furthermore, we introduce a novel
Double-Angle representation that a neural network can use to predict the
orientation. The representation maps any direction and its reverse to the same
point. Lastly, we present a new expanded synthetic dataset, which is based on
Pommier's dataset, but addresses its issues with insufficient separation

Sensing (CS) performance compared to traditional, hand-crafted methods.
However, they are broadly limited in terms of generalisability, inductive bias
and difficulty to model long distance relationships. Transformer neural
networks (TNN) overcome such issues by implementing an attention mechanism
designed to capture dependencies between inputs. However, high-resolution tasks
typically require vision Transformers (ViT) to decompose an image into
patch-based tokens, limiting inputs to inherently local contexts. We propose a
novel image decomposition that naturally embeds images into low-resolution
inputs. These Kaleidoscope tokens (KD) provide a mechanism for global
attention, at the same computational cost as a patch-based approach. To
showcase this development, we replace CNN components in a well-known CS-MRI
neural network with TNN blocks and demonstrate the improvements afforded by KD.
We also propose an ensemble of image tokens, which enhance overall image
quality and reduces model size. Supplementary material is available:

them. On their side, the agents receive those personalized incentives, compute
a solution to an extended game, and then return feedback measurements to the
coordinator. In the stationary setting, our algorithm returns a Nash
equilibrium in case the coordinator is endowed with standard learning policies,
while it returns a Nash equilibrium up to a constant, yet adjustable, error in

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sparse decision tree optimization has been one of the most fundamental
problems in AI since its inception and is a challenge at the core of
interpretable machine learning. Sparse decision tree optimization is
computationally hard, and despite steady effort since the 1960's, breakthroughs
have only been made on the problem within the past few years, primarily on the
problem of finding optimal sparse decision trees. However, current
state-of-the-art algorithms often require impractical amounts of computation
time and memory to find optimal or near-optimal trees for some real-world
datasets, particularly those having several continuous-valued features. Given
that the search spaces of these decision tree optimization problems are
massive, can we practically hope to find a sparse decision tree that competes
in accuracy with a black box machine learning model? We address this problem
via smart guessing strategies that can be applied to any optimal
branch-and-bound-based decision tree algorithm. We show that by using these
guesses, we can reduce the run time by multiple orders of magnitude, while
providing bounds on how far the resulting trees can deviate from the black
box's accuracy and expressive power. Our approach enables guesses about how to
bin continuous features, the size of the tree, and lower bounds on the error
for the optimal decision tree. Our experiments show that in many cases we can
rapidly construct sparse decision trees that match the accuracy of black box

conversion capability between text and image domains. While these methods have
incrementally improved the generated image fidelity and text relevancy, several
pivotal gaps remain unanswered, limiting applicability and quality. We propose
a novel text-to-image method that addresses these gaps by (i) enabling a simple
control mechanism complementary to text in the form of a scene, (ii)
introducing elements that substantially improve the tokenization process by
employing domain-specific knowledge over key image regions (faces and salient
objects), and (iii) adapting classifier-free guidance for the transformer use
case. Our model achieves state-of-the-art FID and human evaluation results,
unlocking the ability to generate high fidelity images in a resolution of
512x512 pixels, significantly improving visual quality. Through scene
controllability, we introduce several new capabilities: (i) Scene editing, (ii)
text editing with anchor scenes, (iii) overcoming out-of-distribution text
prompts, and (iv) story illustration generation, as demonstrated in the story

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Client-wise data heterogeneity is one of the major issues that hinder
effective training in federated learning (FL). Since the data distribution on
each client may vary dramatically, the client selection strategy can
significantly influence the convergence rate of the FL process. Active client
selection strategies are popularly proposed in recent studies. However, they
neglect the loss correlations between the clients and achieve only marginal
improvement compared to the uniform selection strategy. In this work, we
propose FedCor -- an FL framework built on a correlation-based client selection
strategy, to boost the convergence rate of FL. Specifically, we first model the
loss correlations between the clients with a Gaussian Process (GP). Based on
the GP model, we derive a client selection strategy with a significant
reduction of expected global loss in each round. Besides, we develop an
efficient GP training method with a low communication overhead in the FL
scenario by utilizing the covariance stationarity. Our experimental results
show that compared to the state-of-the-art method, FedCorr can improve the
convergence rates by $34\%\sim 99\%$ and $26\%\sim 51\%$ on FMNIST and
CIFAR-10, respectively.]]></summary>

three-dimensional (3D) imaging of hundreds of micrometers of tissue with
nanometer-scale resolution, providing new opportunities to study the
ultrastructure of the brain. In this work, we introduce a freely available
Matlab-based gACSON software for visualization, segmentation, assessment, and
morphology analysis of myelinated axons in 3D-EM volumes of brain tissue
samples. Methods: The software is equipped with a graphical user interface
(GUI). It automatically segments the intra-axonal space of myelinated axons and
their corresponding myelin sheaths and allows manual segmentation,
proofreading, and interactive correction of the segmented components. gACSON
analyzes the morphology of myelinated axons, such as axonal diameter, axonal
eccentricity, myelin thickness, or g-ratio. Results: We illustrate the use of
the software by segmenting and analyzing myelinated axons in six 3D-EM volumes
of rat somatosensory cortex after sham surgery or traumatic brain injury (TBI).
Our results suggest that the equivalent diameter of myelinated axons in
somatosensory cortex was decreased in TBI animals five months after the injury.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that gACSON is a valuable tool for
visualization, segmentation, assessment, and morphology analysis of myelinated
axons in 3D-EM volumes. It is freely available at

themselves to be a powerful tool in all facets of society. However, due to
budget limitations, deliberate or non-deliberate censorship, and other problems
during data collection and curation, the labeled training set might exhibit a
systematic shortage of data for certain groups. We investigate a scenario in
which the absence of certain data is linked to the second level of a two-level
hierarchy in the data. Inspired by the idea of protected groups from
algorithmic fairness, we refer to the partitions carved by this second level as
"subgroups"; we refer to combinations of subgroups and classes, or leaves of
the hierarchy, as "sources". To characterize the problem, we introduce the
concept of classes with incomplete subgroup support. The representational bias
in the training set can give rise to spurious correlations between the classes
and the subgroups which render standard classification models ungeneralizable
to unseen sources. To overcome this bias, we make use of an additional, diverse
but unlabeled dataset, called the "deployment set", to learn a representation
that is invariant to subgroup. This is done by adversarially matching the
support of the training and deployment sets in representation space. In order
to learn the desired invariance, it is paramount that the sets of samples
observed by the discriminator are balanced by class; this is easily achieved
for the training set, but requires using semi-supervised clustering for the
deployment set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with experiments
on several datasets and variants of the problem.]]></summary>

in many modern natural language processing applications. TLM training is
conducted in two phases. First, the model is pre-trained over large volumes of
text to minimize a generic objective function, such as the Masked Language
Model (MLM). Second, the model is fine-tuned in specific downstream tasks.
Pre-training requires large volumes of data and high computational resources,
while introducing many still unresolved design choices. For instance, selecting
hyperparameters for language model pre-training is often carried out based on
heuristics or grid-based searches. In this work, we propose a multi-armed
bandit-based online optimization framework for the sequential selection of
pre-training hyperparameters to optimize language model performance. We pose
the pre-training procedure as a sequential decision-making task, where at each
pre-training step, an agent must determine what hyperparameters to use towards
optimizing the pre-training objective. We propose a Thompson sampling bandit
algorithm, based on a surrogate Gaussian process reward model of the MLM
pre-training objective, for its sequential minimization. We empirically show
how the proposed Gaussian process based Thompson sampling pre-trains robust and
well-performing language models. Namely, by sequentially selecting masking
hyperparameters of the TLM, we achieve satisfactory performance in less epochs,
not only in terms of the pre-training MLM objective, but in diverse downstream
fine-tuning tasks. The proposed bandit-based technique provides an automated
hyperparameter selection method for pre-training TLMs of interest to
practitioners. In addition, our results indicate that, instead of MLM
pre-training with fixed masking probabilities, sequentially adapting the
masking hyperparameters improves both pre-training loss and downstream task

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In real-world applications, it is important and desirable to learn a model
that performs well on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Recently, causality has
become a powerful tool to tackle the OOD generalization problem, with the idea
resting on the causal mechanism that is invariant across domains of interest.
To leverage the generally unknown causal mechanism, existing works assume a
linear form of causal feature or require sufficiently many and diverse training
domains, which are usually restrictive in practice. In this work, we obviate
these assumptions and tackle the OOD problem without explicitly recovering the
causal feature. Our approach is based on transformations that modify the
non-causal feature but leave the causal part unchanged, which can be either
obtained from prior knowledge or learned from the training data in the
multi-domain scenario. Under the setting of invariant causal mechanism, we
theoretically show that if all such transformations are available, then we can
learn a minimax optimal model across the domains using only single domain data.
Noticing that knowing a complete set of these causal invariant transformations
may be impractical, we further show that it suffices to know only a subset of
these transformations. Based on the theoretical findings, a regularized
training procedure is proposed to improve the OOD generalization capability.
Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets verify the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, even with only a few causal invariant
transformations.]]></summary>

high-dimensional probability distributions offer significant theoretical
insights and practical advantages in numerous research areas. Recently, they
have gained popularity in machine learning as a tractable and scalable approach
for training probabilistic models and for statistically differentiating between
data distributions. Their advantages include: 1) They can be estimated from
data as statistical averages. 2) Such representations can leverage the ability
of neural networks to efficiently approximate optimal solutions in function
spaces. However, a systematic and practical approach to improving the tightness
of such variational formulas, and accordingly accelerate statistical learning
and estimation from data, is currently lacking. Here we develop such a
methodology for building new, tighter variational representations of
divergences. Our approach relies on improved objective functionals constructed
via an auxiliary optimization problem. Furthermore, the calculation of the
functional Hessian of objective functionals unveils the local curvature
differences around the common optimal variational solution; this quantifies and
orders the tightness gains between different variational representations.
Finally, numerical simulations utilizing neural network optimization
demonstrate that tighter representations can result in significantly faster
learning and more accurate estimation of divergences in both synthetic and real
datasets (of more than 1000 dimensions), often accelerated by nearly an order
of magnitude.]]></summary>

machine learning model that perfectly fits the training data will generalizes
to unseen data. In particular, we study the power of a malicious agent whose
goal is to construct a model g that fits its training data and nothing else,
but is indistinguishable from an accurate model f. We say that g strongly
spoofs f if no polynomial-time algorithm can tell them apart. If instead we
restrict to algorithms that run in $n^c$ time for some fixed $c$, we say that g
c-weakly spoofs f. Our main results are

1. Under cryptographic assumptions, strong spoofing is possible and

2. For any c> 0, c-weak spoofing is possible unconditionally

While the assumption of a malicious agent is an extreme scenario (hopefully
companies training large models are not malicious), we believe that it sheds

challenge in robotics, with a variety of methods from model-based control to
model-free reinforcement learning having been previously explored in
literature. Perhaps one of the most powerful techniques to learn complex
manipulation strategies is imitation learning. However, collecting and learning
from demonstrations in dexterous manipulation is quite challenging. The
complex, high-dimensional action-space involved with multi-finger control often
leads to poor sample efficiency of learning-based methods. In this work, we
propose 'Dexterous Imitation Made Easy' (DIME) a new imitation learning
framework for dexterous manipulation. DIME only requires a single RGB camera to
observe a human operator and teleoperate our robotic hand. Once demonstrations
are collected, DIME employs standard imitation learning methods to train
dexterous manipulation policies. On both simulation and real robot benchmarks
we demonstrate that DIME can be used to solve complex, in-hand manipulation
tasks such as 'flipping', 'spinning', and 'rotating' objects with the Allegro
hand. Our framework along with pre-collected demonstrations is publicly
available at https://nyu-robot-learning.github.io/dime.]]></summary>

circumvents these limitations with two key components: (1) A confidence value

amino-acid-based connectivity among MS; (2) A global-local fusion decoder to
progressively assimilate contextualized spectrum representations with a
predefined preconception of localized MS evidence and amino acid priors. Our
components originate from a closed-form solution and selectively attend to

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The convolutional neural network (CNN) has been widely applied to process the
industrial data based tensor input, which integrates data records of
distributed industrial systems from the spatial, temporal, and system dynamics
aspects. However, unlike images, information in the industrial data based
tensor is not necessarily spatially ordered. Thus, directly applying CNN is
ineffective. To tackle such issue, we propose a plug and play module, the
Rubik's Cube Operator (RCO), to adaptively permutate the data organization of
the industrial data based tensor to an optimal or suboptimal order of
attributes before being processed by CNNs, which can be updated with subsequent
CNNs together via the gradient-based optimizer. The proposed RCO maintains K
binary and right stochastic permutation matrices to permutate attributes of K
axes of the input industrial data based tensor. A novel learning process is
proposed to enable learning permutation matrices from data, where the
Gumbel-Softmax is employed to reparameterize elements of permutation matrices,
and the soft regularization loss is proposed and added to the task-specific
loss to ensure the feature diversity of the permuted data. We verify the
effectiveness of the proposed RCO via considering two representative learning
tasks processing industrial data via CNNs, the wind power prediction (WPP) and
the wind speed prediction (WSP) from the renewable energy domain. Computational
experiments are conducted based on four datasets collected from different wind
farms and the results demonstrate that the proposed RCO can improve the
performance of CNN based networks significantly.]]></summary>

real-world entity. Although widely studied for the last 50 years, ER still
represents a challenging data management problem, and several recent works have
started to investigate the opportunity of applying deep learning (DL)
techniques to solve this problem. In this paper, we study the fundamental
problem of explainability of the DL solution for ER. Understanding the matching
predictions of an ER solution is indeed crucial to assess the trustworthiness
of the DL model and to discover its biases. We treat the DL model as a black
box classifier and - while previous approaches to provide explanations for DL
predictions are agnostic to the classification task. we propose the CERTA
approach that is aware of the semantics of the ER problem. Our approach
produces both saliency explanations, which associate each attribute with a
saliency score, and counterfactual explanations, which provide examples of
values that can flip the prediction. CERTA builds on a probabilistic framework
that aims at computing the explanations evaluating the outcomes produced by
using perturbed copies of the input records. We experimentally evaluate CERTA's
explanations of state-of-the-art ER solutions based on DL models using publicly

controllers for autonomous systems operating in stochastic and potentially
adversarial environments. Automatic synthesis tools, however, require a model
of the environment to construct controllers. In this work, we introduce a
model-free reinforcement learning (RL) approach that derives controllers from
given LTL specifications even when the environment is completely unknown. We
model the problem of satisfying the LTL specifications as a stochastic game
(SG) between the controller and the adversarial environment; we then learn
optimal controller strategies that maximize the probability of satisfying the
LTL specifications against the worst-case environment behavior. We first
construct a product game using the deterministic parity automaton (DPA)
translated from the given LTL specification. By deriving distinct rewards and
discount factors from the acceptance condition of the DPA, we reduce the
maximization of the worst-case probability of satisfying the LTL specification
into the maximization of a discounted reward objective in the product game;
this allows for the use of model-free RL algorithms to learn an optimal
controller strategy. To deal with the common scalability problems when the
number of colors defining the acceptance condition of the DPA is large, we
propose a lazy color generation method where distinct rewards and discount
factors are utilized only when needed, and an approximate method where the
controller eventually focuses on only one color. In several case studies, we
show that our approach is scalable to a wide range of LTL formulas,
significantly outperforming existing methods for learning controllers from LTL
specifications in SGs.]]></summary>

learning systems, where a central server aggregates local models of
$N\in\mathbb{N}$ distributed users, each of size $L \in \mathbb{N}$, trained on

reduce the communication overheads without any compromise on security, and
achieve the optimum communication load within a diminishing gap. Specifically,
in presence of at most $D$ dropout users, SwiftAgg+ achieves average per-user

communication load of $(1+\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{N}))L$, with a worst-case
information-theoretic security guarantee, against any subset of up to $T$
semi-honest users who may also collude with the curious server. The proposed
SwiftAgg+ has also a flexibility to reduce the number of active communication

the uplink communication load of $(1+\frac{T}{K})L$, and per-user communication

efficient retrieval of large-scale multi-modal data has become a trendy
research topic. Thereinto, hashing has become a prevalent choice due to its
retrieval efficiency and low storage cost. Although multi-modal hashing has
drawn lots of attention in recent years, there still remain some problems. The
first point is that existing methods are mainly designed in batch mode and not
able to efficiently handle streaming multi-modal data. The second point is that
all existing online multi-modal hashing methods fail to effectively handle
unseen new classes which come continuously with streaming data chunks. In this
paper, we propose a new model, termed Online enhAnced SemantIc haShing (OASIS).
We design novel semantic-enhanced representation for data, which could help
handle the new coming classes, and thereby construct the enhanced semantic
objective function. An efficient and effective discrete online optimization
algorithm is further proposed for OASIS. Extensive experiments show that our
method can exceed the state-of-the-art models. For good reproducibility and
benefiting the community, our code and data are already available in

While releasing datasets continues to make a big impact in various applications
of computer vision, its impact is mostly realized when data sharing is not
inhibited by privacy concerns. We alleviate these concerns by sanitizing
datasets in a two-stage process. First, we introduce a global decoupling stage
for decomposing raw data into sensitive and non-sensitive latent
representations. Secondly, we design a local sampling stage to synthetically
generate sensitive information with differential privacy and merge it with
non-sensitive latent features to create a useful representation while
preserving the privacy. This newly formed latent information is a task-agnostic
representation of the original dataset with anonymized sensitive information.
While most algorithms sanitize data in a task-dependent manner, a few
task-agnostic sanitization techniques sanitize data by censoring sensitive
information. In this work, we show that a better privacy-utility trade-off is
achieved if sensitive information can be synthesized privately. We validate the
effectiveness of the sanitizer by outperforming state-of-the-art baselines on
the existing benchmark tasks and demonstrating tasks that are not possible
using existing techniques.]]></summary>

(MPQ) makes it hard to determine the optimal bit-width for each layer. Previous
works usually resort to iterative search methods on the training set, which
consume hundreds or even thousands of GPU-hours. In this study, we reveal that
some unique learnable parameters in quantization, namely the scale factors in
the quantizer, can serve as importance indicators of a layer, reflecting the
contribution of that layer to the final accuracy at certain bit-widths. These
importance indicators naturally perceive the numerical transformation during
quantization-aware training, which can precisely and correctly provide
quantization sensitivity metrics of layers. However, a deep network always
contains hundreds of such indicators, and training them one by one would lead
to an excessive time cost. To overcome this issue, we propose a joint training
scheme that can obtain all indicators at once. It considerably speeds up the
indicators training process by parallelizing the original sequential training
processes. With these learned importance indicators, we formulate the MPQ
search problem as a one-time integer linear programming (ILP) problem. That
avoids the iterative search and significantly reduces search time without
limiting the bit-width search space. For example, MPQ search on ResNet18 with
our indicators takes only 0.06 seconds. Also, extensive experiments show our
approach can achieve SOTA accuracy on ImageNet for far-ranging models with
various constraints (e.g., BitOps, compress rate).]]></summary>

trained models to sequences longer than those seen in training. This
"extrapolating" usage deviates from the traditional statistical learning setup
where guarantees are provided under the assumption that train and test
distributions are identical. Here we set out to understand when RNNs can
extrapolate, focusing on a simple case where the data generating distribution
is memoryless. We first show that even with infinite training data, there exist
RNN models that interpolate perfectly (i.e., they fit the training data) yet
extrapolate poorly to longer sequences. We then show that if gradient descent
is used for training, learning will converge to perfect extrapolation under
certain assumptions on initialization. Our results complement recent studies on
the implicit bias of gradient descent, showing that it plays a key role in
extrapolation when learning temporal prediction models.]]></summary>

nonlinear optimal control problems. The crucial assumption of KL control is the
full controllability of the transition distribution. However, this assumption
is often violated when the dynamics evolves in a continuous space.
Consequently, applying KL control to problems with continuous spaces requires
some approximation, which leads to the lost of the optimality. To avoid such
approximation, in this paper, we reformulate the KL control problem for
continuous spaces so that it does not require unrealistic assumptions. The key
difference between the original and reformulated KL control is that the former
measures the control effort by KL divergence between controlled and
uncontrolled transition distributions while the latter replaces the
uncontrolled transition by a noise-driven transition. We show that the
reformulated KL control admits efficient numerical algorithms like the original
one without unreasonable assumptions. Specifically, the associated value
function can be computed by using a Monte Carlo method based on its path
integral representation.]]></summary>

reconstructing past climates. All foraminifer CNN recognition pipelines in the
literature produce black-box classifiers that lack visualization options for
human experts and cannot be applied to open-set problems. Here, we benchmark
metric learning against these pipelines, produce the first scientific
visualization of the phenotypic planktic foraminifer morphology space, and
demonstrate that metric learning can be used to cluster species unseen during
training. We show that metric learning outperforms all published CNN-based
state-of-the-art benchmarks in this domain. We evaluate our approach on the
34,640 expert-annotated images of the Endless Forams public library of 35
modern planktic foraminifera species. Our results on this data show leading 92%
accuracy (at 0.84 F1-score) in reproducing expert labels on withheld test data,
and 66.5% accuracy (at 0.70 F1-score) when clustering species never encountered
in training. We conclude that metric learning is highly effective for this
domain and serves as an important tool towards expert-in-the-loop automation of
microfossil identification. Keycode, network weights, and data splits are
published with this paper for full reproducibility.]]></summary>

problems, but a complete understanding of their dynamical and computational
principles is still lacking. Conventional theoretical frameworks for analysing
DNNs often assume random networks with coupling weights obeying Gaussian
statistics. However, non-Gaussian, heavy-tailed coupling is a ubiquitous
phenomenon in DNNs. Here, by weaving together theories of heavy-tailed random
matrices and non-equilibrium statistical physics, we develop a new type of mean
field theory for DNNs which predicts that heavy-tailed weights enable the
emergence of an extended critical regime without fine-tuning parameters. In
this extended critical regime, DNNs exhibit rich and complex propagation
dynamics across layers. We further elucidate that the extended criticality
endows DNNs with profound computational advantages: balancing the contraction
as well as expansion of internal neural representations and speeding up
training processes, hence providing a theoretical guide for the design of
efficient neural architectures.]]></summary>

unimportant tokens starting from an intermediate layer in the model to make the
model focus on important tokens; the dropped tokens are later picked up by the
last layer of the model so that the model still produces full-length sequences.
We leverage the already built-in masked language modeling (MLM) loss to

the network edge due to the low communication complexity and privacy protection
among other attractive properties. However, existing algorithms face issues
with slow convergence and/or robustness of performance due to the considerable
heterogeneity of data distribution, computation and communication capability at
the edge. In this work, we tackle both of these issues by focusing on the key
component of model aggregation in federated learning systems and studying
optimal algorithms to perform this task. Particularly, we propose a contextual
aggregation scheme that achieves the optimal context-dependent bound on loss
reduction in each round of optimization. The aforementioned context-dependent
bound is derived from the particular participating devices in that round and an
assumption on smoothness of the overall loss function. We show that this
aggregation leads to a definite reduction of loss function at every round.
Furthermore, we can integrate our aggregation with many existing algorithms to
obtain the contextual versions. Our experimental results demonstrate
significant improvements in convergence speed and robustness of the contextual
versions compared to the original algorithms. We also consider different
variants of the contextual aggregation and show robust performance even in the
most extreme settings.]]></summary>

of CT is only limited by the deposited radiation dose, reduction of which
manifests in noisy or incomplete measurements. Thus, the need for robust
reconstruction algorithms arises. In this work, we learn a parametric
regularizer with a global receptive field by maximizing it's likelihood on
reference CT data. Due to this unsupervised learning strategy, our trained
regularizer truly represents higher-level domain statistics, which we
empirically demonstrate by synthesizing CT images. Moreover, this regularizer
can easily be applied to different CT reconstruction problems by embedding it
in a variational framework, which increases flexibility and interpretability
compared to feed-forward learning-based approaches. In addition, the
accompanying probabilistic perspective enables experts to explore the full
posterior distribution and may quantify uncertainty of the reconstruction
approach. We apply the regularizer to limited-angle and few-view CT
reconstruction problems, where it outperforms traditional reconstruction
algorithms by a large margin.]]></summary>

policies (DRPs) for continuous MDP planning by encoding a parametric policy as
a deep neural network and exploiting automatic differentiation in an end-to-end
model-based gradient descent framework. This approach has proven effective for
optimizing DRPs in nonlinear continuous MDPs, but it requires a large number of
sampled trajectories to learn effectively and can suffer from high variance in
solution quality. In this work, we revisit the overall model-based DRP
objective and instead take a minorization-maximization perspective to
iteratively optimize the DRP w.r.t. a locally tight lower-bounded objective.
This novel formulation of DRP learning as iterative lower bound optimization
(ILBO) is particularly appealing because (i) each step is structurally easier
to optimize than the overall objective, (ii) it guarantees a monotonically
improving objective under certain theoretical conditions, and (iii) it reuses
samples between iterations thus lowering sample complexity. Empirical
evaluation confirms that ILBO is significantly more sample-efficient than the
state-of-the-art DRP planner and consistently produces better solution quality
with lower variance. We additionally demonstrate that ILBO generalizes well to
new problem instances (i.e., different initial states) without requiring
retraining.]]></summary>

detect bugs in these games' models, human testers play the games repeatedly to
explore the game and find errors in the games. Such game play is exhaustive and
time consuming. Moreover, since robotics simulators depend on similar methods
of model specification and debugging, the problem of finding errors in the
model is of interest for the robotics community to ensure robot behaviors and
interactions are consistent in simulators. Previous methods have used
reinforcement learning and search based methods including Rapidly-exploring
Random Trees (RRT) to explore a game's state-action space to find bugs.
However, such search and exploration based methods are not efficient at
exploring the state-action space without a pre-defined heuristic. In this work
we attempt to combine a human-tester's expertise in solving games, and the
exhaustiveness of RRT to search a game's state space efficiently with high
coverage. This paper introduces human-seeded RRT (HS-RRT) and
behavior-cloning-assisted RRT (CA-RRT) in testing the number of game states
searched and the time taken to explore those game states. We compare our
methods to an existing weighted RRT baseline for game exploration testing
studied. We find HS-RRT and CA-RRT both explore more game states in fewer tree
expansions/iterations when compared to the existing baseline. In each test,
CA-RRT reached more states on average in the same number of iterations as RRT.
In our tested environments, CA-RRT was able to reach the same number of states
as RRT by more than 5000 fewer iterations on average, almost a 50% reduction.]]></summary>

algorithm, Q-FW, for solving quadratic, linearly-constrained, binary
optimization problems on quantum annealers (QA). The computational premise of
quantum computers has cultivated the re-design of various existing vision
problems into quantum-friendly forms. Experimental QA realizations can solve a
particular non-convex problem known as the quadratic unconstrained binary
optimization (QUBO). Yet a naive-QUBO cannot take into account the restrictions
on the parameters. To introduce additional structure in the parameter space,
researchers have crafted ad-hoc solutions incorporating (linear) constraints in
the form of regularizers. However, this comes at the expense of a
hyper-parameter, balancing the impact of regularization. To date, a true
constrained solver of quadratic binary optimization (QBO) problems has lacked.
Q-FW first reformulates constrained-QBO as a copositive program (CP), then
employs Frank-Wolfe iterations to solve CP while satisfying linear (in)equality
constraints. This procedure unrolls the original constrained-QBO into a set of
unconstrained QUBOs all of which are solved, in a sequel, on a QA. We use
D-Wave Advantage QA to conduct synthetic and real experiments on two important
computer vision problems, graph matching and permutation synchronization, which
demonstrate that our approach is effective in alleviating the need for an
explicit regularization coefficient.]]></summary>

optimization procedure in terms of a trade-off between the value and
uncertainty of an arbitrary comparator policy. Different choices of test
function spaces allow us to tackle different problems within a common
framework. We characterize the loss of efficiency in moving from on-policy to
off-policy data using our procedures, and establish connections to
concentrability coefficients studied in past work. We examine in depth the
implementation of our methods with linear function approximation, and provide
theoretical guarantees with polynomial-time implementations even when Bellman

dependency structures. Humans and other intelligent agents do not waste time
assessing the utility of every high-level action in existence, but instead only
consider ones they deem possible in the first place. By focusing only on what
is feasible, or "afforded", at the present moment, an agent can spend more time
both evaluating the utility of and acting on what matters. To this end, we
present Hierarchical Affordance Learning (HAL), a method that learns a model of
hierarchical affordances in order to prune impossible subtasks for more
effective learning. Existing works in hierarchical reinforcement learning
provide agents with structural representations of subtasks but are not
affordance-aware, and by grounding our definition of hierarchical affordances
in the present state, our approach is more flexible than the multitude of
approaches that ground their subtask dependencies in a symbolic history. While
these logic-based methods often require complete knowledge of the subtask
hierarchy, our approach is able to utilize incomplete and varying symbolic
specifications. Furthermore, we demonstrate that relative to
non-affordance-aware methods, HAL agents are better able to efficiently learn
complex tasks, navigate environment stochasticity, and acquire diverse skills
in the absence of extrinsic supervision -- all of which are hallmarks of human
learning.]]></summary>

While large organisations often have considerable data assets, it can be
difficult for these assets to be unified in a manner that makes training
possible. Data is very often 'siloed' in different parts of the organisation,
with little to no access between silos. This fragmentation of data assets is
especially prevalent in heavily regulated industries like financial services or
healthcare. In this paper we propose a framework to enable asynchronous
collaborative training of machine learning models across data silos. This
allows data science teams to collaboratively train a machine learning model,
without sharing data with one another. Our proposed approach enhances
conventional federated learning techniques to make them suitable for this
asynchronous training in this intra-organisation, cross-silo setting. We
validate our proposed approach via extensive experiments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is a method for feature extraction of
two views by finding maximally correlated linear projections of them. Several
variants of CCA have been introduced in the literature, in particular, variants
based on deep neural networks for learning highly correlated nonlinear
transformations of two views. As these models are parameterized conventionally,
their learnable parameters remain independent of the inputs after the training
process, which may limit their capacity for learning highly correlated
representations. We introduce a novel dynamic scaling method for training an
input-dependent canonical correlation model. In our deep-CCA models, the
parameters of the last layer are scaled by a second neural network that is
conditioned on the model's input, resulting in a parameterization that is
dependent on the input samples. We evaluate our model on multiple datasets and
demonstrate that the learned representations are more correlated in comparison
to the conventionally-parameterized CCA-based models and also obtain preferable
retrieval results. Our code is available at

addresses the question of: which notion of fairness is most suited to a given
real-world scenario and why? Our attempt to answer this question consists in
(1) identifying the set of fairness-related characteristics of the real-world
scenario at hand, (2) analyzing the behavior of each fairness notion, and then
(3) fitting these two elements to recommend the most suitable fairness notion

spatio-temporal convolutional architectures for the prediction of PH from each

assessment of PH in newborns using echocardiograms. Our results show a mean
F1-score of 0.84 for severity prediction and 0.92 for binary detection using

on simple VGG-style networks. Despite the prevalence, current Rep methods
simply re-parameterize all operations into an augmented network, including
those that rarely contribute to the model's performance. As such, the price to
pay is an expensive computational overhead to manipulate these unnecessary
behaviors. To eliminate the above caveats, we aim to bootstrap the training
with minimal cost by devising a dynamic re-parameterization (DyRep) method,
which encodes Rep technique into the training process that dynamically evolves
the network structures. Concretely, our proposal adaptively finds the
operations which contribute most to the loss in the network, and applies Rep to
enhance their representational capacity. Besides, to suppress the noisy and
redundant operations introduced by Rep, we devise a de-parameterization
technique for a more compact re-parameterization. With this regard, DyRep is
more efficient than Rep since it smoothly evolves the given network instead of
constructing an over-parameterized network. Experimental results demonstrate
our effectiveness, e.g., DyRep improves the accuracy of ResNet-18 by $2.04\%$
on ImageNet and reduces $22\%$ runtime over the baseline. Code is available at:

are semantically consistent with the text descriptions. Existing methods are
usually built upon conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs) and
initialize an image from noise with sentence embedding, and then refine the
features with fine-grained word embedding iteratively. A close inspection of
their generated images reveals a major limitation: even though the generated
image holistically matches the description, individual image regions or parts
of somethings are often not recognizable or consistent with words in the
sentence, e.g. "a white crown". To address this problem, we propose a novel
framework Semantic-Spatial Aware GAN for synthesizing images from input text.
Concretely, we introduce a simple and effective Semantic-Spatial Aware block,
which (1) learns semantic-adaptive transformation conditioned on text to
effectively fuse text features and image features, and (2) learns a semantic
mask in a weakly-supervised way that depends on the current text-image fusion
process in order to guide the transformation spatially. Experiments on the
challenging COCO and CUB bird datasets demonstrate the advantage of our method
over the recent state-of-the-art approaches, regarding both visual fidelity and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many physical systems can be best understood as sets of discrete data with
associated relationships. Where previously these sets of data have been
formulated as series or image data to match the available machine learning
architectures, with the advent of graph neural networks (GNNs), these systems
can be learned natively as graphs. This allows a wide variety of high- and
low-level physical features to be attached to measurements and, by the same
token, a wide variety of HEP tasks to be accomplished by the same GNN
architectures. GNNs have found powerful use-cases in reconstruction, tagging,
generation and end-to-end analysis. With the wide-spread adoption of GNNs in
industry, the HEP community is well-placed to benefit from rapid improvements
in GNN latency and memory usage. However, industry use-cases are not perfectly
aligned with HEP and much work needs to be done to best match unique GNN
capabilities to unique HEP obstacles. We present here a range of these
capabilities, predictions of which are currently being well-adopted in HEP
communities, and which are still immature. We hope to capture the landscape of
graph techniques in machine learning as well as point out the most significant
gaps that are inhibiting potentially large leaps in research.]]></summary>

Incorporating psychoacoustically motivated speech perception metrics as part of

the performance of such predictors is limited by the distribution of metric

ensuring observation of a wider range of metric scores in training.

in PESQ score of 3.8% (3.05 vs 3.22 PESQ score), as well as better

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Purpose: A core component of advancing cancer treatment research is assessing
response to therapy. Doing so by hand, for example as per RECIST or RANO
criteria, is tedious, time-consuming, and can miss important tumor response
information; most notably, they exclude non-target lesions. We wish to assess
change in a holistic fashion that includes all lesions, obtaining simple,
informative, and automated assessments of tumor progression or regression. Due
to often low patient enrolments in clinical trials, we wish to make response
assessments with small training sets. Deep neuroevolution (DNE) can produce
radiology artificial intelligence (AI) that performs well on small training
sets. Here we use DNE for function approximation that predicts progression
versus regression of metastatic brain disease.

Methods: We analyzed 50 pairs of MRI contrast-enhanced images as our training
set. Half of these pairs, separated in time, qualified as disease progression,
while the other 25 images constituted regression. We trained the parameters of
a relatively small CNN via mutations that consisted of random CNN weight
adjustments and mutation fitness. We then incorporated the best mutations into
the next generations CNN, repeating this process for approximately 50,000
generations. We applied the CNNs to our training set, as well as a separate
testing set with the same class balance of 25 progression and 25 regression
images.

Results: DNE achieved monotonic convergence to 100% training set accuracy.
DNE also converged monotonically to 100% testing set accuracy.

Conclusion: DNE can accurately classify brain-metastatic disease progression
versus regression. Future work will extend the input from 2D image slices to
full 3D volumes, and include the category of no change. We believe that an
approach such as our could ultimately provide a useful adjunct to RANO/RECIST
assessment.]]></summary>

balance the explore-exploit trade-off over multiple design rounds, and to
balance objective tradeoffs by optimizing sequences at many different points on
the Pareto frontier. We evaluate LaMBO on a small-molecule task based on the
ZINC dataset and introduce a new large-molecule task targeting fluorescent

representation learning (GRL) without the supervision of manual annotations.
GCL can generate graph-level embeddings by maximizing the Mutual Information
(MI) between different augmented views of the same graph (positive pairs).
However, we identify an obstacle that the optimization of InfoNCE loss only
concentrates on a few embeddings dimensions, limiting the distinguishability of
embeddings in downstream graph classification tasks. This paper proposes an
effective graph complementary contrastive learning approach named GraphCoCo to
tackle the above issue. Specifically, we set the embedding of the first
augmented view as the anchor embedding to localize "highlighted" dimensions
(i.e., the dimensions contribute most in similarity measurement). Then remove
these dimensions in the embeddings of the second augmented view to discover
neglected complementary representations. Therefore, the combination of anchor
and complementary embeddings significantly improves the performance in
downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmark datasets are
conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphCoCo, and the results show
that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Source code will be
made publicly available.]]></summary>

deletion requests come, companies may need to delete the whole models learned

problem conversion, an {\it MCMC influence function} is designed to provably
characterize the learned knowledge from data, which then delivers the MCMC
unlearning algorithm. Theoretical analysis shows that MCMC unlearning would not
compromise the generalizability of the MCMC models. Experiments on Gaussian

capability of such images. As a method to mitigate such artifact, denoising is
largely studied both within the medical imaging community and beyond the
community as a general subject. However, recent deep neural network-based
approaches mostly rely on the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimates,
which tend to produce a blurred output. Moreover, such models suffer when
deployed in real-world sitautions: out-of-distribution data, and complex noise
distributions that deviate from the usual parametric noise models. In this
work, we propose a new denoising method based on score-based reverse diffusion
sampling, which overcomes all the aforementioned drawbacks. Our network,

generalization in the context of physical manipulation from raw sensor
observations. Compared with the more commonly used global third-person
perspective, a hand-centric (eye-in-hand) perspective affords reduced
observability, but we find that it consistently improves training efficiency
and out-of-distribution generalization. These benefits hold across a variety of
learning algorithms, experimental settings, and distribution shifts, and for
both simulated and real robot apparatuses. However, this is only the case when
hand-centric observability is sufficient; otherwise, including a third-person
perspective is necessary for learning, but also harms out-of-distribution
generalization. To mitigate this, we propose to regularize the third-person
information stream via a variational information bottleneck. On six
representative manipulation tasks with varying hand-centric observability
adapted from the Meta-World benchmark, this results in a state-of-the-art
reinforcement learning agent operating from both perspectives improving its
out-of-distribution generalization on every task. While some practitioners have
long put cameras in the hands of robots, our work systematically analyzes the
benefits of doing so and provides simple and broadly applicable insights for
improving end-to-end learned vision-based robotic manipulation.]]></summary>

world today. Drug development for the disease is crippled as there is no way of
measuring effectiveness of the drug without an invasive procedure. Drug
efficacy measurement through assessment of viability of onchocerca worms
requires the patients to undergo nodulectomy which is invasive, expensive,
time-consuming, skill-dependent, infrastructure dependent and lengthy process.
In this paper, we discuss the first-ever study that proposes use of machine
learning over thermal imaging to non-invasively and accurately predict the
viability of worms. The key contributions of the paper are (i) a unique thermal
imaging protocol along with pre-processing steps such as alignment,
registration and segmentation to extract interpretable features (ii) extraction
of relevant semantic features (iii) development of accurate classifiers for
detecting the existence of viable worms in a nodule. When tested on a
prospective test data of 30 participants with 48 palpable nodules, we achieved
an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.85.]]></summary>

different domains, e.g., image classification and audio recognition. However,
the quality of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) still raises concerns in the
practical operational environment, which calls for systematic testing,
especially in safety-critical scenarios. Inspired by software testing, a number
of structural coverage criteria are designed and proposed to measure the test
adequacy of DNNs. However, due to the blackbox nature of DNN, the existing
structural coverage criteria are difficult to interpret, making it hard to
understand the underlying principles of these criteria. The relationship
between the structural coverage and the decision logic of DNNs is unknown.
Moreover, recent studies have further revealed the non-existence of correlation
between the structural coverage and DNN defect detection, which further posts
concerns on what a suitable DNN testing criterion should be.

In this paper, we propose the interpretable coverage criteria through
constructing the decision structure of a DNN. Mirroring the control flow graph
of the traditional program, we first extract a decision graph from a DNN based
on its interpretation, where a path of the decision graph represents a decision
logic of the DNN. Based on the control flow and data flow of the decision
graph, we propose two variants of path coverage to measure the adequacy of the
test cases in exercising the decision logic. The higher the path coverage, the
more diverse decision logic the DNN is expected to be explored. Our large-scale
evaluation results demonstrate that: the path in the decision graph is
effective in characterizing the decision of the DNN, and the proposed coverage
criteria are also sensitive with errors including natural errors and
adversarial examples, and strongly correlated with the output impartiality.]]></summary>

(MAB) in the (local) differential privacy (DP/LDP) model. Unlike previous
results that assume bounded/sub-Gaussian reward distributions, we focus on the
setting where each arm's reward distribution only has $(1+v)$-th moment with
some $v\in (0, 1]$. In the first part, we study the problem in the central
$\epsilon$-DP model. We first provide a near-optimal result by developing a
private and robust Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. Then, we improve the
result via a private and robust version of the Successive Elimination (SE)
algorithm. Finally, we establish the lower bound to show that the
instance-dependent regret of our improved algorithm is optimal. In the second
part, we study the problem in the $\epsilon$-LDP model. We propose an algorithm
that can be seen as locally private and robust version of SE algorithm, which
provably achieves (near) optimal rates for both instance-dependent and
instance-independent regret. Our results reveal differences between the problem
of private MAB with bounded/sub-Gaussian rewards and heavy-tailed rewards. To
achieve these (near) optimal rates, we develop several new hard instances and
private robust estimators as byproducts, which might be used to other related
problems. Finally, experiments also support our theoretical findings and show
the effectiveness of our algorithms.]]></summary>

in effectiveness, while often sacrificing the efficiency and interpretability
of the neural model compared to classical approaches. This paper proposes
ColBERTer, a neural retrieval model using contextualized late interaction
(ColBERT) with enhanced reduction. Along the effectiveness Pareto frontier,
ColBERTer's reductions dramatically lower ColBERT's storage requirements while
simultaneously improving the interpretability of its token-matching scores. To
this end, ColBERTer fuses single-vector retrieval, multi-vector refinement, and
optional lexical matching components into one model. For its multi-vector
component, ColBERTer reduces the number of stored vectors per document by
learning unique whole-word representations for the terms in each document and
learning to identify and remove word representations that are not essential to
effective scoring. We employ an explicit multi-task, multi-stage training to
facilitate using very small vector dimensions. Results on the MS MARCO and
TREC-DL collection show that ColBERTer can reduce the storage footprint by up
to 2.5x, while maintaining effectiveness. With just one dimension per token in
its smallest setting, ColBERTer achieves index storage parity with the
plaintext size, with very strong effectiveness results. Finally, we demonstrate
ColBERTer's robustness on seven high-quality out-of-domain collections,
yielding statistically significant gains over traditional retrieval baselines.]]></summary>

actions, dubbed R(MA)^2B. The state of each arm evolves according to a
controlled Markov decision process (MDP), and the reward of pulling an arm
depends on both the current state of the corresponding MDP and the action
taken. The goal is to sequentially choose actions for arms so as to maximize
the expected value of the cumulative rewards collected. Since finding the
optimal policy is typically intractable, we propose a computationally appealing
index policy which we call Occupancy-Measured-Reward Index Policy. Our policy
is well-defined even if the underlying MDPs are not indexable. We prove that it
is asymptotically optimal when the activation budget and number of arms are
scaled up, while keeping their ratio as a constant. For the case when the
system parameters are unknown, we develop a learning algorithm. Our learning
algorithm uses the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty and further
uses a generative model in order to fully exploit the structure of
Occupancy-Measured-Reward Index Policy. We call it the R(MA)^2B-UCB algorithm.
As compared with the existing algorithms, R(MA)^2B-UCB performs close to an
offline optimum policy, and also achieves a sub-linear regret with a low
computational complexity. Experimental results show that R(MA)^2B-UCB
outperforms the existing algorithms in both regret and run time.]]></summary>

learned waveform and neural receiver enable competitive or higher rates than an
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) baseline, while reducing the

setting in which training instances are provided in bags and only the
proportion of each class within the bags is provided. Most existing MCLLP
methods impose bag-wise constraints on the prediction of instances or assign
them pseudo-labels; however, none of these methods have a theoretical
consistency. To solve this problem, a risk-consistent method is proposed for
instance classification using the empirical risk minimization framework, and
its estimation error bound is derived. An approximation method is proposed for
the proposed risk estimator, to apply it to large bags, by diverting the
constraints on bags in existing research. The proposed method can be applied to
any deep model or loss and is compatible with stochastic optimization.
Experiments are conducted on benchmarks to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed method.]]></summary>

resources. The efficiency of COVID-19 diagnosis has become highly significant.
As deep learning and convolutional neural network (CNN) has been widely
utilized and been verified in analyzing medical images, it has become a
powerful tool for computer-assisted diagnosis. However, there are two most
significant challenges in medical image classification with the help of deep
learning and neural networks, one of them is the difficulty of acquiring enough
samples, which may lead to model overfitting. Privacy concerns mainly bring the
other challenge since medical-related records are often deemed patients'
private information and protected by laws such as GDPR and HIPPA. Federated
learning can ensure the model training is decentralized on different devices
and no data is shared among them, which guarantees privacy. However, with data
located on different devices, the accessible data of each device could be
limited. Since transfer learning has been verified in dealing with limited data
with good performance, therefore, in this paper, We made a trial to implement
federated learning and transfer learning techniques using CNNs to classify
COVID-19 using lung CT scans. We also explored the impact of dataset
distribution at the client-side in federated learning and the number of
training epochs a model is trained. Finally, we obtained very high performance
with federated learning, demonstrating our success in leveraging accuracy and
privacy.]]></summary>

processing tasks. Nevertheless, the computational overhead of the vanilla
transformer scales quadratically with sequence length. Many efforts have been
made to develop more efficient transformer variants. A line of work (e.g.,
Linformer) projects the input sequence into a low-rank space, achieving linear
time complexity. However, Linformer does not suit well for text generation
tasks as the sequence length must be pre-specified. We propose MemSizer, an
approach also projects the source sequence into lower dimension representation
but can take input with dynamic length, with a different perspective of the
attention mechanism. MemSizer not only achieves the same linear time complexity
but also enjoys efficient recurrent-style autoregressive generation, which
yields constant memory complexity and reduced computation at inference. We
demonstrate that MemSizer provides an improved tradeoff between efficiency and
accuracy over the vanilla transformer and other linear variants in language
modeling and machine translation tasks, revealing a viable direction towards
further inference efficiency improvement.]]></summary>

irregular tensor is a collection of matrices whose columns have the same size

fundamental tool to deal with an irregular tensor in applications including
phenotype discovery and trend analysis. Although several PARAFAC2 decomposition
methods exist, their efficiency is limited for irregular dense tensors due to
the expensive computations involved with the tensor. In this paper, we propose
DPar2, a fast and scalable PARAFAC2 decomposition method for irregular dense

matrix of a given irregular tensor, careful reordering of computations with the
compression results, and exploiting the irregularity of the tensor. Extensive
experiments show that DPar2 is up to 6.0x faster than competitors on real-world
irregular tensors while achieving comparable accuracy. In addition, DPar2 is

years, and its potentials are now more apparent. However, transient data
generation and limited energy resources are the major bottlenecks of these
networks. Besides, minimum delay and other conventional quality of service
measurements are still valid requirements to meet. An efficient caching policy
can help meet the standard quality of service requirements while bypassing IoT
networks' specific limitations. Adopting deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
algorithms enables us to develop an effective caching scheme without the need
for any prior knowledge or contextual information. In this work, we propose a
DRL-based caching scheme that improves the cache hit rate and reduces energy
consumption of the IoT networks, in the meanwhile, taking data freshness and
limited lifetime of IoT data into account. To better capture the
regional-different popularity distribution, we propose a hierarchical
architecture to deploy edge caching nodes in IoT networks. The results of
comprehensive experiments show that our proposed method outperforms the
well-known conventional caching policies and an existing DRL-based solution in

frequency-selective channels must operate based on a small number of pilot
symbols. This paper proposes novel channel prediction algorithms that address
this goal by integrating transfer and meta-learning with a reduced-rank

by utilizing data from previous frames, which are generally characterized by
distinct propagation characteristics, in order to enable fast training on the
time slots of the current frame. The proposed predictors rely on a novel
long-short-term decomposition (LSTD) of the linear prediction model that
leverages the disaggregation of the channel into long-term space-time
signatures and fading amplitudes. We first develop predictors for
single-antenna frequency-flat channels based on transfer/meta-learned quadratic
regularization. Then, we introduce transfer and meta-learning algorithms for
LSTD-based prediction models that build on equilibrium propagation (EP) and
alternating least squares (ALS). Numerical results under the 3GPP 5G standard
channel model demonstrate the impact of transfer and meta-learning on reducing
the number of pilots for channel prediction, as well as the merits of the

not need fine-tuning, an essential feature as often the training resources or

design. Over a set of state-of-the-art transformer models, the Mokey

in representation learning - the need for human annotations. As a result, SSL
holds the promise to learn representations from data in-the-wild, i.e., without
the need for finite and static datasets. Instead, true SSL algorithms should be
able to exploit the continuous stream of data being generated on the internet
or by agents exploring their environments. But do traditional self-supervised
learning approaches work in this setup? In this work, we investigate this
question by conducting experiments on the continuous self-supervised learning
problem. While learning in the wild, we expect to see a continuous (infinite)
non-IID data stream that follows a non-stationary distribution of visual
concepts. The goal is to learn a representation that can be robust, adaptive
yet not forgetful of concepts seen in the past. We show that a direct
application of current methods to such continuous setup is 1) inefficient both
computationally and in the amount of data required, 2) leads to inferior
representations due to temporal correlations (non-IID data) in some sources of
streaming data and 3) exhibits signs of catastrophic forgetting when trained on
sources with non-stationary data distributions. We propose the use of replay
buffers as an approach to alleviate the issues of inefficiency and temporal
correlations. We further propose a novel method to enhance the replay buffer by
maintaining the least redundant samples. Minimum redundancy (MinRed) buffers
allow us to learn effective representations even in the most challenging
streaming scenarios composed of sequential visual data obtained from a single
embodied agent, and alleviates the problem of catastrophic forgetting when
learning from data with non-stationary semantic distributions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep metric learning (DML) enables learning with less supervision through its
emphasis on the similarity structure of representations. There has been much
work on improving generalization of DML in settings like zero-shot retrieval,
but little is known about its implications for fairness. In this paper, we are
the first to evaluate state-of-the-art DML methods trained on imbalanced data,
and to show the negative impact these representations have on minority subgroup
performance when used for downstream tasks. In this work, we first define
fairness in DML through an analysis of three properties of the representation
space -- inter-class alignment, intra-class alignment, and uniformity -- and
propose finDML, the fairness in non-balanced DML benchmark to characterize
representation fairness. Utilizing finDML, we find bias in DML representations
to propagate to common downstream classification tasks. Surprisingly, this bias
is propagated even when training data in the downstream task is re-balanced. To
address this problem, we present Partial Attribute De-correlation (PARADE) to
de-correlate feature representations from sensitive attributes and reduce
performance gaps between subgroups in both embedding space and downstream
metrics.]]></summary>

a joint network to generate enhanced speech at the output layer. The AVDCNN
model is trained in an end-to-end manner, and parameters are jointly learned
through back-propagation. We evaluate enhanced speech using five objective

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Variational representations of divergences and distances between
high-dimensional probability distributions offer significant theoretical
insights and practical advantages in numerous research areas. Recently, they
have gained popularity in machine learning as a tractable and scalable approach
for training probabilistic models and for statistically differentiating between
data distributions. Their advantages include: 1) They can be estimated from
data as statistical averages. 2) Such representations can leverage the ability
of neural networks to efficiently approximate optimal solutions in function
spaces. However, a systematic and practical approach to improving the tightness
of such variational formulas, and accordingly accelerate statistical learning
and estimation from data, is currently lacking. Here we develop such a
methodology for building new, tighter variational representations of
divergences. Our approach relies on improved objective functionals constructed
via an auxiliary optimization problem. Furthermore, the calculation of the
functional Hessian of objective functionals unveils the local curvature
differences around the common optimal variational solution; this quantifies and
orders the tightness gains between different variational representations.
Finally, numerical simulations utilizing neural network optimization
demonstrate that tighter representations can result in significantly faster
learning and more accurate estimation of divergences in both synthetic and real
datasets (of more than 1000 dimensions), often accelerated by nearly an order
of magnitude.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Novel prediction methods should always be compared to a baseline to know how
well they perform. Without this frame of reference, the performance score of a
model is basically meaningless. What does it mean when a model achieves an
$F_1$ of 0.8 on a test set? A proper baseline is needed to evaluate the
`goodness' of a performance score. Comparing with the latest state-of-the-art
model is usually insightful. However, being state-of-the-art can change rapidly
when newer models are developed. Contrary to an advanced model, a simple dummy
classifier could be used. However, the latter could be beaten too easily,
making the comparison less valuable. This paper presents a universal baseline
method for all binary classification models, named the Dutch Draw (DD). This
approach weighs simple classifiers and determines the best classifier to use as
a baseline. We theoretically derive the DD baseline for many commonly used
evaluation measures and show that in most situations it reduces to (almost)
always predicting either zero or one. Summarizing, the DD baseline is: (1)
general, as it is applicable to all binary classification problems; (2) simple,
as it is quickly determined without training or parameter-tuning; (3)
informative, as insightful conclusions can be drawn from the results. The DD
baseline serves two purposes. First, to enable comparisons across research
papers by this robust and universal baseline. Secondly, to provide a sanity
check during the development process of a prediction model. It is a major
warning sign when a model is outperformed by the DD baseline.]]></summary>

themselves to be a powerful tool in all facets of society. However, due to
budget limitations, deliberate or non-deliberate censorship, and other problems
during data collection and curation, the labeled training set might exhibit a
systematic shortage of data for certain groups. We investigate a scenario in
which the absence of certain data is linked to the second level of a two-level
hierarchy in the data. Inspired by the idea of protected groups from
algorithmic fairness, we refer to the partitions carved by this second level as
"subgroups"; we refer to combinations of subgroups and classes, or leaves of
the hierarchy, as "sources". To characterize the problem, we introduce the
concept of classes with incomplete subgroup support. The representational bias
in the training set can give rise to spurious correlations between the classes
and the subgroups which render standard classification models ungeneralizable
to unseen sources. To overcome this bias, we make use of an additional, diverse
but unlabeled dataset, called the "deployment set", to learn a representation
that is invariant to subgroup. This is done by adversarially matching the
support of the training and deployment sets in representation space. In order
to learn the desired invariance, it is paramount that the sets of samples
observed by the discriminator are balanced by class; this is easily achieved
for the training set, but requires using semi-supervised clustering for the
deployment set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with experiments
on several datasets and variants of the problem.]]></summary>

supervised machine learning studies. The datasets contain hadronic top quarks,
cosmic-ray induced air showers, phase transitions in hadronic matter, and
generator-level histories. While public datasets from multiple fundamental
physics disciplines already exist, the common interface and provided reference
models simplify future work on cross-disciplinary machine learning and transfer
learning in fundamental physics. We discuss the design and structure and line
out how additional datasets can be submitted for inclusion.

As showcase application, we present a simple yet flexible graph-based neural
network architecture that can easily be applied to a wide range of supervised
learning tasks. We show that our approach reaches performance close to
dedicated methods on all datasets. To simplify adaptation for various problems,
we provide easy-to-follow instructions on how graph-based representations of
data structures, relevant for fundamental physics, can be constructed and
provide code implementations for several of them. Implementations are also
provided for our proposed method and all reference algorithms.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In real-world applications, it is important and desirable to learn a model
that performs well on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Recently, causality has
become a powerful tool to tackle the OOD generalization problem, with the idea
resting on the causal mechanism that is invariant across domains of interest.
To leverage the generally unknown causal mechanism, existing works assume a
linear form of causal feature or require sufficiently many and diverse training
domains, which are usually restrictive in practice. In this work, we obviate
these assumptions and tackle the OOD problem without explicitly recovering the
causal feature. Our approach is based on transformations that modify the
non-causal feature but leave the causal part unchanged, which can be either
obtained from prior knowledge or learned from the training data in the
multi-domain scenario. Under the setting of invariant causal mechanism, we
theoretically show that if all such transformations are available, then we can
learn a minimax optimal model across the domains using only single domain data.
Noticing that knowing a complete set of these causal invariant transformations
may be impractical, we further show that it suffices to know only a subset of
these transformations. Based on the theoretical findings, a regularized
training procedure is proposed to improve the OOD generalization capability.
Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets verify the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, even with only a few causal invariant
transformations.]]></summary>

characterize the learned knowledge from data, which then delivers the MCMC
unlearning algorithm. Theoretical analysis shows that MCMC unlearning would not

feedback representation consisting of an open-loop sequence, and an associated
optimal linear feedback law completely determined by the open-loop. We show
that this alternate approach results in highly efficient training, the answers
obtained are repeatable and hence reliable, and the resulting closed

(1) identifying the set of fairness-related characteristics of the real-world
scenario at hand, (2) analyzing the behavior of each fairness notion, and then
(3) fitting these two elements to recommend the most suitable fairness notion
in every specific setup. The results are summarized in a decision diagram that

actions, dubbed R(MA)^2B. The state of each arm evolves according to a
controlled Markov decision process (MDP), and the reward of pulling an arm
depends on both the current state of the corresponding MDP and the action
taken. The goal is to sequentially choose actions for arms so as to maximize
the expected value of the cumulative rewards collected. Since finding the
optimal policy is typically intractable, we propose a computationally appealing
index policy which we call Occupancy-Measured-Reward Index Policy. Our policy
is well-defined even if the underlying MDPs are not indexable. We prove that it
is asymptotically optimal when the activation budget and number of arms are
scaled up, while keeping their ratio as a constant. For the case when the
system parameters are unknown, we develop a learning algorithm. Our learning
algorithm uses the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty and further
uses a generative model in order to fully exploit the structure of
Occupancy-Measured-Reward Index Policy. We call it the R(MA)^2B-UCB algorithm.
As compared with the existing algorithms, R(MA)^2B-UCB performs close to an
offline optimum policy, and also achieves a sub-linear regret with a low
computational complexity. Experimental results show that R(MA)^2B-UCB
outperforms the existing algorithms in both regret and run time.]]></summary>

multiple short trajectories, where there are no easily observed steady state
behaviors. We provide a finite sample analysis, which shows that the dynamics
can be learned at a rate $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$ for both stable and
unstable systems, where $N$ is the number of trajectories, when the initial
state of the system has zero mean (which is a common assumption in the existing
literature). We further generalize our result to the case where the initial
state has non-zero mean. We show that one can adjust the length of the

in many modern natural language processing applications. TLM training is
conducted in two phases. First, the model is pre-trained over large volumes of
text to minimize a generic objective function, such as the Masked Language
Model (MLM). Second, the model is fine-tuned in specific downstream tasks.
Pre-training requires large volumes of data and high computational resources,
while introducing many still unresolved design choices. For instance, selecting
hyperparameters for language model pre-training is often carried out based on
heuristics or grid-based searches. In this work, we propose a multi-armed
bandit-based online optimization framework for the sequential selection of
pre-training hyperparameters to optimize language model performance. We pose
the pre-training procedure as a sequential decision-making task, where at each
pre-training step, an agent must determine what hyperparameters to use towards
optimizing the pre-training objective. We propose a Thompson sampling bandit
algorithm, based on a surrogate Gaussian process reward model of the MLM
pre-training objective, for its sequential minimization. We empirically show
how the proposed Gaussian process based Thompson sampling pre-trains robust and
well-performing language models. Namely, by sequentially selecting masking
hyperparameters of the TLM, we achieve satisfactory performance in less epochs,
not only in terms of the pre-training MLM objective, but in diverse downstream
fine-tuning tasks. The proposed bandit-based technique provides an automated
hyperparameter selection method for pre-training TLMs of interest to
practitioners. In addition, our results indicate that, instead of MLM
pre-training with fixed masking probabilities, sequentially adapting the
masking hyperparameters improves both pre-training loss and downstream task
metrics.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been successfully applied to many real-world
problems, but a complete understanding of their dynamical and computational
principles is still lacking. Conventional theoretical frameworks for analysing
DNNs often assume random networks with coupling weights obeying Gaussian
statistics. However, non-Gaussian, heavy-tailed coupling is a ubiquitous
phenomenon in DNNs. Here, by weaving together theories of heavy-tailed random
matrices and non-equilibrium statistical physics, we develop a new type of mean
field theory for DNNs which predicts that heavy-tailed weights enable the
emergence of an extended critical regime without fine-tuning parameters. In
this extended critical regime, DNNs exhibit rich and complex propagation
dynamics across layers. We further elucidate that the extended criticality
endows DNNs with profound computational advantages: balancing the contraction
as well as expansion of internal neural representations and speeding up
training processes, hence providing a theoretical guide for the design of
efficient neural architectures.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is a method for feature extraction of
two views by finding maximally correlated linear projections of them. Several
variants of CCA have been introduced in the literature, in particular, variants
based on deep neural networks for learning highly correlated nonlinear
transformations of two views. As these models are parameterized conventionally,
their learnable parameters remain independent of the inputs after the training
process, which may limit their capacity for learning highly correlated
representations. We introduce a novel dynamic scaling method for training an
input-dependent canonical correlation model. In our deep-CCA models, the
parameters of the last layer are scaled by a second neural network that is
conditioned on the model's input, resulting in a parameterization that is
dependent on the input samples. We evaluate our model on multiple datasets and
demonstrate that the learned representations are more correlated in comparison
to the conventionally-parameterized CCA-based models and also obtain preferable
retrieval results. Our code is available at

a framework for this task, based on minimizing the expected divergence between

emphasis on the similarity structure of representations. There has been much
work on improving generalization of DML in settings like zero-shot retrieval,
but little is known about its implications for fairness. In this paper, we are
the first to evaluate state-of-the-art DML methods trained on imbalanced data,
and to show the negative impact these representations have on minority subgroup
performance when used for downstream tasks. In this work, we first define
fairness in DML through an analysis of three properties of the representation
space -- inter-class alignment, intra-class alignment, and uniformity -- and
propose finDML, the fairness in non-balanced DML benchmark to characterize
representation fairness. Utilizing finDML, we find bias in DML representations
to propagate to common downstream classification tasks. Surprisingly, this bias
is propagated even when training data in the downstream task is re-balanced. To
address this problem, we present Partial Attribute De-correlation (PARADE) to
de-correlate feature representations from sensitive attributes and reduce
performance gaps between subgroups in both embedding space and downstream
metrics.]]></summary>

functional approximation. However, these models can suffer from spurious
oscillations when the data to be approximated are not uniformly distributed.
Model regularization (i.e., smoothing) has traditionally been used to minimize
these oscillations; unfortunately, it is sometimes impossible to sufficiently
remove unwanted artifacts without smoothing away key features of the data set.
In this article, we present a method of model regularization that preserves
significant features of a data set while minimizing artificial oscillations.
Our method varies the strength of a smoothing parameter throughout the domain
automatically, removing artifacts in poorly-constrained regions while leaving
other regions unchanged. The behavior of our method is validated on a
collection of two- and three-dimensional data sets produced by scientific
simulations.]]></summary>

dependency structures. Humans and other intelligent agents do not waste time
assessing the utility of every high-level action in existence, but instead only
consider ones they deem possible in the first place. By focusing only on what
is feasible, or "afforded", at the present moment, an agent can spend more time
both evaluating the utility of and acting on what matters. To this end, we
present Hierarchical Affordance Learning (HAL), a method that learns a model of
hierarchical affordances in order to prune impossible subtasks for more
effective learning. Existing works in hierarchical reinforcement learning
provide agents with structural representations of subtasks but are not
affordance-aware, and by grounding our definition of hierarchical affordances
in the present state, our approach is more flexible than the multitude of
approaches that ground their subtask dependencies in a symbolic history. While
these logic-based methods often require complete knowledge of the subtask
hierarchy, our approach is able to utilize incomplete and varying symbolic
specifications. Furthermore, we demonstrate that relative to
non-affordance-aware methods, HAL agents are better able to efficiently learn
complex tasks, navigate environment stochasticity, and acquire diverse skills
in the absence of extrinsic supervision -- all of which are hallmarks of human
learning.]]></summary>

balance objective tradeoffs by optimizing sequences at many different points on
the Pareto frontier. We evaluate LaMBO on a small-molecule task based on the

 I could simply duplicate the current dataset and convert one of them into grayscales, and that may be easier to do, but then I would like to do something else :
 I would like to apply the same data augmentation functions from ImageDataGenerator (rotations, flipping... ) to the features and their corresponding labels.
 Do you know if it is possible or will I have to construct the augmented dataset explicitely ?

 Is it about improving the performance? But if other works didn't do the checkpoint averaging, it wouldn't be a fair comparision. However, I seldom see the recently transformer works highlighting this technique.

 In the example above, I've actually a 2600X for the last 2 years and am considering to buy a 5600X, wait until AM5 CPU later this year, or switch back to Intel 12600K although Intel is at least $200 more because their MB are overpriced. It would be nice to know whether it would save me incredible amount of time so I can justify getting more experience quicker or if it's marginal and to save the money on a nice 3080 GPU, etc. and get into Deep Learning sooner.

 Modern language models like T5 or GPT-3 achieve remarkably low perplexities on both training and validation data, yet when sampling from their output distributions, the generated text often seems dull and uninteresting. Various workarounds have been proposed, such as top-k sampling and nucleus sampling, but while these manage to somewhat improve the generated samples, they are hacky and unfounded. This paper introduces typical sampling, a new decoding method that is principled, effective, and can be implemented efficiently. Typical sampling turns away from sampling purely based on likelihood and explicitly finds a trade-off between generating high-probability samples and generating high-information samples. The paper connects typical sampling to psycholinguistic theories on human speech generation, and shows experimentally that typical sampling achieves much more diverse and interesting results than any of the current methods.

 I hope this is the right subreddit...
 I am currently studying Electrical Engineering at University and studying for an exam that is (partly) about Neural NEtworks. I am struggling a bit with an example given about calculating the entropy of a decision tree and hope someone here can help me out. 
 I have the following information:
 Given information 
 The table is the given dataset and the tree is the resulting tree. I am trying to understand how the calculated Entropy values came to place, since I get different answers when I try it myself. 
 This is my way (for example for "level"):
 p1 (Senior) = 5/14
 p2 (Mid) = 4/14
 p3 (Junior) = 5/14
 Entropy = -(5/14*log_2(5/14)+4/14*log_2(4/14)+5/14*log_2(5/14)) = 1.577 (which makes no sense, since Entropy should be between 0 and 1??)
 Thanks a lot for any help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One core idea in ML is to use/build a simple model at first to get some minimum threshold, and then find better models or refine the existing model, improve the data, etc. 
 I'd say for computer vision, in most cases, a Resnet / EfficientNet would get a good result, given enough data. 
 In NLP, if it's about something very simple, Naive Bayes methods can be decent. If the task is harder, BERT would do the trick up to a certain level for many tasks
 However, choosing the first model is not obvious for many graph-related tasks where a node has more than 1 feature. For example, in node classification problems, what's a model easy to implement that guarantees decent results?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proved to be effective in a wide range of issues and fields. GNNs commonly use a message-passing mechanism, in which nodes communicate feature representations (“messages”) to their neighbors at each layer. Each node’s feature representation is initialized to its original features, and it is updated by aggregating incoming messages from neighbors on a regular basis. GNNs are distinguished from other purely topological learning systems such as random walks or label propagation by their ability to mix topological and feature information, which is arguably what contributes to their success.
 Typically, GNN models assume a fully observed feature matrix, with rows representing nodes and columns representing channels. In real-world circumstances, however, each trait is frequently only observable for a subset of nodes. Demographic information, for example, maybe exposed to only a small percentage of social network users, while content features are typically only available to the most active users.

It's designed with PyTorch (and PyTorch Lightning) in mind, but it is a general-purpose library compatible with other libraries and workflows. This iterative computation is useful if we want to track a model during iterative training or evaluation on minibatches (and optionally across on multiple GPUs). In deep learning, that's essentially all the time. However, when using TorchMetrics, one common question is whether we should use .update() or .forward()? (And that's also a question I certainly had when I started using it.). Here's a hands-on example and explanation.

The recolored photos are a lot drabber than the original, and the thread author says that this gives us a skewed view of the past, making us think the past was a lot more boring than it was, downplaying how vibrant and diverse certain societies were.
 https://preview.redd.it/fctveek4cjp81.png?width=3064&format=png&auto=webp&s=9aadecef7c12a4dd13f5197a69ffd155084be75e
 This made me think of some questions that I thought could lead to a good discussion here. I've put some below in no particular order!
  
Do you think that expert opinion should be consulted in the Machine Learning process more? If so, where? (perhaps omitting Expert Systems)
 Is there too much faith that a result from an ML model is the "right" result? (a phenomenon that maybe isn't specific to ML but a result of human tendencies?)
 Do ML practitioners have a responsibility to clearly communicate to the general public the limitations and degree-of-confidence in these systems?
 Am I reading too much into this, and this colorization model is just a fun model to play with, and the conclusions of the Twitter thread are too speculative or conjectural?
 Is this colorization issue just another form of bias that needs to be ironed out?
 The thread concludes by saying that colorization should be left to experts who can use context to pick accurate colors. I think this is too extreme, and that ML systems can incorporate expertise when training, or after during evaluation. Do you think there are any jobs/problems that ML methods could be applied to but should be left to experts (some considerations might be safety, privacy, ethics, etc.)
  
I know that ultimately a lot of these questions can simply boil down to statistics and their interpretation, so I'm not sure exactly where discussion could/should/will lead, but I'm looking forward to hearing your opinions :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The amount of money and energy necessary to train AI models has become a hot-button issue as they grow in size. Leaders in the AI field have been pouring money towards training increasingly bigger models since GPT-3 proved the considerable gains in performance that can be achieved by merely increasing model size. However, this is prohibitively expensive, necessitates tremendous computational resources, consumes enormous energy, and is becoming more recognized as an issue, not just because of the environmental implications, but also because it makes it harder for smaller AI companies to compete, concentrating power in the hands of industry titans. A new technique that rewrites one of the discipline’s core building pieces could give a workaround.
 Oxford University researchers have proposed a novel method that might cut training time in half. This is accomplished by redesigning backpropagation, one of the essential components of today’s neural network-based AI systems. Backpropagation has remained a mainstay of machine learning for computing gradients of objective functions for optimization. Backpropagation, also known as reverse-mode differentiation, is a subset of the general family of automatic differentiation algorithms that includes forward mode differentiation. A method for computing gradients based purely on the directional derivative, which may be done in the forward mode with precision and efficiency, is designed. The method is known as the forward gradient, which is an unbiased estimate of the gradient that can be assessed in a single forward run of the function, obviating the necessity for backpropagation in gradient descent completely.

 This is an interview with Junnan Li and Dongxu Li, authors of BLIP and members of Salesforce research.
 Cross-modal pre-training has been all the rage lately in deep learning, especially training vision and language models together. However, there are a number of issues, such as low quality datasets that limit the performance of any model trained on it, and also the fact that pure contrastive pre-training cannot be easily fine-tuned for most downstream tasks. BLIP unifies different tasks and objectives in a single pre-training run and achieves a much more versatile model, which the paper immediately uses to create, filter, clean and thus bootstrap its own dataset to improve performance even more!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To learn visual representations, self-attention-based models, particularly vision transformers, offer an alternative to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). ViT breaks an image into a series of non-overlapping patches and then uses multi-headed self-attention in transformers to learn interpatch representations. The typical trend in ViT networks is to increase the number of parameters to improve performance.
 These gains in performance come at the expense of model size (network parameters) and latency. Many real-world applications (such as augmented reality and autonomous wheelchairs) necessitate the timely execution of visual recognition tasks (such as object detection and semantic segmentation) on resource-constrained mobile devices.
 ViT models for such jobs should be light-weight and quick to be effective. ViT models’ performance is much inferior to light-weight CNNs, even when the model size is reduced to fit the resource limits of mobile devices. DeIT, for example, is 3% less accurate than MobileNetv3 for a parameter budget of roughly 5-6 million. As a result, designing light-weight ViT models is critical.
 Many mobile vision tasks have been powered by light-weight CNNs. ViT-based networks, on the other hand, are still a long way from being utilized on such devices. Unlike light-weight CNNs that are simple to optimize and integrate with task-specific networks, ViTs are large (e.g., ViT-B/16 vs. MobileNetv3: 86 vs. 7.5 million parameters), difficult to optimize, require extensive data augmentation and L2 regularisation to avoid over-fitting, and require expensive decoders for downstream tasks, particularly dense prediction tasks.

 The following notebook demonstrates a method to provide explainability for semantic search. This method masks/replaces each token for a search result to determine the importance of each term for a query. The score is then compared with the score for the full text to determine how much of a delta the permutation caused.

 An idea for modelling long-range interactions in CNNs came to my mind, and I thought to share it with you folks and seek your opinions. 
 On a high level, it functions akin to squeeze-and-excitation, with the chief difference being instead of calibrating channel-wise features, it operates on spatial features. Concretely, assume we start with a 3 X 256 X 256 tensor; the first step is to squeeze the channels via a convolution to get a 256 X 256 tensor. However, owing to the computational costs of the multilayer perceptron that is about to be described, it is necessary to downscale the spatial dimensions, which can be done by setting the convolution's kernel size and stride to, say, 16 (i.e., the input is being "patchified"). The resulting 16 X 16 matrix is flattened to yield a 25…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How does nebullvm work?
 It takes your AI model as input and outputs an optimized version that runs 5-20 times faster on your hardware. In other words, nebullvm tests multiple deep learning compilers to identify the best possible way to execute your model on your specific machine, without impacting the accuracy of your model.
 And that's it. In just a few lines of code.
 And a big thank you to everyone for supporting this open-source project! The library received 250+ Github stars⭐ on release day, and that's just amazing 🚀

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A bit of my background: I completed a Ph.D. in statistics in Europe last year. For my Ph.D., I did some work on DL (and also had some papers published). Directly after finishing my Ph.D. I started working as a data scientist in the financial service industry. However, my goal is to move into a pure tech company and hopefully work as a research data scientist or a research scientist. Recently I have been offered a 2-year postdoc in ML in a good group in Europe. I am considering taking this postdoc since I get more time to do "pure" research (and to complete some of the research from my Ph.D.). Thus, would it make sense to take this postdoc with a lower salary (and worse work-life balance) for a few years if the goal is to get a "research" job in the industry, or would I be better of to try to "climb the ladder" from my current data science job?
 PS: I am new to this subreddit so I hope this post is ok.

Three years ago we wrote about our work on predicting a number of cardiovascular risk factors from fundus photos (i.e., photos of the back of the eye)1 using deep learning. That such risk factors could be extracted from fundus photos was a novel discovery and thus a surprising outcome to clinicians and laypersons alike. Since then, we and other researchers have discovered additional novel biomarkers from fundus photos, such as markers for chronic kidney disease and diabetes, and hemoglobin levels to detect anemia.  
A unifying goal of work like this is to develop new disease detection or monitoring approaches that are less invasive, more accurate, cheaper and more readily available. How…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 It might be of interest that I created a Python implementation of IncrementalDBSCAN.
 The repository, including documentation, is here: https://github.com/DataOmbudsman/incdbscan
 And this is the original paper: https://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/Publikationen/Papers/VLDB-98-IncDBSCAN.pdf
 The paper (from the authors of DBSCAN) describes how to make DBSCAN work with an incremental strategy, in which one can add new data points to an already existing clustering and doesn't have to re-cluster every data point. I couldn't find any implementation of the algorithm so I ended up writing my own one. I'm glad it's actually working and has a lot of unit tests covering common and special cases. The performance gain (vs reclustering with DBSCAN) is not huge though, could be worked on more. 
 Happy to take any feedback!

Has anyone tried making a transformer-based reply bot or chatbot that responds to both images and text, like how a person would be able to chat in messaging apps? I thought about this because I figured tweet generation models would be much more interesting if they could also generate replies instead of standalone tweets, and replies by tweeters more often than not are replies to tweets with images. 
 I was thinking not only do you need an image-to-text model, you probably also need finetuning data that includes an image-to-text model? I guess understanding context would be major obstacle.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 After 1 year working extensively with GPT models (GPT-3, GPT-J, and GPT-NeoX), I think I now have a good view on what these NLP models are capable of. It appears that many traditional NLP tasks can now be achieved thanks to these large language models thanks to few-shot learning (aka "prompting", or "prompt engineering").
 NER is a very good candidate because, thanks to these models, it is possible to extract any type of entity without ever annotating and training a new model. Annotation has always been a challenge that has caused many entity extraction projects to simply fail, because it is a long and tedious process.
 In this article, I'm showing how easy it is to perform NER thanks to GPT and few-shot learning, without any annotation process: https://nlpcloud.io/few-shot-ner-entity-extraction-without-annotation-training-based-on-gpt.html
 If you also experimented with entity extraction with GPT models, I would love to hear your thoughts. Are you, like I am, impressed by the results? And do you think it means that annotation is a thing from the past?
 Thanks!

 Basically i need to create a neural net from scratch in c# for intent classification. I have modelled the neurons as a class with attributes : weights(moddelled as an array, each value is a weight for a branch connecting to the neuron) a , a value(result after the activation),and a bias(a different bias per neuron. 
 My question is that , my input will be an array of words, obviously hashed or something so it has a numerical value, each value in the array will be multiplied by the weight. Is the bias added to each of these values and then the activation function applied to each value in the array, OR is it that the activation is applied to the array there is one value as an output and the bias is added to that.
 thank you any help appreciated , if more info is needed then please ask.

Neuroscientists like Stanislas Dehaene at Collège de France, Moira Dillon at New York University, and Josh Tenenbaum at MIT are exploring whether human ability to reason about geometric shapes like squares and rectangles are part of what makes humans special. Dehaene said. “I love the progress in A.I. It’s very impressive. But I believe that there is a deep aspect missing, which is symbol processing”. Yoshua Bengio, at the Université de Montréal, agreed that state-of-the-art machine learning lacks something related to symbols or abstract reasoning. It’s not impossible to do abstract reasoning with neural networks, Bengio said, “it’s just that we don’t know yet how to do it.” It’s an indication, Bengio said, of where A.I. research needs to go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Extracting knowledge and actionable insights by manually processing hundreds of terabytes of data downlinked from satellites to data centers has become difficult.
 Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging is a type of active remote sensing in which a satellite sends microwave radar wave pulses down to the Earth’s surface. These radar signals return to the satellite after reflecting off the Earth and any objects. A SAR image is created by processing these pulses over time and space, with each pixel representing the superposition of multiple radar scatters. Radar waves penetrate clouds and illuminate the Earth’s surface even during nights because the satellite is actively creating them.
 They produce visual that is sometimes contradictory and incompatible with modern computer vision systems. Three common effects are polarisation, layover, and multi-path.
  
The layover effect occurs when radar beams reach the top of a structure before reaching the bottom. This causes the top of the object to appear to be overlapping with the bottom. 
 When radar waves reflect off objects on the ground and bounce numerous times before returning to the SAR sensor, this is known as multi-path effects. Multi-path effects cause things in the picture to appear in multiple transformations in the final image.

 The game itself will be simple, likely a turn based board game. The AIs battle each other to win the competition. Last year's competition had a simplified version of Catan.
 I have taken some university courses in the AI field (AI 101, Machine learning, Soft Computing etc.) and am familiar with basic concepts, but I don't know much about RL (I have a general notion on what it's about). I was hoping to learn more about it some day and this competition seems like a perfect opportunity. 
 I'm looking to prepare a bit before the competition and started exploring reinforcement learning methods and frameworks. Is there a framework which would be suitable for this? A framework which has an interface for a custom game that I can build?
 Could Q learning be used in environments where there is more than one agent? Are there some methods to learn the best heuristic for the minmax algorithm?

I've seen people arguing about whether it's merely counting cards (which isn't the same as out-strategizing humans)
 
Their metrics for success seem questionable, like they have a graph of cumulative chips won that goes up - which seems great but would also happen if some of the human pros could still outperform it on average

 Cross-modal pre-training has been all the rage lately in deep learning, especially training vision and language models together. However, there are a number of issues, such as low quality datasets that limit the performance of any model trained on it, and also the fact that pure contrastive pre-training cannot be easily fine-tuned for most downstream tasks. BLIP unifies different tasks and objectives in a single pre-training run and achieves a much more versatile model, which the paper immediately uses to create, filter, clean and thus bootstrap its own dataset to improve performance even more!

 Here's what I've considered so far:
  
Hugging Face (Gradio) - the VQGAN_CLIP model is down, which doesn't instill confidence...
 Docker, cog, and replicate.com - it doesn't seem to have API capability.
 RunwayML - they seem to be pivoting away from such a service.
 NodeJS and some cloud hosting service (Amazon?) - may be complex to set up, are there any straightforward tutorials to host say VQGAN+CLIP? Would the process be different for a diffusion model?
  
How do tools like WOMBO host their models? Anyone have advice before I start going down a dead end?
 I have some software engineering and machine learning experience, but none with deployment.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A regular SMS message sent from a business – like a promotion or a welcome message – is a common one-way communication. A chatbot, instead, provides a two-way conversation: it can ask questions, process the answer, and continue the communicational path to subscribe, qualify leads and even sell. 
 But here are things to keep in mind:
  
You'll pay for every message.
 You should also keep in mind the character limit. A single SMS message should include no more than 160 characters encoded using the GSM-7 character set.
 If using SMS, you’ll also need to update relevant legal pages like terms of service and privacy policy, with details on how SMS consent will be handled.
 Many countries may have additional regulations. For the US, all SMS messaging in The United States of America is governed by the CTIA – The Wireless Association.
 Another point is media limits. SMS does not allow sending videos or attachments. You may send an image with an MMS but keep in mind the cost of it is different than for a text-only SMS. 
  
Overall, there are more benefits to SMS chatbots, and if you've been thinking on them for a long time, here's a guide to help you starting out https://botscrew.com/blog/sms-chatbot-a-complete-guide-for-business-use-cases/?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=artificial&utm_campaign=44643&utm_term=&utm_content=

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let me start this by saying I am a complete rookie on neural networks. I had one semester when we touched on them and I did a project that involved one. Beyond that, my skill is very limited. Now I am out of school and want to improve on my project. Looking for some expert advice. 
 My project was based on the program found here:
 Price-Forecaster/Stock-RNN-Deep-Learning-TechIndicators.ipynb at master · marcosan93/Price-Forecaster · GitHub 
 I posted an issue and someone added the comment that the programmer has not split the data to X-train,X-test, y-train,y-test so the model will be always biased due to peek ahead. I added early stopping to the program to help with overfitting. Am I understanding things right on where would you add splitting the data? Would you split the data before running the network and use the training data in the epochs, run the network, then recall the best weights for your test set? Just unsure how you do this when the accuracy of the test set may be garbage. 
 My goal is to send a list of stocks through the network, then give me a "report" at the end that shows which stock is most likely to meet or exceed its prediction. Would this just be a confidence interval? Ideally, I would include a goal return and it would say which stock was most likely to reach that return. Since each stock has its own cycles, I was planning to run each stock through the network to find the individual weights. Any advice on this section?
 I hope you can help with some advice. I'd love to see how well my added code ideas would do. Thanks.

The LSTM is meant to enable agents to remember the history of states in which they have observed other agents, and improve their ability to model other agents’ policies.
 Can someone refer me to PyTorch code for such an architecture?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GitHub: https://github.com/muxamilian/wysiwyh
 WYSIWHY is a neural network that transforms an input video into an audio sequence in real time. It does so by compressing each image using an autoencoder and interpreting the resulting code as a frequency range.
 This could potentially be useful for the visually impaired, helping with indoor navigation. It could also be used to transform an infrared or ultraviolet video to sound and thus enable one to perceive otherwise invisible colors.
 Demo; recommended with sound turned on
 In a usual autoencoder, the elements of the code vector are independent of each other. This makes subtle differences between adjacent elements of the code vector hard to perceive for humans. The resulting audio sequence would sound like indistinguishable white noise. For WYSIWYH thus an encoder is used which hierarchically structures the code, meaning that large differences in the input image result in large differences in the output code. This also results in adjacent elements of the code vector being correlated. This makes the autoencoder’s code more friendly to human perception.
 Overall approach

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), with their capacity of producing high-quality images, have been the leading technology in image generation for the past couple of years. Nevertheless, their minimax learning mechanism brought out different limits, such as training instability and mode collapse (i.e., when all the produced samples belong to a small set of samples).
 Recently, Generative Transformer models are beginning to match, or even surpass, the performances of GANs. The simple idea is to learn a function to encode the input image into a quantized sequence and then train an autoregressive Transformer on a sequence prediction task (i.e., predict an image token, given all the previous image tokens). This learning is based on maximum likelihood and thus not affected by the same issue…]]></summary>

 I'm Thomas Simonini from Hugging Face 🤗. I work on building tools, environments and integrating RL libraries to empower researchers and RL enthusiasts. I was wondering how Hugging Face can be useful to you in the Deep Reinforcement Learning Ecosystem? What do you need as RL researcher/enthusiast/engineer and how we can help you?
 For now:
  
We integrated Stable-baselines3 to the Hub** such that you can: 
 Easily host and test your saved models.
 Load powerful, trained models from the community

We're currently integrating more libraries (RL-Zoo, CleanRL...)
 We're working on building tools that allow you to generate a replay video of your agent and test it.
 We're building open-source RL environments such as snowball-fight
 And finally, we're working on state of the art's research with Decision Transformers, Embodied environments, etc.
  
But I would love to know what do you need as RL researcher/enthusiast/engineer and how we can help you?
 Thanks for your feedback,
 📢 To keep in touch is to join our discord server to exchange with us and with the community.

 env.distance_threshold = 0.01(or other value) 
 Because I think 0.05(m) is too rough for some tasks. But it doesn't work! (When the success_rate is 1.0, the distance between the achieved_goal and the desired_goal is 0.04x, which is larger than I set.) 
 What should I do to change the conditions for determining whether a task is complete? Can anyone give me some advice or information?

 I'm an undergraduate CS student trying to re-implement this paper for my University project.
 I have some experience in Machine Learning (Supervised Learning) and implemented some basic projects myself, but I'm a little bit confused about where to begin, I've found two different implementations online but I don't think that's gonna help me a lot as I'm not that experienced in this field.
 I would appreciate any suggestions on how I can understand the paper and implement it myself (not just a copy/paste from someone else's code) or the libraries that can help me, etc.
 Sorry for my bad English, I'm not a native speaker
 thanks a lot :)

 It takes your AI model as input and outputs an optimized version that runs 5-20 times faster on your hardware. In other words, nebullvm tests multiple deep learning compilers to identify the best possible way to execute your model on your specific machine, without impacting the accuracy of your model.
 And that's it. In just a few lines of code.
 And a big thank you to everyone for supporting this open-source project! The library received 250+ Github stars⭐ on release day, and that's just amazing 🚀

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flower and its community are growing. Since Flower is a friendly federated learning framework, the goal is always to get an easy start to federated learning for every data scientist. 
 This involves having Flower coding examples for different machine learning frameworks.
 One of the frameworks is JAX which was developed by Google researchers to run NumPy programs on GPUs and TPUs. It is quickly rising in popularity and is used by DeepMind to support and accelerate its research.
 We couldn’t miss the opportunity to create a code example and a blog post about “JAX meets Flower - Federated Learning with JAX”. 
 It takes always some time to get into a new machine learning framework and its syntax but it is easy to combine it with Flower. 
 You can check out the blog post here: https://flower.dev/blog/2022-03-22-running-jax-federated-jax-meets-flower/

 I have some experience deploying batch machine learning models and now I want to learn about real-time models. More specifically, how to put them in production and what are the best practices and tools for different use-cases.
 Any ideas? I was thinking of reading the book "Designing Event-Driven Systems" by Ben Stopford (I think it's based on Kafka which seems quite popular), but would like to hear your thoughts or if someone has any other reference.
 Thanks and I hope this is the right sub!

My current lab is a neuroscience lab that does lots of ML theory stuff (bio inspired ML). My primary goal is to get a PhD and find a research scientist position in industry at a non-FAANG company. 
 Because my PI is a neuroscientist, I might not be able to work with him as a PhD student if I apply to the EE or CS program at this university, but he has an affiliate appointment at the Biomedical Engineering department. 
 Would having a biomedical engineering degree in any way affect my ability to get a research scientist ML job? As long as I have a productive PhD with ML publications etc., and get internships at relevant places, I should be fine right? Will I have a worse chance at non-biotech companies? If BME is an issue, I’m sure my PI can get affiliate status in EE, because he has multiple collaborators in EE.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Artificial intelligence is generally praised for their use in many sectors. One of the most notable achievements of AI in science is its breakthrough in molecular biology as it helped reduce the time to identify the structure of complicated 3D protein folds. AI has also helped advance the efficiency in quantum computers, and now AI is making a large presence in clinical/healthcare. Despite the potential of AI being revolutionary in healthcare we must be cautious utilizing it. I want to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of AI to inspire and to set forth challenges for you to approach in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I asked this question on stats stackexchange, and it is posted here. I don't copy it here because formulas don't show up nicely on reddit.
 I am trying to implement this paper by Fallah et al (NIPs 2021) titled: On the Convergence Theory of Debiased Model-Agnostic Meta-Reinforcement Learning. As the title suggests, they propose an algorithm for meta RL that uses an stochastic approximation of the gradient. My problem is with the term that yields the probability of a given trajectory (a sequence of state-actions). I don't know how to estimate that term and the paper doesn't discuss that. I'd appreciate if anyone can share any insight on how to estimate that term.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! I'm working on a project where I'm using neural networks to overcome some RF impairments in a wireless communications system. When I introduce a frequency offset to the data, my current neural network (which is a simple 2 hidden layer feed-forward NN) can not compensate. The frequency offset is basically a phase rotation on the IQ samples. The problem is this is also time-dependent such that the amount the sample is shifted is a function of time. ie: x_out[n] = x[n]e^(j2*pi*w*n) where w is the phase shift from the frequency offset, n is the discrete sample. I know my NN needs some kind of memory (so I should use an LSTM or some RNN variant), just wondering if anyone has some recommended papers or has done some work similar to this and would be willing to help, thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I've been interested in pattern theory for a bit, and as far as I can tell it can be viewed as a framework for artificial intelligence. In Grenander's book "Calculus of Thoughts" David Mumford mentions that a major issue with pattern theory is the creation of generators and modalities of bonds.
 For the bonds, has anyone tried basing their properties on a sense of time? I.e. in whatever environment a program is in, it would have a clock measuring time, and would somehow equate these bonds simply with events happening close to each other in time.
 Apologies if this is a naïve/vague/nonsensical question, I'm enthusiastic but not too knowledgeable about pattern theory. Any feedback is greatly appreciated

 With a friend, we are develpoing a tool to be able to easily start pods, distribute the code (with magics) and stop them directly from your notebook.
 Pods can be started in seconds with the specifications you need: number of instances/pods, CPU, Memory, GPU and packages
 The tool makes it easy to increase computer resources quickly, code locally and consume resources only when you need it, paralelize tasks and do parameter grid search.
 If you like it, you can visit our landing page and register for early access: telekinesis.cloud
 We are giving 10 GPU hours to our first 50 registered users!
 We hope you like it! Thank you!
 Please share feedback

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dynamics in reinforcement learning, that are represented by the transition function in an MDP, are meant to modelize the probability of reaching (or deriving from) the desired state. From what I understand, this probability is caused by the environement or by a malfunction within the agent(?). 
 I would like to ask if there is any real life problem modelized into an RL model with a real life transition probability? I would be super grateful if you redirect me to research papers in this axis (all I found so far are theoretical representation of dynamics)
 Thanks in advance.

 As the title points out, I would like to identify someone's professional background (e.g. engineering, art, ...) through his syntax. 
 To do so my strategy was to find a dataset regrouping messages alongside the person's background but it doesn't exist (to my knowledge)
 Do you guys have any idea to persue? (any good dataset?, trying to find multiple datasets and merging them?, scraping LinkedIn?)
 Is it even possible to e.g. scrape LinkedIn for such information?
 Any thoughts and feedback are welcome!
 Initial strategy:
 - Either finding a dataset or scraping LinkedIn. (is it even possible?)
 - Training a NN.
 Alternative question:
 - Do you know of any other approach that would be less data intensive using for instance hand crafted features, computational linguistics and the such?
 Cheers,

 Doing it on every frame would probably be too slow, but one could probably do it only on P-frames with a very small increase of error rate.

FastTreeSHAP v2 would be 2.5x faster than TreeSHAP. Let's reminder that SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanation) values quantify the contribution of each feature to the model prediction, a bit like how each player contributes to the success of a sports team. SHAP does it by incorporating concepts from game theory and local explanations. Naively implemented, SHAP takes exponential time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, all. Hope you lot are doing alright.
 I was looking into Explainable AI and model interpretability lately, and I had an idea but am wondering whether it would constitute a valid use case.
 There is a data analysis project happening at work where we're trying to analyze data we had on hand to determine the factors that affect our KPOs and possibly derive useful actionable insights. Instead of moving forward with manually evaluating correlation and doing EDA that way, I was thinking of using variable importance measures, subpopulation analyses, and partial dependence profiles to potentially gain insights, or at the very least narrow down exploratory scope.
 I have been scrounging the internet for someone using white box models for expediting analysis tasks, but I haven't found anything that remotely fits the bill except perhaps this article: https://medium.com/swlh/how-i-used-a-machine-learning-model-to-generate-actionable-insights-3aa1dfe2ddfd
 It'd be great if you guys let me know what you think.

 Many epistemic uncertainty quantification methods, for example, MC-Dropout, Deep Ensemble, claim themselves as a Bayesian model to justify their approach for quantifying uncertainty. Let's just say their claims are valid so that the methods are truly Bayesian. But then, why are Bayesian methods supposed to estimate uncertainty well?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Researchers from LinkedIn open-source the FastTreeSHAP package which is a Python module based on the paper ‘Fast TreeSHAP: Accelerating SHAP Value Computation for Trees.’ Implementing the widely-used TreeSHAP algorithm in the SHAP package allows for the efficient interpretation of tree-based machine learning models by estimating sample-level feature significance values. Its package includes two new algorithms: FastTreeSHAP v1 and FastTreeSHAP v2, both of which improve TreeSHAP’s computational efficiency by taking a different approach. 
 The empirical benchmarking tests show that FastTreeSHAP v1 is 1.5x faster than TreeSHAP while keeping memory costs the same, and FastTreeSHAP v2 is 2.5x faster while using slightly more memory. The FastTreeSHAP package fully supports parallel multi-core computing to speed up its computation.

 Unfortunately, when doing normalisation, these extreme values will tend to result in almost every other values being extremely small after min-max. Any suggestions to go about this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many machine learning tasks require high-quality data, such as assessing damage in a satellite that negatively affects a model’s performance. Datasets can cost millions of dollars to create if useable data exists, and even the best datasets sometimes contain biases that negatively impact a model’s performance.
 Many scientists have been working to answer an intriguing question working with synthetic data sampled from a generative model instead of real data. A generative model is a machine-learning model that requires significantly less memory to keep or share than a dataset. The range and quality of generative models have improved dramatically in recent years.
 Synthetic data has the ability to get around some of the privacy and usage rights problems that limit how actual data may be distributed. A generative model could potentially be updated to eliminate particular attributes, such as race or gender, to overcome biases in traditional datasets.
 New research by MIT Team develops a method for training a machine learning (ML) model that, rather than requiring a dataset, employs a particular form of ML model to generate exceptionally realistic synthetic data that can train another model for downstream vision tasks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. I am looking for reaearch papers and ideas on how to solve this problem for my master’s thesis. Any pointers to SOTA reearch would be greatly appreciated. Let me just quickly summarize the problem at hand:
  
There are over 100k devices connected to this cloud network, where the devices track the GPS location of shipping containers. Most of the containers also have a cooling system, where it’s possible to read a couple of sensor data and also remotely control temperature/humidity in the containers.
 
My main objective is to apply some ML algo to try and predict if some device (or the integrated cooling system) is about become faulty, such that it can trigger an alarm and consequently get someone to inspect the devices due to possible malfunction.
 
The approach: Just on top of my mind, I would like to apply some unsupervised learning technique to detect if some device is behaving far from the norm. 
 
I am even more intetested in supervised learning, but it might be a little tricky to tell based on a record if it’s faulty (target variable)
 
 Any ideas? Feel free to ask if something isn’t clear.
 Training a model on 100TB of data might become a challenge in itself. I would have to apply some algo that can learn iteratively.
 Thanks!

 Does anyone know of any real-life applications of constrained optimization using newton's method in deep learning (specifically in minimizing the cost function)? Or if constrained optimization is even used at all when minimizing the cost function?
 I know that Newton's method can be used to find the minimum of the cost function in logistic regression. However, would there be any instances where we would add constraints to the cost function in logistic regression, therefore allowing us to use constrained optimization techniques with newton's method (such as Lagrange multipliers or interior-point methods).

 Most of the unstructured pruning algorithms cannot induce their theoretical performance due to the fact that we cannot ignore the zeros when the actual computation occurs.
 I recently read the paper about N:M structured sparse neural networks and I just got interested in the techniques and research about 'the actual acceleration for zeroes'.
 If we want to dig more about these kinds of sparsity acceleration ( If I'm calling it right), which paper should we look into?
 How can we ignore the zeroes, aside from saving indices of non-zero values?

critical for accurate and timely clinical diagnosis. Recent deep learning (DL)
morphology analysis methods achieve promising benchmark results, but leave
performance and robustness on the table by relying on limited and possibly
noisy class labels. To address this, we introduce a new DL training framework
that leverages anatomical and image priors from human sperm microscopy crops to
extract useful features without additional labeling cost. Our core idea is to
distill sperm head information with reliably-generated pseudo-masks and
unsupervised spatial prediction tasks. The predicted foreground masks from this
distillation step are then leveraged to regularize and reduce image and label
noise in the tuning stage. We evaluate our new approach on two public sperm
datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performances (e.g. 65.9% SCIAN accuracy
and 96.5% HuSHeM accuracy).]]></summary>

One of the key takeaways from this paper is that modelling implicit knowledge is crucial. And in order to make the model learn this implicit knowledge, simply "relaxing" the error term in cross-task learning is not enough, because then conventional loss functions won't be able to capture this implicit knowledge. So in order to tackle this problem, they model the error term for various tasks such that implicit knowledge can be learned.
 This reminded me very much of meta-RL, except I haven't seen any implementations of it where they explicitly model this per-task error and use a similar implicit+explicit knowledge learning framework.
 Since YOLOR is currently SOTA for realtime object detection and some other tasks, it seems like this was quite a significant insight and I wonder if anyone is aware of similar works in the "RL branch" of AI?
 I'd love to hear some thoughts about this or if someone can point me to related literature this would be great. In case this hasn't been looked into before, I'd love to start a PhD regarding this topic to learn more about it haha

The field is mathematical and the journal also addresses numerical & computational aspects of it, but applying ML (especially neural net based L2 regressions) is still a bit unheard of there. As such, I made sure to dumb everything down for them and still gave the mathematical justifications, including convergence proofs.
 In short, it was about estimating certain conditional expectations having a very special structure, without resorting to heavy brute-force approaches (like nested Monte-Carlo), using L2 projections with neural networks and a special sampling scheme which was also explained in detail.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all!
 I am trying to use RL in order to train an agent that provides best direction to move in order to maximize the coverage of an area and I am giving reward on the basis of coverage increase at each step. I am implementing such algorithm both for 1 agent (so I am using simple DDPG) and for a set of agents (using MADDPG), but if I make the exploration noise decay, I noticed that the selected action of the model is always the same, independently on the input it receives. In fact, even during training, selected action is always a little update with respect to the one selected previously, even if the episode changes, and the inputs too. I have tried increasing/decresing the effect of noise (I am using Ornstein Uhlenbeck process) or decreasing the learning rates, but this seems to have no effect. What may be the problem of such a strange behaviour?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently writing my Master's thesis on the merits and pitfalls of using reinforcement learning, specifically Proximal Policy Optimization, to finetune large language models. The project is inspired by the paper Fine-Tuning Language Models from Human Preferences, which uses a reward model trained on a dataset of human preferences to supply a reward signal used for fine-tuning GPT-2 to generate summaries and continuations that are optimized for human preference.
 I'm investigating the pros and cons of a more naive approach that does not require collecting a dataset of human preferences. Using the trl library, I train a BERT-classifier to distinguish between sarcastic and non-sarcastic reddit comments, and that classifier then serves as a reward model that provides a reward signal for fine-tuning GPT-2 for text generation using PPO. I have applied the same method to the task of generating negative review, by training BERT on the IMDB-dataset. This method of course leads to extensive reward hacking, but investigating how to mitigate that is part of the fun!
 I'm looking for inspiration for what other NLP tasks I could apply this to. The important constraint is that the tasks have to be something that I can train a classifier to evaluate, or otherwise evaluate algorithmically using metrics like ROUGE, because I need to supply GPT-2 with a scalar reward signal. 
 What other tasks should I try this method out on?

Cells that are high in protein A but low in B may be called "Type 1", cells low in protein A but high in protein B may be called "Type 2", cells high in both A and B "Type 3", and cells low in both "Type 4".
 Sometimes this works well and cells are clearly one type or the other. But unfortunately nature doesn't care about our desire to neatly classify things, and I believe that cell identity exists on a spectrum.

 I am feeding it with 8000 numbers representing the last prices. Due to some reasons still unknown to me, I can basically add as many layers as I want as long as they are not bigger than 4096 neurons without increasing learning speed.
 I just wanted to ask: would 20 layers be too many ? Would 5 probably not be enough ? Right now the model looks like that:
 Dense(2048, "relu")
 Dense(1024, "relu")
 Dense(512, "relu")
 Dense(256, "relu")
 Dense(128, "relu")
 Dense(1024, "relu")

 Dense(128, "relu")
 Dense(64, "relu")
 Dense(32, "relu")
 Dense(16, "relu")
 Dense(8, "relu")

(KG), and then extracts different threat features and generates new datasets
corresponding with three different feature combinations. Finally, 9 types of ML
models are created and trained using the three datasets, respectively, and
their performance are compared and analyzed with 27 threat detectors and 270
times of experiments. The experimental results and analyses show that: 1) the
ML techniques are feasible in detecting general SE attacks and some ML models
are quite effective; ML-based SE threat detection is complementary with
KG-based approaches; 2) the generated datasets are usable and the SE domain
ontology proposed in previous work can dissect SE attacks and deliver the SE
threat features, allowing it to be used as a data model for future research.
Besides, more conclusions and analyses about the characteristics of different

how to make these agents fully autonomous so that they can (1) learn by

and (2) accommodate or adapt to unexpected or novel circumstances. As the
real-world is an open environment that is full of unknowns or novelties,
detecting novelties, characterizing them, accommodating or adapting to them,
and gathering ground-truth training data and incrementally learning the
unknowns/novelties are critical to making the AI agent more and more

process so that it is carried out continually on the agent's own initiative and
through its own interactions with humans, other agents and the environment just

Bayes optimal adversary when it has knowledge of the underlying distribution.
Further, our experimental evaluation shows that several existing heuristic

core problem in drug discovery. An extremely fast computational binding method
would enable key applications such as fast virtual screening or drug

heavy candidate sampling coupled with scoring, ranking, and fine-tuning steps.
We challenge this paradigm with EquiBind, an SE(3)-equivariant geometric deep
learning model performing direct-shot prediction of both i) the receptor
binding location (blind docking) and ii) the ligand's bound pose and
orientation. EquiBind achieves significant speed-ups and better quality
compared to traditional and recent baselines. Further, we show extra
improvements when coupling it with existing fine-tuning techniques at the cost
of increased running time. Finally, we propose a novel and fast fine-tuning
model that adjusts torsion angles of a ligand's rotatable bonds based on
closed-form global minima of the von Mises angular distance to a given input
atomic point cloud, avoiding previous expensive differential evolution

distance from an unlabeled dataset. The resulting distance is broadly useful
for improving various distance-based downstream tasks, even when no information
from downstream tasks is utilized in the metric learning stage. To gain
insights into this approach, we develop a statistical framework to
theoretically study how self-supervised metric learning can benefit downstream
tasks in the context of multi-view data. Under this framework, we show that the
target distance of metric learning satisfies several desired properties for the
downstream tasks. On the other hand, our investigation suggests the target
distance can be further improved by moderating each direction's weights. In
addition, our analysis precisely characterizes the improvement by
self-supervised metric learning on four commonly used downstream tasks: sample
identification, two-sample testing, $k$-means clustering, and $k$-nearest
neighbor classification. When the distance is estimated from an unlabeled
dataset, we establish the upper bound on distance estimation's accuracy and the
number of samples sufficient for downstream task improvement. Finally,
numerical experiments are presented to support the theoretical results in the
paper.]]></summary>

schemes underlying partial differential equations (PDEs) as a Partially
Observable Markov Game (POMG) in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Similar to
numerical solvers, our agent acts at each discrete location of a computational
space for efficient and generalizable learning. To learn higher-order spatial
methods by acting on local states, the agent must discern how its actions at a
given spatiotemporal location affect the future evolution of the state. The
manifestation of this non-stationarity is addressed by BPTTS, which allows for
the flow of gradients across both space and time. The learned numerical
policies are comparable to the SOTA numerics in two settings, the Burgers'

and lower bounds on the sample complexity of PAC RL in deterministic episodic
MDPs with finite state and action spaces. In particular, our bounds feature a
new notion of sub-optimality gap for state-action pairs that we call the
deterministic return gap. While our instance-dependent lower bound is written
as a linear program, our algorithms are very simple and do not require solving
such an optimization problem during learning. Their design and analyses employ

However, accurately distinguishing between sounding and non-sounding regions is
challenging without manual annotations. In this work, we propose a simple yet

from sparse and delayed rewards. It challenges the ability of agents to
attribute their actions to future outcomes. In this paper, we consider the
problem formulation of episodic reinforcement learning with trajectory
feedback. It refers to an extreme delay of reward signals, in which the agent
can only obtain one reward signal at the end of each trajectory. A popular
paradigm for this problem setting is learning with a designed auxiliary dense
reward function, namely proxy reward, instead of sparse environmental signals.
Based on this framework, this paper proposes a novel reward redistribution
algorithm, randomized return decomposition (RRD), to learn a proxy reward
function for episodic reinforcement learning. We establish a surrogate problem
by Monte-Carlo sampling that scales up least-squares-based reward
redistribution to long-horizon problems. We analyze our surrogate loss function
by connection with existing methods in the literature, which illustrates the
algorithmic properties of our approach. In experiments, we extensively evaluate
our proposed method on a variety of benchmark tasks with episodic rewards and
demonstrate substantial improvement over baseline algorithms.]]></summary>

vehicles that aim to improve road safety. Due to their vulnerability,
pedestrians are the users who will benefit the most from these developments.
However, predicting their trajectory is one of the most challenging concerns.
Indeed, accurate prediction requires a good understanding of multi-agent
interactions that can be complex. Learning the underlying spatial and temporal
patterns caused by these interactions is even more of a competitive and open
problem that many researchers are tackling. In this paper, we introduce a model
called PRediction Transformer (PReTR) that extracts features from the
multi-agent scenes by employing a factorized spatio-temporal attention module.
It shows less computational needs than previously studied models with
empirically better results. Besides, previous works in motion prediction suffer
from the exposure bias problem caused by generating future sequences
conditioned on model prediction samples rather than ground-truth samples. In
order to go beyond the proposed solutions, we leverage encoder-decoder
Transformer networks for parallel decoding a set of learned object queries.
This non-autoregressive solution avoids the need for iterative conditioning and
arguably decreases training and testing computational time. We evaluate our
model on the ETH/UCY datasets, a publicly available benchmark for pedestrian
trajectory prediction. Finally, we justify our usage of the parallel decoding
technique by showing that the trajectory prediction task can be better solved
as a non-autoregressive task.]]></summary>

pretraining by adding 2D positional encodings and allowing an arbitrary order
to predict spans, which results in performance gains over BERT and T5 on NLU
tasks. Meanwhile, GLM can be pretrained for different types of tasks by varying
the number and lengths of blanks. On a wide range of tasks across NLU,

Firstly, mandatory margin penalty are added between classes, therefore both

a novel sample selection strategy are proposed to discover informative samples

systems. In deep learning, a common approach to this end is to train a neural
network to estimate the parameters of a heteroscedastic Gaussian distribution
by maximizing the logarithm of the likelihood function under the observed data.
In this work, we examine this approach and identify potential hazards
associated with the use of log-likelihood in conjunction with gradient-based
optimizers. First, we present a synthetic example illustrating how this
approach can lead to very poor but stable parameter estimates. Second, we
identify the culprit to be the log-likelihood loss, along with certain
conditions that exacerbate the issue. Third, we present an alternative
formulation, termed $\beta$-NLL, in which each data point's contribution to the
loss is weighted by the $\beta$-exponentiated variance estimate. We show that
using an appropriate $\beta$ largely mitigates the issue in our illustrative
example. Fourth, we evaluate this approach on a range of domains and tasks and
show that it achieves considerable improvements and performs more robustly
concerning hyperparameters, both in predictive RMSE and log-likelihood

privacy constraint. Data heterogeneity is one of the main challenges in FL,
which results in slow convergence and degraded performance. Most existing
approaches only tackle the heterogeneity challenge by restricting the local

model aggregation. Instead, we propose a data-free knowledge distillation
method to fine-tune the global model in the server (FedFTG), which relieves the
issue of direct model aggregation. Concretely, FedFTG explores the input space
of local models through a generator, and uses it to transfer the knowledge from
local models to the global model. Besides, we propose a hard sample mining
scheme to achieve effective knowledge distillation throughout the training. In
addition, we develop customized label sampling and class-level ensemble to
derive maximum utilization of knowledge, which implicitly mitigates the
distribution discrepancy across clients. Extensive experiments show that our
FedFTG significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) FL algorithms and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Managers often believe that collecting more data will continually improve the
accuracy of their machine learning models. However, we argue in this paper that
when data lose relevance over time, it may be optimal to collect a limited
amount of recent data instead of keeping around an infinite supply of older
(less relevant) data. In addition, we argue that increasing the stock of data
by including older datasets may, in fact, damage the model's accuracy.
Expectedly, the model's accuracy improves by increasing the flow of data
(defined as data collection rate); however, it requires other tradeoffs in
terms of refreshing or retraining machine learning models more frequently.

Using these results, we investigate how the business value created by machine
learning models scales with data and when the stock of data establishes a
sustainable competitive advantage. We argue that data's time-dependency weakens
the barrier to entry that the stock of data creates. As a result, a competing
firm equipped with a limited (yet sufficient) amount of recent data can develop
more accurate models. This result, coupled with the fact that older datasets
may deteriorate models' accuracy, suggests that created business value doesn't
scale with the stock of available data unless the firm offloads less relevant
data from its data repository. Consequently, a firm's growth policy should
incorporate a balance between the stock of historical data and the flow of new
data.

We complement our theoretical results with an experiment. In the experiment,
we empirically measure the loss in the accuracy of a next word prediction model
trained on datasets from various time periods. Our empirical measurements
confirm the economic significance of the value decline over time. For example,
100MB of text data, after seven years, becomes as valuable as 50MB of current
data for the next word prediction task.]]></summary>

classification; (ii) destroy model calibration; and (iii) rely on the source

shift called measurement shift which can be resolved by restoring the source

Restoration (FR) wherein we: (i) store a lightweight and flexible approximation
of the feature distribution under the source data; and (ii) adapt the
feature-extractor such that the approximate feature distribution under the

access disparate information about diseases with numerous benefits for
artificial intelligence (AI). To create knowledge graphs, it is necessary to
extract knowledge from multimodal datasets in the form of relationships between
disease concepts and normalize both concepts and relationship types. Methods:
We introduce REMAP, a multimodal approach for disease relation extraction and
classification. The REMAP machine learning approach jointly embeds a partial,
incomplete knowledge graph and a medical language dataset into a compact latent
vector space, followed by aligning the multimodal embeddings for optimal
disease relation extraction. Results: We apply REMAP approach to a disease
knowledge graph with 96,913 relations and a text dataset of 1.24 million
sentences. On a dataset annotated by human experts, REMAP improves text-based
disease relation extraction by 10.0% (accuracy) and 17.2% (F1-score) by fusing
disease knowledge graphs with text information. Further, REMAP leverages text
information to recommend new relationships in the knowledge graph,
outperforming graph-based methods by 8.4% (accuracy) and 10.4% (F1-score).
Discussion: Systematized knowledge is becoming the backbone of AI, creating
opportunities to inject semantics into AI and fully integrate it into machine
learning algorithms. While prior semantic knowledge can assist in extracting
disease relationships from text, existing methods can not fully leverage
multimodal datasets. Conclusion: REMAP is a multimodal approach for extracting
and classifying disease relationships by fusing structured knowledge and text

samples by a rejection function. This rejection function is trained together
with a classification function under the framework of Learning-with-Rejection
(LwR). The highlights of LwR are: (1) the rejection strategy is not heuristic
but has a strong background from a machine learning theory, and (2) the
rejection function can be trained on an arbitrary feature space which is
different from the feature space for classification. The latter suggests we can
choose a feature space that is more suitable for rejection. Although the past
research on LwR focused only on its theoretical aspect, we propose to utilize
LwR for practical pattern classification tasks. Moreover, we propose to use
features from different CNN layers for classification and rejection. Our
extensive experiments of notMNIST classification and character/non-character
classification demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance
than traditional rejection strategies.]]></summary>

neural networks. Most existing DA techniques naively add a certain number of
augmented samples without considering the quality and the added computational
cost of these samples. To tackle this problem, a common strategy, adopted by
several state-of-the-art DA methods, is to adaptively generate or re-weight
augmented samples with respect to the task objective during training. However,
these adaptive DA methods: (1) are computationally expensive and not
sample-efficient, and (2) are designed merely for a specific setting. In this
work, we present a universal DA technique, called Glitter, to overcome both
issues. Glitter can be plugged into any DA method, making training
sample-efficient without sacrificing performance. From a pre-generated pool of
augmented samples, Glitter adaptively selects a subset of worst-case samples
with maximal loss, analogous to adversarial DA. Without altering the training
strategy, the task objective can be optimized on the selected subset. Our
thorough experiments on the GLUE benchmark, SQuAD, and HellaSwag in three
widely used training setups including consistency training, self-distillation

This connectivity complicates the computation of individual privacy loss in

extends to the domain of GNNs, rendering private machine learning on
graph-structured data a challenging task. A lack of prior systematisation work
motivated us to study graph-based learning from a privacy perspective. In this

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Speaker embedding is an important front-end module to explore discriminative
speaker features for many speech applications where speaker information is
needed. Current SOTA backbone networks for speaker embedding are designed to
aggregate multi-scale features from an utterance with multi-branch network
architectures for speaker representation. However, naively adding many branches
of multi-scale features with the simple fully convolutional operation could not
efficiently improve the performance due to the rapid increase of model
parameters and computational complexity. Therefore, in the most current
state-of-the-art network architectures, only a few branches corresponding to a
limited number of temporal scales could be designed for speaker embeddings. To
address this problem, in this paper, we propose an effective temporal
multi-scale (TMS) model where multi-scale branches could be efficiently
designed in a speaker embedding network almost without increasing computational
costs. The new model is based on the conventional TDNN, where the network
architecture is smartly separated into two modeling operators: a
channel-modeling operator and a temporal multi-branch modeling operator. Adding
temporal multi-scale in the temporal multi-branch operator needs only a little
bit increase of the number of parameters, and thus save more computational
budget for adding more branches with large temporal scales. Moreover, in the
inference stage, we further developed a systemic re-parameterization method to
convert the TMS-based model into a single-path-based topology in order to
increase inference speed. We investigated the performance of the new TMS method
for automatic speaker verification (ASV) on in-domain and out-of-domain
conditions. Results show that the TMS-based model obtained a significant
increase in the performance over the SOTA ASV models, meanwhile, had a faster
inference speed.]]></summary>

remarkable performance in many real-world applications. However, prevailing
(semi-)supervised graph representation learning models for specific tasks often

recently. In this paper, we comprehensively survey these work in the form of a
series of methods and applications. Specifically, we first introduce FSLG
challenges and bases, then categorize and summarize existing work of FSLG in
terms of three major graph mining tasks at different granularity levels, i.e.,
node, edge, and graph. Finally, we share our thoughts on some future research
directions of FSLG. The authors of this survey have contributed significantly

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, it is arguable that in
traditional CNNs, its pooling layer tends to discard important information such
as positions. Moreover, CNNs are sensitive to rotation and affine
transformation. Capsule network is a data-efficient network design proposed to
overcome such limitations by replacing pooling layers with dynamic routing and
convolutional strides, which aims to preserve the part-whole relationships.
Capsule network has shown a great performance in image recognition and natural
language processing, but applications for medical image segmentation,
particularly volumetric image segmentation, has been limited. In this work, we
propose 3D-UCaps, a 3D voxel-based Capsule network for medical volumetric image
segmentation. We build the concept of capsules into a CNN by designing a
network with two pathways: the first pathway is encoded by 3D Capsule blocks,
whereas the second pathway is decoded by 3D CNNs blocks. 3D-UCaps, therefore
inherits the merits from both Capsule network to preserve the spatial
relationship and CNNs to learn visual representation. We conducted experiments
on various datasets to demonstrate the robustness of 3D-UCaps including
iSeg-2017, LUNA16, Hippocampus, and Cardiac, where our method outperforms
previous Capsule networks and 3D-Unets.]]></summary>

end-to-end using imitation learning. This often requires the use of expert
trajectories and low-level language instructions. Such approaches assume that
neural states will integrate multimodal semantics to perform state tracking,
building spatial memory, exploration, and long-term planning. In contrast, we
propose a modular method with structured representations that (1) builds a
semantic map of the scene and (2) performs exploration with a semantic search
policy, to achieve the natural language goal. Our modular method achieves SOTA
performance (24.46 %) with a substantial (8.17 % absolute) gap from previous
work while using less data by eschewing both expert trajectories and low-level
instructions. Leveraging low-level language, however, can further increase our
performance (26.49 %). Our findings suggest that an explicit spatial memory and
a semantic search policy can provide a stronger and more general representation
for state-tracking and guidance, even in the absence of expert trajectories or

backdoor is inserted into the neural network by poisoning the training dataset,
misclassifying inputs that contain the adversary trigger. The major challenge
for defending against these attacks is that only the attacker knows the secret
trigger and the target class. The problem is further exacerbated by the recent
introduction of "Hidden Triggers", where the triggers are carefully fused into
the input, bypassing detection by human inspection and causing backdoor
identification through anomaly detection to fail. To defend against such
imperceptible attacks, in this work we systematically analyze how
representations, i.e., the set of neuron activations for a given DNN when using
the training data as inputs, are affected by backdoor attacks. We propose
PiDAn, an algorithm based on coherence optimization purifying the poisoned
data. Our analysis shows that representations of poisoned data and authentic
data in the target class are still embedded in different linear subspaces,
which implies that they show different coherence with some latent spaces. Based
on this observation, the proposed PiDAn algorithm learns a sample-wise weight
vector to maximize the projected coherence of weighted samples, where we
demonstrate that the learned weight vector has a natural "grouping effect" and
is distinguishable between authentic data and poisoned data. This enables the
systematic detection and mitigation of backdoor attacks. Based on our
theoretical analysis and experimental results, we demonstrate the effectiveness
of PiDAn in defending against backdoor attacks that use different settings of
poisoned samples on GTSRB and ILSVRC2012 datasets. Our PiDAn algorithm can
detect more than 90% infected classes and identify 95% poisoned samples.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here, we report measurements of detailed dynamic cohesive properties (DCPs)
beyond the dynamic fracture toughness of a bicontinuously nanostructured
copolymer, polyurea, under an extremely loading rate, from deep-learning
analyses of a dynamic big-data-generating experiment. We first describe a new
Dynamic Line-Image Shearing Interferometer (DL-ISI), which uses a streak camera
to record optical fringes of displacement-gradient vs time profile along a line
on sample's rear surface. This system enables us to detect crack initiation and
growth processes in plate-impact experiments. Then, we present a convolutional
neural network (CNN) based deep-learning framework, trained by extensive
finite-element simulations, that inversely determines the accurate DCPs from
the DL-ISI fringe images. For the measurements, plate-impact experiments were
performed on a set of samples with a mid-plane crack. A Conditional Generative
Adversarial Networks (cGAN) was employed first to reconstruct missing DL-ISI
fringes with recorded partial DL-ISI fringes. Then, the CNN and a correlation
method were applied to the fully reconstructed fringes to get the dynamic
fracture toughness, 12.1kJ/m^2, cohesive strength, 302 MPa, and maximum
cohesive separation, 80.5 um, within 0.4%, 2.7%, and 2.2% differences,
respectively. For the first time, the DCPs of polyurea have been successfully
obtained by the DL-ISI with the pre-trained CNN and correlation analyses of
cGAN-reconstructed data sets. The dynamic cohesive strength is found to be
nearly three times higher than the dynamic-failure-initiation strength. The
high dynamic fracture toughness is found to stem from both high dynamic
cohesive strength and high ductility of the dynamic cohesive separation.]]></summary>

that is founded on two distinct principles: (1) mapping value estimates to a
different space using arbitrary functions from a broad class, and (2) linearly
decomposing the reward signal into multiple channels. The first principle
enables incorporating specific properties into the value estimator that can
enhance learning. The second principle, on the other hand, allows for the value
function to be represented as a composition of multiple utility functions. This
can be leveraged for various purposes, e.g. dealing with highly varying reward
scales, incorporating a priori knowledge about the sources of reward, and
ensemble learning. Combining the two principles yields a general blueprint for
instantiating convergent algorithms by orchestrating diverse mapping functions
over multiple reward channels. This blueprint generalizes and subsumes
algorithms such as Q-Learning, Log Q-Learning, and Q-Decomposition. In
addition, our convergence proof for this general class relaxes certain required
assumptions in some of these algorithms. Based on our theory, we discuss
several interesting configurations as special cases. Finally, to illustrate the
potential of the design space that our theory opens up, we instantiate a
particular algorithm and evaluate its performance on the Atari suite.]]></summary>

crucial in the automotive industry. It is therefore inevitable, even at the

assessment quickly becomes expensive. We therefore present a parameterized

aerothermal vehicle simulations. The proposed physics-informed neural network
(PINN) design is aimed at learning families of flow solutions according to a
geometric variation. In scope of this work, we could show that our
nondimensional, multivariate scheme can be efficiently trained to predict the
velocity and pressure distribution for different design scenarios and geometric
scales. The proposed algorithm is based on a parametric minibatch training
which enables the utilization of large datasets necessary for the
three-dimensional flow modeling. Further, we introduce a continuous resampling
algorithm that allows to operate on one static dataset. Every feature of our

prediction of the cosmological framework. It is a promising way to constrain
the nature of dark matter. Here we describe the challenges of detecting stars
whose phase-space distribution may be perturbed by the passage of dark matter
subhalos using a machine learning approach. The training data are three Milky
Way-like galaxies and nine synthetic Gaia DR2 surveys derived from these. We
first quantify the magnitude of the perturbations in the simulated galaxies
using an anomaly detection algorithm. We also estimate the feasibility of this
approach in the Gaia DR2-like catalogues by comparing the anomaly detection
based approach with a supervised classification. We find that a classification
algorithm optimized on about half a billion synthetic star observables exhibits
mild but nonzero sensitivity. This classification-based approach is not
sufficiently sensitive to pinpoint the exact locations of subhalos in the
simulation, as would be expected from the very limited number of subhalos in
the detectable region. The enormous size of the Gaia dataset motivates the
further development of scalable and accurate computational methods that could
be used to select potential regions of interest for dark matter searches to
ultimately constrain the Milky Way's subhalo mass function.]]></summary>

generalization on a diverse set of tasks (Brown et al., 2020). It has been
hypothesized that this is a consequence of implicit multitask learning in
language models' pretraining (Radford et al., 2019). Can zero-shot
generalization instead be directly induced by explicit multitask learning? To
test this question at scale, we develop a system for easily mapping any natural
language tasks into a human-readable prompted form. We convert a large set of
supervised datasets, each with multiple prompts with diverse wording. These
prompted datasets allow for benchmarking the ability of a model to perform
completely held-out tasks. We fine-tune a pretrained encoder-decoder model
(Raffel et al., 2020; Lester et al., 2021) on this multitask mixture covering a
wide variety of tasks. The model attains strong zero-shot performance on
several standard datasets, often outperforming models up to 16x its size.
Further, our approach attains strong performance on a subset of tasks from the
BIG-bench benchmark, outperforming models up to 6x its size. All trained models

leverage the power of supervised machine learning. Active Learning (AL) has
been established as a technique to ameliorate this condition through an
iterative framework that queries a human annotator for labels of instances with
the most uncertain class assignment. Via this mechanism, AL produces a binary
classifier trained on less labeled data but with little, if any, loss in
predictive performance. Despite its advantages, AL can have difficulty with
class-imbalanced datasets and results in an inefficient labeling process. To
address these drawbacks, we investigate our unsupervised instance selection
(UNISEL) technique followed by a Random Forest (RF) classifier on 10 outlier
detection datasets under low-label conditions. These results are compared to AL
performed on the same datasets. Further, we investigate the combination of
UNISEL and AL. Results indicate that UNISEL followed by an RF performs
comparably to AL with an RF and that the combination of UNISEL and AL
demonstrates superior performance. The practical implications of these findings

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reinforcement learning (RL) tasks are typically framed as Markov Decision
Processes (MDPs), assuming that decisions are made at fixed time intervals.
However, many applications of great importance, including healthcare, do not
satisfy this assumption, yet they are commonly modelled as MDPs after an
artificial reshaping of the data. In addition, most healthcare (and similar)
problems are offline by nature, allowing for only retrospective studies. To
address both challenges, we begin by discussing the Semi-MDP (SMDP) framework,
which formally handles actions of variable timings. We next present a formal
way to apply SMDP modifications to nearly any given value-based offline RL
method. We use this theory to introduce three SMDP-based offline RL algorithms,
namely, SDQN, SDDQN, and SBCQ. We then experimentally demonstrate that these
SMDP-based algorithms learn the optimal policy in these variable-time
environments, whereas un-directed modifications of MDP modelling lead to
sub-optimal policies. Finally, we apply our new algorithms to a real-world
offline dataset pertaining to warfarin dosing for stroke prevention and

producing large improvements >18% MSE on the MUDI challenge sub-tasks and
qualitative improvements on downstream processes useful for clinical

We conduct an experiment where humans are virtually immersed in an open field
foraging environment and are trained to collect the highest amount of rewards.
A Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework is introduced to model the human
decision dynamics. Then, Imitation Learning (IL) based on maximum likelihood
estimation is used to train Neural Networks (NN) that map human decisions to
observed states. The results show that passive imitation substantially
underperforms humans. We further refine the human-inspired policies via
Reinforcement Learning (RL), using on-policy algorithms that are more suitable
to learn from pre-trained networks. We show that the combination of IL and RL
can match human results and that good performance strongly depends on an
egocentric representation of the environment. The developed methodology can be
used to efficiently learn policies for unmanned vehicles which have to solve
missions in an open field environment.]]></summary>

neuroimaging fusion learning (HGM). Traditional GNN-based models usually assume
the brain network is a homogeneous graph with single type of nodes and edges.
However, vast literatures have shown the heterogeneity of the human brain
especially between the two hemispheres. Homogeneous brain network is
insufficient to model the complicated brain state. Therefore, in this work we
firstly model the brain network as heterogeneous graph with multi-type nodes
(i.e., left and right hemispheric nodes) and multi-type edges (i.e., intra- and
inter-hemispheric edges). Besides, we also propose a self-supervised
pre-training strategy based on heterogeneou brain network to address the
overfitting problem due to the complex model and small sample size. Our results
on two datasets show the superiority of proposed model over other multimodal
methods for disease prediction task. Besides, ablation experiments show that
our model with pre-training strategy can alleviate the problem of limited
training sample size.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as prominent models for
representation learning on graph structured data. GNNs follow an approach of
message passing analogous to 1-dimensional Weisfeiler Lehman (1-WL) test for
graph isomorphism and consequently are limited by the distinguishing power of
1-WL. More expressive higher-order GNNs which operate on k-tuples of nodes need
increased computational resources in order to process higher-order tensors.
Instead of the WL approach, in this work, we follow the classical approach of
Individualization and Refinement (IR), a technique followed by most practical
isomorphism solvers. Individualization refers to artificially distinguishing a
node in the graph and refinement is the propagation of this information to
other nodes through message passing. We learn to adaptively select nodes to
individualize and to aggregate the resulting graphs after refinement to help
handle the complexity. Our technique lets us learn richer node embeddings while
keeping the computational complexity manageable. Theoretically, we show that
our procedure is more expressive than the 1-WL test. Experiments show that our
method outperforms prominent 1-WL GNN models as well as competitive
higher-order baselines on several benchmark synthetic and real datasets.
Furthermore, our method opens new doors for exploring the paradigm of learning
on graph structures with individualization and refinement.]]></summary>

Convolutional networks are unable to handle sequences of unknown size and their

problems can be solved by formulating convolutional kernels in CNNs as
continuous functions. The resulting Continuous Kernel Convolution (CKConv)
allows us to model arbitrarily long sequences in a parallel manner, within a

Continuous Kernel Convolutional Networks (CKCNNs) obtain state-of-the-art
results in multiple datasets, e.g., permuted MNIST, and, thanks to their
continuous nature, are able to handle non-uniformly sampled datasets and
irregularly-sampled data natively. CKCNNs match or perform better than neural

aggregate behaviours of the brain averaged over many successive experiments or
over long recordings in order to construct robust brain models. These models
are limited in their ability to explain dynamic state changes in the brain
which occurs spontaneously as a result of normal brain function. Hidden Markov
Models (HMMs) trained on neuroimaging time series data have since arisen as a
method to produce dynamical models that are easy to train but can be difficult
to fully parametrise or analyse. We propose an interpretation of these neural
HMMs as multiplex brain state graph models we term Hidden Markov Graph Models
(HMGMs). This interpretation allows for dynamic brain activity to be analysed
using the full repertoire of network analysis techniques. Furthermore, we
propose a general method for selecting HMM hyperparameters in the absence of
external data, based on the principle of maximum entropy, and use this to
select the number of layers in the multiplex model. We produce a new tool for
determining important communities of brain regions using a spatiotemporal
random walk-based procedure that takes advantage of the underlying Markov
structure of the model. Our analysis of real multi-subject fMRI data provides
new results that corroborate the modular processing hypothesis of the brain at
rest as well as contributing new evidence of functional overlap between and
within dynamic brain state communities. Our analysis pipeline provides a way to
characterise dynamic network activity of the brain under novel behaviours or
conditions.]]></summary>

identifying objects detected in both sensors, our pipeline generates a cleaner,
more robust set of pseudo-labels that both demonstrates stronger performance
and stymies single-modality error propagation. Further, we leverage the richer

over-approximations of the output set of feedforward neural networks with input

network within the main network. This ensures that the intersection of the
obtained results is the tightest interval over-approximation of the output of
each layer that can be obtained using mixed-monotonicity on any partial network

of piecewise-affine or monotone activation functions, the main strength of our
approach is its generality: it can handle neural networks with any
Lipschitz-continuous activation function. In addition, the simplicity of our
framework allows users to very easily add unimplemented activation functions,
by simply providing the function, its derivative and the global argmin and
argmax of the derivative. Our algorithm is compared to five other
interval-based tools (Interval Bound Propagation, ReluVal, Neurify, VeriNet,

learning and have made breakthroughs in many sectors owing to their ability to
automatically extract features from unstructured data. However, their
performance relies on manual trial-and-error processes for selecting an
appropriate network architecture, hyperparameters for training, and
pre-/post-procedures. Even though it has been shown that network architecture
plays a critical role in learning feature representation feature from data and
the final performance, searching for the best network architecture is
computationally intensive and heavily relies on researchers' experience.
Automated machine learning (AutoML) and its advanced techniques i.e. Neural
Architecture Search (NAS) have been promoted to address those limitations. Not
only in general computer vision tasks, but NAS has also motivated various
applications in multiple areas including medical imaging. In medical imaging,
NAS has significant progress in improving the accuracy of image classification,
segmentation, reconstruction, and more. However, NAS requires the availability
of large annotated data, considerable computation resources, and pre-defined
tasks. To address such limitations, meta-learning has been adopted in the
scenarios of few-shot learning and multiple tasks. In this book chapter, we
first present a brief review of NAS by discussing well-known approaches in
search space, search strategy, and evaluation strategy. We then introduce
various NAS approaches in medical imaging with different applications such as

NAS for few-shot learning and multiple tasks is then explained. Finally, we

representation from time series data. However, an unsupervised representation
framework that is capable of producing high quality representations could be of
great value. It is key to enabling transfer learning, which is especially
beneficial for medical applications, where there is an abundance of data but
labeling is costly and time consuming. We propose an unsupervised contrastive
learning framework that is motivated from the perspective of label smoothing.
The proposed approach uses a novel contrastive loss that naturally exploits a
data augmentation scheme in which new samples are generated by mixing two data
samples with a mixing component. The task in the proposed framework is to
predict the mixing component, which is utilized as soft targets in the loss
function. Experiments demonstrate the framework's superior performance compared
to other representation learning approaches on both univariate and multivariate
time series and illustrate its benefits for transfer learning for clinical time

infinite-dimensional Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, and (2) the reward
function is nonlinear and can be approximated by neural networks. Our main
results provide sample complexity guarantees that only depend on the effective

recognition (ASR), combining phoneme probabilities from deep neural networks
(DNN) and a performance measure that estimates the word error rate from these
probabilities. This model does not require the clean speech reference nor the
word labels during testing as the ASR decoding step, which finds the most
likely sequence of words given phoneme posterior probabilities, is omitted. The
model is evaluated via the root-mean-squared error between the predicted and
observed speech reception thresholds from eight normal-hearing listeners. The
recognition task consists of identifying noisy words from a German matrix
sentence test. The speech material was mixed with eight noise maskers covering
different modulation types, from speech-shaped stationary noise to a
single-talker masker. The prediction performance is compared to five
established models and an ASR-model using word labels. Two combinations of
features and networks were tested. Both include temporal information either at
the feature level (amplitude modulation filterbanks and a feed-forward network)
or captured by the architecture (mel-spectrograms and a time-delay deep neural
network, TDNN). The TDNN model is on par with the DNN while reducing the number
of parameters by a factor of 37; this optimization allows parallel streams on
dedicated hearing aid hardware as a forward-pass can be computed within the
10ms of each frame. The proposed model performs almost as well as the

community due to their excellent performance in novel view synthesis, geometry
reconstruction, and generative modeling. Some of their advantages are a sound
theoretic foundation and an easy implementation in current deep learning
frameworks. While neural fields have been applied to signals on manifolds,
e.g., for texture reconstruction, their representation has been limited to
extrinsically embedding the shape into Euclidean space. The extrinsic embedding
ignores known intrinsic manifold properties and is inflexible wrt. transfer of
the learned function. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces
intrinsic neural fields, a novel and versatile representation for neural fields
on manifolds. Intrinsic neural fields combine the advantages of neural fields
with the spectral properties of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. We show
theoretically that intrinsic neural fields inherit many desirable properties of
the extrinsic neural field framework but exhibit additional intrinsic
qualities, like isometry invariance. In experiments, we show intrinsic neural
fields can reconstruct high-fidelity textures from images with state-of-the-art
quality and are robust to the discretization of the underlying manifold. We
demonstrate the versatility of intrinsic neural fields by tackling various
applications: texture transfer between deformed shapes & different shapes,
texture reconstruction from real-world images with view dependence, and
discretization-agnostic learning on meshes and point clouds.]]></summary>

computer software. However, it is possible to abuse standardized file formats
by creating a file that is valid in multiple file formats. The resulting
polyglot (many languages) file can confound file format identification,
allowing elements of the file to evade analysis.This is especially problematic
for malware detection systems that rely on file format identification for
feature extraction. File format identification processes that depend on file
signatures can be easily evaded thanks to flexibility in the format
specifications of certain file formats. Although work has been done to identify
file formats using more comprehensive methods than file signatures, accurate
identification of polyglot files remains an open problem. Since malware
detection systems routinely perform file format-specific feature extraction,
polyglot files need to be filtered out prior to ingestion by these systems.
Otherwise, malicious content could pass through undetected. To address the
problem of polyglot detection we assembled a data set using the mitra tool. We
then evaluated the performance of the most commonly used file identification
tool, file. Finally, we demonstrated the accuracy, precision, recall and F1
score of a range of machine and deep learning models. Malconv2 and Catboost
demonstrated the highest recall on our data set with 95.16% and 95.34%,
respectively. These models can be incorporated into a malware detector's file
processing pipeline to filter out potentially malicious polyglots before file
format-dependent feature extraction takes place.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are complex, non-linear, and
non-stationary in nature. However, previous studies that applied decomposition
to minimize the complexity mainly exploited the hand-engineering features,
limiting the information learned in EEG decoding. Therefore, extracting
additional primary features from different disassembled components to improve
the EEG-based recognition performance remains challenging. On the other hand,
attempts have been made to use a single model to learn the hand-engineering
features. Less work has been done to improve the generalization ability through
ensemble learning. In this work, we propose a novel decomposition-based hybrid
ensemble convolutional neural network (CNN) framework to enhance the capability
of decoding EEG signals. CNNs, in particular, automatically learn the primary
features from raw disassembled components but not handcraft features. The first
option is to fuse the obtained score before the Softmax layer and execute
back-propagation on the entire ensemble network, whereas the other is to fuse
the probability output of the Softmax layer. Moreover, a component-specific
batch normalization (CSBN) layer is employed to reduce subject variability.
Against the challenging cross-subject driver fatigue-related situation
awareness (SA) recognition task, eight models are proposed under the framework,
which all showed superior performance than the strong baselines. The
performance of different decomposition methods and ensemble modes were further
compared. Results indicated that discrete wavelet transform (DWT)-based
ensemble CNN achieves the best 82.11% among the proposed models. Our framework
can be simply extended to any CNN architecture and applied in any EEG-related
sectors, opening the possibility of extracting more preliminary information
from complex EEG data.]]></summary>

data, e.g., images and text, to propose a personalization mechanism based on
local memorization. Personalization is obtained interpolating a pre-trained
global model with a $k$-nearest neighbors (kNN) model based on the shared
representation provided by the global model. We provide generalization bounds
for the proposed approach and we show on a suite of federated datasets that
this approach achieves significantly higher accuracy and fairness than
state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

from experts can potentially facilitate a more efficient allocation of
resources; they can help decide when and from whom to seek a second opinion. In
this paper, we look at the design of this type of support systems from the
perspective of counterfactual inference. We focus on a multiclass
classification setting and first show that, if experts make predictions on
their own, the underlying causal mechanism generating their predictions needs
to satisfy a desirable set invariant property. Further, we show that, for any
causal mechanism satisfying this property, there exists an equivalent mechanism
where the predictions by each expert are generated by independent
sub-mechanisms governed by a common noise. This motivates the design of a set
invariant Gumbel-Max structural causal model where the structure of the noise
governing the sub-mechanisms underpinning the model depends on an intuitive
notion of similarity between experts which can be estimated from data.
Experiments on both synthetic and real data show that our model can be used to
infer second opinions more accurately than its non-causal counterpart.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In many prediction problems, spurious correlations are induced by a changing
relationship between the label and a nuisance variable that is also correlated
with the covariates. For example, in classifying animals in natural images, the
background, which is a nuisance, can predict the type of animal. This
nuisance-label relationship does not always hold, and the performance of a
model trained under one such relationship may be poor on data with a different
nuisance-label relationship. To build predictive models that perform well
regardless of the nuisance-label relationship, we develop Nuisance-Randomized
Distillation (NURD). We introduce the nuisance-randomized distribution, a
distribution where the nuisance and the label are independent. Under this
distribution, we define the set of representations such that conditioning on
any member, the nuisance and the label remain independent. We prove that the
representations in this set always perform better than chance, while
representations outside of this set may not. NURD finds a representation from
this set that is most informative of the label under the nuisance-randomized
distribution, and we prove that this representation achieves the highest
performance regardless of the nuisance-label relationship. We evaluate NURD on
several tasks including chest X-ray classification where, using non-lung
patches as the nuisance, NURD produces models that predict pneumonia under
strong spurious correlations.]]></summary>

large-scale machine learning problems has been hampered by its prohibitive
computational cost. The sliced Wasserstein distance and its variants improve
the computational efficiency through the random projection, yet they suffer
from low accuracy if the number of projections is not sufficiently large,
because the majority of projections result in trivially small values. In this
work, we propose a new family of distance metrics, called augmented sliced
Wasserstein distances (ASWDs), constructed by first mapping samples to
higher-dimensional hypersurfaces parameterized by neural networks. It is
derived from a key observation that (random) linear projections of samples
residing on these hypersurfaces would translate to much more flexible nonlinear
projections in the original sample space, so they can capture complex
structures of the data distribution. We show that the hypersurfaces can be
optimized by gradient ascent efficiently. We provide the condition under which
the ASWD is a valid metric and show that this can be obtained by an injective
neural network architecture. Numerical results demonstrate that the ASWD
significantly outperforms other Wasserstein variants for both synthetic and

decision-making problems that are hard to overcome by any single agent in
isolation. However, continual coordination and communication learning between
machine agents or human-machine partnerships remains a challenging open
problem. As a stepping stone toward solving the continual communication
learning problem, in this paper we contribute a multi-faceted study into what
we term Pavlovian signalling -- a process by which learned, temporally extended
predictions made by one agent inform decision-making by another agent with
different perceptual access to their shared environment. We seek to establish
how different temporal processes and representational choices impact Pavlovian
signalling between learning agents. To do so, we introduce a partially
observable decision-making domain we call the Frost Hollow. In this domain a
prediction learning agent and a reinforcement learning agent are coupled into a
two-part decision-making system that seeks to acquire sparse reward while
avoiding time-conditional hazards. We evaluate two domain variations: 1)
machine prediction and control learning in a linear walk, and 2) a prediction
learning machine interacting with a human participant in a virtual reality
environment. Our results showcase the speed of learning for Pavlovian
signalling, the impact that different temporal representations do (and do not)
have on agent-agent coordination, and how temporal aliasing impacts agent-agent
and human-agent interactions differently. As a main contribution, we establish
Pavlovian signalling as a natural bridge between fixed signalling paradigms and
fully adaptive communication learning. Our results therefore point to an
actionable, constructivist path towards continual communication learning
between reinforcement learning agents, with potential impact in a range of
real-world settings.]]></summary>

into general clustering tasks is an attractive problem. In this paper, we
propose a graph auto-encoder for general data clustering, which constructs the
graph adaptively according to the generative perspective of graphs. The
adaptive process is designed to induce the model to exploit the high-level
information behind data and utilize the non-Euclidean structure sufficiently.
We further design a novel mechanism with rigorous analysis to avoid the
collapse caused by the adaptive construction. Via combining the generative
model for network embedding and graph-based clustering, a graph auto-encoder
with a novel decoder is developed such that it performs well in weighted graph

(RL) algorithms is a key enabler of the tremendous success of modern RL. Among
many asynchronous RL algorithms, arguably the most popular and effective one is
the asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) algorithm. Although A3C is
becoming the workhorse of RL, its theoretical properties are still not
well-understood, including its non-asymptotic analysis and the performance gain
of parallelism (a.k.a. linear speedup). This paper revisits the A3C algorithm
and establishes its non-asymptotic convergence guarantees. Under both i.i.d.
and Markovian sampling, we establish the local convergence guarantee for A3C in
the general policy approximation case and the global convergence guarantee in
softmax policy parameterization. Under i.i.d. sampling, A3C obtains sample
complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2.5}/N)$ per worker to achieve $\epsilon$
accuracy, where $N$ is the number of workers. Compared to the best-known sample
complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2.5})$ for two-timescale AC, A3C achieves
\emph{linear speedup}, which justifies the advantage of parallelism and
asynchrony in AC algorithms theoretically for the first time. Numerical tests
on synthetic environment, OpenAI Gym environments and Atari games have been

incoming demand for jobs. Since limited jobs are available for training, and it
is usually not necessary to train all workers, efficient matching of training
jobs requires prioritizing fast learners over slow ones. However, the learning
rates of novice workers are unknown, resulting in a tradeoff between
exploration (learning the learning rates) and exploitation (training the best
workers). Motivated to study this tradeoff, we analyze a novel objective within
the stochastic multi-armed bandit framework. Given $K$ arms, instead of
maximizing the expected total reward from $T$ pulls (the traditional "sum"
objective), we consider the vector of cumulative rewards earned from the $K$
arms at the end of $T$ pulls and aim to maximize the expected highest
cumulative reward (the "max" objective). When rewards represent skill
increments, this corresponds to the objective of training a single highly
skilled worker from a set of novice workers, using a limited supply of training
jobs. For this objective, we show that any policy must incur an
instance-dependent asymptotic regret of $\Omega(\log T)$ (with a higher
instance-dependent constant) and a worst-case regret of
$\Omega(K^{1/3}T^{2/3})$. We then design an explore-then-commit policy
featuring exploration based on appropriately tuned confidence bounds on the
mean reward and an adaptive stopping criterion, which adapts to the problem
difficulty and achieves these bounds (up to logarithmic factors). We generalize
our algorithmic insights to the problem of maximizing the expected value of the
average cumulative reward of the top $m$ arms with the highest cumulative
rewards, corresponding to the case where multiple workers must be trained. Our
numerical experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our policies compared to

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Image super-resolution (SR) techniques are used to generate a high-resolution
image from a low-resolution image. Until now, deep generative models such as
autoregressive models and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have proven to
be effective at modelling high-resolution images. Models based on Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) have often been criticized for their feeble generative
performance, but with new advancements such as VDVAE (very deep VAE), there is
now strong evidence that deep VAEs have the potential to outperform current
state-of-the-art models for high-resolution image generation. In this paper, we
introduce VDVAE-SR, a new model that aims to exploit the most recent deep VAE
methodologies to improve upon image super-resolution using transfer learning on
pretrained VDVAEs. Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we show
that the proposed model is competitive with other state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

binary classification, in which $k$ binary predictions are made simultaneously
and the error is judged by a submodular set function. Despite its wide usage in
image segmentation and related problems, its consistency has remained open. We
resolve this open question, showing that the Lov\'asz hinge is inconsistent for
its desired target unless the set function is modular. Leveraging a recent
embedding framework, we instead derive the target loss for which the Lov\'asz
hinge is consistent. This target, which we call the structured abstain problem,
allows one to abstain on any subset of the $k$ predictions. We derive two link
functions, each of which are consistent for all submodular set functions
simultaneously.]]></summary>

classification task) between a mobile device and a more powerful edge server. A
simple alternative to splitting the network is to carry out the supervised task
purely on the edge server while compressing and transmitting the full data, and
most approaches have barely outperformed this baseline. This paper proposes a
new approach for discretizing and entropy-coding intermediate feature
activations to efficiently transmit them from the mobile device to the edge
server. We show that a efficient splittable network architecture results from a
three-way tradeoff between (a) minimizing the computation on the mobile device,
(b) minimizing the size of the data to be transmitted, and (c) maximizing the
model's prediction performance. We propose an architecture based on this
tradeoff and train the splittable network and entropy model in a knowledge
distillation framework. In an extensive set of experiments involving three
vision tasks, three datasets, nine baselines, and more than 180 trained models,
we show that our approach improves supervised rate-distortion tradeoffs while
maintaining a considerably smaller encoder size. We also release sc2bench, an
installable Python package, to encourage and facilitate future studies on
supervised compression for split computing (SC2).]]></summary>

received considerable research efforts. The intensity of the pandemic on a
given territory is efficiently measured by the reproduction number, quantifying
the rate of growth of daily new infections. Recently, estimates for the time
evolution of the reproduction number were produced using an inverse problem
formulation with a nonsmooth functional minimization. While it was designed to
be robust to the limited quality of the Covid19 data (outliers, missing
counts), the procedure lacks the ability to output credibility interval based
estimates. This remains a severe limitation for practical use in actual
pandemic monitoring by epidemiologists that the present work aims to overcome
by use of Monte Carlo sampling. After interpretation of the functional into a
Bayesian framework, several sampling schemes are tailored to adjust the
nonsmooth nature of the resulting posterior distribution. The originality of
the devised algorithms stems from combining a Langevin Monte Carlo sampling
scheme with Proximal operators. Performance of the new algorithms in producing
relevant credibility intervals for the reproduction number estimates and
denoised counts are compared. Assessment is conducted on real daily new
infection counts made available by the Johns Hopkins University. The interest
of the devised monitoring tools are illustrated on Covid19 data from several
different countries.]]></summary>

with a regularization term for promoting desired structures. RMDA does not
incur computation additional to proximal SGD with momentum, and achieves
variance reduction without requiring the objective function to be of the

optimization, we prove that after a finite number of iterations, all iterates
of RMDA possess a desired structure identical to that induced by the
regularizer at the stationary point of asymptotic convergence, even in the
presence of engineering tricks like data augmentation and dropout that
complicate the training process. Experiments on training NNs with structured
sparsity confirm that variance reduction is necessary for such an
identification, and show that RMDA thus significantly outperforms existing
methods for this task. For unstructured sparsity, RMDA also outperforms a
state-of-the-art pruning method, validating the benefits of training structured

calibrates its confidence. Deviations of this idealistic map from the identity
map reveal miscalibration. Such calibration errors can be reduced with many
post-hoc calibration methods which fit some family of calibration maps on a
validation dataset. In contrast, evaluation of calibration with the expected
calibration error (ECE) on the test set does not explicitly involve fitting.
However, as we demonstrate, ECE can still be viewed as if fitting a family of
functions on the test data. This motivates the fit-on-the-test view on
evaluation: first, approximate a calibration map on the test data, and second,
quantify its distance from the identity. Exploiting this view allows us to
unlock missed opportunities: (1) use the plethora of post-hoc calibration
methods for evaluating calibration; (2) tune the number of bins in ECE with
cross-validation. Furthermore, we introduce: (3) benchmarking on pseudo-real
data where the true calibration map can be estimated very precisely; and (4)
novel calibration and evaluation methods using new calibration map families PL

learning on graph-structured data, in large part due to their simplicity and
scalability. Unfortunately, it was shown that these architectures are limited
in their expressive power. This paper proposes a novel framework called
Equivariant Subgraph Aggregation Networks (ESAN) to address this issue. Our
main observation is that while two graphs may not be distinguishable by an
MPNN, they often contain distinguishable subgraphs. Thus, we propose to
represent each graph as a set of subgraphs derived by some predefined policy,
and to process it using a suitable equivariant architecture. We develop novel
variants of the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman (1-WL) test for graph
isomorphism, and prove lower bounds on the expressiveness of ESAN in terms of
these new WL variants. We further prove that our approach increases the
expressive power of both MPNNs and more expressive architectures. Moreover, we
provide theoretical results that describe how design choices such as the
subgraph selection policy and equivariant neural architecture affect our
architecture's expressive power. To deal with the increased computational cost,
we propose a subgraph sampling scheme, which can be viewed as a stochastic
version of our framework. A comprehensive set of experiments on real and
synthetic datasets demonstrates that our framework improves the expressive
power and overall performance of popular GNN architectures.]]></summary>

with just a few labeled examples by transferring previously learned knowledge.
However, the bottleneck of current meta-learning algorithms is the requirement
of a large number of meta-training tasks, which may not be accessible in
real-world scenarios. To address the challenge that available tasks may not
densely sample the space of tasks, we propose to augment the task set through
interpolation. By meta-learning with task interpolation (MLTI), our approach
effectively generates additional tasks by randomly sampling a pair of tasks and
interpolating the corresponding features and labels. Under both gradient-based
and metric-based meta-learning settings, our theoretical analysis shows MLTI
corresponds to a data-adaptive meta-regularization and further improves the
generalization. Empirically, in our experiments on eight datasets from diverse
domains including image recognition, pose prediction, molecule property

MLTI framework is compatible with representative meta-learning algorithms and
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art strategies.]]></summary>

(GNNs) is faced with a challenge uncommon in general neural networks: creating
mini-batches requires a lot of computation and data movement due to the
exponential growth of multi-hop graph neighborhoods along network layers. Such
a unique challenge gives rise to a diverse set of system design choices. We
argue in favor of performing mini-batch training with neighborhood sampling in
a distributed multi-GPU environment, under which we identify major performance
bottlenecks hitherto under-explored by developers: mini-batch preparation and
transfer. We present a sequence of improvements to mitigate these bottlenecks,
including a performance-engineered neighborhood sampler, a shared-memory
parallelization strategy, and the pipelining of batch transfer with GPU
computation. We also conduct an empirical analysis that supports the use of
sampling for inference, showing that test accuracies are not materially
compromised. Such an observation unifies training and inference, simplifying
model implementation. We report comprehensive experimental results with several
benchmark data sets and GNN architectures, including a demonstration that, for
the ogbn-papers100M data set, our system SALIENT achieves a speedup of 3x over
a standard PyTorch-Geometric implementation with a single GPU and a further 8x
parallel speedup with 16 GPUs. Therein, training a 3-layer GraphSAGE model with

increases model's adversarial robustness to adversarial attacks while
maintaining high clean accuracy by combining contrastive learning (CL) with

under both data augmentations and adversarial perturbations. We leverage
contrastive learning to improve adversarial robustness by considering an
adversarial example as another positive example, and aim to maximize the
similarity between random augmentations of data samples and their adversarial
example, while constantly updating the classification head in order to avoid a
cognitive dissociation between the classification head and the embedding space.
This dissociation is caused by the fact that CL updates the network up to the
embedding space, while freezing the classification head which is used to
generate new positive adversarial examples. We validate our method, Contrastive
Learning with Adversarial Features(CLAF), on the CIFAR-10 dataset on which it
outperforms both robust accuracy and clean accuracy over alternative supervised

techniques, many classical methods such as k-means, decision tree, and SVM have
been used in automatic sleep stage classification. However, few methods explore
deep learning on ASSC. Meanwhile, most deep learning methods require extensive
expertise and suffer from a mass of handcrafted steps which are time-consuming
especially when dealing with multi-classification tasks. In this paper, we
propose an efficient five-sleep-stage classification method using convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) with a novel data processing trick and we design neural
architecture search (NAS) technique based on genetic algorithm (GA), NAS-G, to
search for the best CNN architecture. Firstly, we attach each kernel with an
adaptive coefficient to enhance the signal processing of the inputs. This can
enhance the propagation of informative features and suppress the propagation of
useless features in the early stage of the network. Then, we make full use of
GA's heuristic search and the advantage of no need for the gradient to search
for the best architecture of CNN. This can achieve a CNN with better
performance than a handcrafted one in a large search space at the minimum cost.
We verify the convergence of our data processing trick and compare the
performance of traditional CNNs before and after using our trick. Meanwhile, we
compare the performance between the CNN generated through NAS-G and the
traditional CNNs with our trick. The experiments demonstrate that the
convergence of CNNs with data processing trick is faster than without data
processing trick and the CNN with data processing trick generated by NAS-G
outperforms the handcrafted counterparts that use the data processing trick
too.]]></summary>

behaviour in many diverse situations through data efficient, generalisable and
transferable skill acquisition. It is believed that learning "good" sensory
representations is important for enabling this, however there is little
agreement as to what a good representation should look like. In this review
article we are going to argue that symmetry transformations are a fundamental
principle that can guide our search for what makes a good representation. The
idea that there exist transformations (symmetries) that affect some aspects of
the system but not others, and their relationship to conserved quantities has
become central in modern physics, resulting in a more unified theoretical
framework and even ability to predict the existence of new particles. Recently,
symmetries have started to gain prominence in machine learning too, resulting
in more data efficient and generalisable algorithms that can mimic some of the
complex behaviours produced by biological intelligence. Finally, first
demonstrations of the importance of symmetry transformations for representation
learning in the brain are starting to arise in neuroscience. Taken together,
the overwhelming positive effect that symmetries bring to these disciplines
suggest that they may be an important general framework that determines the
structure of the universe, constrains the nature of natural tasks and
consequently shapes both biological and artificial intelligence.]]></summary>

the popular cell-based search spaces and find that the existing search spaces
contain a high degree of redundancy: the architecture performance is minimally
sensitive to changes at large parts of the cells, and universally adopted
designs, like the explicit search for a reduction cell, significantly increase
the complexities but have very limited impact on the performance. Across
architectures found by a diverse set of search strategies, we consistently find
that the parts of the cells that do matter for architecture performance often
follow similar and simple patterns. By explicitly constraining cells to include
these patterns, randomly sampled architectures can match or even outperform the

approaches for few-shot learning. However, due to the non-convexity of deep

properties of MAML with DNNs remain largely unknown. In this paper, we first
prove that MAML with over-parameterized DNNs is guaranteed to converge to
global optima at a linear rate. Our convergence analysis indicates that MAML
with over-parameterized DNNs is equivalent to kernel regression with a novel
class of kernels, which we name as Meta Neural Tangent Kernels (MetaNTK). Then,
we propose MetaNTK-NAS, a new training-free neural architecture search (NAS)
method for few-shot learning that uses MetaNTK to rank and select

methods on two popular few-shot learning benchmarks, miniImageNet, and
tieredImageNet. We show that the performance of MetaNTK-NAS is comparable or

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In clinics, doctors rely on electrocardiograms (ECGs) to assess severe
cardiac disorders. Owing to the development of technology and the increase in
health awareness, ECG signals are currently obtained by using medical and
commercial devices. Deep neural networks (DNNs) can be used to analyze these
signals because of their high accuracy rate. However, researchers have found
that adversarial attacks can significantly reduce the accuracy of DNNs. Studies
have been conducted to defend ECG-based DNNs against traditional adversarial
attacks, such as projected gradient descent (PGD), and smooth adversarial
perturbation (SAP) which targets ECG classification; however, to the best of
our knowledge, no study has completely explored the defense against adversarial
attacks targeting ECG classification. Thus, we did different experiments to
explore the effects of defense methods against white-box adversarial attack and
black-box adversarial attack targeting ECG classification, and we found that
some common defense methods performed well against these attacks. Besides, we
proposed a new defense method called Adversarial Distillation Training (ADT)
which comes from defensive distillation and can effectively improve the
generalization performance of DNNs. The results show that our method performed
more effectively against adversarial attacks targeting on ECG classification
than the other baseline methods, namely, adversarial training, defensive
distillation, Jacob regularization, and noise-to-signal ratio regularization.
Furthermore, we found that our method performed better against PGD attacks with
low noise levels, which means that our method has stronger robustness.]]></summary>

standard for one-class classification where the learning task entails inferring
the smallest hyper-sphere to enclose target objects while linearly penalising
any errors/slacks via an $\ell_1$-norm penalty term. In this study, we
generalise this modelling formalism to a general $\ell_p$-norm ($p\geq1$) slack
penalty function. By virtue of an $\ell_p$ slack norm, the proposed approach
enables formulating a non-linear cost function with respect to slacks. From a
dual problem perspective, the proposed method introduces a sparsity-inducing
dual norm into the objective function, and thus, possesses a higher capacity to
tune into the inherent sparsity of the problem for enhanced descriptive
capability. A theoretical analysis based on Rademacher complexities
characterises the generalisation performance of the proposed approach in terms
of parameter $p$ while the experimental results on several datasets confirm the
merits of the proposed method compared to other alternatives.]]></summary>

memory and less time. However, we pay a price for the savings: lower precision
may yield larger round-off error and hence larger prediction error. As
applications proliferate, users must choose which precision to use to train a
new model, and chip manufacturers must decide which precisions to manufacture.
We view these precision choices as a hyperparameter tuning problem, and borrow
ideas from meta-learning to learn the tradeoff between memory and error. In
this paper, we introduce Pareto Estimation to Pick the Perfect Precision

chemistry domain, due to its close connection with molecular graphs. Most GNN
models collect and update atom and molecule features from the fed atom (and, in
some cases, bond) features, which are basically based on the two-dimensional
(2D) graph representation of 3D molecules. Correspondingly, the adjacency
matrix, containing the information on covalent bonds, or equivalent data
structures (e.g., lists) have been the main core in the feature-updating
processes, such as graph convolution. However, the 2D-based models do not
faithfully represent 3D molecules and their physicochemical properties,
exemplified by the overlooked field effect that is a "through-space" effect,
not a "through-bond" effect. The GNN model proposed herein, denoted as MolNet,
is chemically intuitive, accommodating the 3D non-bond information in a
molecule, with a noncovalent adjacency matrix $\bf{\bar A}$, and also
bond-strength information from a weighted bond matrix $\bf{B}$. The noncovalent
atoms, not directly bonded to a given atom in a molecule, are identified within
5 $\unicode{x212B}$ of cut-off range for the construction of $\bf{\bar A}$, and
$\bf{B}$ has edge weights of 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 for single, aromatic, double, and
triple bonds, respectively. Comparative studies show that MolNet outperforms
various baseline GNN models and gives a state-of-the-art performance in the
classification task of BACE dataset and regression task of ESOL dataset. This
work suggests a future direction of deep-learning chemistry in the construction
of deep-learning models that are chemically intuitive and comparable with the

automating and accelerating the optimization procedure for complicated tasks.
Existing L2O models parameterize optimization rules by neural networks, and
learn those numerical rules via meta-training. However, they face two common
pitfalls: (1) scalability: the numerical rules represented by neural networks
create extra memory overhead for applying L2O models, and limit their
applicability to optimizing larger tasks; (2) interpretability: it is unclear
what an L2O model has learned in its black-box optimization rule, nor is it
straightforward to compare different L2O models in an explainable way. To avoid
both pitfalls, this paper proves the concept that we can "kill two birds by one
stone", by introducing the powerful tool of symbolic regression to L2O. In this
paper, we establish a holistic symbolic representation and analysis framework
for L2O, which yields a series of insights for learnable optimizers. Leveraging
our findings, we further propose a lightweight L2O model that can be
meta-trained on large-scale problems and outperformed human-designed and tuned
optimizers. Our work is set to supply a brand-new perspective to L2O research.

technological applications. For example, photoisomerization can allow a drug
with a photo-switchable scaffold such as azobenzene to be activated with light.
In principle, photoswitches with desired photophysical properties like high
isomerization quantum yields can be identified through virtual screening with
reactive simulations. In practice, these simulations are rarely used for
screening, since they require hundreds of trajectories and expensive quantum
chemical methods to account for non-adiabatic excited state effects. Here we
introduce a diabatic artificial neural network (DANN) based on diabatic states
to accelerate such simulations for azobenzene derivatives. The network is six
orders of magnitude faster than the quantum chemistry method used for training.
DANN is transferable to azobenzene molecules outside the training set,
predicting quantum yields for unseen species that are correlated with
experiment. We use the model to virtually screen 3,100 hypothetical molecules,
and identify novel species with extremely high predicted quantum yields. The
model predictions are confirmed using high accuracy non-adiabatic dynamics. Our
results pave the way for fast and accurate virtual screening of photoactive

(CNNs). Inspired by recent advances of vision transformers (ViTs), in this
paper, we demonstrate that using a few large convolutional kernels instead of a
stack of small kernels could be a more powerful paradigm. We suggested five
guidelines, e.g., applying re-parameterized large depth-wise convolutions, to
design efficient high-performance large-kernel CNNs. Following the guidelines,
we propose RepLKNet, a pure CNN architecture whose kernel size is as large as
31x31, in contrast to commonly used 3x3. RepLKNet greatly closes the
performance gap between CNNs and ViTs, e.g., achieving comparable or superior
results than Swin Transformer on ImageNet and a few typical downstream tasks,
with lower latency. RepLKNet also shows nice scalability to big data and large
models, obtaining 87.8% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet and 56.0% mIoU on ADE20K,
which is very competitive among the state-of-the-arts with similar model sizes.

data efficiency through attribute surrogates learning and spectral tokens
pooling. Vision transformers have recently been thought of as a promising
alternative to convolutional neural networks for visual recognition. But when
there is no sufficient data, it gets stuck in overfitting and shows inferior
performance. To improve data efficiency, we propose hierarchically cascaded
transformers that exploit intrinsic image structures through spectral tokens
pooling and optimize the learnable parameters through latent attribute
surrogates. The intrinsic image structure is utilized to reduce the ambiguity
between foreground content and background noise by spectral tokens pooling. And
the attribute surrogate learning scheme is designed to benefit from the rich
visual information in image-label pairs instead of simple visual concepts
assigned by their labels. Our Hierarchically Cascaded Transformers, called
HCTransformers, is built upon a self-supervised learning framework DINO and is
tested on several popular few-shot learning benchmarks.

In the inductive setting, HCTransformers surpass the DINO baseline by a large
margin of 9.7% 5-way 1-shot accuracy and 9.17% 5-way 5-shot accuracy on
miniImageNet, which demonstrates HCTransformers are efficient to extract
discriminative features. Also, HCTransformers show clear advantages over SOTA
few-shot classification methods in both 5-way 1-shot and 5-way 5-shot settings
on four popular benchmark datasets, including miniImageNet, tieredImageNet,
FC100, and CIFAR-FS. The trained weights and codes are available at

with a few target images to generate images of a novel domain. Unfortunately,
these methods often suffer from overfitting or under-fitting when fine-tuned
with a single target image. To address this, here we present a novel
single-shot GAN adaptation method through unified CLIP space manipulations.
Specifically, our model employs a two-step training strategy: reference image
search in the source generator using a CLIP-guided latent optimization,
followed by generator fine-tuning with a novel loss function that imposes CLIP
space consistency between the source and adapted generators. To further improve
the adapted model to produce spatially consistent samples with respect to the
source generator, we also propose contrastive regularization for patchwise
relationships in the CLIP space. Experimental results show that our model
generates diverse outputs with the target texture and outperforms the baseline
models both qualitatively and quantitatively. Furthermore, we show that our
CLIP space manipulation strategy allows more effective attribute editing.]]></summary>

applications of machine learning and statistics, with maximum likelihood
estimation routinely used to select appropriate parameters for the covariance
kernel. However, it remains an open problem to establish the circumstances in
which maximum likelihood estimation is well-posed. That is, when the
predictions of the regression model are continuous (or insensitive to small
perturbations) in the training data. This article presents a rigorous proof
that the maximum likelihood estimator fails to be well-posed in Hellinger
distance in a scenario where the data are noiseless. The failure case occurs
for any Gaussian process with a stationary covariance function whose
lengthscale parameter is estimated using maximum likelihood. Although the
failure of maximum likelihood estimation is informally well-known, these
theoretical results appear to be the first of their kind, and suggest that
well-posedness may need to be assessed post-hoc, on a case-by-case basis, when
maximum likelihood estimation is used to train a Gaussian process model.]]></summary>

Hard Thresholding (IHT) algorithm widely used for sparse recovery problems. The
parameter estimation and sparsity recovery consistency of IHT has long been
known in compressed sensing. From the perspective of statistical learning,
another fundamental question is how well the IHT estimation would predict on
unseen data. This paper makes progress towards answering this open question by
introducing a novel sparse generalization theory for IHT under the notion of
algorithmic stability. Our theory reveals that: 1) under natural conditions on
the empirical risk function over $n$ samples of dimension $p$, IHT with
sparsity level $k$ enjoys an $\mathcal{\tilde
O}(n^{-1/2}\sqrt{k\log(n)\log(p)})$ rate of convergence in sparse excess risk;
2) a tighter $\mathcal{\tilde O}(n^{-1/2}\sqrt{\log(n)})$ bound can be
established by imposing an additional iteration stability condition on a
hypothetical IHT procedure invoked to the population risk; and 3) a fast rate
of order $\mathcal{\tilde O}\left(n^{-1}k(\log^3(n)+\log(p))\right)$ can be
derived for strongly convex risk function under proper strong-signal
conditions. The results have been substantialized to sparse linear regression
and sparse logistic regression models to demonstrate the applicability of our

is the central challenge to learning. In order for complexity-efficient models
to exist and be discoverable in high dimensions, we require a computational
framework that relates a credible notion of complexity to simple parameter
representations. Further, this framework must allow excess complexity to be
gradually removed via gradient-based optimization. Our n-ary, or n-argument,
activation functions fill this gap by approximating belief functions
(probabilistic Boolean logic) using logit representations of probability. Just
as Boolean logic determines the truth of a consequent claim from relationships
among a set of antecedent propositions, probabilistic formulations generalize
predictions when antecedents, truth tables, and consequents all retain
uncertainty. Our activation functions demonstrate the ability to learn
arbitrary logic, such as the binary exclusive disjunction (p xor q) and ternary
conditioned disjunction ( c ? p : q ), in a single layer using an activation
function of matching or greater arity. Further, we represent belief tables
using a basis that directly associates the number of nonzero parameters to the
effective arity of the belief function, thus capturing a concrete relationship
between logical complexity and efficient parameter representations. This opens
optimization approaches to reduce logical complexity by inducing parameter
sparsity.]]></summary>

outstanding contribution to the development of many deep learning research
fields. Recently, researchers in the acoustic signal processing field noticed
its success and leveraged contrastive learning for better music representation.
Typically, existing approaches maximize the similarity between two distorted
audio segments sampled from the same music. In other words, they ensure a
semantic agreement at the music level. However, those coarse-grained methods
neglect some inessential or noisy elements at the frame level, which may be
detrimental to the model to learn the effective representation of music.
Towards this end, this paper proposes a novel Positive-nEgative frame mask for
Music Representation based on the contrastive learning framework, abbreviated
as PEMR. Concretely, PEMR incorporates a Positive-Negative Mask Generation
module, which leverages transformer blocks to generate frame masks on the
Log-Mel spectrogram. We can generate self-augmented negative and positive
samples by masking important components or inessential components,
respectively. We devise a novel contrastive learning objective to accommodate
both self-augmented positives/negatives sampled from the same music. We conduct
experiments on four public datasets. The experimental results of two
music-related downstream tasks, music classification, and cover song
identification, demonstrate the generalization ability and transferability of
music representation learned by PEMR.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When designing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), one must select the
size\break of the convolutional kernels before training. Recent works show CNNs
benefit from different kernel sizes at different layers, but exploring all
possible combinations is unfeasible in practice. A more efficient approach is
to learn the kernel size during training. However, existing works that learn
the kernel size have a limited bandwidth. These approaches scale kernels by
dilation, and thus the detail they can describe is limited. In this work, we
propose FlexConv, a novel convolutional operation with which high bandwidth
convolutional kernels of learnable kernel size can be learned at a fixed
parameter cost. FlexNets model long-term dependencies without the use of
pooling, achieve state-of-the-art performance on several sequential datasets,
outperform recent works with learned kernel sizes, and are competitive with
much deeper ResNets on image benchmark datasets. Additionally, FlexNets can be
deployed at higher resolutions than those seen during training. To avoid
aliasing, we propose a novel kernel parameterization with which the frequency
of the kernels can be analytically controlled. Our novel kernel
parameterization shows higher descriptive power and faster convergence speed
than existing parameterizations. This leads to important improvements in
classification accuracy.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tensor completion is a fundamental tool for incomplete data analysis, where
the goal is to predict missing entries from partial observations. However,
existing methods often make the explicit or implicit assumption that the
observed entries are noise-free to provide a theoretical guarantee of exact
recovery of missing entries, which is quite restrictive in practice. To remedy
such drawbacks, this paper proposes a novel noisy tensor completion model,
which complements the incompetence of existing works in handling the
degeneration of high-order and noisy observations. Specifically, the tensor
ring nuclear norm (TRNN) and least-squares estimator are adopted to regularize
the underlying tensor and the observed entries, respectively. In addition, a
non-asymptotic upper bound of estimation error is provided to depict the
statistical performance of the proposed estimator. Two efficient algorithms are
developed to solve the optimization problem with convergence guarantee, one of
which is specially tailored to handle large-scale tensors by replacing the
minimization of TRNN of the original tensor equivalently with that of a much
smaller one in a heterogeneous tensor decomposition framework. Experimental
results on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of the proposed model in recovering noisy incomplete tensor data
compared with state-of-the-art tensor completion models.]]></summary>

engineering design process and improve access to highly optimized and
customized products across countless industries. Successfully adapting
generative Machine Learning to design engineering may enable such automated
design synthesis and is a research subject of great importance. We present a
review and analysis of Deep Generative Machine Learning models in engineering
design. Deep Generative Models (DGMs) typically leverage deep networks to learn
from an input dataset and synthesize new designs. Recently, DGMs such as
feedforward Neural Networks (NNs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and certain Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
frameworks have shown promising results in design applications like structural
optimization, materials design, and shape synthesis. The prevalence of DGMs in
engineering design has skyrocketed since 2016. Anticipating continued growth,
we conduct a review of recent advances to benefit researchers interested in
DGMs for design. We structure our review as an exposition of the algorithms,
datasets, representation methods, and applications commonly used in the current
literature. In particular, we discuss key works that have introduced new
techniques and methods in DGMs, successfully applied DGMs to a design-related
domain, or directly supported the development of DGMs through datasets or
auxiliary methods. We further identify key challenges and limitations currently
seen in DGMs across design fields, such as design creativity, handling
constraints and objectives, and modeling both form and functional performance
simultaneously. In our discussion, we identify possible solution pathways as
key areas on which to target future work.]]></summary>

backbone for representation and a linear classifier to output the logit of each
class. A recent study has shown a phenomenon called neural collapse that the
within-class means of features and the classifier vectors converge to the
vertices of a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF) at the terminal phase of
training on a balanced dataset. Since the ETF geometric structure maximally
separates the pair-wise angles of all classes in the classifier, it is natural
to raise the question, why do we spend an effort to learn a classifier when we
know its optimal geometric structure? In this paper, we study the potential of
learning a neural network for classification with the classifier randomly
initialized as an ETF and fixed during training. Our analytical work based on
the layer-peeled model indicates that the feature learning with a fixed ETF
classifier naturally leads to the neural collapse state even when the dataset
is imbalanced among classes. We further show that in this case the cross
entropy (CE) loss is not necessary and can be replaced by a simple squared loss
that shares the same global optimality but enjoys a more accurate gradient and
better convergence property. Our experimental results show that our method is
able to achieve similar performances on image classification for balanced
datasets, and bring significant improvements in the long-tailed and
fine-grained classification tasks.]]></summary>

systematically investigate the robustness of vision transformers to spurious
correlations on three challenging benchmark datasets and compare their
performance with popular CNNs. Our study reveals that when pre-trained on a
sufficiently large dataset, ViT models are more robust to spurious correlations
than CNNs. Key to their success is the ability to generalize better from the
examples where spurious correlations do not hold. Further, we perform extensive
ablations and experiments to understand the role of the self-attention
mechanism in providing robustness under spuriously correlated environments. We

improve adversarial robustness, where data closer to the current decision
boundaries are regarded as more critical and given larger weights. However,
existing methods measuring the closeness are not very reliable: they are
discrete and can take only a few values, and they are path-dependent, i.e.,
they may change given the same start and end points with different attack
paths. In this paper, we propose three types of probabilistic margin (PM),
which are continuous and path-independent, for measuring the aforementioned
closeness and reweighting adversarial data. Specifically, a PM is defined as
the difference between two estimated class-posterior probabilities, e.g., such
the probability of the true label minus the probability of the most confusing
label given some natural data. Though different PMs capture different geometric
properties, all three PMs share a negative correlation with the vulnerability
of data: data with larger/smaller PMs are safer/riskier and should have
smaller/larger weights. Experiments demonstrate that PMs are reliable
measurements and PM-based reweighting methods outperform state-of-the-art

and the interdependencies across those modes exist. This means that the travel
demand across different travel modes could be correlated as one mode may
receive demand from or create demand for another mode, not to mention natural
correlations between different demand time series due to general demand flow
patterns across the network. It is expectable that cross-modal ripple effects
become more prevalent, with Mobility as a Service. Therefore, by propagating
demand data across modes, a better demand prediction could be obtained. To this
end, this study explores various machine learning models and transfer learning
strategies for cross-modal demand prediction. The trip data of bike-share,
metro, and taxi are processed as the station-level passenger flows, and then
the proposed prediction method is tested in the large-scale case studies of
Nanjing and Chicago. The results suggest that prediction models with transfer
learning perform better than unimodal prediction models. Furthermore, stacked
Long Short-Term Memory model performs particularly well in cross-modal demand

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The transferability of adversarial examples allows the deception on black-box
models, and transfer-based targeted attacks have attracted a lot of interest
due to their practical applicability. To maximize the transfer success rate,
adversarial examples should avoid overfitting to the source model, and image
augmentation is one of the primary approaches for this. However, prior works
utilize simple image transformations such as resizing, which limits input
diversity. To tackle this limitation, we propose the object-based diverse input
(ODI) method that draws an adversarial image on a 3D object and induces the
rendered image to be classified as the target class. Our motivation comes from
the humans' superior perception of an image printed on a 3D object. If the
image is clear enough, humans can recognize the image content in a variety of
viewing conditions. Likewise, if an adversarial example looks like the target
class to the model, the model should also classify the rendered image of the 3D
object as the target class. The ODI method effectively diversifies the input by
leveraging an ensemble of multiple source objects and randomizing viewing
conditions. In our experimental results on the ImageNet-Compatible dataset,
this method boosts the average targeted attack success rate from 28.3% to 47.0%
compared to the state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate the applicability
of the ODI method to adversarial examples on the face verification task and its
superior performance improvement. Our code is available at

to learn optimal decisions that minimize the risk of incurring significantly
high costs. Specifically, we use the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) as a risk
measure that the agents can estimate using bandit feedback in the form of the
cost values of only their selected actions. Since the distributions of the cost
functions depend on the actions of all agents that are generally unobservable,
they are themselves unknown and, therefore, the CVaR values of the costs are
difficult to compute. To address this challenge, we propose a new online

of the CVaR gradients computed using CVaR values that are estimated by
appropriately sampling the cost functions. We show that this algorithm achieves
sub-linear regret with high probability. We also propose two variants of this
algorithm that improve performance. The first variant relies on a new sampling
strategy that uses samples from the previous iteration to improve the
estimation accuracy of the CVaR values. The second variant employs residual

studies on data imbalance focus on single-domain settings, i.e., samples are
from the same data distribution. However, natural data can originate from
distinct domains, where a minority class in one domain could have abundant
instances from other domains. We formalize the task of Multi-Domain Long-Tailed
Recognition (MDLT), which learns from multi-domain imbalanced data, addresses
label imbalance, domain shift, and divergent label distributions across
domains, and generalizes to all domain-class pairs. We first develop the
domain-class transferability graph, and show that such transferability governs
the success of learning in MDLT. We then propose BoDA, a theoretically grounded
learning strategy that tracks the upper bound of transferability statistics,
and ensures balanced alignment and calibration across imbalanced domain-class
distributions. We curate five MDLT benchmarks based on widely-used multi-domain
datasets, and compare BoDA to twenty algorithms that span different learning
strategies. Extensive and rigorous experiments verify the superior performance
of BoDA. Further, as a byproduct, BoDA establishes new state-of-the-art on
Domain Generalization benchmarks, improving generalization to unseen domains.

physical layer, from modulation selection to multi-antenna strategy, and each
decision affects the performance of the communication systems. Future
communication systems must include extensive capabilities as they will

learning-driven designs are promising solutions to present a resilient decision

corresponding design solutions should evolve following the lines of
learning-driven paradigms that offer more autonomy and robustness. This
evolution must take place by considering the facts of real-world systems and

efforts with applications of both economic and ecological importance. Current
state-of-the-art deep learning methods are based on self-attention and use
satellite image time series (SITS) to discriminate crop types based on their
unique growth patterns. However, existing methods generalize poorly to regions
not seen during training mainly due to not being robust to temporal shifts of
the growing season caused by variations in climate. To this end, we propose
Thermal Positional Encoding (TPE) for attention-based crop classifiers. Unlike
previous positional encoding based on calendar time (e.g. day-of-year), TPE is
based on thermal time, which is obtained by accumulating daily average
temperatures over the growing season. Since crop growth is directly related to
thermal time, but not calendar time, TPE addresses the temporal shifts between
different regions to improve generalization. We propose multiple TPE
strategies, including learnable methods, to further improve results compared to
the common fixed positional encodings. We demonstrate our approach on a crop
classification task across four different European regions, where we obtain
state-of-the-art generalization results.]]></summary>

which aims to predict whether a user will interact with an item with multimodal
contents. Previous studies focus on modeling user-item interactions with
multimodal features included as side information. However, this scheme is not
well-designed for multimedia recommendation. Firstly, only collaborative
item-item relationships are implicitly modeled through high-order
item-user-item co-occurrences. We argue that the latent semantic item-item
structures underlying these multimodal contents could be beneficial for
learning better item representations and assist the recommender models to
comprehensively discover candidate items. Secondly, previous studies disregard
the fine-grained multimodal fusion. Although having access to multiple
modalities might allow us to capture rich information, we argue that the simple
coarse-grained fusion by linear combination or concatenation in previous work
is insufficient to fully understand content information and item
relationships.To this end, we propose a latent structure MIning with
ContRastive mOdality fusion method (MICRO for brevity). To be specific, we
devise a novel modality-aware structure learning module, which learns item-item
relationships for each modality. Based on the learned modality-aware latent
item relationships, we perform graph convolutions that explicitly inject item
affinities to modality-aware item representations. Then, we design a novel
contrastive method to fuse multimodal features. These enriched item
representations can be plugged into existing collaborative filtering methods to
make more accurate recommendations. Extensive experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art
baselines.]]></summary>

toward the development of therapeutics for complex diseases such as Alzheimer's
disease (AD). However, most machine learning approaches developed for
prediction of disease progression are either single-task or single-modality
models, which can not be directly adopted to our setting involving multi-task
learning with high dimensional images. Moreover, most of those approaches are
trained on a single dataset (i.e. cohort), which can not be generalized to
other cohorts. We propose a novel multimodal multi-task deep learning model to
predict AD progression by analyzing longitudinal clinical and neuroimaging data
from multiple cohorts. Our proposed model integrates high dimensional MRI
features from a 3D convolutional neural network with other data modalities,
including clinical and demographic information, to predict the future
trajectory of patients. Our model employs an adversarial loss to alleviate the
study-specific imaging bias, in particular the inter-study domain shifts. In
addition, a Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) optimization technique is
applied to further improve model generalization. The proposed model is trained
and tested on various datasets in order to evaluate and validate the results.
Our results showed that 1) our model yields significant improvement over the
baseline models, and 2) models using extracted neuroimaging features from 3D

network has been the traditional approach for the semantic segmentation task.
However, such an approach leaves out the semantic context that an image
provides during the encoding stage. This paper argues that incorporating
semantic information of the image into pretrained hierarchical
transformer-based backbones while finetuning improves the performance
considerably. To achieve this, we propose SeMask, a simple and effective
framework that incorporates semantic information into the encoder with the help
of a semantic attention operation. In addition, we use a lightweight semantic
decoder during training to provide supervision to the intermediate semantic
prior maps at every stage. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating
semantic priors enhances the performance of the established hierarchical
encoders with a slight increase in the number of FLOPs. We provide empirical
proof by integrating SeMask into Swin Transformer and Mix Transformer backbones
as our encoder paired with different decoders. Our framework achieves a new
state-of-the-art of 58.22% mIoU on the ADE20K dataset and improvements of over
3% in the mIoU metric on the Cityscapes dataset. The code and checkpoints are

it provides provable (certified) robustness, scales to ImageNet, and yields
deterministic (rather than high-probability) certified guarantees when applied
to quantized data (e.g., images). Our technique for fractional L_p robustness
constructs expressive, deep classifiers that are globally Lipschitz with
respect to the L_p^p metric, for any 0<p<1. However, our method is even more
general: we can construct classifiers which are globally Lipschitz with respect
to any metric defined as the sum of concave functions of components. Our
approach builds on a recent work, Levine and Feizi (2021), which provides a
provable defense against L_1 attacks. However, we demonstrate that our proposed

Dense Matrix Multiplication (SpMM) appear in diverse settings, such as
collaborative filtering, document clustering, and graph embedding. Frequently,
the SDDMM output becomes the input sparse matrix for a subsequent SpMM
operation. Existing work has focused on shared memory parallelization of these
primitives. While there has been extensive analysis of communication-minimizing
distributed 1.5D algorithms for SpMM, no such analysis exists for SDDMM or the
back-to-back sequence of SDDMM and SpMM, termed FusedMM. We show that
distributed memory 1.5D and 2.5D algorithms for SpMM can be converted to
algorithms for SDDMM with identical communication costs and input / output data
layouts. Further, we give two communication-eliding strategies to reduce costs
further for FusedMM kernels: either reusing the replication of an input dense
matrix for the SDDMM and SpMM in sequence, or fusing the local SDDMM and SpMM
kernels.

We benchmark FusedMM algorithms on Cori, a Cray XC40 at LBNL, using
Erdos-Renyi random matrices and large real-world sparse matrices. On 256 nodes
with 68 cores each, 1.5D FusedMM algorithms using either communication eliding
approach can save at least 30% of time spent exclusively in communication
compared to executing a distributed-memory SpMM and SDDMM kernel in sequence.
On real-world matrices with hundreds of millions of edges, all of our
algorithms exhibit at least a 10x speedup over the SpMM algorithm in PETSc. On
these matrices, our communication-eliding techniques exhibit runtimes up to 1.6
times faster than an unoptimized sequence of SDDMM and SpMM. We embed and test
the scaling of our algorithms in real-world applications, including
collaborative filtering via alternating-least-squares and inference for
attention-based graph neural networks.]]></summary>

optimization that are based on an analogy to non-smooth dynamical systems. Two
distinctive features of our approach are that (i) projections or optimizations
over the entire feasible set are avoided, in stark contrast to projected
gradient methods or the Frank-Wolfe method, and (ii) iterates are allowed to
become infeasible, which differs from active set or feasible direction methods,
where the descent motion stops as soon as a new constraint is encountered. The
resulting algorithmic procedure is simple to implement even when constraints
are nonlinear, and is suitable for large-scale constrained optimization
problems in which the feasible set fails to have a simple structure. The key
underlying idea is that constraints are expressed in terms of velocities
instead of positions, which has the algorithmic consequence that optimizations
over feasible sets at each iteration are replaced with optimizations over
local, sparse convex approximations. In particular, this means that at each
iteration only constraints that are violated are taken into account. The result
is a simplified suite of algorithms and an expanded range of possible
applications in machine learning.]]></summary>

between pretraining on iconic images like ImageNet and pretraining on complex
scenes like COCO. This gap exists largely because commonly used random crop
augmentations obtain semantically inconsistent content in crowded scene images
of diverse objects. Previous works use preprocessing pipelines to localize
salient objects for improved cropping, but an end-to-end solution is still
elusive. In this work, we propose a framework which accomplishes this goal via
joint learning of representations and segmentation. We leverage segmentation
masks to train a model with a mask-dependent contrastive loss, and use the
partially trained model to bootstrap better masks. By iterating between these
two components, we ground the contrastive updates in segmentation information,
and simultaneously improve segmentation throughout pretraining. Experiments
show our representations transfer robustly to downstream tasks in
classification, detection and segmentation.]]></summary>

In this paper, we propose an autoregressive prior for 3D shapes to solve
multimodal 3D tasks such as shape completion, reconstruction, and generation.
We model the distribution over 3D shapes as a non-sequential autoregressive
distribution over a discretized, low-dimensional, symbolic grid-like latent
representation of 3D shapes. This enables us to represent distributions over 3D
shapes conditioned on information from an arbitrary set of spatially anchored
query locations and thus perform shape completion in such arbitrary settings
(e.g., generating a complete chair given only a view of the back leg). We also
show that the learned autoregressive prior can be leveraged for conditional
tasks such as single-view reconstruction and language-based generation. This is
achieved by learning task-specific naive conditionals which can be approximated
by light-weight models trained on minimal paired data. We validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method using both quantitative and qualitative
evaluation and show that the proposed method outperforms the specialized
state-of-the-art methods trained for individual tasks. The project page with

provide insights into an upcoming taxi trip to drivers and passengers, the
duration of a trip or its Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) is predicted. To
reach a high prediction precision, machine learning models for ETA are state of
the art. One yet unexploited option to further increase prediction precision is
to combine multiple ETA models into an ensemble. While an increase of
prediction precision is likely, the main drawback is that the predictions made
by such an ensemble become less transparent due to the sophisticated ensemble
architecture. One option to remedy this drawback is to apply eXplainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI). The contribution of this paper is three-fold.
First, we combine multiple machine learning models from our previous work for
ETA into a two-level ensemble model - a stacked ensemble model - which on its
own is novel; therefore, we can outperform previous state-of-the-art static
route-free ETA approaches. Second, we apply existing XAI methods to explain the
first- and second-level models of the ensemble. Third, we propose three joining
methods for combining the first-level explanations with the second-level ones.
Those joining methods enable us to explain stacked ensembles for regression
tasks. An experimental evaluation shows that the ETA models correctly learned
the importance of those input features driving the prediction.]]></summary>

requires large amount of annotated volumes. Annotations mandate expert
knowledge and are time-intensive to obtain through fully manual segmentation
methods. Additionally, lung lesions have large inter-patient variations, with
some pathologies having similar visual appearance as healthy lung tissues. This
poses a challenge when applying existing semi-automatic interactive
segmentation techniques for data labelling. To address these challenges, we
propose an efficient convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can be learned
online while the annotator provides scribble-based interaction. To accelerate
learning from only the samples labelled through user-interactions, a
patch-based approach is used for training the network. Moreover, we use
weighted cross-entropy loss to address the class imbalance that may result from
user-interactions. During online inference, the learned network is applied to
the whole input volume using a fully convolutional approach. We compare our
proposed method with state-of-the-art using synthetic scribbles and show that
it outperforms existing methods on the task of annotating lung lesions
associated with COVID-19, achieving 16% higher Dice score while reducing
execution time by 3$\times$ and requiring 9000 lesser scribbles-based labelled
voxels. Due to the online learning aspect, our approach adapts quickly to user
input, resulting in high quality segmentation labels. Source code for ECONet is

next ten years presents a challenge for air traffic control. Precise flight
trajectory prediction is of great significance in air transportation
management, which contributes to the decision-making for safe and orderly
flights. Existing research and application mainly focus on the sequence
generation based on historical trajectories, while the aircraft-aircraft
interactions in crowded airspace especially the airspaces near busy airports
have been largely ignored. On the other hand, there are distinct
characteristics of aerodynamics for different flight phases, and the trajectory
may be affected by various uncertainties such as weather and advisories from
air traffic controllers. However, there is no literature fully considers all
these issues. Therefore, we proposed a phased flight trajectory prediction
framework. Multi-source and multi-modal datasets have been analyzed and mined
using variants of recurrent neural network (RNN) mixture. To be specific, we
first introduce spatio temporal graphs into the low-altitude airway prediction
problem, and the motion constraints of an aircraft are embedded to the
inference process for reliable forecasting results. In the en-route phase, the
dual attention mechanism is employed to adaptively extract much more important
features from overall datasets to learn the hidden patterns in dynamical
environments. The experimental results demonstrate our proposed framework can
outperform state-of-the-art methods for flight trajectory prediction for large

out to the virial radius, and can additionally describe the variability in the
outer profile of the halos. The neural network architecture consists of a
supervised encoder-decoder framework, which first compresses the density inputs
into a low-dimensional latent representation, and then outputs $\rho(r)$ for
any desired value of radius $r$. The latent representation contains all the
information used by the model to predict the density profiles. This allows us
to interpret the latent representation by quantifying the mutual information
between the representation and the halos' ground-truth density profiles. A
two-dimensional representation is sufficient to accurately model the density
profiles up to the virial radius; however, a three-dimensional representation
is required to describe the outer profiles beyond the virial radius. The
additional dimension in the representation contains information about the
infalling material in the outer profiles of dark matter halos, thus discovering
the splashback boundary of halos without prior knowledge of the halos'
dynamical history.]]></summary>

from pre-collected datasets without the need to query the environment for new
transitions. This setting is particularly well-suited for continuous control
robotic applications for which online data collection based on trial-and-error
is costly and potentially unsafe. In practice, offline datasets are often
heterogeneous, i.e., collected in a variety of scenarios, such as data from
several human demonstrators or from policies that act with different purposes.
Unfortunately, such datasets can exacerbate the distribution shift between the
behavior policy underlying the data and the optimal policy to be learned,
leading to poor performance. To address this challenge, we propose to leverage
latent-variable policies that can represent a broader class of policy
distributions, leading to better adherence to the training data distribution
while maximizing reward via a policy over the latent variable. As we
empirically show on a range of simulated locomotion, navigation, and
manipulation tasks, our method referred to as latent-variable
advantage-weighted policy optimization (LAPO), improves the average performance
of the next best-performing offline reinforcement learning methods by 49% on
heterogeneous datasets, and by 8% on datasets with narrow and biased
distributions.]]></summary>

privacy concerns as it often acquires and transmits speech data at the
client-side to remote cloud platforms for further processing. These speech data

distributed machine learning algorithm that coordinates clients to train a

potential for SER applications as sharing raw speech or speech features from a
user's device is vulnerable to privacy attacks. However, a major challenge in

we propose a semi-supervised federated learning framework, Semi-FedSER, that
utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data samples to address the challenge of

is crucial in a multitude of important applications. One ab initio method for
solving the electronic Schr\"odinger equation that scales favorably for large
systems and whose accuracy is limited only by the choice of wavefunction ansatz
employed is variational quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). The recently introduced deep
QMC approach, using a new class of ansatzes represented by deep neural
networks, has been shown to generate nearly exact ground-state solutions for
molecules containing up to a few dozen electrons, with the potential to scale
to much larger systems where other highly accurate methods are not feasible. In
this paper, we advance one such ansatz (PauliNet) to compute electronic excited
states through a simple variational procedure. We demonstrate our method on a
variety of small atoms and molecules where we consistently achieve high
accuracy for low-lying states. To highlight the method's potential for larger
systems, we show that for the benzene molecule, PauliNet is on par with
significantly more expensive high-level electronic structure methods in terms
of the excitation energy and outperforms them in terms of absolute energies.]]></summary>

systems. In deep learning, a common approach to this end is to train a neural
network to estimate the parameters of a heteroscedastic Gaussian distribution
by maximizing the logarithm of the likelihood function under the observed data.
In this work, we examine this approach and identify potential hazards
associated with the use of log-likelihood in conjunction with gradient-based
optimizers. First, we present a synthetic example illustrating how this
approach can lead to very poor but stable parameter estimates. Second, we
identify the culprit to be the log-likelihood loss, along with certain
conditions that exacerbate the issue. Third, we present an alternative
formulation, termed $\beta$-NLL, in which each data point's contribution to the
loss is weighted by the $\beta$-exponentiated variance estimate. We show that
using an appropriate $\beta$ largely mitigates the issue in our illustrative
example. Fourth, we evaluate this approach on a range of domains and tasks and
show that it achieves considerable improvements and performs more robustly
concerning hyperparameters, both in predictive RMSE and log-likelihood

fixed volume of cloud to characterize the types and sizes of cloud particles,
such as water droplets and ice crystals. Cloud particle properties include
position, diameter, and shape. We present a hologram processing algorithm,
HolodecML, that utilizes a neural segmentation model, GPUs, and computational
parallelization. HolodecML is trained using synthetically generated holograms
based on a model of the instrument, and predicts masks around particles found
within reconstructed images. From these masks, the position and size of the
detected particles can be characterized in three dimensions. In order to
successfully process real holograms, we find we must apply a series of image
corrupting transformations and noise to the synthetic images used in training.

In this evaluation, HolodecML had comparable position and size estimation
performance to the standard processing method, but improved particle detection
by nearly 20\% on several thousand manually labeled HOLODEC images. However,
the improvement only occurred when image corruption was performed on the
simulated images during training, thereby mimicking non-ideal conditions in the
actual probe. The trained model also learned to differentiate artifacts and
other impurities in the HOLODEC images from the particles, even though no such
objects were present in the training data set, while the standard processing
method struggled to separate particles from artifacts. The novelty of the
training approach, which leveraged noise as a means for parameterizing
non-ideal aspects of the HOLODEC detector, could be applied in other domains
where the theoretical model is incapable of fully describing the real-world
operation of the instrument and accurate truth data required for supervised
learning cannot be obtained from real-world observations.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Data is fundamental to machine learning-based products and services and is
considered strategic due to its externalities for businesses, governments,
non-profits, and more generally for society. It is renowned that the value of
organizations (businesses, government agencies and programs, and even
industries) scales with the volume of available data. What is often less
appreciated is that the data value in making useful organizational predictions
will range widely and is prominently a function of data characteristics and
underlying algorithms.

In this research, our goal is to study how the value of data changes over
time and how this change varies across contexts and business areas (e.g. next
word prediction in the context of history, sports, politics). We focus on data
from Reddit.com and compare the value's time-dependency across various Reddit
topics (Subreddits). We make this comparison by measuring the rate at which
user-generated text data loses its relevance to the algorithmic prediction of
conversations. We show that different subreddits have different rates of
relevance decline over time.

Relating the text topics to various business areas of interest, we argue that
competing in a business area in which data value decays rapidly alters

synthesis encouraging diversity and motion correction imposing physical
plausibility. This motion synthesis consists of our modified Variational
AutoEncoder (VAE) and Inverse Kinematics (IK). In this VAE, our proposed
sampling-near-samples method generates various valid motions even with
insufficient training motion data. Our IK-based motion synthesis method allows
us to generate a variety of motions semi-automatically. Since these two schemes
generate unrealistic artifacts in the synthesized motions, our motion
correction rectifies them. This motion correction scheme consists of imitation
learning with physics simulation and subsequent motion debiasing. For this
imitation learning, we propose the PD-residual force that significantly
accelerates the training process. Furthermore, our motion debiasing
successfully offsets the motion bias induced by imitation learning to maximize
the effect of augmentation. As a result, our method outperforms previous
noise-based motion augmentation methods by a large margin on both Recurrent

applied in a variety of physical phenomena described by partial differential
equations (PDE). However, it has been observed that PINNs are difficult to
train in certain "stiff" problems, which include various nonlinear hyperbolic
PDEs that display shocks in their solutions. Recent studies added a diffusion
term to the PDE, and an artificial viscosity (AV) value was manually tuned to
allow PINNs to solve these problems. In this paper, we propose three approaches
to address this problem, none of which rely on an a priori definition of the
artificial viscosity value. The first method learns a global AV value, whereas
the other two learn localized AV values around the shocks, by means of a
parametrized AV map or a residual-based AV map. We applied the proposed methods
to the inviscid Burgers equation and the Buckley-Leverett equation, the latter
being a classical problem in Petroleum Engineering. The results show that the
proposed methods are able to learn both a small AV value and the accurate shock
location and improve the approximation error over a nonadaptive global AV
alternative method.]]></summary>

disciplines, the characterization of their computations and the origin of key
properties such as generalization and robustness remain open questions. Recent
literature suggests that robust networks with good generalization properties
tend to be biased towards processing low frequencies in images. To explore the
frequency bias hypothesis further, we develop an algorithm that allows us to
learn modulatory masks highlighting the essential input frequencies needed for
preserving a trained network's performance. We achieve this by imposing
invariance in the loss with respect to such modulations in the input
frequencies. We first use our method to test the low-frequency preference
hypothesis of adversarially trained or data-augmented networks. Our results
suggest that adversarially robust networks indeed exhibit a low-frequency bias
but we find this bias is also dependent on directions in frequency space.
However, this is not necessarily true for other types of data augmentation. Our
results also indicate that the essential frequencies in question are
effectively the ones used to achieve generalization in the first place.
Surprisingly, images seen through these modulatory masks are not recognizable
and resemble texture-like patterns.]]></summary>

little attention has been devoted to the analysis of the cell-based search

In this work, we conduct an empirical post-hoc analysis of architectures from
the popular cell-based search spaces and find that the existing search spaces
contain a high degree of redundancy: the architecture performance is minimally
sensitive to changes at large parts of the cells, and universally adopted
designs, like the explicit search for a reduction cell, significantly increase
the complexities but have very limited impact on the performance. Across
architectures found by a diverse set of search strategies, we consistently find
that the parts of the cells that do matter for architecture performance often
follow similar and simple patterns. By explicitly constraining cells to include
these patterns, randomly sampled architectures can match or even outperform the
state of the art. These findings cast doubts into our ability to discover truly
novel architectures in the existing cell-based search spaces, and inspire our

provide insights into an upcoming taxi trip to drivers and passengers, the
duration of a trip or its Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) is predicted. To
reach a high prediction precision, machine learning models for ETA are state of
the art. One yet unexploited option to further increase prediction precision is
to combine multiple ETA models into an ensemble. While an increase of
prediction precision is likely, the main drawback is that the predictions made
by such an ensemble become less transparent due to the sophisticated ensemble
architecture. One option to remedy this drawback is to apply eXplainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI). The contribution of this paper is three-fold.
First, we combine multiple machine learning models from our previous work for
ETA into a two-level ensemble model - a stacked ensemble model - which on its
own is novel; therefore, we can outperform previous state-of-the-art static
route-free ETA approaches. Second, we apply existing XAI methods to explain the
first- and second-level models of the ensemble. Third, we propose three joining
methods for combining the first-level explanations with the second-level ones.
Those joining methods enable us to explain stacked ensembles for regression
tasks. An experimental evaluation shows that the ETA models correctly learned
the importance of those input features driving the prediction.]]></summary>

prediction of the cosmological framework. It is a promising way to constrain
the nature of dark matter. Here we describe the challenges of detecting stars
whose phase-space distribution may be perturbed by the passage of dark matter
subhalos using a machine learning approach. The training data are three Milky
Way-like galaxies and nine synthetic Gaia DR2 surveys derived from these. We
first quantify the magnitude of the perturbations in the simulated galaxies
using an anomaly detection algorithm. We also estimate the feasibility of this
approach in the Gaia DR2-like catalogues by comparing the anomaly detection
based approach with a supervised classification. We find that a classification
algorithm optimized on about half a billion synthetic star observables exhibits
mild but nonzero sensitivity. This classification-based approach is not
sufficiently sensitive to pinpoint the exact locations of subhalos in the
simulation, as would be expected from the very limited number of subhalos in
the detectable region. The enormous size of the Gaia dataset motivates the
further development of scalable and accurate computational methods that could
be used to select potential regions of interest for dark matter searches to

the goal is to predict missing entries from partial observations. However,
existing methods often make the explicit or implicit assumption that the
observed entries are noise-free to provide a theoretical guarantee of exact
recovery of missing entries, which is quite restrictive in practice. To remedy
such drawbacks, this paper proposes a novel noisy tensor completion model,
which complements the incompetence of existing works in handling the
degeneration of high-order and noisy observations. Specifically, the tensor
ring nuclear norm (TRNN) and least-squares estimator are adopted to regularize
the underlying tensor and the observed entries, respectively. In addition, a
non-asymptotic upper bound of estimation error is provided to depict the
statistical performance of the proposed estimator. Two efficient algorithms are
developed to solve the optimization problem with convergence guarantee, one of
which is specially tailored to handle large-scale tensors by replacing the
minimization of TRNN of the original tensor equivalently with that of a much
smaller one in a heterogeneous tensor decomposition framework. Experimental
results on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of the proposed model in recovering noisy incomplete tensor data

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The drastic increase of data quantity often brings the severe decrease of
data quality, such as incorrect label annotations, which poses a great
challenge for robustly training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Existing learning
\mbox{methods} with label noise either employ ad-hoc heuristics or restrict to
specific noise assumptions. However, more general situations, such as
instance-dependent label noise, have not been fully explored, as scarce studies
focus on their label corruption process. By categorizing instances into
confusing and unconfusing instances, this paper proposes a simple yet universal
probabilistic model, which explicitly relates noisy labels to their instances.
The resultant model can be realized by DNNs, where the training procedure is
accomplished by employing an alternating optimization algorithm. Experiments on
datasets with both synthetic and real-world label noise verify that the
proposed method yields significant improvements on robustness over
state-of-the-art counterparts.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In many prediction problems, spurious correlations are induced by a changing
relationship between the label and a nuisance variable that is also correlated
with the covariates. For example, in classifying animals in natural images, the
background, which is a nuisance, can predict the type of animal. This
nuisance-label relationship does not always hold, and the performance of a
model trained under one such relationship may be poor on data with a different
nuisance-label relationship. To build predictive models that perform well
regardless of the nuisance-label relationship, we develop Nuisance-Randomized
Distillation (NURD). We introduce the nuisance-randomized distribution, a
distribution where the nuisance and the label are independent. Under this
distribution, we define the set of representations such that conditioning on
any member, the nuisance and the label remain independent. We prove that the
representations in this set always perform better than chance, while
representations outside of this set may not. NURD finds a representation from
this set that is most informative of the label under the nuisance-randomized
distribution, and we prove that this representation achieves the highest
performance regardless of the nuisance-label relationship. We evaluate NURD on
several tasks including chest X-ray classification where, using non-lung
patches as the nuisance, NURD produces models that predict pneumonia under
strong spurious correlations.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On-demand labor platforms aim to train a skilled workforce to serve its
incoming demand for jobs. Since limited jobs are available for training, and it
is usually not necessary to train all workers, efficient matching of training
jobs requires prioritizing fast learners over slow ones. However, the learning
rates of novice workers are unknown, resulting in a tradeoff between
exploration (learning the learning rates) and exploitation (training the best
workers). Motivated to study this tradeoff, we analyze a novel objective within
the stochastic multi-armed bandit framework. Given $K$ arms, instead of
maximizing the expected total reward from $T$ pulls (the traditional "sum"
objective), we consider the vector of cumulative rewards earned from the $K$
arms at the end of $T$ pulls and aim to maximize the expected highest
cumulative reward (the "max" objective). When rewards represent skill
increments, this corresponds to the objective of training a single highly
skilled worker from a set of novice workers, using a limited supply of training
jobs. For this objective, we show that any policy must incur an
instance-dependent asymptotic regret of $\Omega(\log T)$ (with a higher
instance-dependent constant) and a worst-case regret of
$\Omega(K^{1/3}T^{2/3})$. We then design an explore-then-commit policy
featuring exploration based on appropriately tuned confidence bounds on the
mean reward and an adaptive stopping criterion, which adapts to the problem
difficulty and achieves these bounds (up to logarithmic factors). We generalize
our algorithmic insights to the problem of maximizing the expected value of the
average cumulative reward of the top $m$ arms with the highest cumulative
rewards, corresponding to the case where multiple workers must be trained. Our
numerical experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our policies compared to
several natural alternatives in practical parameter regimes.]]></summary>

and the interdependencies across those modes exist. This means that the travel
demand across different travel modes could be correlated as one mode may
receive demand from or create demand for another mode, not to mention natural
correlations between different demand time series due to general demand flow
patterns across the network. It is expectable that cross-modal ripple effects
become more prevalent, with Mobility as a Service. Therefore, by propagating
demand data across modes, a better demand prediction could be obtained. To this
end, this study explores various machine learning models and transfer learning
strategies for cross-modal demand prediction. The trip data of bike-share,
metro, and taxi are processed as the station-level passenger flows, and then
the proposed prediction method is tested in the large-scale case studies of
Nanjing and Chicago. The results suggest that prediction models with transfer
learning perform better than unimodal prediction models. Furthermore, stacked
Long Short-Term Memory model performs particularly well in cross-modal demand
prediction. These results verify our combined method's forecasting improvement
over existing benchmarks and demonstrate the good transferability for

learning on graph-structured data, in large part due to their simplicity and
scalability. Unfortunately, it was shown that these architectures are limited
in their expressive power. This paper proposes a novel framework called
Equivariant Subgraph Aggregation Networks (ESAN) to address this issue. Our
main observation is that while two graphs may not be distinguishable by an
MPNN, they often contain distinguishable subgraphs. Thus, we propose to
represent each graph as a set of subgraphs derived by some predefined policy,
and to process it using a suitable equivariant architecture. We develop novel
variants of the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman (1-WL) test for graph
isomorphism, and prove lower bounds on the expressiveness of ESAN in terms of
these new WL variants. We further prove that our approach increases the
expressive power of both MPNNs and more expressive architectures. Moreover, we
provide theoretical results that describe how design choices such as the
subgraph selection policy and equivariant neural architecture affect our
architecture's expressive power. To deal with the increased computational cost,
we propose a subgraph sampling scheme, which can be viewed as a stochastic
version of our framework. A comprehensive set of experiments on real and

Hard Thresholding (IHT) algorithm widely used for sparse recovery problems. The
parameter estimation and sparsity recovery consistency of IHT has long been
known in compressed sensing. From the perspective of statistical learning,
another fundamental question is how well the IHT estimation would predict on
unseen data. This paper makes progress towards answering this open question by
introducing a novel sparse generalization theory for IHT under the notion of
algorithmic stability. Our theory reveals that: 1) under natural conditions on
the empirical risk function over $n$ samples of dimension $p$, IHT with
sparsity level $k$ enjoys an $\mathcal{\tilde
O}(n^{-1/2}\sqrt{k\log(n)\log(p)})$ rate of convergence in sparse excess risk;
2) a tighter $\mathcal{\tilde O}(n^{-1/2}\sqrt{\log(n)})$ bound can be
established by imposing an additional iteration stability condition on a
hypothetical IHT procedure invoked to the population risk; and 3) a fast rate
of order $\mathcal{\tilde O}\left(n^{-1}k(\log^3(n)+\log(p))\right)$ can be
derived for strongly convex risk function under proper strong-signal
conditions. The results have been substantialized to sparse linear regression
and sparse logistic regression models to demonstrate the applicability of our
theory. Preliminary numerical evidence is provided to confirm our theoretical
predictions.]]></summary>

different from existing works that can either only handle low-dimensional
linear bandits or passively deal with model misspecification. We showcase the
application of our approach to two pure exploration settings that were
previously under-studied: (1) the reward function belongs to a possibly
infinite-dimensional Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, and (2) the reward
function is nonlinear and can be approximated by neural networks. Our main
results provide sample complexity guarantees that only depend on the effective
dimension of the feature spaces in the kernel or neural representations.
Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate the efficacy of our methods.]]></summary>

interactions, revealing potential regulatory and/or signal transduction
pathways for cellular processes of interest when studying life and disease
systems. One of critical challenges when dealing with real-world multi-omics
data is that they may manifest heterogeneous structures and data quality as
often existing data may be collected from different subjects under different
conditions for each type of omics data. We propose a novel deep Bayesian
generative model to efficiently infer a multi-partite graph encoding molecular
interactions across such heterogeneous views, using a fused Gromov-Wasserstein
(FGW) regularization between latent representations of corresponding views for
integrative analysis. With such an optimal transport regularization in the deep
Bayesian generative model, it not only allows incorporating view-specific side
information, either with graph-structured or unstructured data in different
views, but also increases the model flexibility with the distribution-based
regularization. This allows efficient alignment of heterogeneous latent
variable distributions to derive reliable interaction predictions compared to
the existing point-based graph embedding methods. Our experiments on several
real-world datasets demonstrate enhanced performance of MoReL in inferring
meaningful interactions compared to existing baselines.]]></summary>

from experts can potentially facilitate a more efficient allocation of
resources; they can help decide when and from whom to seek a second opinion. In
this paper, we look at the design of this type of support systems from the
perspective of counterfactual inference. We focus on a multiclass
classification setting and first show that, if experts make predictions on
their own, the underlying causal mechanism generating their predictions needs
to satisfy a desirable set invariant property. Further, we show that, for any
causal mechanism satisfying this property, there exists an equivalent mechanism
where the predictions by each expert are generated by independent
sub-mechanisms governed by a common noise. This motivates the design of a set
invariant Gumbel-Max structural causal model where the structure of the noise
governing the sub-mechanisms underpinning the model depends on an intuitive
notion of similarity between experts which can be estimated from data.
Experiments on both synthetic and real data show that our model can be used to
infer second opinions more accurately than its non-causal counterpart.]]></summary>

large-scale machine learning problems has been hampered by its prohibitive
computational cost. The sliced Wasserstein distance and its variants improve
the computational efficiency through the random projection, yet they suffer
from low accuracy if the number of projections is not sufficiently large,
because the majority of projections result in trivially small values. In this
work, we propose a new family of distance metrics, called augmented sliced
Wasserstein distances (ASWDs), constructed by first mapping samples to
higher-dimensional hypersurfaces parameterized by neural networks. It is
derived from a key observation that (random) linear projections of samples
residing on these hypersurfaces would translate to much more flexible nonlinear
projections in the original sample space, so they can capture complex
structures of the data distribution. We show that the hypersurfaces can be
optimized by gradient ascent efficiently. We provide the condition under which
the ASWD is a valid metric and show that this can be obtained by an injective
neural network architecture. Numerical results demonstrate that the ASWD
significantly outperforms other Wasserstein variants for both synthetic and

approaches for few-shot learning. However, due to the non-convexity of deep

prove that MAML with over-parameterized DNNs is guaranteed to converge to

with over-parameterized DNNs is equivalent to kernel regression with a novel
class of kernels, which we name as Meta Neural Tangent Kernels (MetaNTK). Then,
we propose MetaNTK-NAS, a new training-free neural architecture search (NAS)
method for few-shot learning that uses MetaNTK to rank and select

methods on two popular few-shot learning benchmarks, miniImageNet, and
tieredImageNet. We show that the performance of MetaNTK-NAS is comparable or

studies about graph convolution neural networks have achieved impressive
success on graph type data. However, in general clustering tasks, the graph
structure of data does not exist such that the strategy to construct a graph is
crucial for performance. Therefore, how to extend graph convolution networks
into general clustering tasks is an attractive problem. In this paper, we
propose a graph auto-encoder for general data clustering, which constructs the
graph adaptively according to the generative perspective of graphs. The
adaptive process is designed to induce the model to exploit the high-level
information behind data and utilize the non-Euclidean structure sufficiently.
We further design a novel mechanism with rigorous analysis to avoid the
collapse caused by the adaptive construction. Via combining the generative
model for network embedding and graph-based clustering, a graph auto-encoder
with a novel decoder is developed such that it performs well in weighted graph
used scenarios. Extensive experiments prove the superiority of our model.]]></summary>

review and analysis of Deep Generative Machine Learning models in engineering

feedforward Neural Networks (NNs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and certain Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)

DGMs for design. We structure our review as an exposition of the algorithms,
datasets, representation methods, and applications commonly used in the current
literature. In particular, we discuss key works that have introduced new
techniques and methods in DGMs, successfully applied DGMs to a design-related
domain, or directly supported the development of DGMs through datasets or

applications of machine learning and statistics, with maximum likelihood

predictions of the regression model are continuous (or insensitive to small
perturbations) in the training data. This article presents a rigorous proof
that the maximum likelihood estimator fails to be well-posed in Hellinger
distance in a scenario where the data are noiseless. The failure case occurs
for any Gaussian process with a stationary covariance function whose
lengthscale parameter is estimated using maximum likelihood. Although the
failure of maximum likelihood estimation is informally well-known, these
theoretical results appear to be the first of their kind, and suggest that
well-posedness may need to be assessed post-hoc, on a case-by-case basis, when

potential biases in algorithm performance in this context, we curated the
Diverse Dermatology Images (DDI) dataset-the first publicly available, expertly

Using this dataset of 656 images, we show that state-of-the-art dermatology AI
models perform substantially worse on DDI, with receiver operator curve area
under the curve (ROC-AUC) dropping by 27-36 percent compared to the models'
original test results. All the models performed worse on dark skin tones and
uncommon diseases, which are represented in the DDI dataset. Additionally, we
find that dermatologists, who typically provide visual labels for AI training
and test datasets, also perform worse on images of dark skin tones and uncommon
diseases compared to ground truth biopsy annotations. Finally, fine-tuning AI
models on the well-characterized and diverse DDI images closed the performance
gap between light and dark skin tones. Moreover, algorithms fine-tuned on
diverse skin tones outperformed dermatologists on identifying malignancy on

single-shot GAN adaptation method through unified CLIP space manipulations.
Specifically, our model employs a two-step training strategy: reference image
search in the source generator using a CLIP-guided latent optimization,
followed by generator fine-tuning with a novel loss function that imposes CLIP
space consistency between the source and adapted generators. To further improve
the adapted model to produce spatially consistent samples with respect to the
source generator, we also propose contrastive regularization for patchwise
relationships in the CLIP space. Experimental results show that our model
generates diverse outputs with the target texture and outperforms the baseline
models both qualitatively and quantitatively. Furthermore, we show that our

The proposed approach uses a novel contrastive loss that naturally exploits a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a relatively new field, network neuroscience has tended to focus on
aggregate behaviours of the brain averaged over many successive experiments or
over long recordings in order to construct robust brain models. These models
are limited in their ability to explain dynamic state changes in the brain
which occurs spontaneously as a result of normal brain function. Hidden Markov
Models (HMMs) trained on neuroimaging time series data have since arisen as a
method to produce dynamical models that are easy to train but can be difficult
to fully parametrise or analyse. We propose an interpretation of these neural
HMMs as multiplex brain state graph models we term Hidden Markov Graph Models
(HMGMs). This interpretation allows for dynamic brain activity to be analysed
using the full repertoire of network analysis techniques. Furthermore, we
propose a general method for selecting HMM hyperparameters in the absence of
external data, based on the principle of maximum entropy, and use this to
select the number of layers in the multiplex model. We produce a new tool for
determining important communities of brain regions using a spatiotemporal
random walk-based procedure that takes advantage of the underlying Markov
structure of the model. Our analysis of real multi-subject fMRI data provides
new results that corroborate the modular processing hypothesis of the brain at
rest as well as contributing new evidence of functional overlap between and
within dynamic brain state communities. Our analysis pipeline provides a way to
characterise dynamic network activity of the brain under novel behaviours or
conditions.]]></summary>

variance reduction without requiring the objective function to be of the

optimization, we prove that after a finite number of iterations, all iterates
of RMDA possess a desired structure identical to that induced by the
regularizer at the stationary point of asymptotic convergence, even in the
presence of engineering tricks like data augmentation and dropout that
complicate the training process. Experiments on training NNs with structured
sparsity confirm that variance reduction is necessary for such an
identification, and show that RMDA thus significantly outperforms existing

classification. The original algorithm introduced by Breiman in 2001 and many
of its variants are ensembles of randomized decision trees built from
axis-aligned partitions of the feature space. One such variant, called Mondrian
forests, was proposed to handle the online setting and is the first class of
random forests for which minimax rates were obtained in arbitrary dimension.
However, the restriction to axis-aligned splits fails to capture dependencies
between features, and random forests that use oblique splits have shown
improved empirical performance for many tasks. In this work, we show that a
large class of random forests with general split directions also achieve
minimax rates in arbitrary dimension. This class includes STIT forests, a
generalization of Mondrian forests to arbitrary split directions, as well as
random forests derived from Poisson hyperplane tessellations. Crucially, our
rates adapt to sparsity in the sense that they depend only on the dimension of
the relevant feature subspace as opposed to the ambient dimension of the
feature space. This generalizes the known rates for Mondrian random forests.
These are the first results showing that random forest variants with oblique
splits can achieve minimax rates in arbitrary dimension. Our proof technique
relies on the novel application of the theory of stationary random
tessellations in stochastic geometry to statistical learning theory.]]></summary>

distance from an unlabeled dataset. The resulting distance is broadly useful
for improving various distance-based downstream tasks, even when no information
from downstream tasks is utilized in the metric learning stage. To gain
insights into this approach, we develop a statistical framework to
theoretically study how self-supervised metric learning can benefit downstream
tasks in the context of multi-view data. Under this framework, we show that the
target distance of metric learning satisfies several desired properties for the
downstream tasks. On the other hand, our investigation suggests the target
distance can be further improved by moderating each direction's weights. In
addition, our analysis precisely characterizes the improvement by
self-supervised metric learning on four commonly used downstream tasks: sample
identification, two-sample testing, $k$-means clustering, and $k$-nearest
neighbor classification. When the distance is estimated from an unlabeled
dataset, we establish the upper bound on distance estimation's accuracy and the
number of samples sufficient for downstream task improvement. Finally,
numerical experiments are presented to support the theoretical results in the

from sparse and delayed rewards. It challenges the ability of agents to
attribute their actions to future outcomes. In this paper, we consider the
problem formulation of episodic reinforcement learning with trajectory
feedback. It refers to an extreme delay of reward signals, in which the agent
can only obtain one reward signal at the end of each trajectory. A popular
paradigm for this problem setting is learning with a designed auxiliary dense
reward function, namely proxy reward, instead of sparse environmental signals.
Based on this framework, this paper proposes a novel reward redistribution
algorithm, randomized return decomposition (RRD), to learn a proxy reward
function for episodic reinforcement learning. We establish a surrogate problem
by Monte-Carlo sampling that scales up least-squares-based reward
redistribution to long-horizon problems. We analyze our surrogate loss function
by connection with existing methods in the literature, which illustrates the
algorithmic properties of our approach. In experiments, we extensively evaluate
our proposed method on a variety of benchmark tasks with episodic rewards and
demonstrate substantial improvement over baseline algorithms.]]></summary>

while keeping their data local. Federated learning was originally used to train
a unique global model to be served to all clients, but this approach might be

to tackle this limitation, recent personalized federated learning methods train
a separate model for each client while still leveraging the knowledge available
at other clients. In this work, we exploit the ability of deep neural networks
to extract high quality vectorial representations (embeddings) from non-tabular

local memorization. Personalization is obtained interpolating a pre-trained
global model with a $k$-nearest neighbors (kNN) model based on the shared

received considerable research efforts. The intensity of the pandemic on a
given territory is efficiently measured by the reproduction number, quantifying
the rate of growth of daily new infections. Recently, estimates for the time
evolution of the reproduction number were produced using an inverse problem
formulation with a nonsmooth functional minimization. While it was designed to
be robust to the limited quality of the Covid19 data (outliers, missing
counts), the procedure lacks the ability to output credibility interval based
estimates. This remains a severe limitation for practical use in actual
pandemic monitoring by epidemiologists that the present work aims to overcome
by use of Monte Carlo sampling. After interpretation of the functional into a
Bayesian framework, several sampling schemes are tailored to adjust the
nonsmooth nature of the resulting posterior distribution. The originality of
the devised algorithms stems from combining a Langevin Monte Carlo sampling
scheme with Proximal operators. Performance of the new algorithms in producing
relevant credibility intervals for the reproduction number estimates and
denoised counts are compared. Assessment is conducted on real daily new

labelled data in a source domain to unlabelled data in a target domain without
access to the source-domain data during adaptation. Existing methods for SFDA
leverage entropy-minimization techniques which: (i) apply only to
classification; (ii) destroy model calibration; and (iii) rely on the source
model achieving a good level of feature-space class-separation in the target

shift called measurement shift which can be resolved by restoring the source
features rather than extracting new ones. In particular, we propose Feature
Restoration (FR) wherein we: (i) store a lightweight and flexible approximation
of the feature distribution under the source data; and (ii) adapt the
feature-extractor such that the approximate feature distribution under the
target data realigns with that saved on the source. We additionally propose a
bottom-up training scheme which boosts performance, which we call Bottom-Up
Feature Restoration (BUFR). On real and synthetic data, we demonstrate that
BUFR outperforms existing SFDA methods in terms of accuracy, calibration, and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Biological intelligence is remarkable in its ability to produce complex
behaviour in many diverse situations through data efficient, generalisable and
transferable skill acquisition. It is believed that learning "good" sensory
representations is important for enabling this, however there is little
agreement as to what a good representation should look like. In this review
article we are going to argue that symmetry transformations are a fundamental
principle that can guide our search for what makes a good representation. The
idea that there exist transformations (symmetries) that affect some aspects of
the system but not others, and their relationship to conserved quantities has
become central in modern physics, resulting in a more unified theoretical
framework and even ability to predict the existence of new particles. Recently,
symmetries have started to gain prominence in machine learning too, resulting
in more data efficient and generalisable algorithms that can mimic some of the
complex behaviours produced by biological intelligence. Finally, first
demonstrations of the importance of symmetry transformations for representation
learning in the brain are starting to arise in neuroscience. Taken together,
the overwhelming positive effect that symmetries bring to these disciplines
suggest that they may be an important general framework that determines the
structure of the universe, constrains the nature of natural tasks and
consequently shapes both biological and artificial intelligence.]]></summary>

this paper we propose a novel Reservoir Computing (RC) model, called the Euler
State Network (EuSN). The introduced approach makes use of forward Euler
discretization and antisymmetric recurrent matrices to design reservoir
dynamics that are both stable and non-dissipative by construction.

Our mathematical analysis shows that the resulting model is biased towards
unitary effective spectral radius and zero local Lyapunov exponents,
intrinsically operating at the edge of stability. Experiments on synthetic
tasks indicate the marked superiority of the proposed approach, compared to
standard RC models, in tasks requiring long-term memorization skills.
Furthermore, results on real-world time series classification benchmarks point
out that EuSN is capable of matching (or even surpassing) the level of accuracy
of trainable Recurrent Neural Networks, while allowing up to 100-fold savings
in computation time and energy consumption.]]></summary>

sparse. We prove that the causal coefficient becomes identifiable under weak
conditions and may even be identified in models, where the number of
instruments is as small as the number of causal parents. We also develop
graphical criteria under which the identifiability holds with probability one

propose spaceIV and prove that it consistently estimates the causal effect if
the model is identifiable and evaluate its performance on simulated data.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The three essential components that determine the evolution of modern Machine Learning are computing, data, and algorithmic advancements (ML). The article looks at trends in the most easily quantifiable element. Before 2010, training computes expanded in lockstep with Moore’s law, doubling every two years. Since the early 2010s, when Deep Learning was first introduced, the rate of training compute has quickened, roughly doubling every six months. Late in 2015, a new trend emerged. The history of computation in ML has been divided into three eras based on these observations – the Pre-Deep Learning Era, the Deep Learning Era, and the Large-Scale Era. The article summarises the fast-growing compute requirements for training advanced ML systems.
 Trends
 The comparison is made on a dataset of 123 milestone ML systems, annotated with the computing it took to train them. Before Deep Learning took off, there was a period of slow progress. The tendency accelerated in 2010 and hasn’t slowed since. Separately, in 2015 and 2016, a new trend of large-scale models arose, expanding at a comparable rate but by two orders of magnitude faster than the preceding one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I have a dataset of continuous multivariate samples. I'm clustering these samples together using an unsupervised algorithm to infer unmeasured latent states. Ideally, this would just be performed on the entire sample set. However, this label will then subsequently form part of a supervised prediction algorithm, and because the dataset isn't very large (several hundred samples), I'm almost certainly going to end up using k-fold cross validation.
 ​
 Now, the issue with using cluster labels generated from the whole dataset is that this essentially permits data leakage from the test fold back into the training fold for the supervised learning algorithm (which, for the purposes of my experiment, I don't want). So instead, the unsupervised labels will need to be generated for each fold individually.
 ​
 What I would like to do is have a measure of the relative stability/instability of label assignment for each sample across the folds. So for example, over 10 folds, ideally sample 1 would always get the label 'A' ten times out of ten... but in reality, perhaps it will get label 'A' eight times, and label 'B' twice.
 ​
 It sounds like the Bhattacharyya coefficient might be an appropriate scoring system (i.e. for each sample, calculate the square root of the product of the label proportions, and sum over all samples) - but I've never used this before, so I don't know whether it would be an appropriate use case. Does anyone have any familiarity with either this measure or this type of situation in general?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I've been thinking about how to democratize running and training of large language models, and more generally how to democratize all large models.
 I've wondered if this would be achievable with a volunteer computing project. I've found two (and only two, unfortunately) papers on the subject, so I at least know that I'm not the only one thinking about this. Those papers can be found here and here.
 That would be the end of the discussion for me, but I think the previous approaches have some flaws. Both papers use data parallelism, making training of extremely large (> 20GB) models basically impossible, because very few volunteers will have enough resources to run, much less train, the models, regardless of batch size. Systems like Hydra might be able to run things locally for models between 20 to 250GB, but above that it becomes a question of disk space.
 A more theoretical flaw is that both of the papers use a modified version of SGD, which means any model would be required to use special optimizers. I don't know how that would impact results/convergence, but it doesn't seem trivial.
 In conclusion, it seems to me that a VC system for extremely large models probably needs a novel approach that uses tensor parallelism, so that work could be more granularly distributed. It's (probably) not an easy problem, but it seems possible.
 I'm curious what this community's thoughts are, and if anyone would also be interested in working on this. Also, if anyone knows any other resources on this problem, please drop a link so I can check them out!

However, because of the quadratic complexity of transformers over input length, they consume a lot of energy, which limits their research and development and industrial deployment.
 An MLP-based Green AI Replacement to Transformers presents a novel Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model, HyperMixer, as an energy-efficient alternative to transformers that preserves similar inductive biases, according to a recent article published by the Idiap Research Institute in Switzerland.
 The researchers demonstrate that HyperMixer may achieve performance comparable to transformers while significantly reducing processing time, training data, and hyperparameter tuning expenses.
 HyperMixer is a new all-MLP model with inductive biases inspired by transformers. On the GLUE benchmark, HyperMixer’s performance was compared to competitors’. HyperMixer learns attention patterns similarly to transformers, as demonstrated by this ablation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was playing with the idea of trying a transformer for a sequence modelling task for the first time recently - I was interested in all the X-former variants interested in better training stability, eg. Catformer or rezero or adding gates to the residual connections.
 I found I always got late NaN losses whenever the transformer blocks contained layer normalization. Removing layer normalization or using catformer (which has no layer normalization) this didn't happen. 
 I was curious about if anyone knows why this is the case, and what current ideas are about the necessity of layer normalization to the transformer.

I need to preprocess such data with a data transformation and model-based data imputation pipeline. Then I need to run train/test fits on a neural net that needs PyTorch and GPU. With this in mind, what is the most cost-effective aws ec2 instance for large data processing that has gpu as well? Right now I’m either running it all on a p3.2xlarge, or I use a c5d.9xlarge for the data preprocessing, save that file and then move back to p3.2xlarge to run the train/test. Second option is not ideal because I’d want to run several tests quickly even when changing around feature engineering or features selected.

 Catastrophic forgetting is a big problem in mutli-task and continual learning. Gradients of different objectives tend to conflict, and new tasks tend to override past knowledge. In biological neural networks, each neuron carries a complex network of dendrites that mitigate such forgetting by recognizing the context of an input signal. This paper introduces Active Dendrites, which carries over the principle of context-sensitive gating by dendrites into the deep learning world. Various experiments show the benefit in combatting catastrophic forgetting, while preserving sparsity and limited parameter counts.

 Artificial intelligence may soon assist more than 6 million1 individuals worldwide who suffer from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in selecting the optimum medication for their illness. An explainable AI pharmacogenomics methodology we created effectively predicted how patients will respond — favorably or negatively — to an IBD treatment 95% of the time, according to research published in PLOSone.
 Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease are caused by clinical, genetic, and environmental variables such as nutrition and lifestyle. Even though all patients have the same symptoms, there is no one-size-fits-all treatment for IBD that is helpful for everybody. Choosing the optimum therapy for a patient is still a trial-and-error procedure for both the doctor and the patient.
 According to researchers at IBM Research in the UK and REPROCELL, a stem cell and fresh tissue research firm, used IBD patient data and explainable AI approaches to study treatment reactions with the help of the STFC Hartree Centre’s Discovery Accelerator. Their objective was to discover the optimum medications for IBD therapies less of a guessing game. The resulting collection of algorithms demonstrated that it was feasible to crack the IBD data black box and comprehend forecast and explain how persons with IBD could react to different medications on the market and under development.

My advisor seems to give me a lot of freedom, by letting me choose my own topic, but has said if it is away from his interests he can't help a lot. He also would apply for funding, once I have a clear topic, which adds even more pressure. He wants me to write a survey paper, so that both of us can know the literature in the field. I've tried looking at the research by AI companies, but most of the areas are completely crowded. 
 Which brings me to my question, how do you go about choosing your topic? Was a broad idea given to you by your advisor? Were you also expected to know everything about your field? How did you have the confidence in selecting a topic, given most of recent papers is just randomly adding/shifting/removing layers (no offense).
 Also, what did you expect/get from your advisor? Given my situation, it seems like I'll have to run the show, which makes me anxious.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So cross-entropy(H(p,q)) and KL-divergence (KL(p||q)) relate to each other as follows:
 H(p,q) = KL(p||q) + H(p) and KL(p||q) = H(p,q) - H(p)
 where p is the data distribution and q is the model distribution. When p is constant (as is the case in most ML problems), minimizing H(p,q) is equivalent to minimizing KL(p||q). However, there seems to be some ambiguity about this. (One practitioner claims)[https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/409271] that there is a difference in practice, because during batch gradient descent the data distribution p' in each batch is noisy and harder learn for the model, leading to worse performance for the KL-divergence.
 I am skeptical about his claim, as H(p) is part of both cross-entropy and KL-divergence, depending on how one views them. If anything, the KL-divergence should work better because it does not directly incorporate H(p). What is your experience / your thoughts?

 At the moment exist any way to avoid facial recognition from social media? Not Fawkes.... Another way because I think AI learned that the picture is modified with this software. It is possible that the software recognize this pictures as fake face? Also combine fawkes with another software as Photoshop could be a good idea to look as another user? In social media the people use Photoshop... I don't know if is still possible to recognize easy
 Thank you

 For a project i need to find a way to extract some "potential user profiles" from firewall logs, such as the pic i attach to this post.
 For example i would like to infer that user A belongs to the "administrative" part of the company whyle Bob belongs to the tecnician department.
 Any hints on how to do this? I taught about using k-means on some certain fields such as destination, source, protocol.
 The problem is that k-means flags different records of the same user with different clusters, and i guess this may not be a good strategy (I might try to use some kind of smoothening in which i flatten the cluster, for example if BoB has labels 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 then bob has cluster 0).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking to adapt GPT-2 to generate dialogue utterances in the style of a certain demography/population (let's call them Ogres). However, there are no large datasets that are both 1) dialogue datasets, and 2) are generated by this target demography.
 In the absence of such data, I have been considering a few approaches for data augmentation purposes. Many of those approaches would benefit from a GPT-Ogre, which is at least capable of generating text similar to Ogres, if not necessarily dialogic.
 Approach 1
 ==========
 For this, I am considering performing additional pre-training of, say, GPT-2 on some medium-sized corpora generated by Ogres. This sounds like something that should have been done by a lot of people for a lot of different things by now, but except for some papers that have tried to do this with BERT in the Medical domain, I was not able to find any papers/GitHub repos that have done this with additional unsupervised pre-training GPT.
 It would be helpful if someone could point me to some resources around this as I feel the space of hyperparameters to figure out the best learning rate, etc. is too large, and if somebody has already done this, it would be easy to replicate it.
 Approach 2
 ==========
 There are some dialogue-specific GPT models such as DialoGPT that have been fine-tuned (in a supervised way; mind you, not pretrained in an unsupervised way). However, it is not in the Ogre style. I am wondering if it's a ridiculous idea to perform additional pre-training of a fine-tuned GPT-2 model?

While promising, standard procedures for designing accelerators customized towards a target application require manual effort to devise a reasonably accurate simulator of hardware, followed by performing many time-intensive simulations to optimize the desired objective (e.g., optimizing for low power usage or latency when running a particular application).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I programmed a neural network "framework" in C++ which uses CUDA. It's my own implementation, and it's probably really slow, since I'm a beginner and don't even know how oop works (it's all one big file). The project is more about understanding the math behind it, but I still want to know the algorithm's performance in relation to some widely used frameworks like TensorFlow or Keras. It does manage to keep the GPU at 80 - 90% usage for a batch sizes of around 25-50 and 32-64 neurons per layer, if that says anything.
 However, is there something like "calculated derivatives per second", as a measurement of the speed of the implementation? That would be really nice to know.
 My implementation updates the network around 13 times per second with a batch size of 50 and a topology of { 6,32,32,6 }. How slow is that?
 I tried to train the network to calculate the acceleration present in a 3 body planet system. It struggles to do so, although the adam optimizer really helped. I think it got the first digit of the acceleration close to consistently right after one night of training, but it seemed, as if the learning speed was accelerating. The topology was { 6,64,64,6 }, batch size 50 and the learning rate 0.025.
 English is not my native language, so please forgive my mistakes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi reddit experts,
 I know that for any machine learning and AI application, you need data in order to train your model. I would like to ask the following:
  
Where does this data usually come from? (For instance, is this data provided by the customer? Your professor? Is it always assumed that this data will be available? Can you trust the source?)
 If you don’t already have this data, will you be asked to implement a system to collect this data?
 Would the accuracy of this data be important to the model? Meaning, let’s say if we wanted to train the model of an AI temperature controller. Would it really matter if the data was just 25 degrees? Versus 25.58 degrees?
 Is it important that this data is sampled fast enough? Meaning, if I only had 1 data point per day, versus 10 data points per minute?
  
Here’s some context to why I’m asking. I’ve been a measurement and instrumentation engineer for a good part of my career. We set up measurement systems that allow customers to collect all kinds of real-world data, including temp, vibration, voltage, images, etc.
 The other day I had a debate with a friend who does AI, where he claimed that “collecting the data" was a trivial effort, because most of time he just uses the data that’s been given to him. But I challenged him, because there's lots of know-how needed in acquiring real-world physical data (for ex: which sensors to use, how to avoid noise, how to synchronize timestamps, etc.) All of this know-how ensures that the collected data is accurate, clean, and complete.
 But he just kinda brushed this off, and said that most ML/AI algorithms nowadays just look at the general trend of data, absolute accuracy doesn’t really matter, but there still needs to be some relative variability, then he can work with it. I’m having a hard time believing this is true. Can anyone shed some light on this subject?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I apologize for the lack of technical knowledge here, as I have a biology background and am so very much out of my wheelhouse here.
 I was wondering if it was possible to just get a neural network that has already been trained to analyze keystroke biometric data and build profiles off of that information. We are having participants type out a sentence from Alice in Wonderland with a character limit of 100 characters.
 Background: I am a forensic science masters student with a biology background. My masters program has a cybercrime course where we have to conduct a research project with a digital forensic focus, and we've had very little guidance thus far. My project group decided to do a keystroke biometric comparison between English typing vs foreign language typing to see if both profiles could be tied back to one individual (eg, does switching between languages when typing affect typing manner and thus change the keystroke profile of one individual). Unfortunately, this has become a much more technical project than anticipated, and , as I mentioned, NONE of us has any real digital background. Our lecturer just sort of left us hanging and said "cool, go build and train your own neural network for this project", while my group has no idea HOW to actually do that.
 Thank you so much for any and all help! As I said, I deeply apologize for my lack of knowledge in this subject, and hope my post here is adequate.

 ​
 Consider an MDP with a single non terminal state and a single action that transitions back to the non-terminal state with probability p and transitions to the terminal state with probability 1-p. Let the reward be +1 on all transitions and let gamma = 1 (discount factor). Suppose you observe one episode that last for 10 steps, with a return of 10. What are the first-visit and every visit estimators of the value of the non terminal state.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I recently enrolled for AI in a local college, I find AI as a whole fascinating. One problem that I've run into is, the concept of user agents.
 From my understanding, user agents are the entities that try to obtain a goal, such as a human playing chess, here the human would be the user agent. The humans sensors would be their eyes and brain. The humans actuators would be their hands. Similarly an autonomous taxi could be a user agent, the taxis sensors could be cameras, speedometer, etc. It's actuators could be steering, breaks, horn, signals etc. 
 If you can tell by the latter example above, I'm currently reading AI: A modern approach(3rd edition).
 My question is; I've learned about some basic search algorithms such as DFS and BFS. I've implemented a DFS algorithm to solve a maze ie get to the exit node. What is my user agent in this program? Is the user agent the algorithm itself(DFS)?? Or do I have to create a class and put the algorithm as a function(I'm using Python).
 Thanks :)

 Text processing AI has made great progress these last years but the main focus is on the English language (understandably). I think that many people are trying to do Natural Language Processing in non-English languages but are disappointed by the results. It is especially hard with text generation models like GPT-3, GPT-J, GPT-NeoX...
 In this article, I'm trying to quickly summarize what the options are today for people trying to use a multilingual AI:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am obsessed with machine learning despite not being very smart at it myself. But specifically, I love it in games. I love interacting with it. I'm looking for more games like these:
 I play NovelAI, Creatures 3, Wobbledogs, AI Dungeon, Replika, and I was going to pick up Species: Artificial Life Real Evolution. Someone made a hook of what I think is GPT 2.7B to Crusader Kings so that you could talk to the different countries' leaders.
 Wobbledogs uses it for dog's walking. Motivation and desire are present. It also has positive / negative reinforcement.
 AI Dungeon, Replika, and NovelAI are all GPT - OpenAI GPT Da Vinci (for AID Dragon), OpenAI GPT 2.0 (of some sort, for Replika), and Fairseq / EleutherAI GPT models (for NovelAI). 
 Creatures 3 was one of the first pseudo(?) neural network games and utilizes motivation, desire, and positive / negative reinforcement.
 Species: Artificial Life Real Evolution is an abandoned game which simulated lifeforms evolving in stressful situations. They don't seem to actually be neural network, but it's close enough to be very interesting - creatures have motivations and desires but do not experience positive / negative reinforcement. There's also 60,000 of them at once... I guess it's sort of also got generational adaptation!
 PS, if anyone wants to obsess over these awesome games with me, let's do it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! We introduce our new paper "On Embeddings for Numerical Features in Tabular Deep Learning".
 Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05556
 Code: https://github.com/Yura52/tabular-dl-num-embeddings
 TL;DR: using embeddings for numerical features (i.e. using vector representations instead of scalar values) can lead to significant profit for tabular DL models.
 Let's consider the vanilla MLP taking two numerical inputs.
 https://preview.redd.it/yb55tdw27wn81.png?width=330&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6fc53e8611baee6993aab47480f0a6a6b85e46c
 Now, here is the same MLP, but now with embeddings for numerical features:

 The main contributions:
  
we show that using vector representations instead of scalar representations for numerical features can lead to significant profit for tabular DL models
 we show that MLP-like models equipped with embeddings can perform on par with Transformer-based models
 we make some progress in the "DL vs GBDT" competition

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FRUFS is a Feature Relevance based Unsupervised Feature Selection approach using supervised algorithms such as XGBoost, etc. This is a new algorithm that I developed and put down in the form of a blog. Here's the link to the article. While reading the blog you will also re-discover an influential research paper in this domain on your own!
 FRUFS was evaluated on 4 different datasets under both unsupervised and supervised settings. The results are available on the blog as well as in the table below.
  
 Dataset Task All Features FRUFS Metric 
  
 MNIST Unsupervised 50.48 53.70 NMI 
  Waveform Unsupervised 38.20 39.67 NMI 
  Ionosphere Supervised 88.01 91.45 Accuracy 
  Adult Supervised 62.16 62.65 F1-score 
 
 ​
 Fig. 1 shows the feature importance of FRUFS (left) in comparison to the actual feature importance (right) on the MNIST dataset. This was done without any labels.

 ​
 I have also developed a scikit-learn compatible library in case you want to use FRUFS for your own project. Here's the github repo. A simple pip install FRUFS will do the trick!
 Do give the blog a read and let me know your thoughts.

Despite a great desire to do so, many blind children and young people with low vision fail to engage and befriend individuals in their age group. This can be extremely difficult for the kid or adolescent, as well as their support network of family members and instructors who wish to assist them in making these crucial connections.
 Microsoft team has recently developed “PeopleLens,” an open-ended AI system that provides additional resources to people who are blind or have low vision to make sense of and interact with their local social settings. The system uses Nreal Light augmented reality glasses connected to a smartphone, allowing them to expand their existing talents and abilities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The NHS is now employing a cutting-edge AI program that can diagnose heart illness in just 20 SECONDS.
  
Experts claim that the computer tool replicates human abilities but with more precision.
 When the patient is in the scanner, it analyses cardiac MRI images in about 20 seconds.
 This is far faster than a human doctor would take, which may take up to 13 minutes.
 It can also identify changes in the heart’s anatomy with a 40 percent higher accuracy.
  
While the patient is in the scanner, the computer tool, which resembles human ability but with more precision and speed, can analyze cardiac MRI data in 20 seconds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was reading the paper Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning and that part wasn't specified, or at least I couldn't find it.
 More specifically, a model is trained to perform n different tasks. At inference, how do people typically inform the model what tasks need to be performed? is it as simple as adding an extra input with the task to be performed, or do people use more sophisticated ways to do that? For example, the paper has an example where they train an NN on sines with different amplitudes and phases. In that case, the inputs are all identical, but the outputs shouldn't be., which in the paper they aren't.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! This is my first post here so sorry if I don't phrase my topic of discussion well. For context, I'm doing a conceptual project about creating a more positive narrative on our future with AI focusing on one aspect of how it can benefit us in our daily lives. It will be an illustrated story to tell said narrative, not so much a research document (not smart enough for that). 
 The question basically is, what are your thoughts about the different ways and areas AI could improve our lives in which it hasn't done so already? Where is AI lacking today? What could it do more of? 
 Ideas can be grounded such as AI robots serving as caretakers for the elderly in their homes or more sci fi-like such as having AI colonize Mars for us instead of humans.
 Go wild! Would love to hear your thoughts!

 If you use analytics data, what type of data do you collect? And how do you A/B test against different models? Is there some tooling available that could help with that?
 Any help is appreciated! :)

The intersection between the computational difficulty and practical importance of quantum chemistry challenges run on quantum computers has long been a focus for Google Quantum AI. We’ve experimentally simulated simple models of chemical bonding, high-temperature superconductivity, nanowires, and even exotic phases of matter such as time crystals on our Sycamore quantum processors. We’ve also developed algorithms suitable for the error-corrected quantum computers we aim to build, including the world’s most efficient algorithm for large-scale quantum computations of chemistry (in the usual way of formulating the problem) and a pioneering approach that allows for us to solve the same problem at an extremely high spatial res…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is a lot of research going on in Active Learning but I feel there is nothing conclusive coming out of this field. A lot of methods are struggling to beat the random sampling baseline.
 For example, they used to publish this promising paper of using drop out for uncertainty estimation:
 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02142.pdf
 But people tried to use it and it was just not performing well. Since then, I am not sure if DL methods can properly bootstrap themselves and identify what they do not know.
 I feel people are just urged to publish papers and it is too easy to fake the numbers and reportedly beating baselines until the next guy tries to reproduce the results.
 Is my skepticism justified? Or are there some methods (links appreciated) that are productively used in the industry?
 Edit:
 To narrow the discussion, i mean active learning in the sense of finding the next samples to label to maximize improvement of the current model performance.

Because of the modest inter-class variances and high intra-class variations, Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) has long been regarded as a difficult assignment.
 The most common FGVC techniques, such as the part-based model and the attention-based model, are primarily focused on how to get the network to focus on the most discriminative regions. The inductive bias of localization is introduced to neural networks with elaborate structure, inspired by human observation behavior.

 When I was working on reinforcement learning agents for games like 2048 before, i would build the game/simulation with pygame, and then also code the agent in python.
 This worked well, but I would like to have the game with the agent playable by others when I'm done in browser.
 SO i am wondering what is the best workflow for getting a game + agent going in javascript?
 Is there a specific game engine/library you would recommend for javascript that is equivalent to pygame? I only know of https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser which seems to be the most popular.
 Also, I have not done any DEEP reinforcement learning, only simple Q learning with Q table. I would like to implement DQN for a game like Uno, but in javascript how would I train the neural net itself in JS? Do people train in tensorflow (python) and then convert to tensorflow.js somehow? This part I am really unsure of and would appreciate any guidance on best path to take. Thankyou!

 It focuses on conditional coverage and diagnostics to make sure your conformal procedure is working properly. It's slightly more advanced than the last one, but will leave you with a strong understanding of how to implement/evaluate conformal in code.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those of us who publish both at ML conferences and in traditional academic journals, it would be incredibly useful to know the impact factor of NeurIPS and other top ‏‏‎ ML conferences. In many non-CS departments, these conferences are still relatively unknown, and so being able to report these numbers internally would be very helpful, particularly to satisfy deans during hiring reviews. While ISI does not officially estimate the impact factor for conferences, this Microsoft page suggests that the impact factor of NeurIPS has a steady state value ~30 - 40. Does anyone have a secondary source for this, or another estimate? I am well aware of the many flaws of using impact factor to estimate the "importance" of a paper. Unfortunately, my university (and I would imagine many others) are stuck with it. Thank you!

People interact with the world through multiple sensory streams (e.g., we see objects, hear sounds, read words, feel textures and taste flavors), combining information and forming associations between senses. As real-world data consists of various signals that co-occur, such as video frames and audio tracks, web images and their captions and instructional videos and speech transcripts, it is natural to apply a similar logic when building and designing multimodal machine learning (ML) models.  
 Effective multimodal models have wide applications — such as multilingual image retrieval, future action prediction, and vision-language navigation — and are important for several reasons; robustness, which …]]></summary>

 To help address that, I wrote a blog called "Making Deep Learning Go Brrrr From First Principles": https://horace.io/brrr_intro.html
 Basically, for most models, there are 3 regimes that you might be spending all of your time on - Compute, Memory-Bandwidth, and Overhead. (If we wanted to be exhaustive, we could also include data-loading (i.e. Disk Bandwidth) and distributed calls (i.e. network bandwidth)).
 Figuring out which one you're bottlenecked by is crucial if you want to spend your time on actually speeding up your model and not trying out random stuff :P
 Hope folks find it useful - happy to clarify/get any feedback here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since the inception of modern machine learning, the goal has been to make workloads that use the technology as efficient as feasible. Considering the nature of the applications, the speed and efficiency of deep learning models (DNNs) have been at the top of the agenda. These applications can do many tasks, from being a cornerstone of the coming autonomous vehicle era to actual analytics. It also proves helpful for businesses to become more user-friendly, profitable, and capable of thwarting cyberattacks.
 Improving the end-to-end performance of deep learning tasks is a previously unexplored territory. A CPU is required for pre-and post-processing and data preparation for difficult Machine Learning work. However, all of these initiatives have not been very successful in addressing all of the issues. The most prevalent architecture is heterogeneous, combining a different CPU core and an accelerator.
 Other efforts have addressed this problem, such as data compression, data movement reduction, and memory bandwidth improvement. An accelerator coherency port (ACP) was devised to increase data transfer performance to request data directly from the CPU’s last level cache rather than using the DMA engine in one situation.
 Northwestern University researchers present a new design that combines a traditional CPU with a systolic convolutional neural network (CNN) accelerator on a single core, resulting in a highly programmable and versatile unified design. The study team says it can achieve a core utilization rate of above 95%. Data transfer is removed, and latency for end-to-end ML operations is minimized using this method.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on a new learning technique in pytorch and have gotten some promising results. It doesn't always work, but when it does it gives a small boost in accuracy at a cost of network size and speed. It seems to be correlated with the ratio of dataset size to original network size. I can use it on a small two layer model on MNIST and boost accuracy from 98% to 99.5%. And I've been able to get it to work on pytorch's baseline 18 layer Resnet on ImageNet. However, I can't do more serious without paying thousands of dollars for AWS testing. I'm looking for any of the following:
 ​
  
Suggestions on any large datasets where the current state of the art architecture and training code are both open source and also can be run on a single GPU.
 Suggestions for applications where a small boost in accuracy would be worth a slowdown and network size isn't a problem.
 Connections with anyone who works for a company in one of those fields who might be open to hearing my pitch and testing it with me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Come ask questions about everything on the new HuggingFace BigScience language model, the dataset, the licences, the cluster!
 BigScience have just started training a massive-scale multilingual language model on the French supercomputer Jean Zay with BigScience – literally out in the open. This is not only the first time a multilingual LLM (46 languages!) at this scale will be fully accessible to the ML research community, but the whole decision, engineering and training process is transparent and open. We'll be training for several months and the community can follow along, engage and ask questions, etc. The Reddit AMA will be with some of our chairs and leading engineers and research scientists like Stas Bekman (Hugging Face), Iz Beltagy (AI2), Julien Launay (LightOn) and many more.
 The model, compute and training
  
176B parameters – 70 layers, 112 attention heads
 384 A100 80GB GPUs– on Jean Zay
 Checkpoint size: only the bf16 weights are 329GB, the full checkpoint with optimizer states is 2.3TB
 Training throughput: about 150 TFLOPs
 Estimated training time: 3-4 months (depending on throughput and unexpected events)

Their goal: synthesise new graphs from a learned distribution of input graphs. While coming up with a new model may be hard, it turns out that a proper comparison of individual models is even harder!
 In this blog post, I briefly summarise our recent ICLR 2022 spotlight paper on evaluating such models. Spoiler alert: kernels make a surprising comeback, but the devil, as always, is in the details.
 Let me know what you think!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm attempting to create a recurrent RL neural network using a LSTM layer but I'm not able to get the model to properly compile. My model looks like this:
 ``` minibatch_size = 32 window_length=10
 tf.keras.Sequential([ # Input => FC => ReLu Input(shape=(*n_states, )), Flatten(), Dense(32, activation="relu"),
 # FC => ReLu Dense(32, activation="relu"), # LSTM ( => tanh ) LSTM(16), # FC => ReLu Dense(16, activation="relu"), # FC => Linear (output action layer) Dense(n_actions, activation="linear") 
 ]) ```
 However when trying to compile the model, I get this error: ValueError: Input 0 of layer "lstm_0" is incompatible with the layer: expected ndim=3, found ndim=2. Full shape received: (None, 32)
 My thinking is that I have to resize the input for some reason and somehow, but I'm not sure what size the LSTM layer is wanting! Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I hope you can clarify this to me.
 I have a neural network that needs to predict five classes. One of those classes is very easy to identify since one of the features is highly connected to that class. So when I train the network, it can predict that mentioned class, but it can not differentiate the others.
 Lets say my classes are 0,1,2,3 and 4 and in the predictions i have these values:
 [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4,
 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4,
 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0,
 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4,
 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
 while the real outputs are like this:
 [4, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 4, 1, 1, 0, 4, 4, 0, 3, 1,
 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 2, 4, 3, 4, 2, 4,
 1, 1, 3, 2, 4, 3, 3, 2, 4, 0, 1, 4, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0,
 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1,
 0, 3, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 0, 4, 3, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
 As you can see class "0" is always predicted correctly.
 Should I then maybe take out this class from the training and just train the nn it with the rest of them?
 Is it possible that since class "0" has a straightforward pattern to detect is not allowing the nn to learn the behaviour of the other classes?
 ​
 I would appreciate it if you could give me some light on this.

 I would like to share a research blogpost overviewing the toolbox enabling Graph Neural Networks to scale to real-world graphs and real-time applications.
 "Recent Advances in Efficient and Scalable Graph Neural Networks"
 Blogpost: https://www.chaitjo.com/post/efficient-gnns/
 Twitter Thread: https://twitter.com/chaitjo/status/1503668741443362817
 Training and deploying GNNs to handle real-world graph data poses several theoretical and engineering challenges: 
  
Giant Graphs – Memory Limitations 
 Sparse Computations – Hardware Limitations 
 Graph Subsampling – Reliability Limitations
  
The blogpost introduces three simple but effective ideas in the 'toolbox' for developing efficient and scalable GNNs: 
  
Data Preparation - From sampling large-scale graphs to CPU-GPU hybrid training via historical node embedding lookups. 
 Efficient Architectures - Graph-augmented MLPs for scaling to giant networks, and efficient graph convolution designs for real-time inference on batches of graph data. 
 Learning Paradigms - Combining Quantization Aware Training (low precision model weights and activations) with Knowledge Distillation (improving efficient GNNs using expressive teacher models) for maximizing inference latency as well as performance.

 Time series are everywhere, in every industry from Energy to Geoscience, etc. Therefore, it is crucial to work on them; In most cases (especially in real-world projects), time-series datasets contain numerous missing data points which are highly connected to the output of prediction. This article gives you a review of the existed methods and then a thorough illustration of GRU-D (based on Gated Recurrent Unit) to deal with missing points. I also, added the code of the model construction for better understanding or utilizing in your possible project.
 This method is certainly useful in most real-world cases because it is usual to have some missing points in gathering and collecting your time-series data. Though the proposed model is for classification, I believe that we can utilize it for regression tasks as well.
 Please share this article with those who might find it interesting or useful in their works. Finally, let me know your impression or your feedback.😉

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wednesday night (3/16), 8-11 pm EDT, FSU professor and computer scientist Dr. Chris Mills will be the guest on Ask_a_Scientist_Gaming. 
 Chris’ research focus started in applications of machine learning to common software development tasks like concept location and traceability link recovery but has since broadened to applications of machine learning across many industries including finance and law. Current projects include building database-agnostic, natural language interfaces for question-and-answer systems with impedance reduction built from off-the-shelf object-relational mapping. With such an interface, users can directly answer questions and query data with no knowledge of a query language and no need to have custom reports constructed for each information need. Think “Jarvis,” but employees play the role of Iron Man at a bank… and a law firm…. and a hospital… and a university…. and the list goes on.
 If you can’t make the live stream, feel free to leave your question in the comments and we will get them answered. Then follow up with our YouTube channel where we will post the video.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At my company we use RL to solve our problem. Basically the agent takes several actions, and the reward is computed as a weighted-sum of multiple sub-objectives.
 So far so good. But the way we build models for the next release is basically : * We train several models, each with different sets of weights for the reward * The QA team selects the best model (and therefore the best reward's weights), according to qualitative results (not quantitative, since the weights changes, the rewards are not really comparable)
 This process makes me uncomfortable. I can't point out exactly why, but I feel that such process will never lead to model's improvement. Instead of training the model on the environment, it feels like we are updating the environment on the model...
  
So my question is : Is it normal to have such a process in industry ? Is it healthy to modify the reward so often and to rely almost only on qualitative results ?
 I'm looking for rational explanation of this feeling I have...

The phrases should not be made up text, rather factual (like come from a source like Wikipedia, medical journal, news source etc). What type of AI model can support this and how?
 Hi Folks,
 I want to build an app that will recall factual phrases based on user input. A good example is a quote finder or lookup chemical formula for a drug etc. So user enters a topic, a question or a clue and I want the AI model to come up with (one or more) relevant answers. Say I want to limit the model for one industry vertical or type of application (like quotes only or medical only etc). 
 I am fairly new to AI usage and have learned and used OpenAI's GPT3 examples recently. I've also build a few small apps using their API.
 I want to know the following:
  
What type of hosted AI engines would support this type of use case? Give specifics. For example, OpenAI's Davinci or GPT-NeoX-20B. 
 What is this type of application of AI called? I know it's not just transformation. It's actually a strong recall and I do not know the technical name for it.
 Tell me something about how do I fine tune the model. I have some datasets for Quotes that I can use. If I train on them, then how can I make sure that the answers the model generates are factually accurate? That is, it's not making them up (as in the case of story completion).
  
Thanks in advance!

 In the world we live in, there are many problems that need to be urgently solved: climate change[1], the risk of a new pandemic[2], wealth inequality[3], the aging population[4] and more. All of these problems are hugely complex and solving them requires vast amounts of intelligence. In order to address that, there’s a tool that comes in very handy: Artificial Intelligence. We are all familiar with AI, but to put it shortly, it’s the intelligence demonstrated by machines[5].

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's the paper and a Twitter summary.
 Abstract:
  
Compute, data, and algorithmic advances are the three fundamental factors that guide the progress of modern Machine Learning (ML). In this paper we study trends in the most readily quantified factor - compute. We show that before 2010 training compute grew in line with Moore's law, doubling roughly every 20 months. Since the advent of Deep Learning in the early 2010s, the scaling of training compute has accelerated, doubling approximately every 6 months. In late 2015, a new trend emerged as firms developed large-scale ML models with 10 to 100-fold larger requirements in training compute. Based on these observations we split the history of compute in ML into three eras: the Pre Deep Learning Era, the Deep Learning Era and the Large-Scale Era. Overall, our work highlights the fast-growing compute requirements for training advanced ML systems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, I wanted to ask some advice/recommendations on what is a good (and as easy to learn/use as possible :) ) platform for building 3D gridworld environments -- which can subsequently be used for training RL models, like the nice environments seen in Deepmind papers e.g. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.06721.pdf (but more accessible to plebs such as I :)
 Key hopes I have:
 - be able build simple rooms, common objects (apples, keys, etc)
 - pick up objects.
 - be able to run these environments on a headless server that does not require a display in order to run, so that I can run it on a university server.
 (I tried a Unity based system over the last several weeks. These allowed me to build pretty nice environments, but trying to get it to work on a headless server with xvfb was a pain that I could not get to work, so if possible, I would like to avoid this problem altogether).
 Thanks for the kind help! :)

I'm not assuming that one architecture is right while the other is wrong, but what do you guys think is the tradeoff between each one of these choices?

 PADL streamlines the entire deep learning workflow, from experimentation to deployment. Its functional API provides a satisfying correspondence to the “box-and-arrow” mental model for deep learning models, with node logic implemented as pure Python functions.
 Try it out for yourself on Colab:
  
CLIP guided diffusion for face editing
 Sentiment Analysis - NLP
  
And read more about PADL on our developer blog! https://devblog.padl.ai/
 You can get easily started with
 pip install padl 
 We look forward to welcoming you into the PADL community, as either a user or a developer! And we would really appreciate getting your feedback.
 Best,
 the LF1 Team

 This project is built using a State-of-the-Art I3D model on the WLASL Dataset. WLASL is the 𝐥𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐯𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐨 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐭 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐖𝐨𝐫𝐝-𝐋𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥 𝐀𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐒𝐢𝐠𝐧 𝐋𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐮𝐚𝐠𝐞 (𝐀𝐒𝐋) 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐠𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧, 𝐰𝐡𝐢𝐜𝐡 𝐟𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬 2,000 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐨𝐧 𝐝𝐢𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐝𝐬 𝐢𝐧 𝐀𝐒𝐋. Therefore, it can predict much more than YES, NO and I LOVE YOU’s!
 To get to know about further details about our project, you can checkout the PPT that we prepared for the demonstration(link is in the comment )
 As a part of this project, we have developed two applications:
  
The first application helps the user to translate the sign language to meaningful sentences in Real-Time. You can check the video to know more about how it works.
 The second application is a Web App built using streamlit and deployed using Ngrok on Colab. It can be used to predict words or sentences after uploading the video of the Signing. The predicted output is inserted as a caption on the uploaded video which can then be downloaded by the user.
  
A big thanks to Crework for all the mentorship and support which helped us to complete our project in due time. We will now be working on improving our project!

 Second, are Andrew ng neural network exercises all four-choice (□□□□) or should they be coded?
 Third, Friends who know, please help and how can you completely solve Andrew ng's theory of coding exercises with this tutorial?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Experts,
 This is my first time creating a neural network, and I have got myself in a bit of a muddle. 
 Context: The neural network take 5 co-ordinates taken from a photo - head, waist, knees, feet - (with a graph overlay) and spits out a category out of 4, all gymnastic shapes - tuck, straddle, pike, straight . 
 I have use Categorical Cross-Entropy to work out my neural networks loss, I have then used Gradient Descent as an optimizer - with the derivative from the Categorical Cross-Entropy equation. I have now found myself attempting (quite blindly) to adjust the weights in my neural network and have no clue what value I should use as "error" in the following equation:
 weight = weight - learning rate * error * input value
 Should I use the output from Categorical Cross-Entropy or Gradient Descent? Or is there an equation I am missing? 
 ANY notes would be helpful to me?
 Note: I have linked my code

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Take a look at the following fascinating observation. On two identically generated datasets S1 and S2 of the same size, train two networks of the same architecture to zero training error. Both networks would have a test error (or, to put it another way, a generalization gap) of about the same size, which is denoted by epsilon.
 Measure the rate of disagreement of the predicted label between these two networks on a new unlabeled dataset U. This disagreement rate could be anything between 0 and 2 epsilon, based on a triangle inequality. However, studies show that the disagreement rate is not only linearly related to the test error but virtually equals it for various training set sizes and models such as neural networks, kernel SVMs, and decision trees.
 What is the source of this unique equality? Solving this unsolved problem could lead to the discovery of basic patterns in how neural networks make mistakes. This could help researchers better understand generalization and other empirical phenomena in deep learning.
 Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University identified a stronger observation first in a recent investigation. Consider two neural networks that were trained with the same hyperparameters and dataset but with different random seeds (for example, the data may be given in various random orders, and/or the network weights could be randomly initialized). Given that both models observe the same data, one would expect the percentage of disagreement to be substantially lower than in previous experiments.

However, how do we have the optimal policy even if it is a hindsight manner? I think getting the optimal policy is the goal of an RL problem. Once the optimal policy is known, the job is done. There's no need to compute a regret value. There must be a huge gap between the regret methods and my understanding...

Then, I trained RL on both envs with same algorithm and hyperparams. If the performance in the environment having extra state info is better than the other, can I conclude that the extra state help to boost performance? I always have concern that what if there exists a set of hyperparams that will make the training on env, which doesn’t have extra state, better than the one has extra info, hence using the same hyperparams is unfair comparison.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys. I'm a new Deep Learning researcher who just started working at a company that focuses on AI-based image manipulation.
 The goal is to design an AI-based solution that takes an edited/retouched input image and apply the edits/retouches style of the user and apply it to the rest of the images automatically
 Example situation:
 Given a bunch of photos of portrait faces, a software user retouch the first portrait by removing blemishes and pimples with an inpainting tool and some local/global enhancement color adjustment, the algorithm needs to know what and where kind of editing has been made and where the thing to remove with inpainting and apply them to the rest of images.
 I have to thought of using an agent (policy network) to interact with the editing software and imitate the user behavior (Few-Shot Imitation Learning) on the first edited examples.
 My questions:
  
What Machine Learning paradigm appears to be suitable for this problem (e.g, Supervised learning, Reinforcement learning).
 Research direction that might be help full to solve the problem.
 Papers that did this kind of research on examplar based user style transfer.
 Any ideas on how to tackle this problem.
  
I wanted to hear what you guys think about it and if you have any idea.

 Outliers are data points that are highly unlikely to be seen in the training distribution, and therefore deep neural networks have troubles when dealing with them. Many approaches to detecting outliers at inference time have been proposed, but most of them show limited success. This paper presents Virtual Outlier Synthesis, which is a method that pairs synthetic outliers, forged in the latent space, with an energy-based regularization of the network at training time. The result is a deep network that can reliably detect outlier datapoints during inference with minimal overhead.

 I am now using a python client for the OpenReview API, and it's easy to add other conferences from OpenReview. I plan to keep the site updated with the next iterations of NeurIPS and ICLR. Let me know if there are other conferences you would like to have overviews for.

Mainly looking in the domain of neural radiance fields (https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf).

 We've just finished our analysis of 83 competitions in 2021, and what winners did.
 Some highlights:
  
Kaggle still dominant with a third of all competitions and half of $2.7m total prize money
 67 of the competitions took place on the top 5 platforms (Kaggle, AIcrowd, Tianchi, DrivenData, and Zindi), but there were 8 competitions which took place on platforms which only ran one competition last year.
 Almost all winners used Python - 1 used C++!
 77% of Deep Learning solutions used PyTorch (up from 72% last year)
 All winning computer vision solutions we found used CNNs
 All winning NLP solutions we found used Transformers
  
More details here: https://blog.mlcontests.com/p/winning-at-competitive-ml-in-2022?
 And if you have a second to help me out, I'd love a like/retweet: https://twitter.com/ml_contests/status/1503068888447262721
 [Update, since people seem quite interested in this]: there's loads more analysis I'd love to do on this data, but I'm just funding this out of my own pocket right now as I find it interesting and I'm using it to promote my (also free) website. If anyone has any suggestions for ways to fund this, I'll try to do something more in-depth next year. I'd love to see for example:
  
How big a difference was there between #1 and #2 solutions? Can we attribute the 'edge' of the winner to anything in particular in a meaningful way? (data augmentation, feature selection, model architecture, compute power, ...)
 How representative is the public leaderboard? How much do people tend to overfit to the public subset of the test set? Are there particular techniques that work well to avoid this?
 Who are the top teams in the industry?
 Which competitions give the best "return on effort"? (i.e. least competition for a given size prize pool)
 Which particular techniques work well for particular types of competitions?
  
Very open to suggestions too :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As described in Sutton's RL book:
 " Rollout algorithms are decision-time planning algorithms based on Monte Carlo control
 applied to simulated trajectories that all begin at the current environment state. They
 estimate action values for a given policy by averaging the returns of many simulated
 trajectories that start with each possible action and then follow the given policy. When
 the action-value estimates are considered to be accurate enough, the action (or one of the
 actions) having the highest estimated value is executed, after which the process is carried
 out anew from the resulting next state." 
 My questions
 1. Since we are following a given policy and simulating begins with a given state. How come there will be different trajectories in a deterministic environment?
 2. How do we do rollout in continuous space?

 I am working on a problem where I have to predict sets of discrete labels, for example [A, T, D, C]. By definition, I am not interested in the order of these labels so the output can also be [A, D, C, T]. I know that using a cross-entropy between the predicted and ground truth sequence would be wrong, as the cross-entropy cares about the order of the labels. Thus, I'd be interested in applying some losses such as the Hungarian loss:

 (From this paper)
 However, all the definitions I find are about continuous variables. Is there a loss, such as the Hungarian one (i.e. that is not order dependent), for discrete labels?

 I would like to share a tool called Kubis that we built to run ML notebooks on AWS with zero experience in AWS services and no configuration required.
 If this is helpful to you, please check us out at kubis.ai
 Kubis got started because we were working on a research project and found ourselves in a position where our local computers were too limited. At the same time getting started with AWS felt complex as we weren’t software engineers. In our case it made more sense to use cloud and we built a notebook that works like Colab but lets us scale quickly to larger machines on AWS.
 Posting it here to see if the community finds it useful. Critique is welcomed :)

 I'm wanting to make a custom environment in openAI gym. My problem is the action space varies depending on the state, and I don't know if I can compute (without brute-forcing it across every state) the max. I saw one solution was to implement a negative reward if an impossible action was selected, but I'm not sure if that is practial for my use case.

 Is there a way to do this or should I just go for an action space larger than practical and hope it never exceeds that?

 Abstract: "Forecasting has always been at the forefront of decision making and planning. The uncertainty that surrounds the future is both exciting and challenging, with individuals and organisations seeking to minimise risks and maximise utilities. The large number of forecasting applications calls for a diverse set of forecasting methods to tackle real-life challenges. This article provides a non-systematic review of the theory and the practice of forecasting. We provide an overview of a wide range of theoretical, state-of-the-art models, methods, principles, and approaches to prepare, produce, organise, and evaluate forecasts. We then demonstrate how such theoretical concepts are applied in a variety of real-life contexts.
 We do not claim that this review is an exhaustive list of methods and applications. However, we wish that our encyclopedic presentation will offer a point of reference for the rich work that has been undertaken over the last decades, with some key insights for the future of forecasting theory and practice. Given its encyclopedic nature, the intended mode of reading is non-linear. We offer cross-references to allow the readers to navigate through the various topics. We complement the theoretical concepts and applications covered by large lists of free or open-source software implementations and publicly-available databases. "

 I'm planning to create a discord server about discussing machine learning in medical imaging, in which we talk about different papers, their implementations, and overall talk a lot about the possibilities and ideas.
 There are tons of great discussion about these kinds of issues on this sub, but I thought maybe a focused discussion server will prove beneficial too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ice protects the Earth layer and its oceans by acting as a shield. Excess heat is reflected into space by these dazzling white spots, keeping the Earth cold. Many glaciers throughout the world have been melting quickly since the early 1900s. Human actions cause this phenomenon. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gas emissions have elevated temperatures since the industrial revolution. 
 Melting glaciers are a contributing factor in rising sea levels, which leads to an increase of coastal erosion and storm surge. Warmer air temperatures lead directly into more frequent storms like hurricanes or typhoons with stronger winds that cause even greater damage on land. Many cities are already planning to deal with long-term flooding, which may carry salt and moisture into houses and infrastructure, jeopardize drinking water and agriculture, and severely damaged ports.
 Given the gravity of the problem, it is critical to understand how much and how quickly sea levels will rise. The projections in the existing predictive models made by scientists are pretty uncertain. Since the contribution from the southernmost continent is so unknown, governments worldwide must consider an unlimited number of scenarios when planning for the future.
 A group of Stanford University scientists employed autonomous drone technology and machine learning approach to focus their efforts on discovering and gathering the most valuable data in Antarctica to increase our understanding of the processes that drive sea-level rise.

I have some level of interest in Machine Learning, my Final Year project being based upon it and all. But most of my interest was for the mathematics behind Machine Learning and AI. And most of the ML projects are just programming on keras and stuff. Like there can be maths involved here, just not the heavy kind like we learn in theory, so is there usually much research going on under AI making or refining mathematical algorithms for AI, instead of just using AI and ML for tasks, and if so what field. Also, I saw some researchers working on making more Biologically inspired Neural Networks, is it more in the AI domain, or more neuroscience domain, and if the latter, can a EE graduate enter this field? And is it maths extensive, like modelling neurons using Control theory and stuff?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's leading up to an important deadline for me and I really need to get these results working by the end of this week. I am an extreme novice with ML, but due to issues with my master thesis I've had to start using it to try and salvage it. 
 I have my sampled dataset, I have my Matlab script all set up, and it works for example datasets etc.
 But I can't seem to get a good result from my data set and I have exhausted a lot of options over the past couple weeks. It's sort of driving me insane because I can't see why it's not working. 
 To summarise, the boundary of the safe and fail classes is very oscillatory (almost sinusoidal, but only peaks and veeery thin peaks at that, and the peaks themselves fluctuate in height). I imagined it should be possible to get a good result out of this dataset as the boundary is quite well defined. I've been using a Gaussian kernel, and when I sample only a small corner of the dataset (e.g imagine only one or two of the "peaks" are in this sample space), it can define the boundary quite well . But once I give the entire sample space to study, it just gets muddled and either gives me a linear looking boundary or just pure garbage... Its probably important to note the dataset is also imbalanced, but I have played around with weights and down-sampling, but it hasn't really helped. 
 If anyone is an expert, particularly with Matlab, and willing to have a quick conversation with me about where I might be going wrong (kernel selection, data sampling, hyper parameter optimisation method, etc) I'd greatly appreciate it!!
 I would upload an image of my dataset, but want to avoid potential issues and whatnot when I submit my thesis.
 Unfortunately I will be going to sleep soon so will check for replies in the morning, but I appreciate any input immensely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm just trying to understand it conceptually. It's background subtraction in a video using mixture of gaussians. So basically, we have to model each pixel in the training frames (video of a road) as a mixture of gaussians, later a car drives across and we have to just get that foreground image out of it.
 I don't understand what the "distribution of each pixel" means. So if i take the (50,50) pixel out of the first 100 frames of the video (it's gray scale), I could get a histogram out of those 100 gray scale values, is that what I'm trying to model? Like model the histogram as N gaussian distributions, like N different clumps of 0-255 values as gaussian distributions to represent that pixel? Or am i completely off.
 If anyone can help explain in simple terms, I'm not worried about the implementation itself more just what the gaussian distributions represents. Like if I was just doing K-means (hard assignments), what would each "cluster" be in this case?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello dear r/MachineLearning fellows, 
 I have an idea which has a following requirement. With given video (mp4 for being simple, twitch clips of gamers for example) I want to generate a compressed (lossy or lossless), downscaled and/or data lost (corrupt) version (or various combinations of above methods) 
 Using this low sized video and combination of upscaling/synthetic replacement (for lossy compression and corruption) I want to generate a video close to the original. The "closeness" is not visual but bit/byte closeness. So my aim is to generate a video with lowest bits of differance (diff of bytes) 
 Most papers on this topic are about generating visually compelling outputs. So I would like to ask how to approach testing for which methods and combination percentages (like %20 downscale %10 compress) would be more beneficial to generate low diff (on byte level) with least data on input video. 
 Also I have a small dataset of 100 videos and I am afraid of overfitting the result, so testing for generalization would be a requirement aswell.

 I'm a newbie in Reinforcement Learning, but I have read a lot of scientific papers, but I'm really not sure if I am on the right track. 
 My problem is, that I'd like to find the optimal parameters that maximize the output value. 
 The output value is computed by a simulation tool - and the simulation is feeded by 200+ input parameters. So you can basically say, that the problem is to optimize an unknown objective function. 
 ​
 Because of that high-dimensionality, the way to go will be probably with policy-gradient RL, or even better actor-critic RL. As I do not have to explore large parts of the space - I only want to find the optimium - I'm guessing that an on-policy algorithm as for example PPO should be the way to go. 
 ​
 Am I right that using PPO could solve my problem or am I totally on the wrong track?
 Thank you very much in advance for your help, I would be really grateful!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Because streaming video might be harmed by flaws introduced during recording, encoding, packing, or transmission, most subscription video services, such as Amazon Prime Video, monitor the quality of the content they stream regularly.
 Manual content review, often known as eyes-on-glass testing, doesn’t scale well and comes with its own set of issues, such as discrepancies in reviewers’ quality judgments. The use of digital signal processing to detect anomalies in the video signal, which are typically associated with faults, is becoming more popular in the business.
 To validate new program releases or offline modifications to encoding profiles, Prime Video’s Video Quality Analysis (VQA) division began employing machine learning three years ago to discover faults in collected footage from devices such as consoles, TVs, and set-top boxes. More recently, Amazon has used the same techniques to solve problems like real-time quality monitoring of our thousands of channels and live events, as well as large-scale content analysis.
 The Amazon team at VQA trains computer vision models to watch a video and detect flaws like blocky frames, unexpected dark frames, and audio noise that could degrade the customer-watching experience. This allows Amazon to process video on a massive scale, allowing them to process hundreds of thousands of live events and catalog items.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have recently started using Isaac gym for simulating robots for deep reinforcement learning. The ability to simulate thousands of robots at once on a normal GPU feels like a total game changer. It seems strange to me that there are still only a handful of teams using it. It then occurred to me that perhaps other physics environments are actual also capable of similar performance if you know how to program them correctly. GPU physics has existed of a long time so it makes sense that there would be other simulators with excellent parallelizability. 
 so my question is: how real is the Isaac gym speed up? 
 Is it something that can be copied by other simulators? 
 If its so much faster why aren't more people using it ?

For example, I know that the state-action value function specifies how good it is for an agent to perform a particular action in a state with a policy π, however, I don’t know how we could define this function for a simple RL example. Does anyone have a thorough example of an RL problem in which basic concepts of RL are defined and explained?

 This is an annotated (side-by-side notes) implementation of RETRO in PyTorch.
 Retrieval Enhanced Transformer (RETRO) is 25X smaller than GPT-3 but has comparable performance. It uses chunks of similar text retrieved based on a frozen BERT model from a massive database (5 trillion tokens) to improve the performance of the model. Since the model can retrieve information from this large database it doesn't have to contain all the facts in the model weights.

 What are the advantages and disadvantages of facial expression capture based on 3D data (with depth camera or other techniques)?
 In the long term, what facial motion capture method/company do you think the most highly of and why?
 Which human body model (skeleton-based model, contour-based model, volume-based model) do you think will most probably become the mainstream model in the future?
 What do you think of the top-down approach and bottom-up approach to Human Pose Estimation? What method/approach do you think is the most suitable for facial expression capture specifically?
  
Let's have an open discussion guys! Please feel free to share any of your thoughts or throw more questions on facial motion capture. Thanks a lot in advance for sharing your thoughts and time! Much appreciated!

 It seems like:
  
small negative rewards (~-1 to -10) are given on every timestep.
 a huge negative reward (-1000 to -10000) is given at the termination of the game.
  
But what is the criteria for the huge negative reward -- is it the number of times you bump into trees? the number of flags you missed? And what is the criterion for termination (timestep of the huge negative reward)? 
 I can't access the raw code of the skiing-v0 (can't find it on github openai gym) so I have been wracking my brain trying to dissect this.
 Thanks in advance for the help! :)

image generation that rivals GANs'. But unlike GANs, DPMs use a set of latent
variables that lack semantic meaning and cannot serve as a useful
representation for other tasks. This paper explores the possibility of using
DPMs for representation learning and seeks to extract a meaningful and
decodable representation of an input image via autoencoding. Our key idea is to
use a learnable encoder for discovering the high-level semantics, and a DPM as
the decoder for modeling the remaining stochastic variations. Our method can
encode any image into a two-part latent code, where the first part is
semantically meaningful and linear, and the second part captures stochastic
details, allowing near-exact reconstruction. This capability enables
challenging applications that currently foil GAN-based methods, such as
attribute manipulation on real images. We also show that this two-level
encoding improves denoising efficiency and naturally facilitates various
downstream tasks including few-shot conditional sampling. Please visit our

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Specialized hardware accelerators have been designed and employed to maximize
the performance efficiency of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). However, such
accelerators are vulnerable to transient faults (i.e., soft errors), which
occur due to high-energy particle strikes, and manifest as bit flips at the
hardware layer. These errors can change the weight values and neuron operations
in the compute engine of SNN accelerators, thereby leading to incorrect outputs
and accuracy degradation. However, the impact of soft errors in the compute
engine and the respective mitigation techniques have not been thoroughly
studied yet for SNNs. A potential solution is employing redundant executions
(re-execution) for ensuring correct outputs, but it leads to huge latency and
energy overheads. Toward this, we propose SoftSNN, a novel methodology to
mitigate soft errors in the weight registers (synapses) and neurons of SNN
accelerators without re-execution, thereby maintaining the accuracy with low
latency and energy overheads. Our SoftSNN methodology employs the following key
steps: (1) analyzing the SNN characteristics under soft errors to identify
faulty weights and neuron operations, which are required for recognizing faulty
SNN behavior; (2) a Bound-and-Protect technique that leverages this analysis to
improve the SNN fault tolerance by bounding the weight values and protecting
the neurons from faulty operations; and (3) devising lightweight hardware
enhancements for the neural hardware accelerator to efficiently support the
proposed technique. The experimental results show that, for a 900-neuron
network with even a high fault rate, our SoftSNN maintains the accuracy
degradation below 3%, while reducing latency and energy by up to 3x and 2.3x
respectively, as compared to the re-execution technique.]]></summary>

expensive black-box functions, but there are many domains where the function is
not completely black-box. The data may have some known structure (e.g.
symmetries) and/or the data generation process can yield useful intermediate or
auxiliary information in addition to the value of the optimization objective.
However, surrogate models traditionally employed in BO, such as Gaussian
Processes (GPs), scale poorly with dataset size and do not easily accommodate
known structure or auxiliary information. Instead, we propose performing BO on
complex, structured problems by using deep learning models with uncertainty, a
class of scalable surrogate models that have the representation power and
flexibility to handle structured data and exploit auxiliary information. We
demonstrate BO on a number of realistic problems in physics and chemistry,
including topology optimization of photonic crystal materials using
convolutional neural networks, and chemical property optimization of molecules
using graph neural networks. On these complex tasks, we show that neural
networks often outperform GPs as surrogate models for BO in terms of both
sampling efficiency and computational cost.]]></summary>

model in fixed-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) with linear function
approximation. Following recent works, we consider broad classes of problems
where either (i) the optimal value function $v^\star$ or (ii) the optimal
action-value function $q^\star$ lie in the linear span of some features; or
(iii) both $v^\star$ and $q^\star$ lie in the linear span when restricted to
the states reachable from the starting state. Recently, Weisz et al. (2021b)
showed that under (ii) the minimax query complexity of any planning algorithm
is at least exponential in the horizon $H$ or in the feature dimension $d$ when
the size $A$ of the action set can be chosen to be exponential in $\min(d,H)$.
On the other hand, for the setting (i), Weisz et al. (2021a) introduced
TensorPlan, a planner whose query cost is polynomial in all relevant quantities
when the number of actions is fixed. Among other things, these two works left
open the question whether polynomial query complexity is possible when $A$ is
subexponential in $\min(d,H)$. In this paper we answer this question in the
negative: we show that an exponentially large lower bound holds when
$A=\Omega(\min(d^{1/4},H^{1/2}))$, under either (i), (ii) or (iii). In
particular, this implies a perhaps surprising exponential separation of query
complexity compared to the work of Du et al. (2021) who prove a polynomial
upper bound when (iii) holds for all states. Furthermore, we show that the
upper bound of TensorPlan can be extended to hold under (iii) and, for MDPs
with deterministic transitions and stochastic rewards, also under (ii).]]></summary>

multilingual applications. In this work, we release a large-scale Chinese
cross-modal dataset named Wukong, containing 100 million Chinese image-text

that Wukong can serve as a promising Chinese pre-training dataset and benchmark

the recently-proposed unpaired image-to-image translation between cell nuclei
images and randomly synthetic masks, existing approaches, e.g., CycleGAN, have
achieved encouraging results. However, these methods usually take a two-stage
pipeline and fail to learn end-to-end in cell nuclei images. More seriously,
they could lead to the lossy transformation problem, i.e., the content
inconsistency between the original images and the corresponding segmentation
output. To address these limitations, we propose a novel end-to-end
unsupervised framework called Aligned Disentangling Generative Adversarial
Network (AD-GAN). Distinctively, AD-GAN introduces representation
disentanglement to separate content representation (the underling spatial
structure) from style representation (the rendering of the structure). With
this framework, spatial structure can be preserved explicitly, enabling a
significant reduction of macro-level lossy transformation. We also propose a
novel training algorithm able to align the disentangled content in the latent
space to reduce micro-level lossy transformation. Evaluations on real-world 2D
and 3D datasets show that AD-GAN substantially outperforms the other comparison
methods and the professional software both quantitatively and qualitatively.
Specifically, the proposed AD-GAN leads to significant improvement over the
current best unsupervised methods by an average 17.8% relatively (w.r.t. the
metric DICE) on four cell nuclei datasets. As an unsupervised method, AD-GAN
even performs competitive with the best supervised models, taking a further
leap towards end-to-end unsupervised nuclei segmentation.]]></summary>

online news services. Meanwhile, several studies show that recommendation
systems(RS) are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, and the attackers have
the ability to mislead the system to perform as their desires. A widely studied
attack approach, injecting fake users, can be applied on the NRS when the NRS
is treated the same as the other systems whose items are fixed. However, in the
NRS, as each item (i.e. news) is more informative, we propose a novel approach
to poison the NRS, which is to perturb contents of some browsed news that
results in the manipulation of the rank of the target news. Intuitively, an
attack is useless if it is highly likely to be caught, i.e., exposed. To
address this, we introduce a notion of the exposure risk and propose a novel
problem of attacking a history news dataset by means of perturbations where the
goal is to maximize the manipulation of the target news rank while keeping the
risk of exposure under a given budget. We design a reinforcement learning
framework, called TDP-CP, which contains a two-stage hierarchical model to
reduce the searching space. Meanwhile, influence estimation is also applied to
save the time on retraining the NRS for rewards. We test the performance of
TDP-CP under three NRSs and on different target news. Our experiments show that
TDP-CP can increase the rank of the target news successfully with a limited
exposure budget.]]></summary>

randomly parametrized Gaussian kernels and a linear output layer, while the
internal weights are fixed to ones. The unknown weights between the hidden and
output layer are computed by Newton's iterations, using the Moore-Penrose
pseudoinverse for low to medium, and sparse QR decomposition with
regularization for medium to large scale systems. To deal with stiffness and
sharp gradients, we propose a variable step size scheme for adjusting the

bounds of the uniform distribution are parsimoniously chosen based on the
bias-variance trade-off. The performance of the scheme is assessed through
seven benchmark problems: four index-1 DAEs, the Robertson model, a model of
five DAEs describing the motion of a bead, a model of six DAEs describing a
power discharge control problem, the chemical Akzo Nobel problem and three
stiff problems, the Belousov-Zhabotinsky, the Allen-Cahn PDE and the
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky PDE. The efficiency of the scheme is compared with three
solvers ode23t, ode23s, ode15s of the MATLAB ODE suite. Our results show that
the proposed scheme outperforms the stiff solvers in several cases, especially
in regimes where high stiffness or sharp gradients arise in terms of numerical
accuracy, while the computational costs are for any practical purposes
comparable.]]></summary>

data owners ({\em a.k.a.} FL participants) to collaboratively train machine
learning models in a privacy-preserving way. A key unaddressed scenario is that
these FL participants are in a competitive market, where market shares
represent their competitiveness. Although they are interested to enhance the
performance of their respective models through FL, market leaders (who are
often data owners who can contribute significantly to building high performance
FL models) want to avoid losing their market shares by enhancing their
competitors' models. Currently, there is no modeling tool to analyze such
scenarios and support informed decision-making. In this paper, we bridge this
gap by proposing the \underline{mar}ket \underline{s}hare-based decision
support framework for participation in \underline{FL} (MarS-FL). We introduce
{\em two notions of $\delta$-stable market} and {\em friendliness} to measure
the viability of FL and the market acceptability of FL. The FL participants'
behaviours can then be predicted using game theoretic tools (i.e., their
optimal strategies concerning participation in FL). If the market
$\delta$-stability is achievable, the final model performance improvement of
each FL-PT shall be bounded, which relates to the market conditions of FL
applications. We provide tight bounds and quantify the friendliness, $\kappa$,
of given market conditions to FL. Experimental results show the viability of FL
in a wide range of market conditions. Our results are useful for identifying
the market conditions under which collaborative FL model training is viable
among competitors, and the requirements that have to be imposed while applying
FL under these conditions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In learning with recurrent or very deep feed-forward networks, employing
unitary matrices in each layer can be very effective at maintaining long-range
stability. However, restricting network parameters to be unitary typically
comes at the cost of expensive parameterizations or increased training runtime.
We propose instead an efficient method based on rank-$k$ updates -- or their
rank-$k$ approximation -- that maintains performance at a nearly optimal
training runtime. We introduce two variants of this method, named Direct
(projUNN-D) and Tangent (projUNN-T) projected Unitary Neural Networks, that can
parameterize full $N$-dimensional unitary or orthogonal matrices with a
training runtime scaling as $O(kN^2)$. Our method either projects low-rank
gradients onto the closest unitary matrix (projUNN-T) or transports unitary
matrices in the direction of the low-rank gradient (projUNN-D). Even in the
fastest setting ($k=1$), projUNN is able to train a model's unitary parameters
to reach comparable performances against baseline implementations. By
integrating our projUNN algorithm into both recurrent and convolutional neural
networks, our models can closely match or exceed benchmarked results from
state-of-the-art algorithms.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Missing data is a systemic problem in practical scenarios that causes noise
and bias when estimating treatment effects. This makes treatment effect
estimation from data with missingness a particularly tricky endeavour. A key
reason for this is that standard assumptions on missingness are rendered
insufficient due to the presence of an additional variable, treatment, besides
the individual and the outcome. Having a treatment variable introduces
additional complexity with respect to why some variables are missing that is
not fully explored by previous work. In our work we identify a new missingness
mechanism, which we term mixed confounded missingness (MCM), where some
missingness determines treatment selection and other missingness is determined
by treatment selection. Given MCM, we show that naively imputing all data leads
to poor performing treatment effects models, as the act of imputation
effectively removes information necessary to provide unbiased estimates.
However, no imputation at all also leads to biased estimates, as missingness
determined by treatment divides the population in distinct subpopulations,
where estimates across these populations will be biased. Our solution is
selective imputation, where we use insights from MCM to inform precisely which
variables should be imputed and which should not. We empirically demonstrate
how various learners benefit from selective imputation compared to other
solutions for missing data.]]></summary>

(cognitive tests) is challenging due to wide variations amongst individuals.
Since no effective treatment exists, prompt and reliable ASD diagnosis can
enable the effective preparation of treatment regimens. This paper proposes
structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI)-based ASD diagnosis via an outlier
detection approach. To learn Spatio-temporal patterns in structural brain
connectivity, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is trained exclusively
with sMRI scans of healthy subjects. Given a stack of three adjacent slices as
input, the GAN generator reconstructs the next three adjacent slices; the GAN
discriminator then identifies ASD sMRI scan reconstructions as outliers. This
model is compared against two other baselines -- a simpler UNet and a
sophisticated Self-Attention GAN. Axial, Coronal, and Sagittal sMRI slices from
the multi-site ABIDE II dataset are used for evaluation. Extensive experiments
reveal that our ASD detection framework performs comparably with the
state-of-the-art with far fewer training data. Furthermore, longitudinal data
(two scans per subject over time) achieve 17-28% higher accuracy than
cross-sectional data (one scan per subject). Among other findings, metrics
employed for model training as well as reconstruction loss computation impact
detection performance, and the coronal modality is found to best encode
structural information for ASD detection.]]></summary>

from unnormalized probability density functions. The PIS is built on the
Schr\"odinger bridge problem which aims to recover the most likely evolution of
a diffusion process given its initial distribution and terminal distribution.
The PIS draws samples from the initial distribution and then propagates the
samples through the Schr\"odinger bridge to reach the terminal distribution.
Applying the Girsanov theorem, with a simple prior diffusion, we formulate the
PIS as a stochastic optimal control problem whose running cost is the control
energy and terminal cost is chosen according to the target distribution. By
modeling the control as a neural network, we establish a sampling algorithm
that can be trained end-to-end. We provide theoretical justification of the
sampling quality of PIS in terms of Wasserstein distance when sub-optimal
control is used. Moreover, the path integrals theory is used to compute
importance weights of the samples to compensate for the bias induced by the
sub-optimality of the controller and time-discretization. We experimentally
demonstrate the advantages of PIS compared with other start-of-the-art sampling
methods on a variety of tasks.]]></summary>

representation perspective. We first introduce a causal formalism of motion
forecasting, which casts the problem as a dynamic process with three groups of
latent variables, namely invariant variables, style confounders, and spurious
features. We then introduce a learning framework that treats each group
separately: (i) unlike the common practice mixing datasets collected from
different locations, we exploit their subtle distinctions by means of an
invariance loss encouraging the model to suppress spurious correlations; (ii)
we devise a modular architecture that factorizes the representations of
invariant mechanisms and style confounders to approximate a sparse causal
graph; (iii) we introduce a style contrastive loss that not only enforces the
structure of style representations but also serves as a self-supervisory signal
for test-time refinement on the fly. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets
show that our proposed method improves the robustness and reusability of
learned motion representations, significantly outperforming prior
state-of-the-art motion forecasting models for out-of-distribution
generalization and low-shot transfer.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Composition is a key feature of differential privacy. Well-known advanced
composition theorems allow one to query a private database quadratically more
times than basic privacy composition would permit. However, these results
require that the privacy parameters of all algorithms be fixed before
interacting with the data. To address this, Rogers et al. introduced fully
adaptive composition, wherein both algorithms and their privacy parameters can
be selected adaptively. The authors introduce two probabilistic objects to
measure privacy in adaptive composition: privacy filters, which provide
differential privacy guarantees for composed interactions, and privacy
odometers, time-uniform bounds on privacy loss. There are substantial gaps
between advanced composition and existing filters and odometers. First,
existing filters place stronger assumptions on the algorithms being composed.
Second, these odometers and filters suffer from large constants, making them
impractical. We construct filters that match the tightness of advanced
composition, including constants, despite allowing for adaptively chosen
privacy parameters. We also construct several general families of odometers.
These odometers can match the tightness of advanced composition at an
arbitrary, preselected point in time, or at all points in time simultaneously,
up to a doubly-logarithmic factor. We obtain our results by leveraging recent
advances in time-uniform martingale concentration. In sum, we show that fully
adaptive privacy is obtainable at almost no loss, and conjecture that our
results are essentially unimprovable (even in constants) in general.]]></summary>

from large amounts of big data. However, the quality of data labels is a
concern because of the lack of high-quality labels in many real-world

deep neural networks, learning from noisy labels (robust training) is becoming
an important task in modern deep learning applications. In this survey, we
first describe the problem of learning with label noise from a supervised
learning perspective. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of 62
state-of-the-art robust training methods, all of which are categorized into
five groups according to their methodological difference, followed by a
systematic comparison of six properties used to evaluate their superiority.
Subsequently, we perform an in-depth analysis of noise rate estimation and
summarize the typically used evaluation methodology, including public noisy
datasets and evaluation metrics. Finally, we present several promising research
directions that can serve as a guideline for future studies. All the contents

of queries required to accurately optimize a target black-box function, given
access to offline evaluations of other auxiliary functions. When offline
datasets are large, the scalability of prior approaches comes at the expense of
expressivity and inference quality. We propose JUMBO, an MBO algorithm that
sidesteps these limitations by querying additional data based on a combination
of acquisition signals derived from training two Gaussian Processes (GP): a
cold-GP operating directly in the input domain and a warm-GP that operates in
the feature space of a deep neural network pretrained using the offline data.
Such a decomposition can dynamically control the reliability of information
derived from the online and offline data and the use of pretrained neural
networks permits scalability to large offline datasets. Theoretically, we
derive regret bounds for JUMBO and show that it achieves no-regret under
conditions analogous to GP-UCB (Srinivas et. al. 2010). Empirically, we
demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing approaches on
two real-world optimization problems: hyper-parameter optimization and
automated circuit design.]]></summary>

amounts of labeled data which is expensive and time consuming to obtain.
However, it has been shown that a small amount of labeled data, while
insufficient to re-train a model, can be effectively used to generate
human-interpretable labeling functions (LFs). These LFs, in turn, have been
used to generate a large amount of additional noisy labeled data, in a paradigm
that is now commonly referred to as data programming. However, previous
approaches to automatically generate LFs make no attempt to further use the
given labeled data for model training, thus giving up opportunities for
improved performance. Moreover, since the LFs are generated from a relatively
small labeled dataset, they are prone to being noisy, and naively aggregating
these LFs can lead to very poor performance in practice. In this work, we
propose an LF based reweighting framework \ouralgo{} to solve these two
critical limitations. Our algorithm learns a joint model on the (same) labeled
dataset used for LF induction along with any unlabeled data in a
semi-supervised manner, and more critically, reweighs each LF according to its
goodness, influencing its contribution to the semi-supervised loss using a
robust bi-level optimization algorithm. We show that our algorithm
significantly outperforms prior approaches on several text classification

data manifolds that contain holes, without discarding any topological

dimensional Euclidean space by learning a coordinate chart, but it requires
that the entire manifold can be embedded in a single chart. This is impossible
for manifolds with holes. In such cases, it is necessary to learn an atlas: a
collection of charts that collectively cover the entire manifold. We begin with
many small charts, and combine them in a bottom-up approach, where charts are
only combined if doing so will not introduce problematic topological features.
When it is no longer possible to combine any charts, each chart is individually
embedded with standard manifold learning techniques, completing the
construction of the atlas. We show the efficacy of our method by constructing
atlases for challenging synthetic manifolds; learning human motion embeddings
from motion capture data; and learning kinematic models of articulated objects.]]></summary>

becomes essential to investigate ways to adapt these models to downstream
datasets. A recently proposed method named Context Optimization (CoOp)
introduces the concept of prompt learning -- a recent trend in NLP -- to the
vision domain for adapting pre-trained vision-language models. Specifically,
CoOp turns context words in a prompt into a set of learnable vectors and, with
only a few labeled images for learning, can achieve huge improvements over
intensively-tuned manual prompts. In our study we identify a critical problem
of CoOp: the learned context is not generalizable to wider unseen classes
within the same dataset, suggesting that CoOp overfits base classes observed
during training. To address the problem, we propose Conditional Context
Optimization (CoCoOp), which extends CoOp by further learning a lightweight
neural network to generate for each image an input-conditional token (vector).
Compared to CoOp's static prompts, our dynamic prompts adapt to each instance
and are thus less sensitive to class shift. Extensive experiments show that
CoCoOp generalizes much better than CoOp to unseen classes, even showing
promising transferability beyond a single dataset; and yields stronger domain
generalization performance as well. Code is available at

nature of scatterplots of points. In particular, if two points are close in a
scatterplot of points derived from high-dimensional data, it does not generally
follow that the two associated data points are close in the data space.
Standard Andrews plots provide scatterplots of curves that perfectly preserve
Euclidean distances, but simultaneous visualization of these graphs over an
entire dataset produces visual clutter because graphs of functions generally
overlap in 2D. We mitigate this visual clutter issue by constructing
computationally inexpensive 3D extensions of Andrews plots. First, we construct
optimally smooth 3D Andrews plots by considering linear isometries from
Euclidean data spaces to spaces of planar parametric curves. We rigorously
parametrize the linear isometries that produce (on average) optimally smooth
curves over a given dataset. This parameterization of optimal isometries
reveals many degrees of freedom, and (using recent results on generalized Gauss
sums) we identify a particular member of this set which admits an asymptotic
"tour" property that avoids certain local degeneracies as well. Finally, we
construct unit-length 3D curves (filaments) by numerically solving
Frenet-Serret systems given data from these 3D Andrews plots. We conclude with
examples of filament plots for several standard datasets, illustrating how
filament plots avoid visual clutter. Code and examples available at

performance in a variety of tasks, out-performing human-designed networks.
However, most NAS methods heavily rely on human-defined assumptions that
constrain the search: architecture's outer-skeletons, number of layers,
parameter heuristics and search spaces. Additionally, common search spaces
consist of repeatable modules (cells) instead of fully exploring the
architecture's search space by designing entire architectures (macro-search).
Imposing such constraints requires deep human expertise and restricts the
search to pre-defined settings. In this paper, we propose LCMNAS, a method that
pushes NAS to less constrained search spaces by performing macro-search without
relying on pre-defined heuristics or bounded search spaces. LCMNAS introduces
three components for the NAS pipeline: i) a method that leverages information
about well-known architectures to autonomously generate complex search spaces
based on Weighted Directed Graphs with hidden properties, ii) a evolutionary
search strategy that generates complete architectures from scratch, and iii) a
mixed-performance estimation approach that combines information about
architectures at initialization stage and lower fidelity estimates to infer
their trainability and capacity to model complex functions. We present
experiments showing that LCMNAS generates state-of-the-art architectures from
scratch with minimal GPU computation. We study the importance of different NAS
components on a macro-search setting. Code for reproducibility is public at

inevitably accompanied by a significant amount of computational cost for
learning and deployment, which may be incompatible with their usage on edge
devices. Recent efforts to reduce these overheads involve pruning and
decomposing the parameters of various layers without performance deterioration.
Inspired by several decomposition studies, in this paper, we propose a novel
energy-aware pruning method that quantifies the importance of each filter in
the network using nuclear-norm (NN). Proposed energy-aware pruning leads to
state-of-the-art performance for Top-1 accuracy, FLOPs, and parameter reduction
across a wide range of scenarios with multiple network architectures on
CIFAR-10 and ImageNet after fine-grained classification tasks. On toy
experiment, without fine-tuning, we can visually observe that NN has a minute
change in decision boundaries across classes and outperforms the previous
popular criteria. We achieve competitive results with 40.4/49.8% of FLOPs and
45.9/52.9% of parameter reduction with 94.13/94.61% in the Top-1 accuracy with
ResNet-56/110 on CIFAR-10, respectively. In addition, our observations are
consistent for a variety of different pruning setting in terms of data size as
well as data quality which can be emphasized in the stability of the
acceleration and compression with negligible accuracy loss.]]></summary>

(cryo-EM), the Multi-Reference Alignment (MRA) model entails the learning of an
unknown signal from repeated measurements of its images under the latent action
of a group of isometries and additive noise of magnitude $\sigma$. Despite
significant interest, a clear picture for understanding rates of estimation in
this model has emerged only recently, particularly in the high-noise regime
$\sigma \gg 1$ that is highly relevant in applications. Recent investigations
have revealed a remarkable asymptotic sample complexity of order $\sigma^6$ for
certain signals whose Fourier transforms have full support, in stark contrast
to the traditional $\sigma^2$ that arise in regular models. Often prohibitively
large in practice, these results have prompted the investigation of variations
around the MRA model where better sample complexity may be achieved. In this
paper, we show that sparse signals exhibit an intermediate $\sigma^4$ sample
complexity even in the classical MRA model. Further, we characterise the
dependence of the estimation rate on the support size $s$ as $O_p(1)$ and
$O_p(s^{3.5})$ in the dilute and moderate regimes of sparsity respectively. Our
techniques have implications for the problem of crystallographic phase
retrieval, indicating a certain local uniqueness for the recovery of sparse
signals from their power spectrum. Our results explore and exploit connections
of the MRA estimation problem with two classical topics in applied mathematics:
the beltway problem from combinatorial optimization, and uniform uncertainty
principles from harmonic analysis. Our techniques include a certain enhanced
form of the probabilistic method, which might be of general interest in its own
right.]]></summary>

a computational bottleneck in statistical manifold learning when observations

for approximation in statistical manifold learning. The novelty of our
approximation is the strongly consistent distance estimators based on

By exploiting the connection between Hellinger/total variation distance for
discrete distributions and the L2/L1 norm, we demonstrate that the proposed
distance estimators, combined with approximate nearest neighbor searching,
could largely improve the computational efficiency with little to no loss in
the accuracy of manifold embedding. The result is robust to different manifold
learning algorithms and different approximate nearest neighbor algorithms. The
proposed method is applied to learning statistical manifolds of electricity

unknown, it is still unclear if DRL agents are attaining near-optimal
performance in general or if there is still a large gap to bridge.

In this paper, we investigate the performance of DRL agents compared to the
theoretically optimal solution. To that end, we leverage Physically Consistent
Neural Networks (PCNNs) as simulation environments, for which optimal control
inputs are easy to compute. Furthermore, PCNNs solely rely on data to be

complexity of a statistical model, and has found broad applications in machine
learning and statistical signal processing. In a high-dimensional learning
problem, the gauge function attempts to safeguard against overfitting by
promoting a sparse (concise) representation within the learning alphabet.

In this work, within the context of linear inverse problems, we pinpoint the
source of its success, but also argue that the applicability of the gauge
function is inherently limited by its convexity, and showcase several learning
problems where the classical gauge function theory fails. We then introduce a
new notion of statistical complexity, gauge$_p$ function, which overcomes the
limitations of the gauge function. The gauge$_p$ function is a simple
generalization of the gauge function that can tightly control the sparsity of a
statistical model within the learning alphabet and, perhaps surprisingly, draws
further inspiration from the Burer-Monteiro factorization in computational
mathematics.

We also propose a new learning machine, with the building block of gauge$_p$
function, and arm this machine with a number of statistical guarantees. The
potential of the proposed gauge$_p$ function theory is then studied for two
stylized applications. Finally, we discuss the computational aspects and, in

distillation (KD) can boost the accuracy of a small, cheap detection model by
leveraging useful information from a larger teacher model. However, a key
challenge is identifying the most informative features produced by the teacher
for distillation. In this work, we show that only a very small fraction of
features within a ground-truth bounding box are responsible for a teacher's
high detection performance. Based on this, we propose Prediction-Guided
Distillation (PGD), which focuses distillation on these key predictive regions
of the teacher and yields considerable gains in performance over many existing
KD baselines. In addition, we propose an adaptive weighting scheme over the key
regions to smooth out their influence and achieve even better performance. Our

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many wireless networks, including 5G NR (New Radio) and future beyond 5G
cellular systems, are expected to operate on multiple frequency bands. This
paper considers the band assignment (BA) problem in dual-band systems, where
the basestation (BS) chooses one of the two available frequency bands
(centimeter-wave and millimeter-wave bands) to communicate with the user
equipment (UE). While the millimeter-wave band might offer higher data rate,
there is a significant probability of outage during which the communication
should be carried on the (more reliable) centimeter-wave band. With mobility,
the BA can be perceived as a sequential problem, where the BS uses previously
observed information to predict the best band for a future time step.

We formulate the BA as a binary classification problem and propose supervised
Machine Learning (ML) solutions. We study the problem when both the BS and the
UE use (i) omnidirectional antennas and (ii) both use directional antennas. In
the omnidirectional case, we derive analytical benchmark solutions based on the
Gaussian Process (GP) assumption for the inter-band shadow fading. In the
directional case, where the labeling is shown to be complex, we propose an
efficient labeling approach based on the Viterbi Algorithm (VA). We compare the
performances for two channel models: (i) a stochastic channel and (ii) a
ray-tracing based channel.]]></summary>

interpretability are crucial for decision support systems. Linear regression is
one of the most interpretable prediction models. However, the linearity in a
simple linear regression worsens its predictability. In this work, we introduce
a locally adaptive interpretable regression (LoAIR). In LoAIR, a metamodel
parameterized by neural networks predicts percentile of a Gaussian distribution
for the regression coefficients for a rapid adaptation. Our experimental
results on public benchmark datasets show that our model not only achieves
comparable or better predictive performance than the other state-of-the-art
baselines but also discovers some interesting relationships between input and
target variables such as a parabolic relationship between CO2 emissions and
Gross National Product (GNP). Therefore, LoAIR is a step towards bridging the
gap between econometrics, statistics, and machine learning by improving the
predictive ability of linear regression without depreciating its
interpretability.]]></summary>

on tabular data problems. Unlike traditional models, e.g., MLP, these
architectures map scalar values of numerical features to high-dimensional
embeddings before mixing them in the main backbone. In this work, we argue that
embeddings for numerical features are an underexplored degree of freedom in
tabular DL, which allows constructing more powerful DL models and competing
with GBDT on some traditionally GBDT-friendly benchmarks. We start by
describing two conceptually different approaches to building embedding modules:
the first one is based on a piecewise linear encoding of scalar values, and the
second one utilizes periodic activations. Then, we empirically demonstrate that
these two approaches can lead to significant performance boosts compared to the
embeddings based on conventional blocks such as linear layers and ReLU
activations. Importantly, we also show that embedding numerical features is
beneficial for many backbones, not only for Transformers. Specifically, after
proper embeddings, simple MLP-like models can perform on par with the
attention-based architectures. Overall, we highlight that embeddings for
numerical features are an important design aspect, which has good potential for
further improvements in tabular DL.]]></summary>

multiple models with various hyperparameters and (2) pick the individual model
which performs best on a held-out validation set, discarding the remainder. In
this paper, we revisit the second step of this procedure in the context of
fine-tuning large pre-trained models, where fine-tuned models often appear to
lie in a single low error basin. We show that averaging the weights of multiple
models fine-tuned with different hyperparameter configurations often improves
accuracy and robustness. Unlike a conventional ensemble, we may average many
models without incurring any additional inference or memory costs -- we call
the results "model soups." When fine-tuning large pre-trained models such as
CLIP, ALIGN, and a ViT-G pre-trained on JFT, our soup recipe provides
significant improvements over the best model in a hyperparameter sweep on
ImageNet. As a highlight, the resulting ViT-G model attains 90.94% top-1
accuracy on ImageNet, a new state of the art. Furthermore, we show that the
model soup approach extends to multiple image classification and natural
language processing tasks, improves out-of-distribution performance, and
improves zero-shot performance on new downstream tasks. Finally, we
analytically relate the performance similarity of weight-averaging and
logit-ensembling to flatness of the loss and confidence of the predictions, and
validate this relation empirically.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Understanding the deep representations of complex networks is an important
step of building interpretable and trustworthy machine learning applications in
the age of internet. Global surrogate models that approximate the predictions
of a black box model (e.g. an artificial or biological neural net) are usually
used to provide valuable theoretical insights for the model interpretability.
In order to evaluate how well a surrogate model can account for the
representation in another model, we need to develop inference methods for model
comparison. Previous studies have compared models and brains in terms of their
representational geometries (characterized by the matrix of distances between
representations of the input patterns in a model layer or cortical area). In
this study, we propose to explore these summary statistical descriptions of
representations in models and brains as part of a broader class of statistics
that emphasize the topology as well as the geometry of representations. The
topological summary statistics build on topological data analysis (TDA) and
other graph-based methods. We evaluate these statistics in terms of the
sensitivity and specificity that they afford when used for model selection,
with the goal to relate different neural network models to each other and to
make inferences about the computational mechanism that might best account for a
black box representation. These new methods enable brain and computer
scientists to visualize the dynamic representational transformations learned by
brains and models, and to perform model-comparative statistical inference.]]></summary>

retrieval. Between the two, the dual encoder encodes the image and text
independently followed by a dot product, while the cross encoder jointly feeds
image and text as the input and performs dense multi-modal fusion. These two
architectures are typically modeled separately without interaction. In this
work, we propose LoopITR, which combines them in the same network for joint
learning. Specifically, we let the dual encoder provide hard negatives to the
cross encoder, and use the more discriminative cross encoder to distill its
predictions back to the dual encoder. Both steps are efficiently performed
together in the same model. Our work centers on empirical analyses of this
combined architecture, putting the main focus on the design of the distillation
objective. Our experimental results highlight the benefits of training the two
encoders in the same network, and demonstrate that distillation can be quite
effective with just a few hard negative examples. Experiments on two standard

to deploy machine learning models to embedded AI processors with highly

post-training quantization (PTQ) algorithms that quantize a model to low-bit
(less than 8-bit) precision with only a small set of calibration data and
benchmark them on different tinyML use cases. To achieve a fair comparison, we
build a simulated quantization framework to investigate recent PTQ algorithms.
Furthermore, we break down those algorithms into essential components and
re-assembled a generic PTQ pipeline. With ablation study on different
alternatives of components in the pipeline, we reveal key design choices when
performing low precision quantization. We hope this work could provide useful

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In classical statistics, the bias-variance trade-off describes how varying a
model's complexity (e.g., number of fit parameters) affects its ability to make
accurate predictions. According to this trade-off, optimal performance is
achieved when a model is expressive enough to capture trends in the data, yet
not so complex that it overfits idiosyncratic features of the training data.
Recently, it has become clear that this classic understanding of the
bias-variance must be fundamentally revisited in light of the incredible
predictive performance of "overparameterized models" -- models that avoid
overfitting even when the number of fit parameters is large enough to perfectly
fit the training data. Here, we present results for one of the simplest
examples of an overparameterized model: regression with random linear features
(i.e. a two-layer neural network with a linear activation function). Using the
zero-temperature cavity method, we derive analytic expressions for the training
error, test error, bias, and variance. We show that the linear random features
model exhibits three phase transitions: two different transitions to an
interpolation regime where the training error is zero, along with an additional
transition between regimes with large bias and minimal bias. Using random
matrix theory, we show how each transition arises due to small nonzero
eigenvalues in the Hessian matrix. Finally, we compare and contrast the phase
diagram of the random linear features model to the random nonlinear features
model and ordinary regression, highlighting the new phase transitions that
result from the use of linear basis functions.]]></summary>

relies on composition theorems, where the implicit assumption is that the
internal state of the iterative algorithm is revealed to the adversary.
However, by assuming hidden states for DP algorithms (when only the
last-iterate is observable), recent works prove a converging privacy bound for
noisy gradient descent (on strongly convex smooth loss function) that is
significantly smaller than composition bounds after $O(1/\text{step-size})$
epochs. In this paper, we extend this hidden-state analysis to the noisy
mini-batch stochastic gradient descent algorithms on strongly-convex smooth
loss functions. We prove converging R\'enyi DP bounds under various mini-batch
sampling schemes, such as "shuffle and partition" (which are used in practical
implementations of DP-SGD) and "sampling without replacement". We prove that,
in these settings, our privacy bound is much smaller than the composition bound
for training with a large number of iterations (which is the case for learning
from high-dimensional data). Our converging privacy analysis, thus, shows that
differentially private learning, with a tight bound, needs hidden state privacy
analysis or a fast convergence. To complement our theoretical results, we run
experiment on training classification models on MNIST, FMNIST and CIFAR-10
datasets, and observe a better accuracy given fixed privacy budgets, under the
hidden-state analysis.]]></summary>

the exponential growth of the state-action space. Considering a homogeneous
multiagent system, a global state consisting of $m$ homogeneous components has
$m!$ differently ordered representations, thus designing functions satisfying
permutation invariant (PI) can reduce the state space by a factor of
$\frac{1}{m!}$. However, mainstream MARL algorithms ignore this property and
learn over the original state space. To achieve PI, previous works including
data augmentation based methods and embedding-sharing architecture based
methods, suffer from training instability and limited model capacity. In this
work, we propose two novel designs to achieve PI, while avoiding the above
limitations. The first design permutes the same but differently ordered inputs
back to the same order and the downstream networks only need to learn function
mapping over fixed-ordering inputs instead of all permutations, which is much
easier to train. The second design applies a hypernetwork to generate
customized embedding for each component, which has higher representational
capacity than the previous embedding-sharing method. Empirical results on the
SMAC benchmark show that the proposed method achieves 100% win-rates in almost
all hard and super-hard scenarios (never achieved before), and superior

symmetries and of interest in a variety of applications context such as node
role detection, cluster synchronization, consensus dynamics, and network
control problems. In this work we study a blind identification problem in which
we aim to recover an equitable partition of a network without the knowledge of
the network's edges but based solely on the observations of the outputs of an
unknown graph filter. Specifically, we consider two settings. First, we
consider a scenario in which we can control the input to the graph filter and
present a method to extract the partition inspired by the well known
Weisfeiler-Lehman (color refinement) algorithm. Second, we generalize this idea
to a setting where only observe the outputs to random, low-rank excitations of
the graph filter, and present a simple spectral algorithm to extract the
relevant equitable partitions. Finally, we establish theoretical bounds on the
error that this spectral detection scheme incurs and perform numerical
experiments that illustrate our theoretical results and compare both
algorithms.]]></summary>

detection, which makes it possible to train strong 3D detector with
position-level annotations (i.e. annotations of object centers). In order to
remedy the information loss from box annotations to centers, our method, namely
Back to Reality (BR), makes use of synthetic 3D shapes to convert the weak
labels into fully-annotated virtual scenes as stronger supervision, and in turn
utilizes the perfect virtual labels to complement and refine the real labels.
Specifically, we first assemble 3D shapes into physically reasonable virtual
scenes according to the coarse scene layout extracted from position-level
annotations. Then we go back to reality by applying a virtual-to-real domain
adaptation method, which refine the weak labels and additionally supervise the
training of detector with the virtual scenes. Furthermore, we propose a more
challenging benckmark for indoor 3D object detection with more diversity in
object sizes to better show the potential of BR. With less than 5% of the
labeling labor, we achieve comparable detection performance with some popular
fully-supervised approaches on the widely used ScanNet dataset. Code is

communication and computation resources. However, all devices need to finish
training by the same deadline dictated by the server when applying synchronous
FL, as we consider in this paper. Reducing the complexity of the trained neural
network (NN) at constrained devices, i.e., by dropping neurons/filters, is
insufficient as it tightly couples reductions in communication and computation
requirements, wasting resources. Quantization has proven effective to
accelerate inference, but quantized training suffers from accuracy losses. We
present a novel mechanism that quantizes during training parts of the NN to
reduce the computation requirements, freezes them to reduce the communication
and computation requirements, and trains the remaining parts in full precision
to maintain a high convergence speed and final accuracy. Using this mechanism,
we present the first FL technique that independently optimizes for specific
communication and computation constraints in FL: CoCo-FL. We show that CoCo-FL
reaches a much higher convergence speed than the state of the art and a
significantly higher final accuracy.]]></summary>

convergence of the conditional mean to the response function. We prove that the
maximum likelihood and cross-validation estimates of the smoothness parameter

fixed bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$. That is, if the data-generating
response function has Sobolev smoothness $\nu_0 + d/2$, then the smoothness

These results are based on a general theorem, proved using reproducing kernel

distributed learning, where the learning model can be cut into multiple
portions to be trained at the participants collaboratively. The participants
only exchange the intermediate learning results at the cut layer, including
smashed data via forward-pass (i.e., features extracted from the raw data) and
gradients during backward-propagation.Understanding the security performance of
split learning is critical for various privacy-sensitive applications.With the
emphasis on private labels, this paper proposes a passive clustering label
inference attack for practical split learning. The adversary (either clients or
servers) can accurately retrieve the private labels by collecting the exchanged
gradients and smashed data.We mathematically analyse potential label leakages
in split learning and propose the cosine and Euclidean similarity measurements
for clustering attack. Experimental results validate that the proposed approach
is scalable and robust under different settings (e.g., cut layer positions,

Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Specifically, the Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN), initially used for computer vision, has shown remarkable
performance for text data in various NLP problems. Most of the existing
CNN-based models use 1-dimensional convolving filters n-gram detectors), where
each filter specialises in extracting n-grams features of a particular input
word embedding. The input word embeddings, also called sentence matrix, is
treated as a matrix where each row is a word vector. Thus, it allows the model
to apply one-dimensional convolution and only extract n-gram based features
from a sentence matrix. These features can be termed as intra-sentence n-gram
features. To the extent of our knowledge, all the existing CNN models are based
on the aforementioned concept. In this paper, we present a CNN-based
architecture TextConvoNet that not only extracts the intra-sentence n-gram
features but also captures the inter-sentence n-gram features in input text
data. It uses an alternative approach for input matrix representation and
applies a two-dimensional multi-scale convolutional operation on the input. To
evaluate the performance of TextConvoNet, we perform an experimental study on
five text classification datasets. The results are evaluated by using various
performance metrics. The experimental results show that the presented
TextConvoNet outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning

gestures conditioned on multi-modal data is still an unsolved problem, due to
the lack of available datasets, models and standard evaluation metrics. To
address this, we build Body-Expression-Audio-Text dataset, BEAT, which has i)
76 hours, high-quality, multi-modal data captured from 30 speakers talking with
eight different emotions and in four different languages, ii) 32 millions
frame-level emotion and semantic relevance annotations.Our statistical analysis
on BEAT demonstrates the correlation of conversational gestures with facial
expressions, emotions, and semantics, in addition to the known correlation with
audio, text, and speaker identity. Qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate metrics' validness, ground truth data quality, and baseline's
state-of-the-art performance. To the best of our knowledge, BEAT is the largest
motion capture dataset for investigating the human gestures, which may
contribute to a number of different research fields including controllable
gesture synthesis, cross-modality analysis, emotional gesture recognition. The
data, code and model will be released for research.]]></summary>

the concept of equivalence classes: manifold modeling in quotient space (MMQS).
In MMQS, we do not consider a set of local patches of the image as it is, but
rather the set of their canonical patches obtained by introducing the concept
of equivalence classes and performing manifold learning on their canonical
patches. Canonical patches represent equivalence classes, and their
auto-encoder constructs a manifold in the quotient space. Based on this
framework, we produce a novel manifold-based image model by introducing
rotation-flip-equivalence relations. In addition, we formulate an image
reconstruction problem by fitting the proposed image model to a corrupted
observed image and derive an algorithm to solve it. Our experiments show that
the proposed image model is effective for various self-supervised image
reconstruction tasks, such as image inpainting, deblurring, super-resolution,

research. Cohorts impact downstream analyses, such as how a condition is
characterized, how patient risk is defined, and what treatments are studied. It
is thus critical to ensure that selected cohorts are representative of all
patients, independently of their demographics or social determinants of health.
While there are multiple potential sources of bias when constructing phenotype
definitions which may affect their fairness, it is not standard in the field of
phenotyping to consider the impact of different definitions across subgroups of
patients. In this paper, we propose a set of best practices to assess the
fairness of phenotype definitions. We leverage established fairness metrics
commonly used in predictive models and relate them to commonly used
epidemiological cohort description metrics. We describe an empirical study for
Crohn's disease and diabetes type 2, each with multiple phenotype definitions
taken from the literature across two sets of patient subgroups (gender and
race). We show that the different phenotype definitions exhibit widely varying
and disparate performance according to the different fairness metrics and
subgroups. We hope that the proposed best practices can help in constructing
fair and inclusive phenotype definitions.]]></summary>

infinite-dimensional function spaces with the capacity to process heterogeneous
discrete representations of functions as inputs and/or outputs of a learning

between the encoder and decoder. This basic building block is applied in
parallel in a wide multi-channel structure, which are repeatedly composed to
form a deep and densely connected neural network with skip connections as
IAE-Net. IAE-Net is trained with randomized data augmentation that generates
training data with heterogeneous structures to facilitate the performance of
discretization invariant learning. The proposed IAE-Net is tested with various
applications in predictive data science, solving forward and inverse problems

variety of domains , detailed analysis of time series data (via Forecasting and
Anomaly Detection) leads to a better understanding of how events associated
with a specific time instance behave. Time Series Analysis (TSA) is commonly
performed with plots and traditional models. Machine Learning (ML) approaches ,
on the other hand , have seen an increase in the state of the art for
Forecasting and Anomaly Detection because they provide comparable results when
time and data constraints are met. A number of time series toolboxes are
available that offer rich interfaces to specific model classes (ARIMA/filters ,
neural networks) or framework interfaces to isolated time series modelling
tasks (forecasting , feature extraction , annotation , classification).
Nonetheless , open source machine learning capabilities for time series remain
limited , and existing libraries are frequently incompatible with one another.
The goal of this paper is to provide a concise and user friendly overview of
the most important open source tools for time series analysis. This article
examines two related toolboxes (1) forecasting and (2) anomaly detection. This
paper describes a typical Time Series Analysis (TSA) framework with an
architecture and lists the main features of TSA framework. The tools are
categorized based on the criteria of analysis tasks completed , data
preparation methods employed , and evaluation methods for results generated.
This paper presents quantitative analysis and discusses the current state of
actively developed open source Time Series Analysis frameworks. Overall , this
article considered 60 time series analysis tools , and 32 of which provided

opposite directions, utilizing powerful decoder model for generating realistic
images but collapsing the learned representation, or increasing regularization
coefficient for disentangling representation but ultimately generating blurry
examples. Existing methods narrow the issues to the rate-distortion trade-off
between compression and reconstruction. We argue that a good reconstruction
model does learn high capacity latents that encode more details, however, its
use is hindered by two major issues: the prior is random noise which is
completely detached from the posterior and allow no controllability in the
generation; mean-field variational inference doesn't enforce hierarchy
structure which makes the task of recombining those units into plausible novel
output infeasible. As a result, we develop a system that learns a hierarchy of
disentangled representation together with a mechanism for recombining the
learned representation for generalization. This is achieved by introducing a
minimal amount of inductive bias to learn controllable prior for the VAE. The
idea is supported by here developed transitive information theory, that is, the
mutual information between two target variables could alternately be maximized
through the mutual information to the third variable, thus bypassing the
rate-distortion bottleneck in VAE design. In particular, we show that our
model, named SemafoVAE (inspired by the similar concept in computer science),
could generate high-quality examples in a controllable manner, perform smooth
traversals of the disentangled factors and intervention at a different level of
representation hierarchy.]]></summary>

efficient than their model-free counterparts, especially in sparse reward
problems. Unfortunately, many interesting domains are too complex to specify
the complete models required by traditional model-based approaches. Learning a
model takes a large number of environment samples, and may not capture critical
information if the environment is hard to explore. If we could specify an
incomplete model and allow the agent to learn how best to use it, we could take
advantage of our partial understanding of many domains. Existing hybrid
planning and learning systems which address this problem often impose highly
restrictive assumptions on the sorts of models which can be used, limiting
their applicability to a wide range of domains. In this work we propose SAGE,
an algorithm combining learning and planning to exploit a previously unusable

offered by large-scale language models to overcome some of their challenges
with respect to grounding to factual and up-to-date information. Motivated by
semi-parametric language models, which ground their decisions in external
retrieved evidence, we use few-shot prompting to learn to condition language
models on information returned from the web using Google Search, a broad and
constantly updated knowledge source. Our approach does not involve fine-tuning
or learning additional parameters, thus making it applicable to any language
model, offering like this a strong baseline. Indeed, we find that language
models conditioned on the web surpass performance of closed-book models of
similar, or even larger, model sizes in open-domain question answering.
Finally, we find that increasing the inference-time compute of models, achieved
via using multiple retrieved evidences to generate multiple answers followed by
a reranking stage, alleviates generally decreased performance of smaller
few-shot language models. All in all, our findings suggest that it might be
beneficial to slow down the race towards the biggest model and instead shift
the attention towards finding more effective ways to use models, including but

Frank-Wolfe policy optimization to address frame-level bit allocation for
HEVC/H.265. Most previous RL-based approaches adopt the single-critic design,
which weights the rewards for distortion minimization and rate regularization
by an empirically chosen hyper-parameter. More recently, the dual-critic design
is proposed to update the actor network by alternating the rate and distortion
critics. However, the convergence of training is not guaranteed. To address
this issue, we introduce Neural Frank-Wolfe Policy Optimization (NFWPO) in
formulating the frame-level bit allocation as an action-constrained RL problem.
In this new framework, the rate critic serves to specify a feasible action set,
and the distortion critic updates the actor network towards maximizing the
reconstruction quality while conforming to the action constraint. Experimental
results show that when trained to optimize the video multi-method assessment
fusion (VMAF) metric, our NFWPO-based model outperforms both the single-critic
and the dual-critic methods. It also demonstrates comparable rate-distortion
performance to the 2-pass average bit rate control of x265.]]></summary>

multiple iterations of human annotations to learn additional rules for
detecting informal data mentions. These examples are then used to train an NLP

or more teams decide to collaborate towards a common goal, with the intention
of gaining an unfair advantage from this cooperation. The task of identifying
colluders from the player population is however infeasible to game designers
due to the sheer size of the player population. In this paper, we propose a
system that detects colluding behaviors in team-based multiplayer games and
highlights the players that most likely exhibit colluding behaviors. The game
designers then proceed to analyze a smaller subset of players and decide what
action to take. For this reason, it is important and necessary to be extremely
careful with false positives when automating the detection. The proposed method
analyzes the players' social relationships paired with their in-game behavioral
patterns and, using tools from graph theory, infers a feature set that allows
us to detect and measure the degree of collusion exhibited by each pair of
players from opposing teams. We then automate the detection using Isolation

outliers, and show the performance and efficiency of our approach on two real

physico-chemical processes exhibiting highly non-smooth dynamics is
challenging. In this work, we propose new developments and perform comparisons
for two promising approaches: manifold-based polynomial chaos expansion (m-PCE)
and the deep neural operator (DeepONet), and we examine the effect of
over-parameterization on generalization. We demonstrate the performance of
these methods in terms of generalization accuracy by solving the 2D
time-dependent Brusselator reaction-diffusion system with uncertainty sources,
modeling an autocatalytic chemical reaction between two species. We first
propose an extension of the m-PCE by constructing a mapping between latent
spaces formed by two separate embeddings of input functions and output QoIs. To
enhance the accuracy of the DeepONet, we introduce weight self-adaptivity in
the loss function. We demonstrate that the performance of m-PCE and DeepONet is
comparable for cases of relatively smooth input-output mappings. However, when
highly non-smooth dynamics is considered, DeepONet shows higher accuracy. We
also find that for m-PCE, modest over-parameterization leads to better
generalization, both within and outside of distribution, whereas aggressive
over-parameterization leads to over-fitting. In contrast, an even highly
over-parameterized DeepONet leads to better generalization for both smooth and
non-smooth dynamics. Furthermore, we compare the performance of the above
models with another operator learning model, the Fourier Neural Operator, and
show that its over-parameterization also leads to better generalization. Our
studies show that m-PCE can provide very good accuracy at very low training
cost, whereas a highly over-parameterized DeepONet can provide better accuracy
and robustness to noise but at higher training cost. In both methods, the
inference cost is negligible.]]></summary>

comfort response, instead of the average response of a large group. Recently,
machine learning algorithms have proven to be having enormous potential as a
candidate for personal thermal comfort models. But, often within the normal
settings of a building, personal thermal comfort data obtained via experiments
are heavily class-imbalanced. There are a disproportionately high number of
data samples for the "Prefer No Change" class, as compared with the "Prefer
Warmer" and "Prefer Cooler" classes. Machine learning algorithms trained on
such class-imbalanced data perform sub-optimally when deployed in the real
world. To develop robust machine learning-based applications using the above
class-imbalanced data, as well as for privacy-preserving data sharing, we
propose to implement a state-of-the-art conditional synthetic data generator to
generate synthetic data corresponding to the low-frequency classes. Via
experiments, we show that the synthetic data generated has a distribution that
mimics the real data distribution. The proposed method can be extended for use

temporal, structural, and contextual information on temporal graphs. The
generated temporal node embeddings outperform other methods in many downstream
tasks. Real-world applications require high performance inference on real-time
streaming dynamic graphs. However, these models usually rely on complex
attention mechanisms to capture relationships between temporal neighbors. In
addition, maintaining vertex memory suffers from intrinsic temporal data
dependency that hinders task-level parallelism, making it inefficient on
general-purpose processors. In this work, we present a novel model-architecture
co-design for inference in memory-based TGNNs on FPGAs. The key modeling
optimizations we propose include a light-weight method to compute attention
scores and a related temporal neighbor pruning strategy to further reduce
computation and memory accesses. These are holistically coupled with key
hardware optimizations that leverage FPGA hardware. We replace the temporal
sampler with an on-chip FIFO based hardware sampler and the time encoder with a
look-up-table. We train our simplified models using knowledge distillation to
ensure similar accuracy vis-\'a-vis the original model. Taking advantage of the
model optimizations, we propose a principled hardware architecture using
batching, pipelining, and prefetching techniques to further improve the
performance. We also propose a hardware mechanism to ensure the chronological
vertex updating without sacrificing the computation parallelism. We evaluate
the performance of the proposed hardware accelerator on three real-world

gained much popularity in recent years, due to the various challenges faced in
ML, like the requirement of vast amounts of training data, expensive and
time-consuming labelling processes for data samples, and long training duration
for models. TL is useful in tackling these problems, as it focuses on
transferring knowledge from previously solved tasks to new tasks. Digital twins
and other intelligent systems need to utilise TL to use the previously gained
knowledge and solve new tasks in a more self-reliant way, and to incrementally
increase their knowledge base. Therefore, in this article, the critical
challenges in power forecasting and anomaly detection in the context of
renewable energy systems are identified, and a potential TL framework to meet
these challenges is proposed. This article also proposes a feature embedding
approach to handle the missing sensors data. The proposed TL methods help to

ODEs into a teacher-student learning process, in which we propose ResNets as
the teacher model to provide richer supervised information. The experimental
results show that the new training manner can improve the classification
accuracy of Neural ODEs by 24% on CIFAR10 and 5% on SVHN. In addition, we also
quantitatively discuss the effect of both knowledge distillation and time

unveils a fundamental dichotomy between value spaces: whether finite-horizon

propose a mild integrability condition under which there exist algorithms for

Why does a linear structure emerge when the networks become wide? In this work,
we provide a new perspective on this "transition to linearity" by considering a
neural network as an assembly model recursively built from a set of sub-models
corresponding to individual neurons. In this view, we show that the linearity
of wide neural networks is, in fact, an emerging property of assembling a large

in acoustic data but abundant in text-only corpora (typed search logs).
However, such corpora have properties that hinder downstream performance,
including being (1) too large, (2) beset with domain-mismatched content, and
(3) heavy-headed rather than heavy-tailed (excessively many duplicate search
queries such as "weather"). We show that three simple strategies for selecting
language modeling data can dramatically improve rare-word recognition without
harming overall performance. First, to address the heavy-headedness, we
downsample the data according to a soft log function, which tunably reduces
high frequency (head) sentences. Second, to encourage rare-word exposure, we
explicitly filter for words rare in the acoustic data. Finally, we tackle
domain-mismatch via perplexity-based contrastive selection, filtering for
examples matched to the target domain. We down-select a large corpus of web
search queries by a factor of 53x and achieve better LM perplexities than
without down-selection. When shallow-fused with a state-of-the-art, production
speech engine, our LM achieves WER reductions of up to 24% relative on
rare-word sentences (without changing overall WER) compared to a baseline LM
trained on the raw corpus. These gains are further validated through favorable
side-by-side evaluations on live voice search traffic.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The development of face recognition algorithms by academic and commercial
organizations is growing rapidly due to the onset of deep learning and the
widespread availability of training data. Though tests of face recognition
algorithm performance indicate yearly performance gains, error rates for many
of these systems differ based on the demographic composition of the test set.
These "demographic differentials" in algorithm performance can contribute to
unequal or unfair outcomes for certain groups of people, raising concerns with
increased worldwide adoption of face recognition systems. Consequently,
regulatory bodies in both the United States and Europe have proposed new rules
requiring audits of biometric systems for "discriminatory impacts" (European
Union Artificial Intelligence Act) and "fairness" (U.S. Federal Trade
Commission). However, no standard for measuring fairness in biometric systems
yet exists. This paper characterizes two proposed measures of face recognition
algorithm fairness (fairness measures) from scientists in the U.S. and Europe.
We find that both proposed methods are challenging to interpret when applied to
disaggregated face recognition error rates as they are commonly experienced in
practice. To address this, we propose a set of interpretability criteria,
termed the Functional Fairness Measure Criteria (FFMC), that outlines a set of
properties desirable in a face recognition algorithm fairness measure. We
further develop a new fairness measure, the Gini Aggregation Rate for Biometric
Equitability (GARBE), and show how, in conjunction with the Pareto
optimization, this measure can be used to select among alternative algorithms
based on the accuracy/fairness trade-space. Finally, we have open-sourced our
dataset of machine-readable, demographically disaggregated error rates. We
believe this is currently the largest open-source dataset of its kind.]]></summary>

describe causal inference for application in a novel clinical design called
basket trial that tests how well a new drug works in patients who have
different types of cancer that all have the same mutation. We propose a
multi-task adversarial learning (MTAL) method, which incorporates feature
selection multi-task representation learning and adversarial learning to
estimate potential outcomes across different tumor types for patients sharing
the same genetic mutation but having different tumor types. In our paper, the
basket trial is employed as an intuitive example to present this new causal
inference setting. This new causal inference setting includes, but is not
limited to basket trials. This setting has the same challenges as the
traditional causal inference problem, i.e., missing counterfactual outcomes
under different subgroups and treatment selection bias due to confounders. We
present the practical advantages of our MTAL method for the analysis of
synthetic basket trial data and evaluate the proposed estimator on two

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As engineered systems grow in complexity, there is an increasing need for
automatic methods that can detect, diagnose, and even correct transient
anomalies that inevitably arise and can be difficult or impossible to diagnose
and fix manually. Among the most sensitive and complex systems of our
civilization are the detectors that search for incredibly small variations in
distance caused by gravitational waves -- phenomena originally predicted by
Albert Einstein to emerge and propagate through the universe as the result of
collisions between black holes and other massive objects in deep space. The
extreme complexity and precision of such detectors causes them to be subject to
transient noise issues that can significantly limit their sensitivity and
effectiveness.

In this work, we present a demonstration of a method that can detect and
characterize emergent transient anomalies of such massively complex systems. We
illustrate the performance, precision, and adaptability of the automated
solution via one of the prevalent issues limiting gravitational-wave
discoveries: noise artifacts of terrestrial origin that contaminate
gravitational wave observatories' highly sensitive measurements and can obscure
or even mimic the faint astrophysical signals for which they are listening.
Specifically, we demonstrate how a highly interpretable convolutional
classifier can automatically learn to detect transient anomalies from auxiliary
detector data without needing to observe the anomalies themselves. We also
illustrate several other useful features of the model, including how it
performs automatic variable selection to reduce tens of thousands of auxiliary
data channels to only a few relevant ones; how it identifies behavioral
signatures predictive of anomalies in those channels; and how it can be used to
investigate individual anomalies and the channels associated with them.]]></summary>

over a network. The problem generalizes the well-studied risk-neutral
finite-sum distributed optimization problem and its importance stems from the
need to handle risk in an uncertain environment. For algorithms in the
literature, there exists a gap in communication complexities for solving
risk-averse and risk-neutral problems. We propose two distributed algorithms,
namely the distributed risk averse optimization (DRAO) method and the
distributed risk averse optimization with sliding (DRAO-S) method, to close the
gap. Specifically, the DRAO method achieves the optimal communication
complexity by assuming a certain saddle point subproblem can be easily solved
in the server node. The DRAO-S method removes the strong assumption by
introducing a novel saddle point sliding subroutine which only requires the
projection over the ambiguity set $P$. We observe that the number of
$P$-projections performed by DRAO-S is optimal. Moreover, we develop matching
lower complexity bounds to show that communication complexities of both DRAO
and DRAO-S are not improvable. Numerical experiments are conducted to
demonstrate the encouraging empirical performance of the DRAO-S method.]]></summary>

time-constrained applications requires optimization of memory and computational
complexity of the networks, usually by quantizing the weights. Most of the
existing works employ linear quantization which causes considerable degradation
in accuracy for weight bit widths lower than 8. Since the distribution of
weights is usually non-uniform (with most weights concentrated around zero),
other methods, such as logarithmic quantization, are more suitable as they are
able to preserve the shape of the weight distribution more precise. Moreover,
using base-2 logarithmic representation allows optimizing the multiplication by
replacing it with bit shifting. In this paper, we explore non-linear
quantization techniques for exploiting lower bit precision and identify
favorable hardware implementation options. We developed the Quantization Aware
Training (QAT) algorithm that allowed training of low bit width Power-of-Two
(PoT) networks and achieved accuracies on par with state-of-the-art floating
point models for different tasks. We explored PoT weight encoding techniques
and investigated hardware designs of MAC units for three different quantization
schemes - uniform, PoT and Additive-PoT (APoT) - to show the increased
efficiency when using the proposed approach. Eventually, the experiments showed
that for low bit width precision, non-uniform quantization performs better than
uniform, and at the same time, PoT quantization vastly reduces the
computational complexity of the neural network.]]></summary>

based computer-aided detection systems shows promising potential in improving
the curability and mortality rates of breast cancer. However, many clinical
centres are restricted in the amount and heterogeneity of available data to
train such models to (i) achieve promising performance and to (ii) generalise
well across acquisition protocols and domains. As sharing data between centres
is restricted due to patient privacy concerns, we propose a potential solution:
sharing trained generative models between centres as substitute for real
patient data. In this work, we use three well known mammography datasets to
simulate three different centres, where one centre receives the trained
generator of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) from the two remaining
centres in order to augment the size and heterogeneity of its training dataset.
We evaluate the utility of this approach on mammography patch classification on
the test set of the GAN-receiving centre using two different classification
models, (a) a convolutional neural network and (b) a transformer neural
network. Our experiments demonstrate that shared GANs notably increase the
performance of both transformer and convolutional classification models and
highlight this approach as a viable alternative to inter-centre data sharing.]]></summary>

model in fixed-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) with linear function
approximation. Following recent works, we consider broad classes of problems
where either (i) the optimal value function $v^\star$ or (ii) the optimal
action-value function $q^\star$ lie in the linear span of some features; or
(iii) both $v^\star$ and $q^\star$ lie in the linear span when restricted to
the states reachable from the starting state. Recently, Weisz et al. (2021b)
showed that under (ii) the minimax query complexity of any planning algorithm
is at least exponential in the horizon $H$ or in the feature dimension $d$ when
the size $A$ of the action set can be chosen to be exponential in $\min(d,H)$.
On the other hand, for the setting (i), Weisz et al. (2021a) introduced
TensorPlan, a planner whose query cost is polynomial in all relevant quantities
when the number of actions is fixed. Among other things, these two works left
open the question whether polynomial query complexity is possible when $A$ is
subexponential in $\min(d,H)$. In this paper we answer this question in the
negative: we show that an exponentially large lower bound holds when
$A=\Omega(\min(d^{1/4},H^{1/2}))$, under either (i), (ii) or (iii). In
particular, this implies a perhaps surprising exponential separation of query
complexity compared to the work of Du et al. (2021) who prove a polynomial
upper bound when (iii) holds for all states. Furthermore, we show that the
upper bound of TensorPlan can be extended to hold under (iii) and, for MDPs
with deterministic transitions and stochastic rewards, also under (ii).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Missing data is a systemic problem in practical scenarios that causes noise
and bias when estimating treatment effects. This makes treatment effect
estimation from data with missingness a particularly tricky endeavour. A key
reason for this is that standard assumptions on missingness are rendered
insufficient due to the presence of an additional variable, treatment, besides
the individual and the outcome. Having a treatment variable introduces
additional complexity with respect to why some variables are missing that is
not fully explored by previous work. In our work we identify a new missingness
mechanism, which we term mixed confounded missingness (MCM), where some
missingness determines treatment selection and other missingness is determined
by treatment selection. Given MCM, we show that naively imputing all data leads
to poor performing treatment effects models, as the act of imputation
effectively removes information necessary to provide unbiased estimates.
However, no imputation at all also leads to biased estimates, as missingness
determined by treatment divides the population in distinct subpopulations,
where estimates across these populations will be biased. Our solution is
selective imputation, where we use insights from MCM to inform precisely which
variables should be imputed and which should not. We empirically demonstrate
how various learners benefit from selective imputation compared to other
solutions for missing data.]]></summary>

of space curves simultaneously with "drag-to-rotate" interfaces. This inspires
us to replace "scatterplots of points" with "scatterplots of curves" to
simultaneously visualize relationships across an entire dataset. Since spaces
of curves are infinite dimensional, scatterplots of curves avoid the "lossy"
nature of scatterplots of points. In particular, if two points are close in a
scatterplot of points derived from high-dimensional data, it does not generally
follow that the two associated data points are close in the data space.
Standard Andrews plots provide scatterplots of curves that perfectly preserve
Euclidean distances, but simultaneous visualization of these graphs over an
entire dataset produces visual clutter because graphs of functions generally
overlap in 2D. We mitigate this visual clutter issue by constructing
computationally inexpensive 3D extensions of Andrews plots. First, we construct
optimally smooth 3D Andrews plots by considering linear isometries from
Euclidean data spaces to spaces of planar parametric curves. We rigorously
parametrize the linear isometries that produce (on average) optimally smooth
curves over a given dataset. This parameterization of optimal isometries
reveals many degrees of freedom, and (using recent results on generalized Gauss
sums) we identify a particular member of this set which admits an asymptotic
"tour" property that avoids certain local degeneracies as well. Finally, we
construct unit-length 3D curves (filaments) by numerically solving
Frenet-Serret systems given data from these 3D Andrews plots. We conclude with
examples of filament plots for several standard datasets, illustrating how
filament plots avoid visual clutter. Code and examples available at

(cryo-EM), the Multi-Reference Alignment (MRA) model entails the learning of an
unknown signal from repeated measurements of its images under the latent action
of a group of isometries and additive noise of magnitude $\sigma$. Despite
significant interest, a clear picture for understanding rates of estimation in
this model has emerged only recently, particularly in the high-noise regime
$\sigma \gg 1$ that is highly relevant in applications. Recent investigations
have revealed a remarkable asymptotic sample complexity of order $\sigma^6$ for
certain signals whose Fourier transforms have full support, in stark contrast
to the traditional $\sigma^2$ that arise in regular models. Often prohibitively
large in practice, these results have prompted the investigation of variations
around the MRA model where better sample complexity may be achieved. In this
paper, we show that sparse signals exhibit an intermediate $\sigma^4$ sample
complexity even in the classical MRA model. Further, we characterise the
dependence of the estimation rate on the support size $s$ as $O_p(1)$ and
$O_p(s^{3.5})$ in the dilute and moderate regimes of sparsity respectively. Our
techniques have implications for the problem of crystallographic phase
retrieval, indicating a certain local uniqueness for the recovery of sparse
signals from their power spectrum. Our results explore and exploit connections
of the MRA estimation problem with two classical topics in applied mathematics:
the beltway problem from combinatorial optimization, and uniform uncertainty
principles from harmonic analysis. Our techniques include a certain enhanced
form of the probabilistic method, which might be of general interest in its own
right.]]></summary>

challenging and so far under-explored task. We introduce a novel
semi-supervised probabilistic approach to cluster survival data by leveraging
recent advances in stochastic gradient variational inference. In contrast to
previous work, our proposed method employs a deep generative model to uncover
the underlying distribution of both the explanatory variables and censored
survival times. We compare our model to the related work on clustering and
mixture models for survival data in comprehensive experiments on a wide range
of synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets, including medical
imaging data. Our method performs better at identifying clusters and is
competitive at predicting survival times. Relying on novel generative
assumptions, the proposed model offers a holistic perspective on clustering
survival data and holds a promise of discovering subpopulations whose survival
is regulated by different generative mechanisms.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many wireless networks, including 5G NR (New Radio) and future beyond 5G
cellular systems, are expected to operate on multiple frequency bands. This
paper considers the band assignment (BA) problem in dual-band systems, where
the basestation (BS) chooses one of the two available frequency bands
(centimeter-wave and millimeter-wave bands) to communicate with the user
equipment (UE). While the millimeter-wave band might offer higher data rate,
there is a significant probability of outage during which the communication
should be carried on the (more reliable) centimeter-wave band. With mobility,
the BA can be perceived as a sequential problem, where the BS uses previously
observed information to predict the best band for a future time step.

We formulate the BA as a binary classification problem and propose supervised
Machine Learning (ML) solutions. We study the problem when both the BS and the
UE use (i) omnidirectional antennas and (ii) both use directional antennas. In
the omnidirectional case, we derive analytical benchmark solutions based on the
Gaussian Process (GP) assumption for the inter-band shadow fading. In the
directional case, where the labeling is shown to be complex, we propose an
efficient labeling approach based on the Viterbi Algorithm (VA). We compare the
performances for two channel models: (i) a stochastic channel and (ii) a
ray-tracing based channel.]]></summary>

from large amounts of big data. However, the quality of data labels is a
concern because of the lack of high-quality labels in many real-world

an important task in modern deep learning applications. In this survey, we
first describe the problem of learning with label noise from a supervised
learning perspective. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of 62
state-of-the-art robust training methods, all of which are categorized into
five groups according to their methodological difference, followed by a
systematic comparison of six properties used to evaluate their superiority.
Subsequently, we perform an in-depth analysis of noise rate estimation and
summarize the typically used evaluation methodology, including public noisy
datasets and evaluation metrics. Finally, we present several promising research
directions that can serve as a guideline for future studies. All the contents

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Differential privacy analysis of randomized learning algorithms typically
relies on composition theorems, where the implicit assumption is that the
internal state of the iterative algorithm is revealed to the adversary.
However, by assuming hidden states for DP algorithms (when only the
last-iterate is observable), recent works prove a converging privacy bound for
noisy gradient descent (on strongly convex smooth loss function) that is
significantly smaller than composition bounds after $O(1/\text{step-size})$
epochs. In this paper, we extend this hidden-state analysis to the noisy
mini-batch stochastic gradient descent algorithms on strongly-convex smooth
loss functions. We prove converging R\'enyi DP bounds under various mini-batch
sampling schemes, such as "shuffle and partition" (which are used in practical
implementations of DP-SGD) and "sampling without replacement". We prove that,
in these settings, our privacy bound is much smaller than the composition bound
for training with a large number of iterations (which is the case for learning
from high-dimensional data). Our converging privacy analysis, thus, shows that
differentially private learning, with a tight bound, needs hidden state privacy
analysis or a fast convergence. To complement our theoretical results, we run
experiment on training classification models on MNIST, FMNIST and CIFAR-10
datasets, and observe a better accuracy given fixed privacy budgets, under the
hidden-state analysis.]]></summary>

propose a mild integrability condition under which there exist algorithms for

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In classical statistics, the bias-variance trade-off describes how varying a
model's complexity (e.g., number of fit parameters) affects its ability to make
accurate predictions. According to this trade-off, optimal performance is
achieved when a model is expressive enough to capture trends in the data, yet
not so complex that it overfits idiosyncratic features of the training data.
Recently, it has become clear that this classic understanding of the
bias-variance must be fundamentally revisited in light of the incredible
predictive performance of "overparameterized models" -- models that avoid
overfitting even when the number of fit parameters is large enough to perfectly
fit the training data. Here, we present results for one of the simplest
examples of an overparameterized model: regression with random linear features
(i.e. a two-layer neural network with a linear activation function). Using the
zero-temperature cavity method, we derive analytic expressions for the training
error, test error, bias, and variance. We show that the linear random features
model exhibits three phase transitions: two different transitions to an
interpolation regime where the training error is zero, along with an additional
transition between regimes with large bias and minimal bias. Using random
matrix theory, we show how each transition arises due to small nonzero
eigenvalues in the Hessian matrix. Finally, we compare and contrast the phase
diagram of the random linear features model to the random nonlinear features
model and ordinary regression, highlighting the new phase transitions that
result from the use of linear basis functions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Physics-based and first-principles models pervade the engineering and
physical sciences, allowing for the ability to model the dynamics of complex
systems with a prescribed accuracy. The approximations used in deriving
governing equations often result in discrepancies between the model and
sensor-based measurements of the system, revealing the approximate nature of
the equations and/or the signal-to-noise ratio of the sensor itself. In modern
dynamical systems, such discrepancies between model and measurement can lead to
poor quantification, often undermining the ability to produce accurate and
precise control algorithms. We introduce a discrepancy modeling framework to
resolve deterministic model-measurement mismatch with two distinct approaches:
(i) by learning a model for the evolution of systematic state-space residual,
and (ii) by discovering a model for the missing deterministic physics.
Regardless of approach, a common suite of data-driven model discovery methods
can be used. Specifically, we use four fundamentally different methods to
demonstrate the mathematical implementations of discrepancy modeling: (i) the
sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), (ii) dynamic mode
decomposition (DMD), (iii) Gaussian process regression (GPR), and (iv) neural
networks (NN). The choice of method depends on one's intent for discrepancy
modeling, as well as quantity and quality of the sensor measurements. We
demonstrate the utility and suitability for both discrepancy modeling
approaches using the suite of data-driven modeling methods on three dynamical
systems under varying signal-to-noise ratios. We compare reconstruction and
forecasting accuracies and provide detailed comparatives, allowing one to
select the appropriate approach and method in practice.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We propose a regularization method for ensemble Kalman filtering (EnKF) with
elliptic observation operators. Commonly used EnKF regularization methods
suppress state correlations at long distances. For observations described by
elliptic partial differential equations, such as the pressure Poisson equation
(PPE) in incompressible fluid flows, distance localization cannot be applied,
as we cannot disentangle slowly decaying physical interactions from spurious
long-range correlations. This is particularly true for the PPE, in which
distant vortex elements couple nonlinearly to induce pressure. Instead, these
inverse problems have a low effective dimension: low-dimensional projections of
the observations strongly inform a low-dimensional subspace of the state space.
We derive a low-rank factorization of the Kalman gain based on the spectrum of
the Jacobian of the observation operator. The identified eigenvectors
generalize the source and target modes of the multipole expansion,
independently of the underlying spatial distribution of the problem. Given
rapid spectral decay, inference can be performed in the low-dimensional
subspace spanned by the dominant eigenvectors. This low-rank EnKF is assessed
on dynamical systems with Poisson observation operators, where we seek to
estimate the positions and strengths of point singularities over time from
potential or pressure observations. We also comment on the broader
applicability of this approach to elliptic inverse problems outside the context
of filtering.]]></summary>

(DNN) that we call "Deep Regression Ensembles" (DRE). It bridges the gap
between DNN and two-layer neural networks trained with random feature
regression. Each layer of DRE has two components, randomly drawn input weights
and output weights trained myopically (as if the final output layer) using
linear ridge regression. Within a layer, each neuron uses a different subset of
inputs and a different ridge penalty, constituting an ensemble of random
feature ridge regressions. Our experiments show that a single DRE architecture
is at par with or exceeds state-of-the-art DNN in many data sets. Yet, because
DRE neural weights are either known in closed-form or randomly drawn, its
computational cost is orders of magnitude smaller than DNN.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Composition is a key feature of differential privacy. Well-known advanced
composition theorems allow one to query a private database quadratically more
times than basic privacy composition would permit. However, these results
require that the privacy parameters of all algorithms be fixed before
interacting with the data. To address this, Rogers et al. introduced fully
adaptive composition, wherein both algorithms and their privacy parameters can
be selected adaptively. The authors introduce two probabilistic objects to
measure privacy in adaptive composition: privacy filters, which provide
differential privacy guarantees for composed interactions, and privacy
odometers, time-uniform bounds on privacy loss. There are substantial gaps
between advanced composition and existing filters and odometers. First,
existing filters place stronger assumptions on the algorithms being composed.
Second, these odometers and filters suffer from large constants, making them
impractical. We construct filters that match the tightness of advanced
composition, including constants, despite allowing for adaptively chosen
privacy parameters. We also construct several general families of odometers.
These odometers can match the tightness of advanced composition at an
arbitrary, preselected point in time, or at all points in time simultaneously,
up to a doubly-logarithmic factor. We obtain our results by leveraging recent
advances in time-uniform martingale concentration. In sum, we show that fully
adaptive privacy is obtainable at almost no loss, and conjecture that our
results are essentially unimprovable (even in constants) in general.]]></summary>

complex, non-linear, and difficult to capture with a single model. Significant
levels of model uncertainty -- arising from these characteristics -- cannot be
resolved by model selection or simple ensemble methods, as performances are not
homogeneous. We address this issue by proposing a novel methodology that
captures spatially-varying model uncertainty, which we call spatial Bayesian
predictive synthesis. Our proposal is defined by specifying a latent factor
spatially-varying coefficient model as the synthesis function, which enables
model coefficients to vary over the region to achieve flexible spatial model
ensembling. Two MCMC strategies are implemented for full uncertainty
quantification, as well as a variational inference strategy for fast point
inference. We also extend the estimations strategy for general responses. A
finite sample theoretical guarantee is given for the predictive performance of
our methodology, showing that the predictions are exact minimax. Through
simulation examples and two real data applications, we demonstrate that our
proposed spatial Bayesian predictive synthesis outperforms standard spatial
models and advanced machine learning methods, in terms of predictive accuracy,
while maintaining interpretability of the prediction mechanism.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Neural networks are usually trained by calculating gradients using backprop and then performing gradient descent. I am not sure what are difficulties in training a neural network using alternating minimization? 
 It seems that the main idea in neural networks is that there are many parameters, and updates can be performed in parallel, thus speeding up the process. In this process, we lose the theoretical guarantees of alternating minimization, but we gain on speed. Is that right? What is the difference from a theoretical and optimization point of view of updating everything at once and serially?
 Alternating minimization- In this optimization strategy, the idea is to fix everything except one variable and perform gradient descent for it, and do this procedure alternatively for all variables till some convergence criteria is met. Reference: https://www.mit.edu/~rakhlin/6.883/lectures/lecture07.pdf
 Also, what is the order of computing gradient using backprop vs. naive gradient computation in neural networks?

 So, how do they create these things? Can anyone take a voice and make new content out of it? I'd have fun taking James Avery's Shredder voice, and redubbing episodes that he missed :).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The purpose of the paper presented in this article is to reconstruct speech only based on sequences of images of talking people. The generation of speech from silent videos can be used for many applications: for instance, silent visual input methods used in public environments for privacy protection or understanding speech in surveillance videos.
 The main challenge in speech reconstruction from visual information is that human speech is produced not only through observable mouth and face movements but also through lips, tongue, and internal organs like vocal cords. Furthermore, it is hard to visually distinguish phonemes like ‘v’ and ‘f’ only through mouth and face movements. 
 This paper leverages the natural co-occurrence of audio and video streams to pre-train a video-to-audio speech reconstruction model through self-supervision.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hellooo!
 Actually I am applying DDPG algorithm in a problem with three action spaces. all of them are defined as:
 self.action_space = spaces.Box(low=0, high=+1, shape=(3,), dtype=np.float32)
 All these actions will be used to calculate the global action at time t.
 However, I am having a problem in the DDPG outputs. At each time step, the agent outputs roughly the same actions which sum to nearly 1 (whatever the state).
 I´ have already checked that the environment is working (with stable_baselines3.common.env_checker)
 Also, I have already tested many hyperparameters values but in vain. I am waiting that the agent outputs a diffirent value of the three actions each time we have a different state but always the agent outputs roughly the same actions values such that sum(action1 + action2 + action3) = 1 (nearly) I don´t know what may constrain this in my code?
 the second point is that the actions start in something like [0.5xxxx, 0,4xxxxx, 0.5xxx] and end in [0.00xxxx, 0.00xxxx, 0.99xxxx]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. I've been messing with at least image recognition software when it comes to AI, but not so much with things like machine learning. Before I get too deep in the hole, I'd like to understand the current capabilities of AI and find out of it's something that even sounds feasible. 
 There are two main things I'm interested in:
  
Can AI categorize web pages based on content? For example, can it distinguish between a page meant for shopping vs one meant for education.
 Can AI determine the purpose of a web page? For example, can it determine if a page is meant for ecommerce vs one meant for getting sign ups or leads?
  
Those are the subjects I'm interested in at high level. If they sound like feasible projects, I'd also be curious as to what path and branch of AI I should explore. Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have trained a large deep learning model on Dataset A. It works well on data similar to dataset A, but doesn't generalize that well as real world problems are more complex and varied than Dataset A.
 Since training, I have compiled a new dataset, Dataset B, that has significantly more data and a more realistic data distribution.
 I would like to re-train the model using Dataset B. My understanding is warm-starting the model can hurt generalization, but since the model is large, I would like to avoid starting training from scratch. For this reason, I am thinking of doing a warm-start using "Shrink and Perturb".
 overview: https://jamesmccaffrey.wordpress.com/2020/12/14/neural-network-warm-start-shrink-and-perturb/
 paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.08475.pdf
 Dataset A's features have been normalized using the mean and variance of the features calculated on the dataset.
 To get the best results, should I normalize Dataset B using the same statistics (mean and variance calculated from Dataset A) or normalize using new statistics calculated from Dataset B.
 My assumption is that the best results will be obtained by training from scratch using Dataset B normalized using statistics from Dataset B, but since I may have to do this process many times, being able to warm-start and use the Shrink and Perturb method is preferred - I'm just not sure whether I should be maintaining the normalization statistics from the initial dataset for all dataset normalization, or re-calculate the statistics for each new Dataset. My assumption is that the same normalization statistics should be used, but will this hurt the generalization of the model in any way?
 Any thoughts? Thanks!

 However, when it came out, people complained about poor cuda support - was that just close to release and has since been fixed?
 Another issue besides the low end chip is the low bandwidth of the memory.
 Does anyone have any experience with it or any cuda/DL benchmarks they can share? Thanks!

 A vibrating metal plate trained using this method reached 87% accuracy for the popular MNIST handwritten digit classification task.
 Training is done using the Physics Aware Training - training data is input to the physical system alongside trainable parameters -> the physical system applies its transformation to produce an output -> the output is compared with the target output to calculate error -> then a differentiable digital model estimates the gradient loss with respect to controllable parameters -> finally, the parameters are updated based on the inferred gradient. By repeating the process multiple times, the error is reduced

 Do you think it could bring any advantage in comparison to the gaussian process regression?
 Its complexity would be O(n2) and it could be brought down using random fourier feature and such, whereas the gaussian process complexity is O(n3). If not KRLS-T do you have any other technique to reccomend?

Am I correct in saying this? (and is this the reason why I should prefer Nvidia libraries for all the possible cases)
 If the implementation of "F" is architecture-dependent, then doesn't it create performance issues. As you basically have to use if-else conditions to use the appropriate implementation for the installed GPU?

 I mean people use DL for autonomous cars, and I have to wonder if doing that isn't stupid and outright irresponsible. DL is at best explainable, and not even that much. Using it with RL within autonomous vehicles seems like a mistake.
 I know, it's a continuous space, it's too hard to use something else because of how large those spaces are, but even so. These are cars we're talking about, they make the wrong turn, make the wrong decision, and they could very well kill someone. How exactly is anyone going to explain how that happened, if DL models are really black boxes? I mean, are people just going to look at the activation atlases and figure out which neuron activated? Those things and other ways of using explainability are really weak in my opinion, they're heuristics trying to explain other heuristics.
 So why is there this obsession to put DL into RL? Can't researchers look for other methods? RL has a foundation on MDPs, it can be proven and verified mathematically, DL can't. Why on Earth would anybody want to mix this all in with RL? I think this is a mistake, and researchers should really look towards something else other than DL. In my opinion RL is really the milestone of machine learning, not those magic boxes that you put data into and give you some sort of unexplainable result.

given by pretrained teacher networks, and students are expected to improve upon
teachers since SLs are stronger supervision than the original hard labels.
However, when considering adversarial robustness, teachers may become
unreliable and adversarial distillation may not work: teachers are pretrained
on their own adversarial data, and it is too demanding to require that teachers
are also good at every adversarial data queried by students. Therefore, in this
paper, we propose reliable introspective adversarial distillation (IAD) where
students partially instead of fully trust their teachers. Specifically, IAD
distinguishes between three cases given a query of a natural data (ND) and the
corresponding adversarial data (AD): (a) if a teacher is good at AD, its SL is
fully trusted; (b) if a teacher is good at ND but not AD, its SL is partially
trusted and the student also takes its own SL into account; (c) otherwise, the
student only relies on its own SL. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
IAD for improving upon teachers in terms of adversarial robustness.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many real-world scenarios in which DNN-based recognition systems are deployed
have inherently fine-grained attributes (e.g., bird-species recognition,
medical image classification). In addition to achieving reliable accuracy, a
critical subtask for these models is to detect Out-of-distribution (OOD)
inputs. Given the nature of the deployment environment, one may expect such OOD
inputs to also be fine-grained w.r.t. the known classes (e.g., a novel bird
species), which are thus extremely difficult to identify. Unfortunately, OOD
detection in fine-grained scenarios remains largely underexplored. In this
work, we aim to fill this gap by first carefully constructing four large-scale
fine-grained test environments, in which existing methods are shown to have
difficulties. Particularly, we find that even explicitly incorporating a
diverse set of auxiliary outlier data during training does not provide
sufficient coverage over the broad region where fine-grained OOD samples
locate. We then propose Mixture Outlier Exposure (MixOE), which mixes ID data
and training outliers to expand the coverage of different OOD granularities,
and trains the model such that the prediction confidence linearly decays as the
input transitions from ID to OOD. Extensive experiments and analyses
demonstrate the effectiveness of MixOE for building up OOD detector in
fine-grained environments. Code is available at
https://github.com/zjysteven/MixOE.]]></summary>

the Chicago Department of Public Health to schedule restaurant inspections and
prioritize the detection of critical food code violations. We perform the first
analysis of the model's fairness to the population served by the restaurants in
terms of average time to find a critical violation. We find that the model
treats inspections unequally based on the sanitarian who conducted the
inspection and that, in turn, there are geographic disparities in the benefits
of the model. We examine four alternate methods of model training and two
alternative ways of scheduling using the model and find that the latter
generate more desirable results. The challenges from this application point to
important directions for future work around fairness with collective entities
rather than individuals, the use of critical violations as a proxy, and the
disconnect between fair classification and fairness in the dynamic scheduling
system.]]></summary>

extensively used for analytics in the recent years, is that it still requires
manual collection, thus limiting its availability to a reduced number of
tournaments. In this work, we propose a computational, decision tree-based
approach to automatically extract football events using tracking data, which
consists of two models: (1) a possession model that evaluates which player was
in possession of the ball at each frame in the tracking data, as well as the
distinct player configurations in the time intervals where the ball is not in
play; (2) an event detection model that combines the laws of football with the
changes in ball possession computed in the first step to determine in-game
events and set pieces. The automatically generated events are benchmarked
against manually annotated events and we show that in most event categories the
proposed methodology achieves $+90\%$ detection rate across different
tournaments and tracking data providers. Finally, we demonstrate how the
contextual information offered by tracking data can be leveraged to increase
the granularity of auto-detected events, and exhibit how the proposed framework
may be used to conduct a myriad of data analyses in football.]]></summary>

to solve large industrial instances, the design of handcrafted heuristics is
time-consuming and empirical. Under the circumstances, the flexible and

classifiers with handcrafted features to the emerging end-to-end SAT solvers

general procedure based on persistent homology to investigate topological
invariants of the manifold on which we suspect the data set. We specify the
required dimensions precisely, assuming that there is a smooth manifold on or
near which the data are located. Furthermore, we require that this space is
connected and has a commutative group structure in the mathematical sense.
These assumptions allow us to derive a decomposition of the underlying space
whose topology is well known. We use the representatives of the $k$-dimensional
homology groups from the persistence landscape to determine an integer
dimension for this decomposition. This number is the dimension of the embedding
that is capable of capturing the topology of the data manifold. We derive the

expensive, and often burdensome on patients. More importantly, clinical trials
face uncertain outcomes due to issues with efficacy, safety, or problems with
patient recruitment. If we were better at predicting the results of clinical
trials, we could avoid having to run trials that will inevitably fail more
resources could be devoted to trials that are likely to succeed. In this paper,
we propose Hierarchical INteraction Network (HINT) for more general, clinical
trial outcome predictions for all diseases based on a comprehensive and diverse
set of web data including molecule information of the drugs, target disease
information, trial protocol and biomedical knowledge. HINT first encode these
multi-modal data into latent embeddings, where an imputation module is designed
to handle missing data. Next, these embeddings will be fed into the knowledge
embedding module to generate knowledge embeddings that are pretrained using
external knowledge on pharmaco-kinetic properties and trial risk from the web.
Then the interaction graph module will connect all the embedding via domain
knowledge to fully capture various trial components and their complex relations
as well as their influences on trial outcomes. Finally, HINT learns a dynamic
attentive graph neural network to predict trial outcome. Comprehensive
experimental results show that HINT achieves strong predictive performance,
obtaining 0.772, 0.607, 0.623, 0.703 on PR-AUC for Phase I, II, III, and
indication outcome prediction, respectively. It also consistently outperforms
the best baseline method by up to 12.4\% on PR-AUC.]]></summary>

through deep reinforcement learning against adversarial attacks, raising
concerns about the application of such models to risk-sensitive tasks such as
autonomous driving. Threat models for these demonstrations are limited to (1)
targeted attacks through real-time manipulation of the agent's observation, and
(2) untargeted attacks through manipulation of the physical environment. The
former assumes full access to the agent's states/observations at all times,
while the latter has no control over attack outcomes. This paper investigates
the feasibility of targeted attacks through visually learned patterns placed on
physical objects in the environment, a threat model that combines the
practicality and effectiveness of the existing ones. Through analysis, we
demonstrate that a pre-trained policy can be hijacked within a time window,
e.g., performing an unintended self-parking, when an adversarial object is
present. To enable the attack, we adopt an assumption that the dynamics of both
the environment and the agent can be learned by the attacker. Lastly, we
empirically show the effectiveness of the proposed attack on different driving
scenarios, perform a location robustness test, and study the tradeoff between
the attack strength and its effectiveness. Code is available at

Memory replay of representative old training samples has been shown as an
effective solution, and achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.
However, existing work is mainly built on a small memory buffer containing a
few original data, which cannot fully characterize the old data distribution.
In this work, we propose memory replay with data compression (MRDC) to reduce
the storage cost of old training samples and thus increase their amount that
can be stored in the memory buffer. Observing that the trade-off between the
quality and quantity of compressed data is highly nontrivial for the efficacy
of memory replay, we propose a novel method based on determinantal point
processes (DPPs) to efficiently determine an appropriate compression quality
for currently-arrived training samples. In this way, using a naive data
compression algorithm with a properly selected quality can largely boost recent
strong baselines by saving more compressed data in a limited storage space. We
extensively validate this across several benchmarks of class-incremental
learning and in a realistic scenario of object detection for autonomous
driving.]]></summary>

experimental and theoretical attention in recent years. The practical success
of excessively large networks underscores the need for better theoretical

structure and behavior in overparameterized deep models. To do so, we study
empirically the layers' robustness to post-training re-initialization and
re-randomization of the parameters. We provide experimental results which give
evidence for the heterogeneity of layers. Morally, layers of large deep neural
networks can be categorized as either "robust" or "critical". Resetting the
robust layers to their initial values does not result in adverse decline in
performance. In many cases, robust layers hardly change throughout training. In
contrast, re-initializing critical layers vastly degrades the performance of
the network with test error essentially dropping to random guesses. Our study
provides further evidence that mere parameter counting or norm calculations are
too coarse in studying generalization of deep models, and "flatness" and
robustness analysis of trained models need to be examined while taking into

distributed machine learning across edge devices. A single neural network (NN)
that optimises a global objective is generally learned in most work in FL,
which could be suboptimal for edge devices. Although works finding a NN
personalised for edge device specific tasks exist, they lack generalisation
and/or convergence guarantees. In this paper, a novel communication efficient
FL algorithm for personalised learning in a wireless setting with guarantees is
presented. The algorithm relies on finding a ``better`` empirical estimate of
losses at each device, using a weighted average of the losses across different
devices. It is devised from a Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) bound on the
true loss in terms of the proposed empirical loss and is bounded by (i) the
Rademacher complexity, (ii) the discrepancy, (iii) and a penalty term. Using a
signed gradient feedback to find a personalised NN at each device, it is also
proven to converge in a Rayleigh flat fading (in the uplink) channel, at a rate
of the order max{1/SNR,1/sqrt(T)} Experimental results show that the proposed
algorithm outperforms locally trained devices as well as the conventionally

require preprocessing steps in the form of patching to accurately classify
diversified land cover in remotely sensed images. These approaches use patching
to incorporate the rich neighborhood information in images and exploit the

most landmasses in the world consist of overlapping and diffused classes,
making neighborhood information weaker than what is seen in common HSI
datasets. To combat this issue and generalize the segmentation models to more

combine spectral information extracted from convolutional neural network (CNN)
training on a cluster of landscape pixels. Our CEU-Net model outperforms

and can hardly transfer to new tasks. We relax these assumptions by describing
human tasks in terms of object-centric sub-tasks and interpreting physical
interventions in relation to specific objects. Our method, Object Preference
Adaptation (OPA), is composed of two key stages: 1) pre-training a base policy
to produce a wide variety of behaviors, and 2) online-updating only certain
weights in the model according to human feedback. The key to our fast, yet
simple adaptation is that general interaction dynamics between agents and
objects are fixed, and only object-specific preferences are updated. Our
adaptation occurs online, requires only one human intervention (one-shot), and
produces new behaviors never seen during training. Trained on cheap synthetic

impressive adaptation to human perturbations on challenging, realistic tasks in

for de novo molecule generation. However, popular generative models like GANs
and normalizing flows face challenges such as training instabilities due to
adversarial training and architectural constraints, respectively. Score-based
generative models sidestep these challenges by modelling the gradient of the
log probability density using a score function approximation, as opposed to
modelling the density function directly, and sampling from it using annealed
Langevin Dynamics. We believe that score-based generative models could open up
new opportunities in molecule generation due to their architectural
flexibility, such as replacing the score function with an SE(3) equivariant
model. In this work, we lay the foundations by testing the efficacy of
score-based models for molecule generation. We train a Transformer-based score
function on Self-Referencing Embedded Strings (SELFIES) representations of 1.5
million samples from the ZINC dataset and use the Moses benchmarking framework
to evaluate the generated samples on a suite of metrics.]]></summary>

knowledge graph (KG) into a vector space with a purpose of representation
learning and reasoning for an ultimate downstream task (i.e., link prediction,

the present facts in KGs to be positive (correct), they also require negative
samples as a counterpart for learning process for truthfulness test of existing
triples. Therefore, there are several approaches for creating negative samples
from the existing positive ones through a randomized distribution. This choice
of generating negative sampling affects the performance of the embedding models
as well as their generalization. In this paper, we propose an approach for
generating negative sampling considering the existing rich textual knowledge in
KGs. %The proposed approach is leveraged to cluster other relevant
representations of the entities inside a KG. Particularly, a pre-trained
Language Model (LM) is utilized to obtain the contextual representation of
symbolic entities. Our approach is then capable of generating more meaningful
negative samples in comparison to other state of the art methods. Our

the precise extraction of the colony features. However, existing computerized
systems relied on segmentation of contours by preprocessing for classifying the

categorizing colony conditions, we propose a multiple instance learning (MIL)
in weakly supervised settings. It is designed in a single model to produce weak

(CNN) to train on binary image-level labels for MIL colonies classification.
Furthermore, to specify the object of interest we used a simple post-processing
method. The proposed approach is compared over conventional methods using
five-fold cross-validation and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
The maximum accuracy of the MIL-net is 95%, which is 15 % higher than the

flexible priors when solving inverse problems. One challenge of using them is
overcoming representation error, the fundamental limitation of the network in
representing any particular signal. Recently, multiple proposed inversion
algorithms reduce representation error by optimizing over intermediate layer
representations. These methods are typically applied to generative models that
were trained agnostic of the downstream inversion algorithm. In our work, we
introduce a principle that if a generative model is intended for inversion
using an algorithm based on optimization of intermediate layers, it should be
trained in a way that regularizes those intermediate layers. We instantiate
this principle for two notable recent inversion algorithms: Intermediate Layer
Optimization and the Multi-Code GAN prior. For both of these inversion
algorithms, we introduce a new regularized GAN training algorithm and
demonstrate that the learned generative model results in lower reconstruction
errors across a wide range of under sampling ratios when solving compressed

to learn effect-based task representations as a common space of tasks, using an
alternatively fixed training scheme. We demonstrate that the task
representation can capture the relationship among tasks, and can generalize to

learning-based perception systems in robotics. Current approaches often rely on
human labelers, which can be expensive, or simulation data, which can visually
or physically differ from real data. This paper proposes Labels from
UltraViolet (LUV), a novel framework that enables rapid, labeled data
collection in real manipulation environments without human labeling. LUV uses
transparent, ultraviolet-fluorescent paint with programmable ultraviolet LEDs
to collect paired images of a scene in standard lighting and UV lighting to
autonomously extract segmentation masks and keypoints via color segmentation.
We apply LUV to a suite of diverse robot perception tasks to evaluate its
labeling quality, flexibility, and data collection rate. Results suggest that
LUV is 180-2500 times faster than a human labeler across the tasks. We show
that LUV provides labels consistent with human annotations on unpainted test
images. The networks trained on these labels are used to smooth and fold
crumpled towels with 83% success rate and achieve 1.7mm position error with
respect to human labels on a surgical needle pose estimation task. The low cost
of LUV makes it ideal as a lightweight replacement for human labeling systems,
with the one-time setup costs at $300 equivalent to the cost of collecting

prediction and detection of drivers of cleared homicides at the national- and
state-levels in the United States.

Methods: First, nine algorithmic approaches are compared to assess the best
performance in predicting cleared homicides country-wise, using data from the
Murder Accountability Project. The most accurate algorithm among all (XGBoost)
is then used for predicting clearance outcomes state-wise. Second, SHAP, a
framework for Explainable Artificial Intelligence, is employed to capture the
most important features in explaining clearance patterns both at the national
and state levels.

Results: At the national level, XGBoost demonstrates to achieve the best
performance overall. Substantial predictive variability is detected state-wise.
In terms of explainability, SHAP highlights the relevance of several features
in consistently predicting investigation outcomes. These include homicide
circumstances, weapons, victims' sex and race, as well as number of involved
offenders and victims.

Conclusions: Explainable Machine Learning demonstrates to be a helpful
framework for predicting homicide clearance. SHAP outcomes suggest a more
organic integration of the two theoretical perspectives emerged in the
literature. Furthermore, jurisdictional heterogeneity highlights the importance
of developing ad hoc state-level strategies to improve police performance in
clearing homicides.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi-criteria decision-making often requires finding a small representative
set from the database. A recently proposed method is the regret minimization
set (RMS) query. RMS returns a size $r$ subset $S$ of dataset $D$ that
minimizes the regret-ratio (the difference between the score of top-1 in $S$
and the score of top-1 in $D$, for any possible utility function). RMS is not
shift invariant, causing inconsistency in results. Further, existing work
showed that the regret-ratio is often a made-up number and users may mistake
its absolute value. Instead, users do understand the notion of rank. Thus it
considered the problem of finding the minimal set $S$ with a rank-regret (the
rank of top-1 tuple of $S$ in the sorted list of $D$) at most $k$, called the
rank-regret representative (RRR) problem.

Corresponding to RMS, we focus on the min-error version of RRR, called the
rank-regret minimization (RRM) problem, which finds a size $r$ set to minimize
the maximum rank-regret for all utility functions. Further, we generalize RRM
and propose the restricted RRM (i.e., RRRM) problem to optimize the rank-regret
for functions restricted in a given space. Previous studies on both RMS and RRR
did not consider the restricted function space. The solution for RRRM usually
has a lower regret level and can better serve the specific preferences of some
users. Note that RRM and RRRM are shift invariant. In 2D space, we design a
dynamic programming algorithm 2DRRM to return the optimal solution for RRM. In
HD space, we propose an algorithm HDRRM that introduces a double approximation
guarantee on rank-regret. Both 2DRRM and HDRRM are applicable for RRRM.
Extensive experiments on the synthetic and real datasets verify the efficiency
and effectiveness of our algorithms. In particular, HDRRM always has the best
output quality in experiments.]]></summary>

nodes, connected by edges of specific relation types. However, information and
knowledge evolve continuously, and temporal dynamics emerge, which are expected
to influence future situations. In temporal knowledge graphs, time information
is integrated into the graph by equipping each edge with a timestamp or a time
range. Embedding-based methods have been introduced for link prediction on
temporal knowledge graphs, but they mostly lack explainability and
comprehensible reasoning chains. Particularly, they are usually not designed to
deal with link forecasting -- event prediction involving future timestamps. We
address the task of link forecasting on temporal knowledge graphs and introduce
TLogic, an explainable framework that is based on temporal logical rules
extracted via temporal random walks. We compare TLogic with state-of-the-art
baselines on three benchmark datasets and show better overall performance while
our method also provides explanations that preserve time consistency.
Furthermore, in contrast to most state-of-the-art embedding-based methods,
TLogic works well in the inductive setting where already learned rules are

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is well accepted that acquiring downlink channel state information in
frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) systems is challenging because of the large overhead in training and
feedback. In this paper, we propose a deep generative model (DGM)-based
technique to address this challenge. Exploiting the partial reciprocity of
uplink and downlink channels, we first estimate the frequency-independent
underlying channel parameters, i.e., the magnitudes of path gains, delays,
angles-of-arrivals (AoAs) and angles-of-departures (AoDs), via uplink training,
since these parameters are common in both uplink and downlink. Then, the
frequency-specific underlying channel parameters, namely, the phase of each
propagation path, are estimated via downlink training using a very short
training signal. In the first step, we incorporate the underlying distribution
of the channel parameters as a prior into our channel estimation algorithm. We
use DGMs to learn this distribution. Simulation results indicate that our
proposed DGM-based channel estimation technique outperforms, by a large gap,
the conventional channel estimation techniques in practical ranges of
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In addition, a near-optimal performance is
achieved using only few downlink pilot measurements.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Enhancing Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) with supervised Machine
Learning (ML) is tough. ML-NIDS must be trained and evaluated, operations
requiring data where benign and malicious samples are clearly labelled. Such
labels demand costly expert knowledge, resulting in a lack of real deployments,
as well as on papers always relying on the same outdated data. The situation
improved recently, as some efforts disclosed their labelled datasets. However,
most past works used such datasets just as a 'yet another' testbed, overlooking
the added potential provided by such availability.

In contrast, we promote using such existing labelled data to cross-evaluate
ML-NIDS. Such approach received only limited attention and, due to its
complexity, requires a dedicated treatment. We hence propose the first
cross-evaluation model. Our model highlights the broader range of realistic
use-cases that can be assessed via cross-evaluations, allowing the discovery of
still unknown qualities of state-of-the-art ML-NIDS. For instance, their
detection surface can be extended--at no additional labelling cost. However,
conducting such cross-evaluations is challenging. Hence, we propose the first
framework, XeNIDS, for reliable cross-evaluations based on Network Flows. By
using XeNIDS on six well-known datasets, we demonstrate the concealed
potential, but also the risks, of cross-evaluations of ML-NIDS.]]></summary>

Local stochastic gradient descent ascent (SGDA), the local-update version of

but it is not well-understood in a distributed setting. We prove that Local
SGDA has \textit{order-optimal} sample complexity for several classes of
nonconvex-concave and nonconvex-nonconcave minimax problems, and also enjoys
\textit{linear speedup} with respect to the number of clients. We provide a
novel and tighter analysis, which improves the convergence and communication
guarantees in the existing literature. For nonconvex-PL and

results for centralized minimax problems. Furthermore, we propose a

networks such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for predicting structure activity
relationships (SAR) have shown tremendous potential in computer-aided drug
discovery. However, the applicability of such deep neural networks are limited
by the requirement of large amounts of training data. In order to cope with
limited training data for a target task, transfer learning for SAR modeling has
been recently adopted to leverage information from data of related tasks. In
this work, in contrast to the popular parameter-based transfer learning such as
pretraining, we develop novel deep transfer learning methods TAc and TAc-fc to
leverage source domain data and transfer useful information to the target
domain. TAc learns to generate effective molecular features that can generalize
well from one domain to another, and increase the classification performance in
the target domain. Additionally, TAc-fc extends TAc by incorporating novel
components to selectively learn feature-wise and compound-wise transferability.
We used the bioassay screening data from PubChem, and identified 120 pairs of
bioassays such that the active compounds in each pair are more similar to each
other compared to its inactive compounds. Our experiments clearly demonstrate
that TAc achieves significant improvement over all baselines across a large
number of target tasks. Furthermore, although TAc-fc achieves slightly worse
ROC-AUC on average compared to TAc, TAc-fc still achieves the best performance
on more tasks in terms of PR-AUC and F1 compared to other methods. In summary,
TAc-fc is also found to be a strong model with competitive or even better
performance than TAc on a notable number of target tasks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The objective of this article is to introduce a fairness interpretability
framework for measuring and explaining the bias in classification and
regression models at the level of a distribution. In our work, we measure the
model bias across sub-population distributions in the model output using the
Wasserstein metric. To properly quantify the contributions of predictors, we
take into account the favorability of both the model and predictors with
respect to the non-protected class. The quantification is accomplished by the
use of transport theory, which gives rise to the decomposition of the model
bias and bias explanations to positive and negative contributions. To gain more
insight into the role of favorability and allow for additivity of bias
explanations, we adapt techniques from cooperative game theory.]]></summary>

experimental and theoretical attention in recent years. The practical success
of excessively large networks underscores the need for better theoretical
analyses and justifications. In this paper we focus on layer-wise functional
structure and behavior in overparameterized deep models. To do so, we study
empirically the layers' robustness to post-training re-initialization and
re-randomization of the parameters. We provide experimental results which give
evidence for the heterogeneity of layers. Morally, layers of large deep neural
networks can be categorized as either "robust" or "critical". Resetting the
robust layers to their initial values does not result in adverse decline in
performance. In many cases, robust layers hardly change throughout training. In
contrast, re-initializing critical layers vastly degrades the performance of
the network with test error essentially dropping to random guesses. Our study
provides further evidence that mere parameter counting or norm calculations are
too coarse in studying generalization of deep models, and "flatness" and
robustness analysis of trained models need to be examined while taking into
account the respective network architectures.]]></summary>

collaborate with humans in tight spaces. A key component for allowing robots to
leave structured lab and manufacturing settings is their ability to evaluate
online and real-time collisions with the world around them. Distance-based
constraints are fundamental for enabling robots to plan their actions and act
safely, protecting both humans and their hardware. However, different
applications require different distance resolutions, leading to various
heuristic approaches for measuring distance fields w.r.t. obstacles, which are
computationally expensive and hinder their application in dynamic obstacle
avoidance use-cases. We propose Regularized Deep Signed Distance Fields
(ReDSDF), a single neural implicit function that can compute smooth distance
fields at any scale, with fine-grained resolution over high-dimensional
manifolds and articulated bodies like humans, thanks to our effective data
generation and a simple inductive bias during training. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in representative simulated tasks for whole-body
control (WBC) and safe Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) in shared workspaces.
Finally, we provide proof of concept of a real-world application in a HRI

predicting missing types of entities, predicting which molecules cause cancer,
or predicting which drugs are promising treatment candidates. While black-box
models often achieve high predictive performance, they are only post-hoc and
locally explainable and do not allow the learned model to be easily enriched
with domain knowledge. Towards this end, learning description logic concepts
from positive and negative examples has been proposed. However, learning such
concepts often takes a long time and state-of-the-art approaches provide
limited support for literal data values, although they are crucial for many
applications. In this paper, we propose EvoLearner - an evolutionary approach
to learn concepts in ALCQ(D), which is the attributive language with complement
(ALC) paired with qualified cardinality restrictions (Q) and data properties
(D). We contribute a novel initialization method for the initial population:
starting from positive examples, we perform biased random walks and translate
them to description logic concepts. Moreover, we improve support for data
properties by maximizing information gain when deciding where to split the
data. We show that our approach significantly outperforms the state of the art
on the benchmarking framework SML-Bench for structured machine learning. Our
ablation study confirms that this is due to our novel initialization method and
support for data properties.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Black-box policy optimization is a class of reinforcement learning algorithms
that explores and updates the policies at the parameter level. This class of
algorithms is widely applied in robotics with movement primitives or
non-differentiable policies. Furthermore, these approaches are particularly
relevant where exploration at the action level could cause actuator damage or
other safety issues. However, Black-box optimization does not scale well with
the increasing dimensionality of the policy, leading to high demand for
samples, which are expensive to obtain in real-world systems. In many practical
applications, policy parameters do not contribute equally to the return.
Identifying the most relevant parameters allows to narrow down the exploration
and speed up the learning. Furthermore, updating only the effective parameters
requires fewer samples, improving the scalability of the method. We present a
novel method to prioritize the exploration of effective parameters and cope
with full covariance matrix updates. Our algorithm learns faster than recent
approaches and requires fewer samples to achieve state-of-the-art results. To
select the effective parameters, we consider both the Pearson correlation
coefficient and the Mutual Information. We showcase the capabilities of our
approach on the Relative Entropy Policy Search algorithm in several simulated
environments, including robotics simulations. Code is available at

building-systems operations. Previous research has relied on CO$_2$ sensors and
vision-based techniques to determine occupancy patterns. Vision-based
techniques provide highly accurate information; however, they are very
intrusive. Therefore, motion or CO$_2$ sensors are more widely adopted
worldwide. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are another pollutant originating
from the occupants. However, a limited number of studies have evaluated the
impact of occupants on the VOC level. In this paper, continuous measurements of
CO$_2$, VOC, light, temperature, and humidity were recorded in a 17,000 sqft
open office space for around four months. Using different statistical models
(e.g., SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest) we evaluated which
combination of environmental factors provides more accurate insights on
occupant presence. Our preliminary results indicate that VOC is a good
indicator of occupancy detection in some cases. It is also concluded that
proper feature selection and developing appropriate global occupancy detection
models can reduce the cost and energy of data collection without a significant

state-of-the-art Deep Neural Networks (DNN)-based models- Conv-TasNet and
DPT-Net. We evaluate their performance with mixtures of natural speech versus
slightly manipulated inharmonic speech, where harmonics are slightly frequency
jittered. We find that performance deteriorates significantly if one source is
even slightly harmonically jittered, e.g., an imperceptible 3% harmonic jitter
degrades performance of Conv-TasNet from 15.4 dB to 0.70 dB. Training the model
on inharmonic speech does not remedy this sensitivity, instead resulting in
worse performance on natural speech mixtures, making inharmonicity a powerful
adversarial factor in DNN models. Furthermore, additional analyses reveal that
DNN algorithms deviate markedly from biologically inspired algorithms that rely
primarily on timing cues and not harmonicity to segregate speech.]]></summary>

neural-net-based Standard Model jet classification tasks, to detect non-QCD

\emph{powerful enough feature extractor}, a well-trained
\emph{mass-decorrelated} supervised Standard Model neural jet classifier can
serve as a strong generic anti-QCD jet tagger for effectively reducing the QCD
background. Imposing \emph{data-augmented} mass-invariance (decoupling the
dominant factor) not only facilitates background estimation, but also induces
more substructure-aware representation learning. We are able to reach excellent
tagging efficiencies for all the test signals considered. In the best case, we
reach a background rejection rate of 51 and a significance improvement factor
of 3.6 at 50 \% signal acceptance, with jet mass decorrelated. This study
indicates that supervised Standard Model jet classifiers have great potential

methods widely used in practice and implemented as part of standard software
packages for statistical learning. Nevertheless, their convergence is generally
not well understood and so far their good practical performance has not been
explained by existing convergence analyses. In this work, we introduce a new
block coordinate method that applies to the general class of variational
inequality (VI) problems with monotone operators. This class includes composite
convex optimization problems and convex-concave min-max optimization problems
as special cases and has not been addressed by the existing work. The resulting
convergence bounds match the optimal convergence bounds of full gradient
methods, but are provided in terms of a novel gradient Lipschitz condition
w.r.t.~a Mahalanobis norm. For $m$ coordinate blocks, the resulting gradient
Lipschitz constant in our bounds is never larger than a factor $\sqrt{m}$
compared to the traditional Euclidean Lipschitz constant, while it is possible
for it to be much smaller. Further, for the case when the operator in the VI
has finite-sum structure, we propose a variance reduced variant of our method
which further decreases the per-iteration cost and has better convergence rates
in certain regimes. To obtain these results, we use a gradient extrapolation
strategy that allows us to view a cyclic collection of block coordinate-wise
gradients as one implicit gradient.]]></summary>

that have the ability to address competitive resource allocation problems
together with detection and mitigation of anomalous behavior. In this paper, we
investigate their use in next-generation (NextG) communications within the
context of cognitive networks to address i) spectrum sharing, ii) detecting
anomalies, and iii) mitigating security attacks. GANs have the following
advantages. First, they can learn and synthesize field data, which can be
costly, time consuming, and nonrepeatable. Second, they enable pre-training
classifiers by using semi-supervised data. Third, they facilitate increased
resolution. Fourth, they enable the recovery of corrupted bits in the spectrum.
The paper provides the basics of GANs, a comparative discussion on different
kinds of GANs, performance measures for GANs in computer vision and image
processing as well as wireless applications, a number of datasets for wireless
applications, performance measures for general classifiers, a survey of the
literature on GANs for i)-iii) above, and future research directions. As a use
case of GAN for NextG communications, we show that a GAN can be effectively

have recently begun to be explored in the context of drug discovery and have
the potential to assist in key challenges such as target identification. In the
drug discovery domain, KGs can be employed as part of a process which can
result in lab-based experiments being performed, or impact on other decisions,
incurring significant time and financial costs and most importantly, ultimately
influencing patient healthcare. For KGE models to have impact in this domain, a
better understanding of not only of performance, but also the various factors
which determine it, is required. In this study we investigate, over the course
of many thousands of experiments, the predictive performance of five KGE models
on two public drug discovery-oriented KGs. Our goal is not to focus on the best
overall model or configuration, instead we take a deeper look at how
performance can be affected by changes in the training setup, choice of
hyperparameters, model parameter initialisation seed and different splits of
the datasets. Our results highlight that these factors have significant impact
on performance and can even affect the ranking of models. Indeed these factors
should be reported along with model architectures to ensure complete
reproducibility and fair comparisons of future work, and we argue this is
critical for the acceptance of use, and impact of KGEs in a biomedical setting.]]></summary>

remain the leading machine learning methods for many real-world data problems,
specifically on tabular data. However, current standard implementations only
operate in batch mode, and therefore cannot incrementally update when more data
arrive. Several previous works developed streaming trees and ensembles to
overcome this limitation. Nonetheless, we found that those state-of-the-art
algorithms suffer from a number of drawbacks, including performing very poorly
on some problems and requiring a huge amount of memory on others. We therefore
developed the simplest possible extension of decision trees we could think of:
given new data, simply update existing trees by continuing to grow them, and
replace some old trees with new ones to control the total number of trees. On
three standard datasets, we illustrate that our approach, Stream Decision
Forest (SDF), does not suffer from either of the aforementioned limitations. In
a benchmark suite containing 72 classification problems (the OpenML-CC18 data
suite), we illustrate that our approach often performs as well, and sometimes
better even, than the batch mode decision forest algorithm. Thus, we believe
SDFs establish a simple standard for streaming trees and forests that could
readily be applied to many real-world problems, including those with
distribution drift and continual learning.]]></summary>

for generalizing deep neural networks to new target domains. However, there is
still enormous potential to be tapped to reach the fully supervised
performance. In this paper, we present a novel active learning strategy to
assist knowledge transfer in the target domain, dubbed active domain
adaptation. We start from an observation that energy-based models exhibit
\textit{free energy biases} when training (source) and test (target) data come
from different distributions. Inspired by this inherent mechanism, we
empirically reveal that a simple yet efficient energy-based sampling strategy
sheds light on selecting the most valuable target samples than existing
approaches requiring particular architectures or computation of the distances.
Our algorithm, Energy-based Active Domain Adaptation (EADA), queries groups of
target data that incorporate both domain characteristic and instance
uncertainty into every selection round. Meanwhile, by aligning the free energy
of target data compact around the source domain via a regularization term,
domain gap can be implicitly diminished. Through extensive experiments, we show
that EADA surpasses state-of-the-art methods on well-known challenging
benchmarks with substantial improvements, making it a useful option in the open

trajectories of stochastic dynamics. In this paper, we present a method to
significantly accelerate the convergence by introducing deterministic virtual
trajectories generated in augmented state space under the Hamiltonian dynamics.
We theoretically show that our approach achieves second-order acceleration
compared to a naive estimator with the Langevin dynamics and zero variance
estimation on harmonic potentials. We also present numerical experiments on

improved regularizers are covered along with k-space based methods which focus
on better interpolation strategies using neural networks. While the field is

conventional power grids, especially when renewable energy resources are
utilized. An energy storage based feedback controller can compensate undesired
dynamics of a microgrid to improve its stability. However, the optimal feedback
control of a microgrid subject to a large disturbance needs to solve a
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman problem. This paper proposes a machine learning-based
optimal feedback control scheme. Its training dataset is generated from a
linear-quadratic regulator and a brute-force method respectively addressing
small and large disturbances. Then, a three-layer neural network is constructed
from the data for the purpose of optimal feedback control. A case study is
carried out for a microgrid model based on a modified Kundur two-area system to
test the real-time performance of the proposed control scheme.]]></summary>

overall performance is decreased so as to improve performance on disadvantaged
groups where the algorithm would otherwise be less accurate. Contrary to this,
we find that applying existing fairness approaches to computer vision improve
fairness by degrading the performance of classifiers across all groups (with
increased degradation on the best performing groups).

Extending the bias-variance decomposition for classification to fairness, we
theoretically explain why the majority of fairness classifiers designed for low
capacity models should not be used in settings involving high-capacity models,
a scenario common to computer vision. We corroborate this analysis with
extensive experimental support that shows that many of the fairness heuristics
used in computer vision also degrade performance on the most disadvantaged
groups. Building on these insights, we propose an adaptive augmentation
strategy that, uniquely, of all methods tested, improves performance for the
disadvantaged groups.]]></summary>

numerical optimization problems. Many of these problems involve nonconvex
objective functions with multiple saddle points, which necessitates an
understanding of the behavior of discrete trajectories of first-order methods
within the geometrical landscape of these functions. This paper concerns
convergence of first-order discrete methods to a local minimum of nonconvex
optimization problems that comprise strict-saddle points within the geometrical
landscape. To this end, it focuses on analysis of discrete gradient
trajectories around saddle neighborhoods, derives sufficient conditions under
which these trajectories can escape strict-saddle neighborhoods in linear time,
explores the contractive and expansive dynamics of these trajectories in
neighborhoods of strict-saddle points that are characterized by gradients of
moderate magnitude, characterizes the non-curving nature of these trajectories,
and highlights the inability of these trajectories to re-enter the
neighborhoods around strict-saddle points after exiting them. Based on these
insights and analyses, the paper then proposes a simple variant of the vanilla
gradient descent algorithm, termed Curvature Conditioned Regularized Gradient
Descent (CCRGD) algorithm, which utilizes a check for an initial boundary
condition to ensure its trajectories can escape strict-saddle neighborhoods in
linear time. Convergence analysis of the CCRGD algorithm, which includes its
rate of convergence to a local minimum, is also presented in the paper.
Numerical experiments are then provided on a test function as well as a
low-rank matrix factorization problem to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed
algorithm.]]></summary>

has been thoroughly researched in the literature. However, some issues are
still open. This work addresses the identification of the related low-resource
languages on the example of the Celtic language family.

This work's main goals were: (1) to collect the dataset of three Celtic
languages; (2) to prepare a method to identify the languages from the Celtic
family, i.e. to train a successful classification model; (3) to evaluate the
influence of different feature extraction methods, and explore the
applicability of the unsupervised models as a feature extraction technique; (4)
to experiment with the unsupervised feature extraction on a reduced annotated
set.

We collected a new dataset including Irish, Scottish, Welsh and English
records. We tested supervised models such as SVM and neural networks with
traditional statistical features alongside the output of clustering,
autoencoder, and topic modelling methods. The analysis showed that the
unsupervised features could serve as a valuable extension to the n-gram feature
vectors. It led to an improvement in performance for more entangled classes.
The best model achieved a 98\% F1 score and 97\% MCC. The dense neural network
consistently outperformed the SVM model.

The low-resource languages are also challenging due to the scarcity of
available annotated training data. This work evaluated the performance of the
classifiers using the unsupervised feature extraction on the reduced labelled
dataset to handle this issue. The results uncovered that the unsupervised
feature vectors are more robust to the labelled set reduction. Therefore, they
proved to help achieve comparable classification performance with much less
labelled data.]]></summary>

in cases where data cannot be aggregated across data silos. Softmax cross
entropy loss is highly effective and commonly used for learning image
representations. Using a large number of classes has proven to be particularly
beneficial for the descriptive power of such representations in centralized
learning. However, doing so on decentralized data with Federated Learning is
not straightforward as the demand on FL clients' computation and communication
increases proportionally to the number of classes. In this work we introduce
federated sampled softmax (FedSS), a resource-efficient approach for learning
image representation with Federated Learning. Specifically, the FL clients
sample a set of classes and optimize only the corresponding model parameters
with respect to a sampled softmax objective that approximates the global full
softmax objective. We examine the loss formulation and empirically show that
our method significantly reduces the number of parameters transferred to and
optimized by the client devices, while performing on par with the standard full
softmax method. This work creates a possibility for efficiently learning image
representations on decentralized data with a large number of classes under the
federated setting.]]></summary>

can be trained to make sequential decisions, and achieve a particular goal
within an arbitrary environment. While learning, they repeatedly take actions
based on their observation of the environment, and receive appropriate rewards
which define the objective. This experience is then used to progressively
improve the policy controlling the agent's behavior, typically represented by a
neural network. This trained module can then be reused for similar problems,
which makes this approach promising for the animation of autonomous, yet
reactive characters in simulators, video games or virtual reality environments.
This paper surveys the modern Deep Reinforcement Learning methods and discusses
their possible applications in Character Animation, from skeletal control of a
single, physically-based character to navigation controllers for individual
agents and virtual crowds. It also describes the practical side of training DRL
systems, comparing the different frameworks available to build such agents.]]></summary>

subject to many instabilities. The spectral density of the Jacobian is a key
component for analyzing robustness. Following the works of Pennington et al.,
such Jacobians are modeled using free multiplicative convolutions from Free
Probability Theory (FPT). We present a reliable and very fast method for
computing the associated spectral densities. This method has a controlled and
proven convergence.

Our technique is based on an homotopy method: it is an adaptative
Newton-Raphson scheme which chains basins of attraction. We find contiguous
lilypad-like basins and step from one to the next, heading towards the
objective.

In order to demonstrate the applicability of our method we show that the
relevant FPT metrics computed before training are highly correlated to final
test losses -- up to $85 \%$. We also give evidence that a very desirable
feature for neural networks is the hyperbolicity of their Jacobian at
initialization.]]></summary>

Healthcare datasets may have biases in which certain protected groups might

fairness of synthetically generated health data comes into question. In this
paper, we evaluate the fairness of models generated on two healthcare datasets

MCMC methods struggle to scale to large models with many local variables and
observations, and variational inference (VI) may fail to provide accurate
approximations due to the use of simple variational families. Some variational
methods (e.g. importance weighted VI) integrate Monte Carlo methods to give
better accuracy, but these tend to be unsuitable for hierarchical models, as
they do not allow for subsampling and their performance tends to degrade for
high dimensional models. We propose a new family of variational bounds for
hierarchical models, based on the application of tightening methods (e.g.
importance weighting) separately for each group of local random variables. We
show that our approach naturally allows the use of subsampling to get unbiased
gradients, and that it fully leverages the power of methods that build tighter
lower bounds by applying them independently in lower dimensional spaces,
leading to better results and more accurate posterior approximations than
relevant baselines.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Data-centric AI encourages the need of cleaning and understanding of data in
order to achieve trustworthy AI. Existing technologies, such as AutoML, make it
easier to design and train models automatically, but there is a lack of a
similar level of capabilities to extract data-centric insights. Manual
stratification of tabular data per a feature (e.g., gender) is limited to scale
up for higher feature dimension, which could be addressed using automatic
discovery of divergent subgroups. Nonetheless, these automatic discovery
techniques often search across potentially exponential combinations of features
that could be simplified using a preceding feature selection step. Existing
feature selection techniques for tabular data often involve fitting a
particular model in order to select important features. However, such
model-based selection is prone to model-bias and spurious correlations in
addition to requiring extra resource to design, fine-tune and train a model. In
this paper, we propose a model-free and sparsity-based automatic feature
selection (SAFS) framework to facilitate automatic discovery of divergent
subgroups. Different from filter-based selection techniques, we exploit the
sparsity of objective measures among feature values to rank and select
features. We validated SAFS across two publicly available datasets (MIMIC-III
and Allstate Claims) and compared it with six existing feature selection
methods. SAFS achieves a reduction of feature selection time by a factor of 81x
and 104x, averaged cross the existing methods in the MIMIC-III and Claims
datasets respectively. SAFS-selected features are also shown to achieve
competitive detection performance, e.g., 18.3% of features selected by SAFS in
the Claims dataset detected divergent samples similar to those detected by
using the whole features with a Jaccard similarity of 0.95 but with a 16x
reduction in detection time.]]></summary>

work has partially explained transferability by recognizing common adversarial
subspaces and correlations between decision boundaries, but little is known
beyond this. We propose that transferability between seemingly different models
is due to a high linear correlation between the feature sets that different
networks extract. In other words, two models trained on the same task that are
distant in the parameter space likely extract features in the same fashion,
just with trivial affine transformations between the latent spaces.
Furthermore, we show how applying a feature correlation loss, which
decorrelates the extracted features in a latent space, can reduce the
transferability of adversarial attacks between models, suggesting that the
models complete tasks in semantically different ways. Finally, we propose a
Dual Neck Autoencoder (DNA), which leverages this feature correlation loss to
create two meaningfully different encodings of input information with reduced
transferability.]]></summary>

getting enough sleep at any stage may lead to sleep disorder like parasomnia,
apnea, insomnia, etc. Sleep-related diseases could be diagnosed using
Convolutional Neural Network Classifier. However, this classifier has not been
successfully implemented into sleep stage classification systems due to high
complexity and low accuracy of classification. The aim of this research is to
increase the accuracy and reduce the learning time of Convolutional Neural
Network Classifier. Methodology: The proposed system used a modified Orthogonal
Convolutional Neural Network and a modified Adam optimisation technique to
improve the sleep stage classification accuracy and reduce the gradient
saturation problem that occurs due to sigmoid activation function. The proposed
system uses Leaky Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) instead of sigmoid activation
function as an activation function. Results: The proposed system called
Enhanced Sleep Stage Classification system (ESSC) used six different databases
for training and testing the proposed model on the different sleep stages.
These databases are University College Dublin database (UCD), Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center MIT database (MIT-BIH), Sleep European Data Format
(EDF), Sleep EDF Extended, Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies (MASS), and Sleep
Heart Health Study (SHHS). Our results show that the gradient saturation
problem does not exist anymore. The modified Adam optimiser helps to reduce the
noise which in turn result in faster convergence time. Conclusion: The
convergence speed of ESSC is increased along with better classification
accuracy compared to the state of art solution.]]></summary>

data and used to predict future values. It is assumed that the data
distribution does not change over time (stationarity). However, in real-world
scenarios, the data generation process changes over time and the model has to
adapt to the new incoming data. This phenomenon is known as concept drift and
leads to a decrease in the predictive model's performance. In this study, we
propose a new concept drift detection method based on autoregressive models
called ADDM. This method can be integrated into any machine learning algorithm
from deep neural networks to simple linear regression model. Our results show
that this new concept drift detection method outperforms the state-of-the-art
drift detection methods, both on synthetic data sets and real-world data sets.
Our approach is theoretically guaranteed as well as empirical and effective for
the detection of various concept drifts. In addition to the drift detector, we
proposed a new method of concept drift adaptation based on the severity of the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent studies on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) reveal that the initial
node representations (i.e., the node representations before the first-time
graph convolution) largely affect the final model performance. However, when
learning the initial representation for a node, most existing work linearly
combines the embeddings of node features, without considering the interactions
among the features (or feature embeddings). We argue that when the node
features are categorical, e.g., in many real-world applications like user
profiling and recommender system, feature interactions usually carry important
signals for predictive analytics. Ignoring them will result in suboptimal
initial node representation and thus weaken the effectiveness of the follow-up
graph convolution. In this paper, we propose a new GCN model named CatGCN,
which is tailored for graph learning when the node features are categorical.
Specifically, we integrate two ways of explicit interaction modeling into the
learning of initial node representation, i.e., local interaction modeling on
each pair of node features and global interaction modeling on an artificial
feature graph. We then refine the enhanced initial node representations with
the neighborhood aggregation-based graph convolution. We train CatGCN in an
end-to-end fashion and demonstrate it on semi-supervised node classification.
Extensive experiments on three tasks of user profiling (the prediction of user
age, city, and purchase level) from Tencent and Alibaba datasets validate the
effectiveness of CatGCN, especially the positive effect of performing feature
interaction modeling before graph convolution.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Integrating cross-department multi-modal data (e.g., radiological,
pathological, genomic, and clinical data) is ubiquitous in brain cancer
diagnosis and survival prediction. To date, such an integration is typically
conducted by human physicians (and panels of experts), which can be subjective
and semi-quantitative. Recent advances in multi-modal deep learning, however,
have opened a door to leverage such a process to a more objective and
quantitative manner. Unfortunately, the prior arts of using four modalities on
brain cancer survival prediction are limited by a "complete modalities" setting
(i.e., with all modalities available). Thus, there are still open questions on
how to effectively predict brain cancer survival from the incomplete
radiological, pathological, genomic, and demographic data (e.g., one or more
modalities might not be collected for a patient). For instance, should we use
both complete and incomplete data, and more importantly, how to use those data?
To answer the preceding questions, we generalize the multi-modal learning on
cross-department multi-modal data to a missing data setting. Our contribution
is three-fold: 1) We introduce optimal multi-modal learning with missing data
(MMD) pipeline with optimized hardware consumption and computational
efficiency; 2) We extend multi-modal learning on radiological, pathological,
genomic, and demographic data into missing data scenarios; 3) a large-scale
public dataset (with 962 patients) is collected to systematically evaluate
glioma tumor survival prediction using four modalities. The proposed method
improved the C-index of survival prediction from 0.7624 to 0.8053.]]></summary>

manufacturability issues of topologically optimized structures, particularly
those represented as discrete density maps. However, the optimization of such
cellular structures is challenging due to the multiscale design problem. Past
work addressing this problem generally either only optimizes the volume
fraction of single-type unit cells but ignoring the effects of unit cell
geometry on properties, or considers the geometry-property relation but builds
this relation via heuristics. In contrast, we propose a simple yet more
principled way to accurately model the property to geometry mapping using a
conditional deep generative model, named Inverse Homogenization Generative
Adversarial Network (IH-GAN). It learns the conditional distribution of unit
cell geometries given properties and can realize the one-to-many mapping from
geometry to properties. We further reduce the complexity of IH-GAN by using the
implicit function parameterization to represent unit cell geometries. Results
show that our method can 1) generate various unit cells that satisfy given
material properties with high accuracy (relative error <5%) and 2) improve the
optimized structural performance over the conventional topology-optimized
variable-density structure. Specifically, in the minimum compliance example,
our IH-GAN generated structure achieves an 84.4% reduction in concentrated
stress and an extra 7% reduction in displacement. In the target deformation
examples, our IH-GAN generated structure reduces the target matching error by
24.2% and 44.4% for two test cases, respectively. We also demonstrated that the
connectivity issue for multi-type unit cells can be solved by transition layer
blending.]]></summary>

we explore three interesting properties between Bitcoin transaction accounts:
topological connectivity pattern of Bitcoin accounts, transaction amount

reachability graph and a time-decaying transaction pattern graph, aiming at
capturing different types of spatial-temporal Bitcoin transaction patterns.
Third, we employ node embedding on both graphs and develop a Bitcoin
transaction forecasting system between user accounts based on historical
transactions with built-in time-decaying factor. To maintain an effective
transaction forecasting performance, we leverage the multiplicative model
update (MMU) ensemble to combine prediction models built on different
transaction features extracted from each corresponding Bitcoin transaction

shoppers were accessed, constructing a broad spectrum of lifestyle features
covering various product categories and buyer personas. Using the
lifestyle-related information preceding online shoppers' first purchases of
specific prescription drugs, we could determine associations between their past
lifestyle choices and whether they suffered from a particular chronic disease.

Results: Novel lifestyle risk factors were discovered in two
exemplars--depression and type 2 diabetes, most of which showed reasonable
consistency with existing healthcare knowledge. Further, such empirical
findings could be adopted to locate online shoppers at higher risk of these
chronic diseases with decent accuracy [i.e., (area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve) AUC=0.68 for depression and AUC=0.70 for type 2
diabetes], closely matching the performance of screening surveys benchmarked
against medical diagnosis.

Conclusions: Mining online shopping behaviors can point medical experts to a
series of lifestyle issues associated with chronic diseases that are less
explored to date. Hopefully, unobtrusive chronic disease surveillance via
e-commerce sites can grant consenting individuals a privilege to be connected
more readily with the medical profession and sophistication.]]></summary>

heart-rate (HR) monitoring, suitable for compact wrist-worn devices.
Unfortunately, Motion Artifacts (MAs) severely impact the monitoring accuracy,
causing high variability in the skin-to-sensor interface. Several data fusion
techniques have been introduced to cope with this problem, based on combining
PPG signals with inertial sensor data. Until know, both commercial and
reasearch solutions are computationally efficient but not very robust, or
strongly dependent on hand-tuned parameters, which leads to poor generalization
performance. % In this work, we tackle these limitations by proposing a
computationally lightweight yet robust deep learning-based approach for
PPG-based HR estimation. Specifically, we derive a diverse set of Temporal
Convolutional Networks (TCN) for HR estimation, leveraging Neural Architecture
Search (NAS). Moreover, we also introduce ActPPG, an adaptive algorithm that
selects among multiple HR estimators depending on the amount of MAs, to improve
energy efficiency. We validate our approaches on two benchmark datasets,
achieving as low as 3.84 Beats per Minute (BPM) of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on
PPGDalia, which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art. Moreover, we deploy
our models on a low-power commercial microcontroller (STM32L4), obtaining a
rich set of Pareto optimal solutions in the complexity vs. accuracy space.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A framework is proposed for generative models as a basis for digital twins or
mirrors of structures. The proposal is based on the premise that deterministic
models cannot account for the uncertainty present in most structural modelling
applications. Two different types of generative models are considered here. The
first is a physics-based model based on the stochastic finite element (SFE)
method, which is widely used when modelling structures that have material and
loading uncertainties imposed. Such models can be calibrated according to data
from the structure and would be expected to outperform any other model if the
modelling accurately captures the true underlying physics of the structure. The
potential use of SFE models as digital mirrors is illustrated via application
to a linear structure with stochastic material properties. For situations where
the physical formulation of such models does not suffice, a data-driven
framework is proposed, using machine learning and conditional generative
adversarial networks (cGANs). The latter algorithm is used to learn the
distribution of the quantity of interest in a structure with material
nonlinearities and uncertainties. For the examples considered in this work, the
data-driven cGANs model outperform the physics-based approach. Finally, an
example is shown where the two methods are coupled such that a hybrid model
approach is demonstrated.]]></summary>

target function. We are interested in characterizing processes for which
learning is possible and whether there exist learning rules guaranteed to be
universally consistent given the only assumption that such learning is
possible. The case of unbounded losses is very restrictive, since the learnable
processes almost surely visit a finite number of points and as a result, simple
memorization is optimistically universal. We focus on the bounded setting and
give a complete characterization of the processes admitting strong and weak
universal learning. We further show that k-nearest neighbor algorithm (kNN) is
not optimistically universal and present a novel variant of 1NN which is
optimistically universal for general input and value spaces in both strong and
weak setting. This closes all COLT 2021 open problems posed by Hanneke on

indistinguishability, a theoretical framework of machine learning recently
introduced by Dwork, Kim, Reingold, Rothblum, and Yona (STOC 2021). In outcome
indistinguishability, the goal of the learner is to output a predictor that
cannot be distinguished from the target predictor by a class $D$ of
distinguishers examining the outcomes generated according to the predictors'
predictions.

In the distribution-specific and realizable setting where the learner is
given the data distribution together with a predictor class $P$ containing the
target predictor, we show that the sample complexity of outcome
indistinguishability is characterized by the metric entropy of $P$ w.r.t. the
dual Minkowski norm defined by $D$, and equivalently by the metric entropy of
$D$ w.r.t. the dual Minkowski norm defined by $P$. This equivalence makes an
intriguing connection to the long-standing metric entropy duality conjecture in
convex geometry. Our sample complexity characterization implies a variant of
metric entropy duality, which we show is nearly tight. In the distribution-free
setting, we focus on the case considered by Dwork et al. where $P$ contains all
possible predictors, hence the sample complexity only depends on $D$. In this
setting, we show that the sample complexity of outcome indistinguishability is
characterized by the fat-shattering dimension of $D$.

We also show a strong sample complexity separation between realizable and
agnostic outcome indistinguishability in both the distribution-free and the
distribution-specific settings. This is in contrast to distribution-free (resp.
distribution-specific) PAC learning where the sample complexity in both the
realizable and the agnostic settings can be characterized by the VC dimension
(resp. metric entropy).]]></summary>

reconstructing images from highly-undersampled multi-coil k-space data

Methods: DL-Speed, an unrolled optimization architecture with dense
skip-layer connections, was trained on 3D T1-weighted brain scan data to
reconstruct complex-valued images from highly-undersampled k-space data. The
trained model was evaluated on 3D MPRAGE brain scan data
retrospectively-undersampled with a 10-fold acceleration, compared to a
conventional parallel imaging method with a 2-fold acceleration. Scores of SNR,
artifacts, gray/white matter contrast, resolution/sharpness, deep gray-matter,
cerebellar vermis, anterior commissure, and overall quality, on a 5-point
Likert scale, were assessed by experienced radiologists. In addition, the
trained model was tested on retrospectively-undersampled 3D T1-weighted LAVA
(Liver Acquisition with Volume Acceleration) abdominal scan data, and
prospectively-undersampled 3D MPRAGE and LAVA scans in three healthy volunteers
and one, respectively.

Results: The qualitative scores for DL-Speed with a 10-fold acceleration were
higher than or equal to those for the parallel imaging with 2-fold
acceleration. DL-Speed outperformed a compressed sensing method in quantitative
metrics on retrospectively-undersampled LAVA data. DL-Speed was demonstrated to
perform reasonably well on prospectively-undersampled scan data, realizing a
2-5 times reduction in scan time.

Conclusion: DL-Speed was shown to accelerate 3D MPRAGE and LAVA with up to a
net 10-fold acceleration, achieving 2-5 times faster scans compared to
conventional parallel imaging and acceleration, while maintaining diagnostic
image quality and real-time reconstruction. The brain scan data-trained
DL-Speed also performed well when reconstructing abdominal LAVA scan data,
demonstrating versatility of the network.]]></summary>

prominent two-stage pipeline alternates between eliminating possible incorrect
labels and semi-supervised training. However, discarding part of noisy labels
could result in a loss of information, especially when the corruption is not
completely random, e.g., class-dependent or instance-dependent. Moreover, from
the training dynamics of a representative two-stage method DivideMix, we
identify the domination of confirmation bias: pseudo-labels fail to correct a
considerable amount of noisy labels, and consequently, the errors accumulate.
To sufficiently exploit information from noisy labels and mitigate wrong
corrections, we propose Robust Label Refurbishment (Robust LR) a new hybrid
method that integrates pseudo-labeling and confidence estimation techniques to
refurbish noisy labels. We show that our method successfully alleviates the
damage of both label noise and confirmation bias. As a result, it achieves
state-of-the-art results across datasets and noise types. For example, Robust

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many fundamental problems affecting the care of critically ill patients lead
to similar analytical challenges: physicians cannot easily estimate the effects
of at-risk medical conditions or treatments because the causal effects of
medical conditions and drugs are entangled. They also cannot easily perform
studies: there are not enough high-quality data for high-dimensional
observational causal inference, and RCTs often cannot ethically be conducted.
However, mechanistic knowledge is available, including how drugs are absorbed
into the body, and the combination of this knowledge with the limited data
could potentially suffice -- if we knew how to combine them. In this work, we
present a framework for interpretable estimation of causal effects for
critically ill patients under exactly these complex conditions: interactions
between drugs and observations over time, patient data sets that are not large,
and mechanistic knowledge that can substitute for lack of data. We apply this
framework to an extremely important problem affecting critically ill patients,
namely the effect of seizures and other potentially harmful electrical events
in the brain (called epileptiform activity -- EA) on outcomes. Given the high
stakes involved and the high noise in the data, interpretability is critical
for troubleshooting such complex problems. Interpretability of our matched
groups allowed neurologists to perform chart reviews to verify the quality of
our causal analysis. For instance, our work indicates that a patient who
experiences a high level of seizure-like activity (75% high EA burden) and is
untreated for a six-hour window, has, on average, a 16.7% increased chance of
adverse outcomes such as severe brain damage, lifetime disability, or death. We
find that patients with mild but long-lasting EA (average EA burden >= 50%)
have their risk of an adverse outcome increased by 11.2%.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adversarial examples have recently drawn considerable attention in the field
of machine learning due to the fact that small perturbations in the data can
result in major performance degradation. This phenomenon is usually modeled by
a malicious adversary that can apply perturbations to the data in a constrained
fashion, such as being bounded in a certain norm. In this paper, we study this
problem when the adversary is constrained by the $\ell_0$ norm; i.e., it can
perturb a certain number of coordinates in the input, but has no limit on how
much it can perturb those coordinates. Due to the combinatorial nature of this
setting, we need to go beyond the standard techniques in robust machine
learning to address this problem. We consider a binary classification scenario
where $d$ noisy data samples of the true label are provided to us after
adversarial perturbations. We introduce a classification method which employs a
nonlinear component called truncation, and show in an asymptotic scenario, as
long as the adversary is restricted to perturb no more than $\sqrt{d}$ data
samples, we can almost achieve the optimal classification error in the absence
of the adversary, i.e. we can completely neutralize adversary's effect.
Surprisingly, we observe a phase transition in the sense that using a converse
argument, we show that if the adversary can perturb more than $\sqrt{d}$
coordinates, no classifier can do better than a random guess.]]></summary>

making the game arbitrarily complex with increasing board sizes. As such,
top-performing algorithms for playing Hex rely on accurate evaluation of board
positions using neural networks. However, the limited interpretability of
neural networks is problematic when the user wants to understand the reasoning
behind the predictions made. In this paper, we propose to use propositional
logic expressions to describe winning and losing board game positions,
facilitating precise visual interpretation. We employ a Tsetlin Machine (TM) to
learn these expressions from previously played games, describing where pieces
must be located or not located for a board position to be strong. Extensive
experiments on $6\times6$ boards compare our TM-based solution with popular
machine learning algorithms like XGBoost, InterpretML, decision trees, and
neural networks, considering various board configurations with $2$ to $22$
moves played. On average, the TM testing accuracy is $92.1\%$, outperforming
all the other evaluated algorithms. We further demonstrate the global
interpretation of the logical expressions and map them down to particular board
game configurations to investigate local interpretability. We believe the
resulting interpretability establishes building blocks for accurate assistive
AI and human-AI collaboration, also for more complex prediction tasks.]]></summary>

increasingly important in drug discovery. However, in contrast to other
domains, the performance of multi-task learning in drug discovery is still not
satisfying as the number of labeled data for each task is too limited, which
calls for additional data to complement the data scarcity. In this paper, we
study multi-task learning for molecular property prediction in a novel setting,
where a relation graph between tasks is available. We first construct a dataset
including around 400 tasks as well as a task relation graph. Then to better
utilize such relation graph, we propose a method called SGNN-EBM to
systematically investigate the structured task modeling from two perspectives.
(1) In the \emph{latent} space, we model the task representations by applying a
state graph neural network (SGNN) on the relation graph. (2) In the
\emph{output} space, we employ structured prediction with the energy-based
model (EBM), which can be efficiently trained through noise-contrastive
estimation (NCE) approach. Empirical results justify the effectiveness of
SGNN-EBM. Code is available on https://github.com/chao1224/SGNN-EBM.]]></summary>

manufacturability issues of topologically optimized structures, particularly
those represented as discrete density maps. However, the optimization of such
cellular structures is challenging due to the multiscale design problem. Past
work addressing this problem generally either only optimizes the volume
fraction of single-type unit cells but ignoring the effects of unit cell
geometry on properties, or considers the geometry-property relation but builds
this relation via heuristics. In contrast, we propose a simple yet more
principled way to accurately model the property to geometry mapping using a
conditional deep generative model, named Inverse Homogenization Generative
Adversarial Network (IH-GAN). It learns the conditional distribution of unit
cell geometries given properties and can realize the one-to-many mapping from
geometry to properties. We further reduce the complexity of IH-GAN by using the
implicit function parameterization to represent unit cell geometries. Results
show that our method can 1) generate various unit cells that satisfy given
material properties with high accuracy (relative error <5%) and 2) improve the
optimized structural performance over the conventional topology-optimized
variable-density structure. Specifically, in the minimum compliance example,
our IH-GAN generated structure achieves an 84.4% reduction in concentrated
stress and an extra 7% reduction in displacement. In the target deformation
examples, our IH-GAN generated structure reduces the target matching error by
24.2% and 44.4% for two test cases, respectively. We also demonstrated that the
connectivity issue for multi-type unit cells can be solved by transition layer
blending.]]></summary>

adopting some time-consuming techniques like dynamic programming (DP) for
decoding output structures, which permits parallel computation and makes the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent studies on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) reveal that the initial
node representations (i.e., the node representations before the first-time
graph convolution) largely affect the final model performance. However, when
learning the initial representation for a node, most existing work linearly
combines the embeddings of node features, without considering the interactions
among the features (or feature embeddings). We argue that when the node
features are categorical, e.g., in many real-world applications like user
profiling and recommender system, feature interactions usually carry important
signals for predictive analytics. Ignoring them will result in suboptimal
initial node representation and thus weaken the effectiveness of the follow-up
graph convolution. In this paper, we propose a new GCN model named CatGCN,
which is tailored for graph learning when the node features are categorical.
Specifically, we integrate two ways of explicit interaction modeling into the
learning of initial node representation, i.e., local interaction modeling on
each pair of node features and global interaction modeling on an artificial
feature graph. We then refine the enhanced initial node representations with
the neighborhood aggregation-based graph convolution. We train CatGCN in an
end-to-end fashion and demonstrate it on semi-supervised node classification.
Extensive experiments on three tasks of user profiling (the prediction of user
age, city, and purchase level) from Tencent and Alibaba datasets validate the
effectiveness of CatGCN, especially the positive effect of performing feature
interaction modeling before graph convolution.]]></summary>

hyperdimensional computing (HDC) classifiers have been emerging as a
lightweight framework to achieve efficient on-device inference. Nonetheless,
they have two fundamental drawbacks, heuristic training process and ultra-high
dimension, which result in sub-optimal inference accuracy and large model sizes
beyond the capability of tiny devices with stringent resource constraints. In
this paper, we address these fundamental drawbacks and propose a
low-dimensional computing (LDC) alternative. Specifically, by mapping our LDC
classifier into an equivalent neural network, we optimize our model using a
principled training approach. Most importantly, we can improve the inference
accuracy while successfully reducing the ultra-high dimension of existing HDC
models by orders of magnitude (e.g., 8000 vs. 4/64). We run experiments to
evaluate our LDC classifier by considering different datasets for inference on
tiny devices, and also implement different models on an FPGA platform for
acceleration. The results highlight that our LDC classifier offers an
overwhelming advantage over the existing brain-inspired HDC models and is
particularly suitable for inference on tiny devices.]]></summary>

neglects tissue heterogenity. The latter can be calculated using different

the training procedure of GRU is inherently sequential. Prior efforts to
parallelize GRU have largely focused on conventional parallelization strategies
such as data-parallel and model-parallel training algorithms. However, when the
given sequences are very long, existing approaches are still inevitably
performance limited in terms of training time. In this paper, we present a
novel parallel training scheme (called parallel-in-time) for GRU based on a
multigrid reduction in time (MGRIT) solver. MGRIT partitions a sequence into
multiple shorter sub-sequences and trains the sub-sequences on different
processors in parallel. The key to achieving speedup is a hierarchical
correction of the hidden state to accelerate end-to-end communication in both
the forward and backward propagation phases of gradient descent. Experimental
results on the HMDB51 dataset, where each video is an image sequence,
demonstrate that the new parallel training scheme achieves up to 6.5$\times$
speedup over a serial approach. As efficiency of our new parallelization
strategy is associated with the sequence length, our parallel GRU algorithm
achieves significant performance improvement as the sequence length increases.]]></summary>

data and used to predict future values. It is assumed that the data
distribution does not change over time (stationarity). However, in real-world

adapt to the new incoming data. This phenomenon is known as concept drift and
leads to a decrease in the predictive model's performance. In this study, we
propose a new concept drift detection method based on autoregressive models
called ADDM. This method can be integrated into any machine learning algorithm
from deep neural networks to simple linear regression model. Our results show
that this new concept drift detection method outperforms the state-of-the-art
drift detection methods, both on synthetic data sets and real-world data sets.
Our approach is theoretically guaranteed as well as empirical and effective for

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new Bayesian modelling framework is introduced for piece-wise homogeneous
variable-memory Markov chains, along with a collection of effective algorithmic
tools for change-point detection and segmentation of discrete time series.
Building on the recently introduced Bayesian Context Trees (BCT) framework, the
distributions of different segments in a discrete time series are described as
variable-memory Markov chains. Inference for the presence and location of
change-points is then performed via Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The key
observation that facilitates effective sampling is that, using one of the BCT
algorithms, the prior predictive likelihood of the data can be computed
exactly, integrating out all the models and parameters in each segment. This
makes it possible to sample directly from the posterior distribution of the
number and location of the change-points, leading to accurate estimates and
providing a natural quantitative measure of uncertainty in the results.
Estimates of the actual model in each segment can also be obtained, at

standard practice in natural language processing applications. Unfortunately,
training large neural language models, such as transformers, from scratch is
very costly and requires a vast amount of training data, which might not be
available in the application domain of interest. Moreover, in many real-world
scenarios, classes are uncovered as more data is seen, calling for
class-incremental modelling approaches. In this work we devise a method to
perform text classification using pre-trained models on a sequence of
classification tasks provided in sequence. We formalize the problem as a
continual learning problem where the algorithm learns new tasks without
performance degradation on the previous ones and without re-training the model
from scratch. We empirically demonstrate that our method requires significantly
less model parameters compared to other state of the art methods and that it is
significantly faster at inference time. The tight control on the number of
model parameters, and so the memory, is not only improving efficiency. It is
making possible the usage of the algorithm in real-world applications where
deploying a solution with a constantly increasing memory consumption is just
unrealistic. While our method suffers little forgetting, it retains a
predictive performance on-par with state of the art but less memory efficient
methods.]]></summary>

distributed machine learning (ML) approaches that provide some data privacy
protection mechanisms. In the time-series classification problem, many
researchers typically use 1D convolutional neural networks (1DCNNs) based on
the SL approach with a single client to reduce the computational overhead at
the client-side while still preserving data privacy. Another method, recurrent
neural network (RNN), is utilized on sequentially partitioned data where
segments of multiple-segment sequential data are distributed across various
clients. However, to the best of our knowledge, it is still not much work done
in SL with long short-term memory (LSTM) network, even the LSTM network is
practically effective in processing time-series data. In this work, we propose
a new approach, LSTMSPLIT, that uses SL architecture with an LSTM network to
classify time-series data with multiple clients. The differential privacy (DP)
is applied to solve the data privacy leakage. The proposed method, LSTMSPLIT,
has achieved better or reasonable accuracy compared to the Split-1DCNN method
using the electrocardiogram dataset and the human activity recognition dataset.
Furthermore, the proposed method, LSTMSPLIT, can also achieve good accuracy
after applying differential privacy to preserve the user privacy of the cut
layer of the LSTMSPLIT.]]></summary>

machine learning models. Scholars have increased focus on unraveling the bias
and fairness in the models, also in relation to inherent biases in the input
data. However, limited work exists on the representativity of samples
(datasets) for appropriate inference in AI systems. This paper analyzes data
representativity in scientific literature related to AI and sampling, and gives
a brief overview of statistical sampling methodology from disciplines like
sampling of physical materials, experimental design, survey analysis, and
observational studies. Different notions of a 'representative sample' exist in
past and present literature. In particular, the contrast between the notion of
a representative sample in the sense of coverage of the input space, versus a
representative sample as a miniature of the target population is of relevance
when building AI systems. Using empirical demonstrations on US Census data, we
demonstrate that the first is useful for providing equality and demographic
parity, and is more robust to distribution shifts, whereas the latter notion is
useful in situations where the purpose is to make historical inference or draw
inference about the underlying population in general, or make better
predictions for the majority in the underlying population. We propose a
framework of questions for creating and documenting data, with data
representativity in mind, as an addition to existing datasheets for datasets.
Finally, we will also like to call for caution of implicit, in addition to
explicit, use of a notion of data representativeness without specific
clarification.]]></summary>

prediction and detection of drivers of cleared homicides at the national- and
state-levels in the United States.

Methods: First, nine algorithmic approaches are compared to assess the best
performance in predicting cleared homicides country-wise, using data from the
Murder Accountability Project. The most accurate algorithm among all (XGBoost)
is then used for predicting clearance outcomes state-wise. Second, SHAP, a
framework for Explainable Artificial Intelligence, is employed to capture the
most important features in explaining clearance patterns both at the national
and state levels.

Results: At the national level, XGBoost demonstrates to achieve the best
performance overall. Substantial predictive variability is detected state-wise.
In terms of explainability, SHAP highlights the relevance of several features
in consistently predicting investigation outcomes. These include homicide
circumstances, weapons, victims' sex and race, as well as number of involved
offenders and victims.

Conclusions: Explainable Machine Learning demonstrates to be a helpful
framework for predicting homicide clearance. SHAP outcomes suggest a more
organic integration of the two theoretical perspectives emerged in the
literature. Furthermore, jurisdictional heterogeneity highlights the importance
of developing ad hoc state-level strategies to improve police performance in
clearing homicides.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hierarchical models represent a challenging setting for inference algorithms.
MCMC methods struggle to scale to large models with many local variables and
observations, and variational inference (VI) may fail to provide accurate
approximations due to the use of simple variational families. Some variational
methods (e.g. importance weighted VI) integrate Monte Carlo methods to give
better accuracy, but these tend to be unsuitable for hierarchical models, as
they do not allow for subsampling and their performance tends to degrade for
high dimensional models. We propose a new family of variational bounds for
hierarchical models, based on the application of tightening methods (e.g.
importance weighting) separately for each group of local random variables. We
show that our approach naturally allows the use of subsampling to get unbiased
gradients, and that it fully leverages the power of methods that build tighter
lower bounds by applying them independently in lower dimensional spaces,
leading to better results and more accurate posterior approximations than
relevant baselines.]]></summary>

consecutive latent points are sampled on the Euclidean Sphere using an unknown

stamp-time $k$ we add a latent point $X_k$ sampled by jumping from the previous
one $X_{k-1}$ in a direction chosen uniformly $Y_k$ and with a length $r_k$
drawn from an unknown distribution called the latitude function. The connection
probabilities between each pair of nodes are equal to the envelope function of
the distance between these two latent points. We provide theoretical guarantees
for the non-parametric estimation of the latitude and the envelope functions.We

regression due to its ability to quickly adapt to unseen tasks. However, it has
not yet been well explored on regression tasks with high dimensional inputs
such as images. This paper makes two main contributions that help understand
this barely explored area. \emph{First}, we design two new types of
cross-category level vision regression tasks, namely object discovery and pose
estimation of unprecedented complexity in the meta-learning domain for computer
vision. To this end, we (i) exhaustively evaluate common meta-learning
techniques on these tasks, and (ii) quantitatively analyze the effect of
various deep learning techniques commonly used in recent meta-learning
algorithms in order to strengthen the generalization capability: data
augmentation, domain randomization, task augmentation and meta-regularization.
Finally, we (iii) provide some insights and practical recommendations for
training meta-learning algorithms on vision regression tasks. \emph{Second}, we
propose the addition of functional contrastive learning (FCL) over the task
representations in Conditional Neural Processes (CNPs) and train in an
end-to-end fashion. The experimental results show that the results of prior
work are misleading as a consequence of a poor choice of the loss function as
well as too small meta-training sets. Specifically, we find that CNPs
outperform MAML on most tasks without fine-tuning. Furthermore, we observe that
naive task augmentation without a tailored design results in underfitting.]]></summary>

neural networks without significantly affecting their performance, which
involves removing redundant regular regions of weights. However, current
structured pruning methods are highly empirical in nature, do not provide any

inapplicable in the limited-data regime. We propose a principled data-efficient
structured pruning method based on submodular optimization. In particular, for
a given layer, we select neurons/channels to prune and corresponding new
weights for the next layer, that minimize the change in the next layer's input
induced by pruning. We show that this selection problem is a weakly submodular
maximization problem, thus it can be provably approximated using an efficient
greedy algorithm. Our method is one of the few in the literature that uses only
a limited-number of training data and no labels. Our experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms popular baseline methods in various

processes almost surely visit a finite number of points and as a result, simple
memorization is optimistically universal. We focus on the bounded setting and
give a complete characterization of the processes admitting strong and weak
universal learning. We further show that k-nearest neighbor algorithm (kNN) is

increasingly important in drug discovery. However, in contrast to other
domains, the performance of multi-task learning in drug discovery is still not
satisfying as the number of labeled data for each task is too limited, which
calls for additional data to complement the data scarcity. In this paper, we
study multi-task learning for molecular property prediction in a novel setting,
where a relation graph between tasks is available. We first construct a dataset
including around 400 tasks as well as a task relation graph. Then to better
utilize such relation graph, we propose a method called SGNN-EBM to
systematically investigate the structured task modeling from two perspectives.
(1) In the \emph{latent} space, we model the task representations by applying a
state graph neural network (SGNN) on the relation graph. (2) In the
\emph{output} space, we employ structured prediction with the energy-based

spaces. This is done based on Kirszbraun's extension theorem, to the best of
our knowledge, the first application of this technique to supervised learning.
We analyze the statistical and computational aspects of this method. We
decompose this task into two stages: training (which corresponds operationally
to smoothing/regularization) and prediction (which is achieved via Kirszbraun
extension). Both are solved algorithmically via a novel multiplicative weight
updates (MWU) scheme, which, for our problem formulation, achieves a quadratic
runtime improvement over the state of the art. Our empirical results indicate a
dramatic improvement over standard off-the-shelf solvers in our setting.]]></summary>

arbitrary dimensions in regression tasks. One quantifies the structure of
uncertainty and the other quantifies the distribution of uncertainty. The
structure metric assesses the similarity in shape and location of uncertainty
with the true error, while the distribution metric quantifies the supported
magnitudes between the two. We apply these metrics to Gaussian Processes (GPs),
Ensemble Deep Neural Nets (DNNs), and Ensemble Deep Neural Operators (DNOs) on
high-dimensional and nonlinear test cases. We find that comparing a model's
uncertainty estimates with the model's squared error provides a compelling
ground truth assessment. We also observe that both DNNs and DNOs, especially
when compared to GPs, provide encouraging metric values in high dimensions with
either sparse or plentiful data.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Data representativity is crucial when drawing inference from data through
machine learning models. Scholars have increased focus on unraveling the bias
and fairness in the models, also in relation to inherent biases in the input
data. However, limited work exists on the representativity of samples
(datasets) for appropriate inference in AI systems. This paper analyzes data
representativity in scientific literature related to AI and sampling, and gives
a brief overview of statistical sampling methodology from disciplines like
sampling of physical materials, experimental design, survey analysis, and
observational studies. Different notions of a 'representative sample' exist in
past and present literature. In particular, the contrast between the notion of
a representative sample in the sense of coverage of the input space, versus a
representative sample as a miniature of the target population is of relevance
when building AI systems. Using empirical demonstrations on US Census data, we
demonstrate that the first is useful for providing equality and demographic
parity, and is more robust to distribution shifts, whereas the latter notion is
useful in situations where the purpose is to make historical inference or draw
inference about the underlying population in general, or make better
predictions for the majority in the underlying population. We propose a
framework of questions for creating and documenting data, with data
representativity in mind, as an addition to existing datasheets for datasets.
Finally, we will also like to call for caution of implicit, in addition to
explicit, use of a notion of data representativeness without specific
clarification.]]></summary>

number of common machine learning algorithms. Subspaces have been shown to
provide useful, robust representations for datasets of images, videos and more.
Since subspaces correspond to points on a Grassmann manifold, one is led to
consider the idea of a subspace prototype for a Grassmann-valued dataset. While
a number of different subspace prototypes have been described, the calculation
of some of these prototypes has proven to be computationally expensive while
other prototypes are affected by outliers and produce highly imperfect
clustering on noisy data. This work proposes a new subspace prototype, the flag
median, and introduces the FlagIRLS algorithm for its calculation. We provide
evidence that the flag median is robust to outliers and can be used effectively
in algorithms like Linde-Buzo-Grey (LBG) to produce improved clusterings on
Grassmannians. Numerical experiments include a synthetic dataset, the MNIST
handwritten digits dataset, the Mind's Eye video dataset and the UCF YouTube
action dataset. The flag median is compared the other leading algorithms for
computing prototypes on the Grassmannian, namely, the $\ell_2$-median and to
the flag mean. We find that using FlagIRLS to compute the flag median converges
in $4$ iterations on a synthetic dataset. We also see that Grassmannian LBG
with a codebook size of $20$ and using the flag median produces at least a
$10\%$ improvement in cluster purity over Grassmannian LBG using the flag mean
or $\ell_2$-median on the Mind's Eye dataset.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The inverse approach is computationally efficient in aerodynamic design as
the desired target performance distribution is prespecified. However, it has
some significant limitations that prevent it from achieving full efficiency.
First, the iterative procedure should be repeated whenever the specified target
distribution changes. Target distribution optimization can be performed to
clarify the ambiguity in specifying this distribution, but several additional
problems arise in this process such as loss of the representation capacity due
to parameterization of the distribution, excessive constraints for a realistic
distribution, inaccuracy of quantities of interest due to theoretical/empirical
predictions, and the impossibility of explicitly imposing geometric
constraints. To deal with these issues, a novel inverse design optimization
framework with a two-step deep learning approach is proposed. A variational
autoencoder and multi-layer perceptron are used to generate a realistic target
distribution and predict the quantities of interest and shape parameters from
the generated distribution, respectively. Then, target distribution
optimization is performed as the inverse design optimization. The proposed
framework applies active learning and transfer learning techniques to improve
accuracy and efficiency. Finally, the framework is validated through
aerodynamic shape optimizations of the wind turbine airfoil. Their results show
that this framework is accurate, efficient, and flexible to be applied to other
inverse design engineering applications.]]></summary>

imperceptible perturbations to their input, such as $\ell_p$-bounded norm
adversarial attacks. This has motivated the development of many defense
methods, which are then broken by new attacks, and so on. This paper focuses on
a different but related problem of reverse engineering adversarial attacks.
Specifically, given an attacked signal, we study conditions under which one can
determine the type of attack ($\ell_1$, $\ell_2$ or $\ell_\infty$) and recover
the clean signal. We pose this problem as a block-sparse recovery problem,
where both the signal and the attack are assumed to lie in a union of subspaces
that includes one subspace per class and one subspace per attack type. We
derive geometric conditions on the subspaces under which any attacked signal
can be decomposed as the sum of a clean signal plus an attack. In addition, by
determining the subspaces that contain the signal and the attack, we can also
classify the signal and determine the attack type. Experiments on digit and
face classification demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.]]></summary>

often, simplifying assumptions are made introducing modeling errors. In this

constrained bottleneck autoencoders can be used to learn the underlying unknown
detector response model directly from data. The results show that excellent
performance results can be achieved even when the signals are significantly

solution of nonlinear, time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs).
Current state-of-the-art PDE solvers treat the space- and time-dimensions
separately, serially, and with black-box algorithms, which obscures the
interactions between spatial and temporal approximation errors and misguides
the quantification of the overall error. To fix this issue, we introduce a
probabilistic version of a technique called method of lines. The proposed
algorithm begins with a Gaussian process interpretation of finite difference
methods, which then interacts naturally with filtering-based probabilistic
ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers because they share a common
language: Bayesian inference. Joint quantification of space- and
time-uncertainty becomes possible without losing the performance benefits of
well-tuned ODE solvers. Thereby, we extend the toolbox of probabilistic
programs for differential equation simulation to PDEs.]]></summary>

These assumptions allow us to derive a decomposition of the underlying space

such Jacobians are modeled using free multiplicative convolutions from Free
Probability Theory (FPT). We present a reliable and very fast method for

Our technique is based on an homotopy method: it is an adaptative
Newton-Raphson scheme which chains basins of attraction. We find contiguous
lilypad-like basins and step from one to the next, heading towards the
objective.

In order to demonstrate the applicability of our method we show that the
relevant FPT metrics computed before training are highly correlated to final

increasingly prevalent, offering new opportunities for safer and more
convenient travel and potentially smarter traffic control methods exploiting
automation and connectivity. Car following is a prime function in autonomous
driving. Car following based on reinforcement learning has received attention
in recent years with the goal of learning and achieving performance levels
comparable to humans. However, most existing RL methods model car following as
a unilateral problem, sensing only the vehicle ahead. Recent literature,
however, Wang and Horn [16] has shown that bilateral car following that
considers the vehicle ahead and the vehicle behind exhibits better system
stability. In this paper we hypothesize that this bilateral car following can
be learned using RL, while learning other goals such as efficiency
maximisation, jerk minimization, and safety rewards leading to a learned model
that outperforms human driving.

We propose and introduce a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework for
car following control by integrating bilateral information into both state and
reward function based on the bilateral control model (BCM) for car following
control. Furthermore, we use a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning
framework to generate the corresponding control action for each agent. Our
simulation results demonstrate that our learned policy is better than the human
driving policy in terms of (a) inter-vehicle headways, (b) average speed, (c)
jerk, (d) Time to Collision (TTC) and (e) string stability.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The demand to process vast amounts of data generated from state-of-the-art
high resolution cameras has motivated novel energy-efficient on-device AI
solutions. Visual data in such cameras are usually captured in the form of
analog voltages by a sensor pixel array, and then converted to the digital
domain for subsequent AI processing using analog-to-digital converters (ADC).
Recent research has tried to take advantage of massively parallel low-power
analog/digital computing in the form of near- and in-sensor processing, in
which the AI computation is performed partly in the periphery of the pixel
array and partly in a separate on-board CPU/accelerator. Unfortunately,
high-resolution input images still need to be streamed between the camera and
the AI processing unit, frame by frame, causing energy, bandwidth, and security
bottlenecks. To mitigate this problem, we propose a novel
Processing-in-Pixel-in-memory (P2M) paradigm, that customizes the pixel array
by adding support for analog multi-channel, multi-bit convolution and ReLU
(Rectified Linear Units). Our solution includes a holistic algorithm-circuit
co-design approach and the resulting P2M paradigm can be used as a drop-in
replacement for embedding memory-intensive first few layers of convolutional
neural network (CNN) models within foundry-manufacturable CMOS image sensor
platforms. Our experimental results indicate that P2M reduces data transfer
bandwidth from sensors and analog to digital conversions by ~21x, and the
energy-delay product (EDP) incurred in processing a MobileNetV2 model on a
TinyML use case for visual wake words dataset (VWW) by up to ~11x compared to
standard near-processing or in-sensor implementations, without any significant
drop in test accuracy.]]></summary>

(AEC) industry, information retrieval (IR) from unstructured textual data based
on natural language processing (NLP) is gaining increasing attention. Although
various deep learning (DL) models for IR tasks have been investigated in the
AEC domain, it is still unclear how domain corpora and domain-specific
pretrained DL models can improve performance in various IR tasks. To this end,
this work systematically explores the impacts of domain corpora and various
transfer learning techniques on the performance of DL models for IR tasks and
proposes a pretrained domain-specific language model for the AEC domain. First,
both in-domain and close-domain corpora are developed. Then, two types of
pretrained models, including traditional wording embedding models and
BERT-based models, are pretrained based on various domain corpora and transfer
learning strategies. Finally, several widely used DL models for IR tasks are
further trained and tested based on various configurations and pretrained
models. The result shows that domain corpora have opposite effects on
traditional word embedding models for text classification and named entity
recognition tasks but can further improve the performance of BERT-based models
in all tasks. Meanwhile, BERT-based models dramatically outperform traditional
methods in all IR tasks, with maximum improvements of 5.4% and 10.1% in the F1
score, respectively. This research contributes to the body of knowledge in two
ways: 1) demonstrating the advantages of domain corpora and pretrained DL
models and 2) opening the first domain-specific dataset and pretrained language
model for the AEC domain, to the best of our knowledge. Thus, this work sheds
light on the adoption and application of pretrained models in the AEC domain.]]></summary>

computers have recently started to offer new viable computational paradigms to
tackle such problems. On the one hand, quantum algorithms may notably be used
to extend the reach of electronic structure calculations. On the other hand,
quantum machine learning is also emerging as an alternative and promising path
to quantum advantage. Here we follow this second route and establish a direct
connection between classical and quantum solutions for learning neural network
potentials. To this end, we design a quantum neural network architecture and
apply it successfully to different molecules of growing complexity. The quantum

planning (GTAMP). GTAMP is a subclass of task and motion planning in which the
goal is to move multiple objects to target regions among movable obstacles. A
standard graph search algorithm is not directly applicable, because GTAMP
problems involve hybrid search spaces and expensive action feasibility checks.
To handle this, we introduce a novel planner that extends basic heuristic
search with random sampling and a heuristic function that prioritizes
feasibility checking on promising state action pairs. The main drawback of such
pure planners is that they lack the ability to learn from planning experience
to improve their efficiency. We propose two learning algorithms to address
this. The first is an algorithm for learning a rank function that guides the
discrete task level search, and the second is an algorithm for learning a
sampler that guides the continuous motionlevel search. We propose design
principles for designing data efficient algorithms for learning from planning
experience and representations for effective generalization. We evaluate our

structure-property relationships and fast screening of chemical compounds.
Recently proposed methods have demonstrated that using 3D geometry information
of the molecule along with the bonding structure can lead to more accurate
prediction on a wide range of properties. A common practice is to use 3D
geometries computed through density functional theory (DFT) for both training
and testing of models. However, the computational time needed for DFT
calculations can be prohibitively large. Moreover, many of the properties that
we aim to predict can often be obtained with little or no overhead on top of
the DFT calculations used to produce the 3D geometry information, voiding the
need for a predictive model. To be practically useful for high-throughput
chemical screening and drug discovery, it is desirable to work with 3D
geometries obtained using less-accurate but much more efficient non-DFT
methods. In this work we investigate the impact of using non-DFT conformations
in the training and the testing of existing models and propose a data
augmentation method for improving the prediction accuracy of classical
forcefield-derived geometries.]]></summary>

automatic network design in recent years. Previous NAS methods suffer from
limited search spaces, which may lead to sub-optimal results. In this paper, we
propose UENAS, an evolution-based NAS framework with a broader search space
that supports optimizing network architectures, pruning strategies, and
hyperparameters simultaneously. To alleviate the huge search cost caused by the
expanded search space, three strategies are adopted: First, an adaptive pruning
strategy that iteratively trims the average model size in the population
without compromising performance. Second, child networks share weights of
overlapping layers with pre-trained parent networks to reduce the training
epochs. Third, an online predictor scores the joint representations of
architecture, pruning strategy, and hyperparameters to filter out inferior
combos. By the proposed three strategies, the search efficiency is
significantly improved and more well-performed compact networks with tailored
hyper-parameters are derived. In experiments, UENAS achieves error rates of
2.81% on CIFAR-10, 20.24% on CIFAR-100, and 33% on Tiny-ImageNet, which shows
the effectiveness of our method.]]></summary>

unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm network (USNET) with multiple UAV clusters,
where the inherent follow strategy (IFS) of low-level follower UAVs (FUAVs)
with respect to high-level cluster head UAVs (HUAVs) is unknown. We first
propose a graph attention self-supervised learning algorithm (GASSL) to detect
the HUAVs of a single UAV cluster, where the GASSL can fit the IFS at the same
time. Then, to detect the HUAVs in the USNET with multiple UAV clusters, we
develop a multi-cluster graph attention self-supervised learning algorithm
(MC-GASSL) based on the GASSL. The MC-GASSL clusters the USNET with a gated
recurrent unit (GRU)-based metric learning scheme and finds the HUAVs in each
cluster with GASSL. Numerical results show that the GASSL can detect the HUAVs
in single UAV clusters obeying various kinds of IFSs with over 98% average
accuracy. The simulation results also show that the clustering purity of the
USNET with MC-GASSL exceeds that with traditional clustering algorithms by at

HUAVs in USNETs with various IFSs and cluster numbers with low detection

promises faster scanning time. To this end, current State-of-The-Art (SoTA)
approaches leverage deep neural networks and supervised training to learn a
recovery model. While these approaches achieve impressive performances, the
learned model can be fragile on unseen degradation, e.g. when given a different
acceleration factor. These methods are also generally deterministic and provide
a single solution to an ill-posed problem; as such, it can be difficult for
practitioners to understand the reliability of the reconstruction. We introduce
DiffuseRecon, a novel diffusion model-based MR reconstruction method.
DiffuseRecon guides the generation process based on the observed signals and a
pre-trained diffusion model, and does not require additional training on
specific acceleration factors. DiffuseRecon is stochastic in nature and
generates results from a distribution of fully-sampled MR images; as such, it
allows us to explicitly visualize different potential reconstruction solutions.
Lastly, DiffuseRecon proposes an accelerated, coarse-to-fine Monte-Carlo
sampling scheme to approximate the most likely reconstruction candidate. The
proposed DiffuseRecon achieves SoTA performances reconstructing from raw
acquisition signals in fastMRI and SKM-TEA.]]></summary>

the data just from a few training samples. Requiring a large number of data
samples, many deep learning solutions suffer from data hunger and extensively
high computation time and resources. Furthermore, data is often not available
due to not only the nature of the problem or privacy concerns but also the cost
of data preparation. Data collection, preprocessing, and labeling are strenuous
human tasks. Therefore, few-shot learning that could drastically reduce the
turnaround time of building machine learning applications emerges as a low-cost
solution. This survey paper comprises a representative list of recently
proposed few-shot learning algorithms. Given the learning dynamics and
characteristics, the approaches to few-shot learning problems are discussed in
the perspectives of meta-learning, transfer learning, and hybrid approaches

complex mechanisms. Current quantitative causal models rely on one or more
assumptions: (1) the climate drivers persistently generate conflict, (2) the
causal mechanisms have a linear relationship with the conflict generation
parameter, and/or (3) there is sufficient data to inform the prior
distribution. Yet, we know conflict drivers often excite a social
transformation process which leads to violence (e.g., drought forces
agricultural producers to join urban militia), but further climate effects do
not necessarily contribute to further violence. Therefore, not only is this
bifurcation relationship highly non-linear, there is also often a lack of data
to support prior assumptions for high resolution modeling. Here, we aim to
overcome the aforementioned causal modeling challenges by proposing a neural
forward-intensity Poisson process (NFIPP) model. The NFIPP is designed to
capture the potential non-linear causal mechanism in climate induced political
violence, whilst being robust to sparse and timing-uncertain data. Our results
span 20 recent years and reveal an excitation-based causal link between extreme
climate events and political violence across diverse countries. Our
climate-induced conflict model results are cross-validated against qualitative
climate vulnerability indices. Furthermore, we label historical events that
either improve or reduce our predictability gain, demonstrating the importance
of domain expertise in informing interpretation.]]></summary>

objects of interest (targets) in a search space using decision making
algorithms that adapt to the history of their observations. It has important
applications in search and rescue missions, wildlife patrolling and environment
monitoring. Active search algorithms must contend with two types of
uncertainty: detection uncertainty and location uncertainty. Prior work has
typically focused on one of these while ignoring or engineering away the other.
The more common approach in robotics is to focus on location uncertainty and
remove detection uncertainty by thresholding the detection probability to zero
or one. On the other hand, it is common in the sparse signal processing
literature to assume the target location is accurate and focus on the
uncertainty of its detection. In this work, we propose an inference method to
jointly handle both target detection and location uncertainty. We then build a
decision making algorithm on this inference method that uses Thompson sampling
to enable efficient active search in both the single agent and multi-agent
settings. We perform experiments in simulation over varying number of agents
and targets to show that our inference and decision making algorithms
outperform competing baselines that only account for either target detection or
location uncertainty.]]></summary>

indistinguishability, a theoretical framework of machine learning recently
introduced by Dwork, Kim, Reingold, Rothblum, and Yona (STOC 2021). In outcome
indistinguishability, the goal of the learner is to output a predictor that
cannot be distinguished from the target predictor by a class $D$ of
distinguishers examining the outcomes generated according to the predictors'
predictions.

In the distribution-specific and realizable setting where the learner is
given the data distribution together with a predictor class $P$ containing the
target predictor, we show that the sample complexity of outcome
indistinguishability is characterized by the metric entropy of $P$ w.r.t. the
dual Minkowski norm defined by $D$, and equivalently by the metric entropy of
$D$ w.r.t. the dual Minkowski norm defined by $P$. This equivalence makes an
intriguing connection to the long-standing metric entropy duality conjecture in
convex geometry. Our sample complexity characterization implies a variant of
metric entropy duality, which we show is nearly tight. In the distribution-free
setting, we focus on the case considered by Dwork et al. where $P$ contains all
possible predictors, hence the sample complexity only depends on $D$. In this
setting, we show that the sample complexity of outcome indistinguishability is
characterized by the fat-shattering dimension of $D$.

We also show a strong sample complexity separation between realizable and
agnostic outcome indistinguishability in both the distribution-free and the
distribution-specific settings. This is in contrast to distribution-free (resp.
distribution-specific) PAC learning where the sample complexity in both the
realizable and the agnostic settings can be characterized by the VC dimension
(resp. metric entropy).]]></summary>

cure has been developed for it. Breast cancer is one of the most common cancer
types. According to the National Breast Cancer foundation, in 2020 alone, more
than 276,000 new cases of invasive breast cancer and more than 48,000
non-invasive cases were diagnosed in the US. To put these figures in
perspective, 64% of these cases are diagnosed early in the disease's cycle,
giving patients a 99% chance of survival. Artificial intelligence and machine
learning have been used effectively in detection and treatment of several
dangerous diseases, helping in early diagnosis and treatment, and thus
increasing the patient's chance of survival. Deep learning has been designed to
analyze the most important features affecting detection and treatment of
serious diseases. For example, breast cancer can be detected using genes or
histopathological imaging. Analysis at the genetic level is very expensive, so
histopathological imaging is the most common approach used to detect breast
cancer. In this research work, we systematically reviewed previous work done on
detection and treatment of breast cancer using genetic sequencing or
histopathological imaging with the help of deep learning and machine learning.

learning to enhance the efficiency of path planning while fully respecting
safety constraints. In particular, the dominant computational cost in such
safety-critical settings is running a model-based safety checker on the
proposed paths. Our learned search heuristic can simultaneously predict the
feasibility for all path options in a single run, and the model-based safety
checker is only invoked on the top-scoring paths. We validate in high-fidelity
simulations using both real Martian terrain data collected by the Perseverance
rover, as well as a suite of challenging synthetic terrains. Our experiments
show that: (i) compared to the baseline ENav path planner on board the
Perserverance rover, MLNav can provide a significant improvement in multiple
key metrics, such as a 10x reduction in collision checks when navigating real
Martian terrains, despite being trained with synthetic terrains; and (ii) MLNav
can successfully navigate highly challenging terrains where the baseline ENav
fails to find a feasible path before timing out.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In stream-based active learning, the learning procedure typically has access
to a stream of unlabeled data instances and must decide for each instance
whether to label it and use it for training or to discard it. There are
numerous active learning strategies which try to minimize the number of labeled
samples required for training in this setting by identifying and retaining the
most informative data samples. Most of these schemes are rule-based and rely on
the notion of uncertainty, which captures how small the distance of a data
sample is from the classifier's decision boundary. Recently, there have been
some attempts to learn optimal selection strategies directly from the data, but
many of them are still lacking generality for several reasons: 1) They focus on
specific classification setups, 2) They rely on rule-based metrics, 3) They
require offline pre-training of the active learner on related tasks. In this
work we address the above limitations and present an online stream-based meta
active learning method which learns on the fly an informativeness measure
directly from the data, and is applicable to a general class of classification
problems without any need for pretraining of the active learner on related
tasks. The method is based on reinforcement learning and combines episodic
policy search and a contextual bandits approach which are used to train the
active learner in conjunction with training of the model. We demonstrate on
several real datasets that this method learns to select training samples more
efficiently than existing state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

larger -- even if the resulting models are overparameterized. Nevertheless,
carefully removing such excess parameters before, during, or after training may
also produce models with similar or even improved accuracy. In many cases, that
can be curiously achieved by heuristics as simple as removing a percentage of
the weights with the smallest absolute value -- even though magnitude is not a
perfect proxy for weight relevance. With the premise that obtaining
significantly better performance from pruning depends on accounting for the
combined effect of removing multiple weights, we revisit one of the classic
approaches for impact-based pruning: the Optimal Brain Surgeon~(OBS). We
propose a tractable heuristic for solving the combinatorial extension of OBS,
in which we select weights for simultaneous removal, as well as a systematic
update of the remaining weights. Our selection method outperforms other methods
under high sparsity, and the weight update is advantageous even when combined

behaviors and trajectories. At a certain time, to forecast a reasonable future
trajectory, each agent needs to pay attention to the interactions with only a
small group of most relevant agents instead of unnecessarily paying attention
to all the other agents. However, existing attention modeling works ignore that
human attention in driving does not change rapidly, and may introduce
fluctuating attention across time steps. In this paper, we formulate an
attention model for multi-agent interactions based on a total variation
temporal smoothness prior and propose a trajectory prediction architecture that
leverages the knowledge of these attended interactions. We demonstrate how the
total variation attention prior along with the new sequence prediction loss
terms leads to smoother attention and more sample-efficient learning of
multi-agent trajectory prediction, and show its advantages in terms of
prediction accuracy by comparing it with the state-of-the-art approaches on
both synthetic and naturalistic driving data. We demonstrate the performance of
our algorithm for trajectory prediction on the INTERACTION dataset on our

many tasks but have shown extreme vulnerabilities to attacks generated by
adversarial examples. Many works go with a white-box attack that assumes total
access to the targeted model including its architecture and gradients. A more
realistic assumption is the black-box scenario where an attacker only has
access to the targeted model by querying some input and observing its predicted
class probabilities. Different from most prevalent black-box attacks that make
use of substitute models or gradient estimation, this paper proposes a
gradient-free attack by using a concept of evolutionary art to generate
adversarial examples that iteratively evolves a set of overlapping transparent
shapes. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we attack three
state-of-the-art image classification models trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset in
a targeted manner. We conduct a parameter study outlining the impact the number

learning. Recent advances in representation learning give rise to developments
in distance-based OOD detection, where testing samples are detected as OOD if
they are relatively far away from the centroids or prototypes of
in-distribution (ID) classes. However, prior methods directly take
off-the-shelf loss functions that suffice for classifying ID samples, but are
not optimally designed for OOD detection. In this paper, we propose CIDER, a
simple and effective representation learning framework by exploiting
hyperspherical embeddings for OOD detection. CIDER jointly optimizes two losses
to promote strong ID-OOD separability: (1) a dispersion loss that promotes
large angular distances among different class prototypes, and (2) a compactness
loss that encourages samples to be close to their class prototypes. We show
that CIDER is effective under various settings and establishes state-of-the-art
performance. On a hard OOD detection task CIFAR-100 vs. CIFAR-10, our method
substantially improves the AUROC by 14.20% compared to the embeddings learned

number of common machine learning algorithms. Subspaces have been shown to
provide useful, robust representations for datasets of images, videos and more.
Since subspaces correspond to points on a Grassmann manifold, one is led to
consider the idea of a subspace prototype for a Grassmann-valued dataset. While
a number of different subspace prototypes have been described, the calculation
of some of these prototypes has proven to be computationally expensive while
other prototypes are affected by outliers and produce highly imperfect
clustering on noisy data. This work proposes a new subspace prototype, the flag
median, and introduces the FlagIRLS algorithm for its calculation. We provide
evidence that the flag median is robust to outliers and can be used effectively
in algorithms like Linde-Buzo-Grey (LBG) to produce improved clusterings on
Grassmannians. Numerical experiments include a synthetic dataset, the MNIST
handwritten digits dataset, the Mind's Eye video dataset and the UCF YouTube
action dataset. The flag median is compared the other leading algorithms for
computing prototypes on the Grassmannian, namely, the $\ell_2$-median and to
the flag mean. We find that using FlagIRLS to compute the flag median converges
in $4$ iterations on a synthetic dataset. We also see that Grassmannian LBG
with a codebook size of $20$ and using the flag median produces at least a
$10\%$ improvement in cluster purity over Grassmannian LBG using the flag mean
or $\ell_2$-median on the Mind's Eye dataset.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the expected rise in behind-the-meter solar penetration within the
distribution networks, there is a need to develop time-series forecasting
methods that can reliably predict the net-load, accurately quantifying its
uncertainty and variability. This paper presents a deep learning method to
generate probabilistic forecasts of day-ahead net-load at 15-min resolution, at
various solar penetration levels. Our proposed deep-learning based architecture
utilizes the dimensional reduction, from a higher-dimensional input to a
lower-dimensional latent space, via a convolutional Autoencoder (AE). The
extracted features from AE are then utilized to generate probability
distributions across the latent space, by passing the features through a
kernel-embedded Perron-Frobenius (kPF) operator. Finally, long short-term
memory (LSTM) layers are used to synthesize time-series probability
distributions of the forecasted net-load, from the latent space distributions.
The models are shown to deliver superior forecast performance (as per several
metrics), as well as maintain superior training efficiency, in comparison to
existing benchmark models. Detailed analysis is carried out to evaluate the
model performance across various solar penetration levels (up to 50\%),
prediction horizons (e.g., 15\,min and 24\,hr ahead), and aggregation level of
houses, as well as its robustness against missing measurements.]]></summary>

independences existing between the components of a random vector. Staged trees
are an extension of Bayesian networks for categorical random vectors whose
graph represents non-symmetric conditional independences via vertex coloring.
However, since they are based on a tree representation of the sample space, the
underlying graph becomes cluttered and difficult to visualize as the number of
variables increases. Here we introduce the first structural learning algorithms
for the class of simple staged trees, entertaining a compact coalescence of the
underlying tree from which non-symmetric independences can be easily read. We
show that data-learned simple staged trees often outperform Bayesian networks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A framework is proposed for generative models as a basis for digital twins or
mirrors of structures. The proposal is based on the premise that deterministic
models cannot account for the uncertainty present in most structural modelling
applications. Two different types of generative models are considered here. The
first is a physics-based model based on the stochastic finite element (SFE)
method, which is widely used when modelling structures that have material and
loading uncertainties imposed. Such models can be calibrated according to data
from the structure and would be expected to outperform any other model if the
modelling accurately captures the true underlying physics of the structure. The
potential use of SFE models as digital mirrors is illustrated via application
to a linear structure with stochastic material properties. For situations where
the physical formulation of such models does not suffice, a data-driven
framework is proposed, using machine learning and conditional generative
adversarial networks (cGANs). The latter algorithm is used to learn the
distribution of the quantity of interest in a structure with material
nonlinearities and uncertainties. For the examples considered in this work, the
data-driven cGANs model outperform the physics-based approach. Finally, an
example is shown where the two methods are coupled such that a hybrid model
approach is demonstrated.]]></summary>

coordinate system - a technique widely used in various applications of computer
vision, such as remote sensing, image retrieval, and most commonly in medical
imaging. Deep Learning based techniques have been applied successfully to
tackle various complex medical image processing problems, including medical
image registration. Over the years, several image registration techniques have
been proposed using deep learning. Deformable image registration techniques
such as Voxelmorph have been successful in capturing finer changes and
providing smoother deformations. However, Voxelmorph, as well as ICNet and
FIRE, do not explicitly encode global dependencies (i.e. the overall anatomical
view of the supplied image) and therefore can not track large deformations. In
order to tackle the aforementioned problems, this paper extends the Voxelmorph
approach in three different ways. To improve the performance in case of small
as well as large deformations, supervision of the model at different
resolutions have been integrated using a multi-scale UNet. To support the
network to learn and encode the minute structural co-relations of the given
image-pairs, a self-constructing graph network (SCGNet) has been used as the
latent of the multi-scale UNet - which can improve the learning process of the
model and help the model to generalise better. And finally, to make the
deformations inverse-consistent, cycle consistency loss has been employed. On
the task of registration of brain MRIs, the proposed method achieved
significant improvements over ANTs and VoxelMorph, obtaining a Dice score of
0.8013$\pm$0.0243 for intramodal and 0.6211$\pm$0.0309 for intermodal, while
VoxelMorph achieved 0.7747$\pm$0.0260 and 0.6071$\pm$0.0510, respectively.]]></summary>

System (MAS), which comprises multiple roads and traffic lights.Constructing a
model of MAS for ITLCS is the basis to alleviate traffic congestion. Existing
approaches of MAS are largely based on Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning
(MADRL). Although the Deep Neural Network (DNN) of MABRL is effective, the
training time is long, and the parameters are difficult to trace. Recently,
Broad Learning Systems (BLS) provided a selective way for learning in the deep
neural networks by a flat network. Moreover, Broad Reinforcement Learning (BRL)
extends BLS in Single Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (SADRL) problem with
promising results. However, BRL does not focus on the intricate structures and
interaction of agents. Motivated by the feature of MADRL and the issue of BRL,
we propose a Multi-Agent Broad Reinforcement Learning (MABRL) framework to
explore the function of BLS in MAS. Firstly, unlike most existing MADRL
approaches, which use a series of deep neural networks structures, we model
each agent with broad networks. Then, we introduce a dynamic self-cycling
interaction mechanism to confirm the "3W" information: When to interact, Which
agents need to consider, What information to transmit. Finally, we do the
experiments based on the intelligent traffic light control scenario. We compare
the MABRL approach with six different approaches, and experimental results on
three datasets verify the effectiveness of MABRL.]]></summary>

maintain the long-term exploration capability of the agent. To tackle this
problem, it has been recently proposed to provide intrinsic rewards for the
agent to encourage exploration. However, most existing intrinsic reward-based
methods proposed in the literature fail to provide sustainable exploration
incentives, a problem known as vanishing rewards. In addition, these
conventional methods incur complex models and additional memory in their
learning procedures, resulting in high computational complexity and low
robustness. In this work, a novel intrinsic reward module based on the R\'enyi
entropy is proposed to provide high-quality intrinsic rewards. It is shown that
the proposed method actually generalizes the existing state entropy
maximization methods. In particular, a $k$-nearest neighbor estimator is
introduced for entropy estimation while a $k$-value search method is designed
to guarantee the estimation accuracy. Extensive simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed R\'enyi entropy-based method can achieve higher performance

effects in 2D cancer cell cultures. We train a convolutional autoencoder on 1M
images dataset with random augmentations and multi-crops to use as feature
extractor. We systematically compare it to the pretrained state-of-the-art
models. We further use the feature extractor in two ways. First, we apply
distance-based analysis and dynamic time warping to cluster temporal patterns
of 31 drugs. We identify clusters allowing annotation of drugs as having
cytotoxic, cytostatic, mixed or no effect. Second, we implement an
adversarial/regularized learning setup to improve classification of 31 drugs
and visualize image regions that contribute to the improvement. We increase
top-3 classification accuracy by 8% on average and mine examples of
morphological feature importance maps. We provide the feature extractor and the
weights to foster transfer learning applications in biology. We also discuss
utility of other pretrained models and applicability of our methods to other
types of biomedical data.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm trying to build a scalable RL system that uses super-computers to train. But doesn't rely on the common assumption that environment evaluation is slow (which is not the case for me). And instead emphasizes HPC resources for super-efficient policy-space exploration. 
 I've tried using parallelized versions of PPO, especially those that emphasize batch size via distributed training and gradient averaging but I have had limited success.
 I've begun to wonder, what if I only use GA to train RL? I don't understand why this isn't more popular because GA's have absolutely no limits when it comes to scaling in a parallel fashion and are significantly simpler than most RL algorithms. 
 I'm essentially wondering if there is some catch to GA-based training that I'm not aware of which makes it not as desirable as attempting to scale more complicated RL algorithms?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently saw many people interested in whether the algorithm from the "Gradients without Backpropagation" paper works and people saying they were waiting for the authors to release their PyTorch code. So while we're waiting I decided to quickly hack together a proof-of-concept that computes estimates of gradients using dual numbers based on the paper.
 CODE: https://github.com/ForceBru/Matches.jl
 I wrapped it in a PyTorch-like interface, so you can create and train Sequential models with a bunch of Linear layers and various activation functions. The code aims to be self-contained, so I also rolled my own implementation of dual numbers to compute directional derivatives.
 It seems to work, so everyone is welcome to have a look and mess with the code.
 The paper in question: Baydin, A. G., Pearlmutter, B. A., Syme, D., Wood, F., & Torr, P. (2022). Gradients without Backpropagation (Version 1). arXiv. https://doi.org/10.48550/ARXIV.2202.08587

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all!
 I am a last year PhD student. I have been mainly working on fundamental research for multiagent RL. Even though I am sure I want to continue with a postdoc and remain in this field, I also need to make sure I can be employed if this does not go according to the plan.
 I have interviewed for some industry research internships at big companies (not FAANG but close. Big communications etc). They publish in high-profile conferences. The problem was that, I did not fit their internship profile because I do not have the necessary toolkit (e.g. Very fluent in PyTorch) to produce quickly in an internship. But, they said I should apply for a permanent position where time is not this tight. 
 I noticed, there are tons of tools used in industry that I have no idea about. From the Apache Kafka to a ton of things I cannot even recall. I was asked about Apache, Azure, AWS in other interviews. I realize I may not have the needed toolkit for industry, as a researcher. I write meh code, only to get empirical results for my papers. What do you think are the most important things to get my teeth into, in order to increase my employability in industry after a machine learning PhD?

 From it's description, it says it stores past weights and reuses them to optimize the calculation when given a pair of gradients/variabels. 
 My question is, what is the scope of the stored values?
 If I use the Adam optimization on a Dense layer, is the scope per "neuron" or the entire layer at once? Or is it keeping track of all weights across the entire multilayer network? (i.e. Conv2D feeds into the dense). 
 My naive thought is, that it's scoped to each "Neuron". And in a Conv2D layer scoped to a single Kernel of a Filter. But I can't find an exact wording on how this works out.

 …you *can* tune its HPs on a single GPU thanks to new theoretical advances?
  
Hi Reddit,
 I'm excited to share with you our latest work, [2203.03466] Tensor Programs V: Tuning Large Neural Networks via Zero-Shot Hyperparameter Transfer (arxiv.org).

 (Disclaimer: this post is shamelessly converted from my twitter thread)
 The idea is actually really simple: in a special parametrization introduced in our previous work (reddit thread) called µP, narrow and wide neural networks share the same set of optimal hyperparameters. This w…]]></summary>

 Hamilton is an open-source system to generate feature transforms by writing simple python functions. It's been valuable for our use at Stitch Fix, and we're excited to see how it could be used by the outside world.
 Our team's goal at Stitch Fix is to provide an experience that allows Data Scientists/MLE to worry less about infrastructure. By allowing representation of complex data transforms (feature generation, models, etc...) with simple python functions, we think we've found something that really helps with that.
 We're actively working on new capabilities and taking requests/accepting contributions. Would love to see what the data science community thinks! Can you see it being useful? What would you want to be added in?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi /r/MachineLearning,
 We would like to highlight to the community our new research paper published at JMLR on how to reparameterise the search space in which gradient descent occurs, when training neural networks: https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v23/20-040.html
 We call this new space target space - it is the space of target activations for the hidden nodes in the network, as opposed to the usual weight space.
 Hence learning occurs by doing gradient descent on these hidden target activations, as opposed to doing gradient descent on the weights themselves. In this sense it provides a new paradigm on how to train neural networks. We explain and address the exploding gradients problem in terms of "cascade untangling". This stabilises the training process, and we argue it smooths out the gradient descent surface into something more manageable and less chaotic.
 For highlights of the paper see Figs.2 and Fig 4. Results also show us training ordinary RNNs to match or beat performance of RNNs with memory gates (e.g. on the IMDB sentiment analysis problem), and CNN benchmarks.
 TensorFlow code is provided.
 We would welcome any discussion here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys, I am creating the app which can:
 Functionalities till now:
  
Predict car prices (poland market only)
 Scrap data from advertisments like otomoto.pl
  
ToDo:
  
Explain car prices (XAI)
 Find potentially worthy cars / advertisments (e.g. if predicted price < real price)
 Explore data about cars in Poland to better understand the market
 Better model
  
Here is the link: https://share.streamlit.io/mateuszdalba/car_app/app.py
 This app might be usefull for:
  
People who want to sell their car but they are not experts
 People who want to make profit on potentially profitable advertisments
 People who want to better understand car market
  
Right now model was trained on 23 000 observations (car advertisments) which I scrapped myself. There are 12 variables used (while I can have ~104 parameters from data).
 The code is avaliable on github: https://github.com/mateuszdalba/car_app

 'Fake news' or its more formal name ‘misinformation’ is a term that we have become increasingly familiar with throughout the pandemic and conflict in Ukraine. With the rising amounts of misinformation flooding our internet spaces, it's vital that we turn to technology to help us combat it. Full Fact is an independent charity and fact-checking org in the UK that has been working to apply Machine learning to help fight 'Fake news'.
 For the past few years, we have been developing AI tools to help increase the speed, reach and impact of our fact-checking, which we intend to share with like-minded organisations around the world.
 It’s worth remembering that we are not attempting to replace fact-checkers with AI, but to empower fact-checkers with the best AI-driven tools. We expect most fact checks to be completed by a highly trained human, but we want to use technology to help fact-checkers:
  
Know the most important thing to be fact-checking each day
 Know when someone repeats something they already know to be false
 Check things in as close to real-time as possible
  
We are proud of the work that we do at Full Fact and are excited to share our work with the Machine learning community. I hope this video provides some insight into the benefits that AI can bring to the fact-checking process and inspires more research into the space. You can learn more about our work here.
