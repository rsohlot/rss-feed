        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I noticed that the default argument for `deterministic` in DQN is false. But how would that work? Typically DQN is trained with a deterministic function approximator. How would the algorithm become stochastic during inference time? In DQN the final layer activation is linear and therefore I don't see how one could even make this algorithm stochastic, unlike policy gradient where the final layer is softmax or Normal.

 I have been working on scalable GNN training for a while and noticed that the bottleneck of training GNNs is the graph sampling and feature fetching stages. GNN training frameworks PyG and DGL that most people use seem to default to using Neighbor Sampling for minibatch training. I am hoping that with my new paper Layer-Neighbor Sampling -- Defusing Neighborhood Explosion in GNNs, this default might be due to change.
 My new approach combines the layer sampling approach with the neighbor sampling approach. The result is that there is more overlap in the sampled neighborhoods and one still gets a fixed number of neighbors per seed vertex. It is even possible to turn it into a subgraph sampling approach by fixing the random seed used for sampling across all layers of the GNN m…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is no one definitive answer to this question, as the percentage of our thoughts that come to us on their own without our consciously choosing them can vary depending on the individual and the situation. However, some estimates suggest that up to 95% of our thoughts may be involuntary.
 This is because our thoughts are constantly being influenced by a variety of factors, both external and internal. For example, our environment, our emotions, and our physical state can all play a role in determining what thoughts pop into our heads.
 In addition, our brains are constantly processing information and making predictions, even when we are not actively thinking about anything. This process can sometimes lead to spontaneous thoughts, such as when we suddenly remember something that we had forgotten or when we come up with a new idea.
 While some of our spontaneous thoughts may be negative or intrusive, many of them can also be helpful or creative. For example, a spontaneous thought may help us to solve a problem, come up with a new solution, or simply make us smile.
 Overall, it is clear that a significant portion of our thoughts come to us without our consciously choosing them. This is a natural part of the human cognitive process and can be both beneficial and detrimental.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today we live in a world of multi-model LLMs. How will the following technologies fare against these LLM-based models? 
  
Neural VQA
 
Semantic Scene Segmentation
 
 Multi-model LLM are emerging quickly now, (such as NExT-GPT https://next-gpt.github.io/ ) . When you consider the kind of "understanding" of a visual scene these models are capable of, what will happen to prior approaches like Neural VQA? The nagging feeling that Neural VQA is going to be completely superseded by LLMs is palpable. The only vestige left for the older technology may have something to do with reasoning about the objects , such as properly counting the number of objects of a category that are present. But even that is getting sketchy. 
 On the topic of scene understanding, we can turn to semantic scene segmentation. SSS is a more complicated topic than Neural VQA. SOTA SSS algorithms are still largely employing DeConv Nets, and still require fully labelled datasets. With multi-model LLMs, there is a nagging question : Why go through the complexity/mess of first segmenting a scene very accurately, when an LLM can do better at identifying the entire scene's category in one fail swoop? 
 One might suggest that SSS still has a use in regards to interacting with the segmented objects of an environment, where one such "interaction" would be avoiding collisions with pedestrians, trees, or other cars. But honestly, SSS does not really make this connection with planning and action, it really only gives you the categories of the segments. THe autonomous vehicle's next moves are still an open problem. 
 What technologies do you expect that multi-model LLMs will supersede, if any?

I couldn't understand how an RNN with only fixed activations act as RL? Can someone help?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey. First of all I'm not a researcher on this area, so pardon my ignorance.
 I'm looking to employ a GAN on a dataset. The goals are still a bit unclear, but it's mainly to improve classification by either data augmentation and class balancing, or understanding the data through the latent representations.
 I'm really keen on InfoGAN at the moment. I trained one on the MNIST and the continuous variables learned the rotation and width, as in the paper and other peoples code.
 But at this point I think I need some help. I have labels, which means that maybe I should use a conditional GAN. But how will I learn similar representations as those in InfoGAN? I know StyleGAN is the current big thing in this area, but my images are limited to similar pixel-range as MNIST, and StyleGAN seems dependant on the ProGAN idea of increasing resolution for training.
 I'm a bit confused on the whole topic and would love a pointer to any discussion etc., as I can't seem to find anything but papers and they seem to be only focused on human faces, my data is unnatural not unsimilar again to MNIST. I don't have semantical information either as I see many papers employing that.
 I see many papers employing semi-supervision in this area, but honestly I'm just a bit lost and overwhelmed as this is not my area and GAN papers are still not stopping (I read a post here from 2017 about a GAN making GANs...).
 If you read this far: thank you and any pointers and discussion are very welcome. I would post on /r/learnmachinelearning but I feel the discussion in there is very different from this. My main goal is data exploration, but also to prove effectiveness some classification will be necessary and here the generative approach may help to augment data efficiently.

academic and applied machine learning. On the other hand, these steps are
becoming ever increasingly delicate due to the extensive rise in the number,
diversity, and distributedness of machine learning resources. Multi-agent
systems, when applied to the design of machine learning platforms, bring about
several distinctive characteristics such as scalability, flexibility, and
robustness, just to name a few. This paper proposes a fully automatic and
collaborative agent-based mechanism for selecting distributedly organized
machine learning algorithms and simultaneously tuning their hyperparameters.
Our method builds upon an existing agent-based hierarchical machine-learning
platform and augments its query structure to support the aforementioned
functionalities without being limited to specific learning, selection, and
tuning mechanisms. We have conducted theoretical assessments, formal
verification, and analytical study to demonstrate the correctness, resource
utilization, and computational efficiency of our technique. According to the
results, our solution is totally correct and exhibits linear time and space
complexity in relation to the size of available resources. To provide concrete
examples of how the proposed methodologies can effectively adapt and perform
across a range of algorithmic options and datasets, we have also conducted a
series of experiments using a system comprised of 24 algorithms and 9 datasets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Traffic prediction is a crucial topic because of its broad scope of
applications in the transportation domain. Recently, various studies have
achieved promising results. However, most studies assume the prediction
locations have complete or at least partial historical records and cannot be
extended to non-historical recorded locations. In real-life scenarios, the
deployment of sensors could be limited due to budget limitations and
installation availability, which makes most current models not applicable.
Though few pieces of literature tried to impute traffic states at the missing
locations, these methods need the data simultaneously observed at the locations
with sensors, making them not applicable to prediction tasks. Another drawback
is the lack of measurement of uncertainty in prediction, making prior works
unsuitable for risk-sensitive tasks or involving decision-making. To fill the
gap, inspired by the previous inductive graph neural network, this work
proposed an uncertainty-aware framework with the ability to 1) extend
prediction to missing locations with no historical records and significantly
extend spatial coverage of prediction locations while reducing deployment of
sensors and 2) generate probabilistic prediction with uncertainty
quantification to help the management of risk and decision making in the
down-stream tasks. Through extensive experiments on real-life datasets, the
result shows our method achieved promising results on prediction tasks, and the
uncertainty quantification gives consistent results which highly correlated
with the locations with and without historical data. We also show that our
model could help support sensor deployment tasks in the transportation field to
achieve higher accuracy with a limited sensor deployment budget.]]></summary>

single precision IEEE 754 floating point numbers (binary32), can also work
using lower precision. Therefore, 16-bit and 8-bit compressed format have
attracted considerable attention. In this paper, we focused on two families of
formats that have already achieved interesting results in compressing binary32
numbers in machine learning applications, without sensible degradation of the
accuracy: bfloat and posit. Even if 16-bit and 8-bit bfloat/posit are routinely
used for reducing the storage of the weights/biases of trained DNNs, the
inference still often happens on the 32-bit FPU of the CPU (especially if GPUs
are not available). In this paper we propose a way to decompress a tensor of
bfloat/posits just before computations, i.e., after the compressed operands
have been loaded within the vector registers of a vector capable CPU, in order
to save bandwidth usage and increase cache efficiency. Finally, we show the
architectural parameters and considerations under which this solution is

performance on many complex language tasks, there is a great interest in
bringing these LLMs to mobile devices for faster responses and better privacy
protection. However, the size of LLMs (i.e., billions of parameters) requires
highly effective compression to fit into storage-limited devices. Among many
compression techniques, weight-clustering, a form of non-linear quantization,
is one of the leading candidates for LLM compression, and supported by modern
smartphones. Yet, its training overhead is prohibitively significant for LLM
fine-tuning. Especially, Differentiable KMeans Clustering, or DKM, has shown
the state-of-the-art trade-off between compression ratio and accuracy
regression, but its large memory complexity makes it nearly impossible to apply
to train-time LLM compression. In this paper, we propose a memory-efficient DKM
implementation, eDKM powered by novel techniques to reduce the memory footprint
of DKM by orders of magnitudes. For a given tensor to be saved on CPU for the
backward pass of DKM, we compressed the tensor by applying uniquification and
sharding after checking if there is no duplicated tensor previously copied to
CPU. Our experimental results demonstrate that \prjname can fine-tune and
compress a pretrained LLaMA 7B model from 12.6 GB to 2.5 GB (3bit/weight) with
the Alpaca dataset by reducing the train-time memory footprint of a decoder
layer by 130$\times$, while delivering good accuracy on broader LLM benchmarks
(i.e., 77.7% for PIQA, 66.1% for Winograde, and so on).]]></summary>

important step in the drug discovery pipeline. Graph neural fingerprint is a
promising method for developing molecular docking surrogates with high
throughput and great fidelity. In this study, we built a COVID-19 drug docking
dataset of about 300,000 drug candidates on 23 coronavirus protein targets.
With this dataset, we trained graph neural fingerprint docking models for
high-throughput virtual COVID-19 drug screening. The graph neural fingerprint
models yield high prediction accuracy on docking scores with the mean squared
error lower than $0.21$ kcal/mol for most of the docking targets, showing
significant improvement over conventional circular fingerprint methods. To make
the neural fingerprints transferable for unknown targets, we also propose a
transferable graph neural fingerprint method trained on multiple targets. With
comparable accuracy to target-specific graph neural fingerprint models, the
transferable model exhibits superb training and data efficiency. We highlight
that the impact of this study extends beyond COVID-19 dataset, as our approach

the pixel space by adding adversarial perturbations. By contrast, semantic
adversarial attacks focus on changing semantic attributes of clean examples,
such as color, context, and features, which are more feasible in the real
world. In this paper, we propose a framework to quickly generate a semantic
adversarial attack by leveraging recent diffusion models since semantic
information is included in the latent space of well-trained diffusion models.
Then there are two variants of this framework: 1) the Semantic Transformation
(ST) approach fine-tunes the latent space of the generated image and/or the
diffusion model itself; 2) the Latent Masking (LM) approach masks the latent
space with another target image and local backpropagation-based interpretation
methods. Additionally, the ST approach can be applied in either white-box or
black-box settings. Extensive experiments are conducted on CelebA-HQ and AFHQ
datasets, and our framework demonstrates great fidelity, generalizability, and
transferability compared to other baselines. Our approaches achieve
approximately 100% attack success rate in multiple settings with the best FID

challenging task due to the unknown physical properties such as mass
distribution and coefficient of friction. In this study, we propose a
meta-learning algorithm called ConDex, which incorporates Conditional Neural
Processes (CNP) with DexNet-2.0 to autonomously discern the underlying physical
properties of objects using depth images. ConDex efficiently acquires physical
embeddings from limited trials, enabling precise grasping point estimation.
Furthermore, ConDex is capable of updating the predicted grasping quality
iteratively from new trials in an online fashion. To the best of our knowledge,
we are the first who generate two object datasets focusing on inhomogeneous
physical properties with varying mass distributions and friction coefficients.
Extensive evaluations in simulation demonstrate ConDex's superior performance
over DexNet-2.0 and existing meta-learning-based grasping pipelines.
Furthermore, ConDex shows robust generalization to previously unseen real-world
objects despite training solely in the simulation. The synthetic and real-world
datasets will be published as well.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spatial-temporal data contains rich information and has been widely studied
in recent years due to the rapid development of relevant applications in many
fields. For instance, medical institutions often use electrodes attached to
different parts of a patient to analyse the electorencephal data rich with
spatial and temporal features for health assessment and disease diagnosis.
Existing research has mainly used deep learning techniques such as
convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN) to extract
hidden spatial-temporal features. Yet, it is challenging to incorporate both
inter-dependencies spatial information and dynamic temporal changes
simultaneously. In reality, for a model that leverages these spatial-temporal
features to fulfil complex prediction tasks, it often requires a colossal
amount of training data in order to obtain satisfactory model performance.
Considering the above-mentioned challenges, we propose an adaptive federated
relevance framework, namely FedRel, for spatial-temporal graph learning in this
paper. After transforming the raw spatial-temporal data into high quality
features, the core Dynamic Inter-Intra Graph (DIIG) module in the framework is
able to use these features to generate the spatial-temporal graphs capable of
capturing the hidden topological and long-term temporal correlation information
in these graphs. To improve the model generalization ability and performance
while preserving the local data privacy, we also design a relevance-driven
federated learning module in our framework to leverage diverse data
distributions from different participants with attentive aggregations of their
models.]]></summary>

discriminative representation space.A generated feature is meaningful when the
generated feature is from a feature pair with inherent feature interaction. In
the real world, experienced data scientists can identify potentially useful

exponentially large search space, in an optimal crossing form over an optimal

such learning tasks as self-optimizing feature generation. Self-optimizing
feature generation imposes several under-addressed challenges on existing
systems: meaningful, robust, and efficient generation. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a principled and generic representation-crossing
framework to solve self-optimizing feature generation.To achieve hashing
representation, we propose a three-step approach: feature discretization,
feature hashing, and descriptive summarization. To achieve reinforcement
crossing, we develop a hierarchical reinforcement feature crossing approach.We

driving technologies where the entire driving pipeline is replaced with a
single neural network because of its simpler structure and faster inference

safety issues arXiv:2003.06404. The trained policy is not always compliant with
the traffic rules and it is also hard to discover the reason for the
misbehavior because of the lack of intermediate outputs. Meanwhile, Sensors are
also critical to autonomous driving's security and feasibility to perceive the
surrounding environment under complex driving scenarios. In this paper, we
proposed P-CSG, a novel penalty-based imitation learning approach with cross
semantics generation sensor fusion technologies to increase the overall
performance of End-to-End Autonomous Driving. We conducted an assessment of our

scientific knowledge graphs such as molecular interaction or chemical reaction
networks that define cellular signaling relationships. In these situations,
source nodes typically have distinct biophysical properties from sinks. Due to
their ordered and unidirectional relationships, many such networks also have
hierarchical and multiscale structure. However, the majority of methods
performing node- and edge-level tasks in machine learning do not take these
properties into account, and thus have not been leveraged effectively for
scientific tasks such as cellular signaling network inference. We propose a new
framework called Directed Scattering Autoencoder (DSAE) which uses a directed
version of a geometric scattering transform, combined with the non-linear
dimensionality reduction properties of an autoencoder and the geometric
properties of the hyperbolic space to learn latent hierarchies. We show this
method outperforms numerous others on tasks such as embedding directed graphs

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Accurately labeling biomedical data presents a challenge. Traditional
semi-supervised learning methods often under-utilize available unlabeled data.
To address this, we propose a novel reliability-based training data cleaning
method employing inductive conformal prediction (ICP). This method capitalizes
on a small set of accurately labeled training data and leverages ICP-calculated
reliability metrics to rectify mislabeled data and outliers within vast
quantities of noisy training data. The efficacy of the method is validated
across three classification tasks within distinct modalities: filtering
drug-induced-liver-injury (DILI) literature with title and abstract, predicting
ICU admission of COVID-19 patients through CT radiomics and electronic health
records, and subtyping breast cancer using RNA-sequencing data. Varying levels
of noise to the training labels were introduced through label permutation.
Results show significant enhancements in classification performance: accuracy
enhancement in 86 out of 96 DILI experiments (up to 11.4%), AUROC and AUPRC
enhancements in all 48 COVID-19 experiments (up to 23.8% and 69.8%), and
accuracy and macro-average F1 score improvements in 47 out of 48 RNA-sequencing
experiments (up to 74.6% and 89.0%). Our method offers the potential to
substantially boost classification performance in multi-modal biomedical
machine learning tasks. Importantly, it accomplishes this without necessitating
an excessive volume of meticulously curated training data.]]></summary>

essential to various downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis, sarcasm

In this work, we aim to directly model this by proposing the use of two
auxiliary losses jointly with the main task when fine-tuning any pre-trained
multimodal model. Image-Text Contrastive (ITC) brings image-text
representations of a post closer together and separates them from different
posts, capturing underlying dependencies. Image-Text Matching (ITM) facilitates
the understanding of semantic correspondence between images and text by
penalizing unrelated pairs. We combine these objectives with five multimodal

detectors, a weakly supervised video-based deep learning model called Robust

blooms of water bodies, and is an important indicator for evaluating water
quality. The prediction of chlorophyll concentration change trend is of great
significance to environmental protection and aquaculture. However, there is a
complex and indistinguishable nonlinear relationship between many factors
affecting chlorophyll concentration. In order to effectively mine the nonlinear

adaptive graph-time convolutional network ( AGTCNSD ) prediction model.
Firstly, the original sequence is decomposed into trend component and periodic
component by moving average method. Secondly, based on the graph convolutional
neural network, the water quality parameter data is modeled, and a parameter
embedding matrix is defined. The idea of matrix decomposition is used to assign
weight parameters to each node. The adaptive graph convolution learns the
relationship between different water quality parameters, updates the state
information of each parameter, and improves the learning ability of the update
relationship between nodes. Finally, time dependence is captured by time
convolution to achieve multi-step prediction of chlorophyll concentration. The
validity of the model is verified by the water quality data of the coastal city
Beihai. The results show that the prediction effect of this method is better

used by journalists and fact-checkers to assess the veracity of online content.
Automating the task of credibility signal extraction, however, is very
challenging as it requires high-accuracy signal-specific extractors to be
trained, while there are currently no sufficiently large datasets annotated
with all credibility signals. This paper investigates whether large language
models (LLMs) can be prompted effectively with a set of 18 credibility signals
to produce weak labels for each signal. We then aggregate these potentially
noisy labels using weak supervision in order to predict content veracity. We
demonstrate that our approach, which combines zero-shot LLM credibility signal
labeling and weak supervision, outperforms state-of-the-art classifiers on two
misinformation datasets without using any ground-truth labels for training. We
also analyse the contribution of the individual credibility signals towards
predicting content veracity, which provides new valuable insights into their
role in misinformation detection.]]></summary>

is complicated by the fact that trial eligibility is stated in natural
language. A potential solution to this problem is to employ text classification
methods for common types of eligibility criteria. In this study, we focus on
seven common exclusion criteria in cancer trials: prior malignancy, human
immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, psychiatric illness,
drug/substance abuse, and autoimmune illness. Our dataset consists of 764 phase
III cancer trials with these exclusions annotated at the trial level. We
experiment with common transformer models as well as a new pre-trained clinical
trial BERT model. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of automatically
classifying common exclusion criteria. Additionally, we demonstrate the value
of a pre-trained language model specifically for clinical trials, which yields
the highest average performance across all criteria.]]></summary>

multidimensional signal and image processing, most traditional neural networks
process data represented by (multidimensional) arrays of real numbers. The
intercorrelation between feature channels is usually expected to be learned
from the training data, requiring numerous parameters and careful training. In
contrast, vector-valued neural networks are conceived to process arrays of
vectors and naturally consider the intercorrelation between feature channels.
Consequently, they usually have fewer parameters and often undergo more robust
training than traditional neural networks. This paper aims to present a broad
framework for vector-valued neural networks, referred to as V-nets. In this
context, hypercomplex-valued neural networks are regarded as vector-valued
models with additional algebraic properties. Furthermore, this paper explains
the relationship between vector-valued and traditional neural networks.
Precisely, a vector-valued neural network can be obtained by placing
restrictions on a real-valued model to consider the intercorrelation between
feature channels. Finally, we show how V-nets, including hypercomplex-valued
neural networks, can be implemented in current deep-learning libraries as
real-valued networks.]]></summary>

learning (ML) model for diagnosing and monitoring Parkinson's disease (PD) in
an Internet of Things (IoT) environment using rest-state EEG signals (rs-EEG).
We computed different types of entropy from EEG signals and found that Fuzzy
Entropy performed the best in diagnosing and monitoring PD using rs-EEG. We
also investigated different combinations of signal frequency ranges and EEG
channels to accurately diagnose PD. Finally, with a fewer number of features
(11 features), we achieved a maximum classification accuracy (ARKF) of ~99.9%.
The most prominent frequency range of EEG signals has been identified, and we
have found that high classification accuracy depends on low-frequency signal
components (0-4 Hz). Moreover, the most informative signals were mainly
received from the right hemisphere of the head (F8, P8, T8, FC6). Furthermore,
we assessed the accuracy of the diagnosis of PD using three different lengths
of EEG data (150-1000 samples). Because the computational complexity is reduced
by reducing the input data. As a result, we have achieved a maximum mean
accuracy of 99.9% for a sample length (LEEG) of 1000 (~7.8 seconds), 98.2% with
a LEEG of 800 (~6.2 seconds), and 79.3% for LEEG = 150 (~1.2 seconds). By
reducing the number of features and segment lengths, the computational cost of
classification can be reduced. Lower-performance smart ML sensors can be used
in IoT environments for enhances human resilience to PD.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive disease preceded by Mild Cognitive
Impairment (MCI). Early detection of AD is crucial for making treatment
decisions. However, most of the literature on computer-assisted detection of AD
focuses on classifying brain images into one of three major categories:
healthy, MCI, and AD; or categorizing MCI patients into (1) progressive: those
who progress from MCI to AD at a future examination time, and (2) stable: those
who stay as MCI and never progress to AD. This misses the opportunity to
accurately identify the trajectory of progressive MCI patients. In this paper,
we revisit the brain image classification task for AD identification and
re-frame it as an ordinal classification task to predict how close a patient is
to the severe AD stage. To this end, we select progressive MCI patients from
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset and construct an
ordinal dataset with a prediction target that indicates the time to progression
to AD. We train a Siamese network model to predict the time to onset of AD
based on MRI brain images. We also propose a Weighted variety of Siamese
network and compare its performance to a baseline model. Our evaluations show
that incorporating a weighting factor to Siamese networks brings considerable
performance gain at predicting how close input brain MRI images are to
progressing to AD. Moreover, we complement our results with an interpretation
of the learned embedding space of the Siamese networks using a model
explainability technique.]]></summary>

punishments as central to explaining goal-directed behavior. However, over a
life, organisms will need to learn about many different aspects of the world's
structure: the states of the world and state-vector transition dynamics. The
number of combinations of states grows exponentially as an agent incorporates
new knowledge, and there is no obvious weighted combination of pre-existing
rewards or costs defined for a given combination of states, as such a weighting
would need to encode information about good and bad combinations prior to an
agent's experience in the world. Therefore, we must develop more naturalistic
accounts of behavior and motivation in large state-spaces. We show that it is
possible to use only the intrinsic motivation metric of empowerment, which
measures the agent's capacity to realize many possible futures under a
transition operator. We propose to scale empowerment to hierarchical
state-spaces by using Operator Bellman Equations. These equations produce
state-time feasibility functions, which are compositional hierarchical
state-time transition operators that map an initial state and time when an
agent begins a policy to the final states and times of completing a goal.
Because these functions are hierarchical operators we can define hierarchical
empowerment measures on them. An agent can then optimize plans to distant
states and times to maximize its hierarchical empowerment-gain, allowing it to
discover goals that bring about a more favorable coupling of its internal
structure (physiological states) to its external environment (world structure &
spatial state). Life-long agents could therefore be primarily animated by
principles of compositionality and empowerment, exhibiting self-concern for the
growth & maintenance of their own structural integrity without recourse to
reward-maximization.]]></summary>

https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-36363-w (2023)], the authors present a deep
reinforced learning approach to augment combinatorial optimization heuristics.
In particular, they present results for several spin glass ground state
problems, for which instances on non-planar networks are generally NP-hard, in
comparison with several Monte Carlo based methods, such as simulated annealing
(SA) or parallel tempering (PT). Indeed, those results demonstrate that the
reinforced learning improves the results over those obtained with SA or PT, or
at least allows for reduced runtimes for the heuristics before results of
comparable quality have been obtained relative to those other methods. To
facilitate the conclusion that their method is ''superior'', the authors pursue
two basic strategies: (1) A commercial GUROBI solver is called on to procure a
sample of exact ground states as a testbed to compare with, and (2) a
head-to-head comparison between the heuristics is given for a sample of larger
instances where exact ground states are hard to ascertain. Here, we put these
studies into a larger context, showing that the claimed superiority is at best
marginal for smaller samples and becomes essentially irrelevant with respect to
any sensible approximation of true ground states in the larger samples. For
example, this method becomes irrelevant as a means to determine stiffness
exponents $\theta$ in $d>2$, as mentioned by the authors, where the problem is
not only NP-hard but requires the subtraction of two almost equal ground-state
energies and systemic errors in each of $\approx 1\%$ found here are
unacceptable. This larger picture on the method arises from a straightforward
finite-size corrections study over the spin glass ensembles the authors employ,
using data that has been available for decades.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The marketplace system connecting demands and supplies has been explored to
develop unbiased decision-making in valuing properties. Real estate appraisal
serves as one of the high-cost property valuation tasks for financial
institutions since it requires domain experts to appraise the estimation based
on the corresponding knowledge and the judgment of the market. Existing
automated valuation models reducing the subjectivity of domain experts require
a large number of transactions for effective evaluation, which is predominantly
limited to not only the labeling efforts of transactions but also the
generalizability of new developing and rural areas. To learn representations
from unlabeled real estate sets, existing self-supervised learning (SSL) for
tabular data neglects various important features, and fails to incorporate
domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose DoRA, a Domain-based
self-supervised learning framework for low-resource Real estate Appraisal. DoRA
is pre-trained with an intra-sample geographic prediction as the pretext task
based on the metadata of the real estate for equipping the real estate
representations with prior domain knowledge. Furthermore, inter-sample
contrastive learning is employed to generalize the representations to be robust
for limited transactions of downstream tasks. Our benchmark results on three
property types of real-world transactions show that DoRA significantly
outperforms the SSL baselines for tabular data, the graph-based methods, and
the supervised approaches in the few-shot scenarios by at least 7.6% for MAPE,
11.59% for MAE, and 3.34% for HR10%. We expect DoRA to be useful to other
financial practitioners with similar marketplace applications who need general
models for properties that are newly built and have limited records. The source

(ML) based systems raise major evaluation challenges that are amplified by the
large-scale deployment of models in many hardware platforms. Until recently,
most of research works focused on API-based attacks that consider a ML model as
a pure algorithmic abstraction. However, new implementation-based threats have
been revealed, emphasizing the urgency to propose both practical and
simulation-based methods to properly evaluate the robustness of models. A major
concern is parameter-based attacks (such as the Bit-Flip Attack, BFA) that
highlight the lack of robustness of typical deep neural network models when
confronted by accurate and optimal alterations of their internal parameters
stored in memory. Setting in a security testing purpose, this work practically
reports, for the first time, a successful variant of the BFA on a 32-bit
Cortex-M microcontroller using laser fault injection. It is a standard fault
injection means for security evaluation, that enables to inject spatially and
temporally accurate faults. To avoid unrealistic brute-force strategies, we
show how simulations help selecting the most sensitive set of bits from the
parameters taking into account the laser fault model.]]></summary>

global score functions. However, if local variables have direct and indirect
dependence simultaneously, the global optimization on score functions misses
edges between variables with indirect dependent relationship, of which scores
are smaller than those with direct dependent relationship. In this paper, we
present an identifiability condition based on a determined subset of parents to
identify the underlying DAG. By the identifiability condition, we develop a
two-phase algorithm namely optimal-tuning (OT) algorithm to locally amend the
global optimization. In the optimal phase, an optimization problem based on
first-order Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) gives an estimated
skeleton as the initial determined parents subset. In the tuning phase, the
skeleton is locally tuned by deletion, addition and DAG-formalization
strategies using the theoretically proved incremental properties of high-order
HSIC. Numerical experiments for different synthetic datasets and real-world
datasets show that the OT algorithm outperforms existing methods. Especially in
Sigmoid Mix model with the size of the graph being ${\rm\bf d=40}$, the
structure intervention distance (SID) of the OT algorithm is 329.7 smaller than
the one obtained by CAM, which indicates that the graph estimated by the OT
algorithm misses fewer edges compared with CAM.Source code of the OT algorithm
is available at https://github.com/YafeiannWang/optimal-tune-algorithm.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Focus in Explainable AI is shifting from explanations defined in terms of
low-level elements, such as input features, to explanations encoded in terms of
interpretable concepts learned from data. How to reliably acquire such concepts
is, however, still fundamentally unclear. An agreed-upon notion of concept
interpretability is missing, with the result that concepts used by both
post-hoc explainers and concept-based neural networks are acquired through a
variety of mutually incompatible strategies. Critically, most of these neglect
the human side of the problem: a representation is understandable only insofar
as it can be understood by the human at the receiving end. The key challenge in
Human-interpretable Representation Learning (HRL) is how to model and
operationalize this human element. In this work, we propose a mathematical
framework for acquiring interpretable representations suitable for both
post-hoc explainers and concept-based neural networks. Our formalization of HRL
builds on recent advances in causal representation learning and explicitly
models a human stakeholder as an external observer. This allows us to derive a
principled notion of alignment between the machine representation and the
vocabulary of concepts understood by the human. In doing so, we link alignment
and interpretability through a simple and intuitive name transfer game, and
clarify the relationship between alignment and a well-known property of
representations, namely disentanglment. We also show that alignment is linked
to the issue of undesirable correlations among concepts, also known as concept
leakage, and to content-style separation, all through a general
information-theoretic reformulation of these properties. Our conceptualization
aims to bridge the gap between the human and algorithmic sides of
interpretability and establish a stepping stone for new research on
human-interpretable representations.]]></summary>

its flexibility, in that it can predict a warm start for fixed-point algorithms
run for any number of steps, without being limited to the number of steps it

interpretability. Despite the advancements in interpretable machine learning
(IML) methods, they frequently assign importance to features which lack causal
influence on the outcome variable. Selecting causally relevant features among
those identified as relevant by these methods, or even before model training,
would offer a solution. Feature selection methods utilizing information
theoretical quantities have been successful in identifying statistically
relevant features. However, the information theoretical quantities they are
based on do not incorporate causality, rendering them unsuitable for such
scenarios. To address this challenge, this article proposes information
theoretical quantities that incorporate the causal structure of the system,
which can be used to evaluate causal importance of features for some given
outcome variable. Specifically, we introduce causal versions of entropy and
mutual information, termed causal entropy and causal information gain, which
are designed to assess how much control a feature provides over the outcome
variable. These newly defined quantities capture changes in the entropy of a
variable resulting from interventions on other variables. Fundamental results
connecting these quantities to the existence of causal effects are derived. The
use of causal information gain in feature selection is demonstrated,
highlighting its superiority over standard mutual information in revealing
which features provide control over a chosen outcome variable. Our
investigation paves the way for the development of methods with improved

work, by transforming the original EEG channels into a two-dimensional (2D)
spatial topological map, the EEG data is transformed into a three-dimensional
(3D) arrangement containing spatial-temporal information. And then a 3D deep
convolutional neural network (DenseNet-3D) is used to extract temporal and
spatial features of the neural representation for the attended locations. The
results show that the proposed method achieves higher decoding accuracy than
the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method (94.4% compared to XANet's 90.6%) with
1-second decision window for the widely used KULeuven (KUL) dataset, and the

robustness and spatial robustness, plays an integral part in achieving robust
generalization. In this paper, we endeavor to design strategies to achieve
universal adversarial robustness. To achieve this, we first investigate the
relatively less-explored realm of spatial robustness. Then, we integrate the
existing spatial robustness methods by incorporating both local and global
spatial vulnerability into a unified spatial attack and adversarial training
approach. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive relationship between natural
accuracy, sensitivity-based robustness, and spatial robustness, supported by
strong evidence from the perspective of robust representation. Crucially, to
reconcile the interplay between the mutual impacts of various robustness
components into one unified framework, we incorporate the \textit{Pareto
criterion} into the adversarial robustness analysis, yielding a novel strategy
called Pareto Adversarial Training for achieving universal robustness. The
resulting Pareto front, which delineates the set of optimal solutions, provides
an optimal balance between natural accuracy and various adversarial robustness.
This sheds light on solutions for achieving universal robustness in the future.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to consider universal
adversarial robustness via multi-objective optimization.]]></summary>

goal representation as they offer ways to structure knowledge for efficient and
transferable learning. However, the existing Hierarchical Reinforcement
Learning (HRL) approaches relying on symbolic reasoning are often limited as
they require a manual goal representation. The challenge in autonomously
discovering a symbolic goal representation is that it must preserve critical
information, such as the environment dynamics. In this paper, we propose a
developmental mechanism for goal discovery via an emergent representation that
abstracts (i.e., groups together) sets of environment states that have similar
roles in the task. We introduce a Feudal HRL algorithm that concurrently learns
both the goal representation and a hierarchical policy. The algorithm uses
symbolic reachability analysis for neural networks to approximate the
transition relation among sets of states and to refine the goal representation.
We evaluate our approach on complex navigation tasks, showing the learned

applications due to the high cost of data labeling. To this end,
semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) on graphs aims to leverage the
knowledge of a labeled source graph to aid in node classification on a target
graph with limited labels. SSDA tasks need to overcome the domain gap between
the source and target graphs. However, to date, this challenging research
problem has yet to be formally considered by the existing approaches designed
for cross-graph node classification. To tackle the SSDA problem on graphs, a
novel method called SemiGCL is proposed, which benefits from graph contrastive
learning and minimax entropy training. SemiGCL generates informative node
representations by contrasting the representations learned from a graph's local
and global views. Additionally, SemiGCL is adversarially optimized with the
entropy loss of unlabeled target nodes to reduce domain divergence.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemiGCL outperforms
the state-of-the-art baselines on the SSDA tasks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We introduce beta diffusion, a novel generative modeling method that
integrates demasking and denoising to generate data within bounded ranges.
Using scaled and shifted beta distributions, beta diffusion utilizes
multiplicative transitions over time to create both forward and reverse
diffusion processes, maintaining beta distributions in both the forward
marginals and the reverse conditionals, given the data at any point in time.
Unlike traditional diffusion-based generative models relying on additive
Gaussian noise and reweighted evidence lower bounds (ELBOs), beta diffusion is
multiplicative and optimized with KL-divergence upper bounds (KLUBs) derived
from the convexity of the KL divergence. We demonstrate that the proposed KLUBs
are more effective for optimizing beta diffusion compared to negative ELBOs,
which can also be derived as the KLUBs of the same KL divergence with its two
arguments swapped. The loss function of beta diffusion, expressed in terms of
Bregman divergence, further supports the efficacy of KLUBs for optimization.
Experimental results on both synthetic data and natural images demonstrate the
unique capabilities of beta diffusion in generative modeling of range-bounded
data and validate the effectiveness of KLUBs in optimizing diffusion models,
thereby making them valuable additions to the family of diffusion-based
generative models and the optimization techniques used to train them.]]></summary>

events that put physical fitness and endurance of riders to the test. The
coaches of Team Jumbo-Visma have long been responsible for predicting the
energy needs of each rider of the Dutch team for every race on the calendar.
Those must be estimated to ensure riders have the energy and resources
necessary to maintain a high level of performance throughout a race. This task,
however, is both time-consuming and challenging, as it requires precise
estimates of race speed and power output. Traditionally, the approach to
predicting energy needs has relied on judgement and experience of coaches, but
this method has its limitations and often leads to inaccurate predictions. In
this paper, we propose a new, more effective approach to predicting energy
needs for cycling races. By predicting the speed and power with regression
models, we provide the coaches with calorie needs estimates for each individual
rider per stage instantly. In addition, we compare methods to quantify
uncertainty using conformal prediction. The empirical analysis of the
jackknife+, jackknife-minmax, jackknife-minmax-after-bootstrap, CV+, CV-minmax,
conformalized quantile regression, and inductive conformal prediction methods
in conformal prediction reveals that all methods achieve valid prediction
intervals. All but minmax-based methods also produce sufficiently narrow
prediction intervals for decision-making. Furthermore, methods computing
prediction intervals of fixed size produce tighter intervals for low
significance values. Among the methods computing intervals of varying length
across the input space, inductive conformal prediction computes narrower
prediction intervals at larger significance level.]]></summary>

On the one hand, the first considers adapting multiple heterogeneous labeled

attacks the problem of synthesizing a small summary containing all the
information about the datasets. We thus consider a new problem called MSDA-DD.
To solve it, we adapt previous works in the MSDA literature, such as
Wasserstein Barycenter Transport and Dataset Dictionary Learning, as well as DD

on four benchmarks (Caltech-Office 10, Tennessee-Eastman Process, Continuous

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Purpose: Common to most MRSI techniques, the spatial resolution and the
minimal scan duration of Deuterium Metabolic Imaging (DMI) are limited by the
achievable SNR. This work presents a deep learning method for sensitivity
enhancement of DMI.

Methods: A convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed to estimate the
2H-labeled metabolite concentrations from low SNR and distorted DMI FIDs. The
CNN was trained with synthetic data that represent a range of SNR levels
typically encountered in vivo. The estimation precision was further improved by
fine-tuning the CNN with MRI-based edge-preserving regularization for each DMI
dataset. The proposed processing method, PReserved Edge ConvolutIonal neural
network for Sensitivity Enhanced DMI (PRECISE-DMI), was applied to simulation
studies and in vivo experiments to evaluate the anticipated improvements in SNR
and investigate the potential for inaccuracies.

Results: PRECISE-DMI visually improved the metabolic maps of low SNR
datasets, and quantitatively provided higher precision than the standard
Fourier reconstruction. Processing of DMI data acquired in rat brain tumor
models resulted in more precise determination of 2H-labeled lactate and
glutamate + glutamine levels, at increased spatial resolution (from >8 to 2
$\mu$L) or shortened scan time (from 32 to 4 min) compared to standard
acquisitions. However, rigorous SD-bias analyses showed that overuse of the
edge-preserving regularization can compromise the accuracy of the results.

Conclusion: PRECISE-DMI allows a flexible trade-off between enhancing the
sensitivity of DMI and minimizing the inaccuracies. With typical settings, the
DMI sensitivity can be improved by 3-fold while retaining the capability to
detect local signal variations.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Benign overfitting, the phenomenon where interpolating models generalize well
in the presence of noisy data, was first observed in neural network models
trained with gradient descent. To better understand this empirical observation,
we consider the generalization error of two-layer neural networks trained to
interpolation by gradient descent on the logistic loss following random
initialization. We assume the data comes from well-separated class-conditional
log-concave distributions and allow for a constant fraction of the training
labels to be corrupted by an adversary. We show that in this setting, neural
networks exhibit benign overfitting: they can be driven to zero training error,
perfectly fitting any noisy training labels, and simultaneously achieve minimax
optimal test error. In contrast to previous work on benign overfitting that
require linear or kernel-based predictors, our analysis holds in a setting
where both the model and learning dynamics are fundamentally nonlinear.]]></summary>

genomic studies to identify differentially expressed genes. However, due to
unmeasured confounders, many standard statistical approaches may be
substantially biased. This paper investigates the large-scale hypothesis
testing problem for multivariate generalized linear models in the presence of
confounding effects. Under arbitrary confounding mechanisms, we propose a
unified statistical estimation and inference framework that harnesses
orthogonal structures and integrates linear projections into three key stages.
It first leverages multivariate responses to separate marginal and uncorrelated
confounding effects, recovering the confounding coefficients' column space.
Subsequently, latent factors and primary effects are jointly estimated,
utilizing $\ell_1$-regularization for sparsity while imposing orthogonality
onto confounding coefficients. Finally, we incorporate projected and weighted
bias-correction steps for hypothesis testing. Theoretically, we establish
various effects' identification conditions and non-asymptotic error bounds. We
show effective Type-I error control of asymptotic $z$-tests as sample and
response sizes approach infinity. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method controls the false discovery rate by the Benjamini-Hochberg
procedure and is more powerful than alternative methods. By comparing
single-cell RNA-seq counts from two groups of samples, we demonstrate the
suitability of adjusting confounding effects when significant covariates are
absent from the model.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Auditory Attention Detection (AAD) aims to detect target speaker from brain
signals in a multi-speaker environment. Although EEG-based AAD methods have
shown promising results in recent years, current approaches primarily rely on
traditional convolutional neural network designed for processing Euclidean data
like images. This makes it challenging to handle EEG signals, which possess
non-Euclidean characteristics. In order to address this problem, this paper
proposes a dynamical graph self-distillation (DGSD) approach for AAD, which
does not require speech stimuli as input. Specifically, to effectively
represent the non-Euclidean properties of EEG signals, dynamical graph
convolutional networks are applied to represent the graph structure of EEG
signals, which can also extract crucial features related to auditory spatial
attention in EEG signals. In addition, to further improve AAD detection
performance, self-distillation, consisting of feature distillation and
hierarchical distillation strategies at each layer, is integrated. These
strategies leverage features and classification results from the deepest
network layers to guide the learning of shallow layers. Our experiments are
conducted on two publicly available datasets, KUL and DTU. Under a 1-second
time window, we achieve results of 90.0\% and 79.6\% accuracy on KUL and DTU,
respectively. We compare our DGSD method with competitive baselines, and the
experimental results indicate that the detection performance of our proposed
DGSD method is not only superior to the best reproducible baseline but also
significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters by approximately 100
times.]]></summary>

(EEG)-based cognitive workload (CWL) estimation. The focus of the article is
twofold: identify the disparate experimental paradigms used for reliably
eliciting discreet and quantifiable levels of cognitive load and the specific
nature and representational structure of the commonly used input formulations
in deep neural networks (DNNs) used for signal classification. The analysis
revealed a number of studies using EEG signals in its native representation of
a two-dimensional matrix for offline classification of CWL. However, only a few
studies adopted an online or pseudo-online classification strategy for
real-time CWL estimation. Further, only a couple of interpretable DNNs and a
single generative model were employed for cognitive load detection till date
during this review. More often than not, researchers were using DNNs as
black-box type models. In conclusion, DNNs prove to be valuable tools for
classifying EEG signals, primarily due to the substantial modeling power
provided by the depth of their network architecture. It is further suggested
that interpretable and explainable DNN models must be employed for cognitive
workload estimation since existing methods are limited in the face of the
non-stationary nature of the signal.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pushing the boundaries of machine learning often requires exploring different
hardware and software combinations. However, the freedom to experiment across
different tooling stacks can be at odds with the drive for efficiency, which
has produced increasingly specialized AI hardware and incentivized
consolidation around a narrow set of ML frameworks. Exploratory research can be
restricted if software and hardware are co-evolving, making it even harder to
stray away from mainstream ideas that work well with popular tooling stacks.
While this friction increasingly impacts the rate of innovation in machine
learning, to our knowledge the lack of portability in tooling has not been
quantified. In this work, we ask: How portable are popular ML software
frameworks? We conduct a large-scale study of the portability of mainstream ML
frameworks across different hardware types. Our findings paint an uncomfortable
picture -- frameworks can lose more than 40% of their key functions when ported
to other hardware. Worse, even when functions are portable, the slowdown in
their performance can be extreme and render performance untenable.
Collectively, our results reveal how costly straying from a narrow set of
hardware-software combinations can be - and suggest that specialization of
hardware impedes innovation in machine learning research.]]></summary>

outperforming traditional statistical techniques. However, to establish ML as a
reliable tool in clinical practice, adherence to best practices regarding data
handling, experimental design, and model evaluation is crucial. This work
summarizes and strictly observes such practices to ensure reproducible and
reliable ML. Specifically, we focus on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection,
which serves as a paradigmatic example of challenging problem in healthcare. We
investigate the impact of different data augmentation techniques and model
complexity on the overall performance. We consider MRI data from ADNI dataset
to address a classification problem employing 3D Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). The experiments are designed to compensate for data scarcity and initial
random parameters by utilizing cross-validation and multiple training trials.
Within this framework, we train 15 predictive models, considering three
different data augmentation strategies and five distinct 3D CNN architectures,
each varying in the number of convolutional layers. Specifically, the
augmentation strategies are based on affine transformations, such as zoom,
shift, and rotation, applied concurrently or separately. The combined effect of
data augmentation and model complexity leads to a variation in prediction
performance up to 10% of accuracy. When affine transformation are applied
separately, the model is more accurate, independently from the adopted
architecture. For all strategies, the model accuracy followed a concave
behavior at increasing number of convolutional layers, peaking at an
intermediate value of layers. The best model (8 CL, (B)) is the most stable
across cross-validation folds and training trials, reaching excellent
performance both on the testing set and on an external test set.]]></summary>

complex monotonic-increasing shapes that change the distribution of the data so
that the linear transformation that follows is more effective. Because a D-PBN
operates by "backing up", the TCAs are inverted in the reconstruction process,
restoring the original distribution of the data, thus taking advantage of a
given TCA in both analysis and reconstruction. In this paper, we show that a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Variable importance assessment has become a crucial step in machine-learning
applications when using complex learners, such as deep neural networks, on
large-scale data. Removal-based importance assessment is currently the
reference approach, particularly when statistical guarantees are sought to
justify variable inclusion. It is often implemented with variable permutation
schemes. On the flip side, these approaches risk misidentifying unimportant
variables as important in the presence of correlations among covariates. Here
we develop a systematic approach for studying Conditional Permutation
Importance (CPI) that is model agnostic and computationally lean, as well as
reusable benchmarks of state-of-the-art variable importance estimators. We show
theoretically and empirically that $\textit{CPI}$ overcomes the limitations of
standard permutation importance by providing accurate type-I error control.
When used with a deep neural network, $\textit{CPI}$ consistently showed top
accuracy across benchmarks. An empirical benchmark on real-world data analysis
in a large-scale medical dataset showed that $\textit{CPI}$ provides a more
parsimonious selection of statistically significant variables. Our results
suggest that $\textit{CPI}$ can be readily used as drop-in replacement for

medicine and decision support systems through the analysis of whole slide
images. It has the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of
cancer. However, a major challenge to this objective is that for many specific
computational pathology tasks the amount of data is inadequate for development.
To address this challenge, we created Virchow, a 632 million parameter deep
neural network foundation model for computational pathology. Using
self-supervised learning, Virchow is trained on 1.5 million hematoxylin and
eosin stained whole slide images from diverse tissue groups, which is orders of
magnitude more data than previous works. When evaluated on downstream tasks
including tile-level pan-cancer detection and subtyping and slide-level
biomarker prediction, Virchow outperforms state-of-the-art systems both on
internal datasets drawn from the same population as the pretraining data as
well as external public datasets. Virchow achieves 93% balanced accuracy for
pancancer tile classification, and AUCs of 0.983 for colon microsatellite
instability status prediction and 0.967 for breast CDH1 status prediction. The
gains in performance highlight the importance of pretraining on massive
pathology image datasets, suggesting pretraining on even larger datasets could
continue improving performance for many high-impact applications where limited

potential in zero-shot transferability to downstream tasks. However, to attain
optimal performance, the manual selection of prompts is necessary to improve
alignment between the downstream image distribution and the textual class
descriptions. This manual prompt engineering is the major challenge for
deploying such models in practice since it requires domain expertise and is
extremely time-consuming. To avoid non-trivial prompt engineering, recent work
Context Optimization (CoOp) introduced the concept of prompt learning to the
vision domain using learnable textual tokens. While CoOp can achieve
substantial improvements over manual prompts, its learned context is worse
generalizable to wider unseen classes within the same dataset. In this work, we
present Prompt Learning with Reparameterization Encoder (PRE) - a simple and
efficient method that enhances the generalization ability of the learnable
prompt to unseen classes while maintaining the capacity to learn Base classes.
Instead of directly optimizing the prompts, PRE employs a prompt encoder to
reparameterize the input prompt embeddings, enhancing the exploration of
task-specific knowledge from few-shot samples. Experiments and extensive
ablation studies on 8 benchmarks demonstrate that our approach is an efficient
method for prompt learning. Specifically, PRE achieves a notable enhancement of
5.60% in average accuracy on New classes and 3% in Harmonic mean compared to
CoOp in the 16-shot setting, all achieved within a good training time.]]></summary>

Transformer-level performance in natural language modeling and long-range
modeling while offering rapid parallel training and constant inference costs.
With the resurged interest in LRNNs, we study whether they can learn the hidden
rules in training sequences, such as the grammatical structures of regular
language. We theoretically analyze some existing LRNNs and discover their
limitations on regular language. Motivated by the analysis, we propose a new
LRNN equipped with a block-diagonal and input-dependent transition matrix.

Learning (SSL) methods for time series analysis have demonstrated their
effectiveness in encoding the inherent static characteristics of temporal data.

diseases within a confined subject cohort. Introducing Distilled Encoding
Beyond Similarities (DEBS), this paper pioneers an SSL approach that transcends
mere similarities by integrating dissimilarities among positive pairs. The
framework is applied to electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, leading to a notable
enhancement of +10\% in the detection accuracy of Atrial Fibrillation (AFib)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The main premise of federated learning (FL) is that machine learning model
updates are computed locally to preserve user data privacy. This approach
avoids by design user data to ever leave the perimeter of their device. Once
the updates aggregated, the model is broadcast to all nodes in the federation.
However, without proper defenses, compromised nodes can probe the model inside
their local memory in search for adversarial examples, which can lead to
dangerous real-world scenarios. For instance, in image-based applications,
adversarial examples consist of images slightly perturbed to the human eye
getting misclassified by the local model. These adversarial images are then
later presented to a victim node's counterpart model to replay the attack.
Typical examples harness dissemination strategies such as altered traffic signs
(patch attacks) no longer recognized by autonomous vehicles or seemingly
unaltered samples that poison the local dataset of the FL scheme to undermine
its robustness. Pelta is a novel shielding mechanism leveraging Trusted
Execution Environments (TEEs) that reduce the ability of attackers to craft
adversarial samples. Pelta masks inside the TEE the first part of the
back-propagation chain rule, typically exploited by attackers to craft the
malicious samples. We evaluate Pelta on state-of-the-art accurate models using
three well-established datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet. We show the
effectiveness of Pelta in mitigating six white-box state-of-the-art adversarial
attacks, such as Projected Gradient Descent, Momentum Iterative Method, Auto
Projected Gradient Descent, the Carlini & Wagner attack. In particular, Pelta
constitutes the first attempt at defending an ensemble model against the
Self-Attention Gradient attack to the best of our knowledge. Our code is

them to a new family of weighted adjacency matrices. We prove that when a

corresponding CSOs converge to that of the limit complexon. These results hint
at learning transferability on large simplicial complexes or simplicial complex

multiple machine learning models able to classify different health conditions.
Our method combines Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and spectral analysis to

cardiovascular and respiratory patterns, making our approach apart in its
departure from conventional audio feature extraction practices. We use Power
Spectral Density analysis and filtering techniques to select Intrinsic Mode
Functions (IMFs) strongly correlated with underlying physiological phenomena.
These biosignals undergo a comprehensive feature extraction process for
predictive modeling. Initially, we deploy a binary classification model that
demonstrates a balanced accuracy of 87% in distinguishing between healthy and
diseased individuals. Subsequently, we employ a six-class classification model
that achieves a balanced accuracy of 72% in diagnosing specific respiratory
conditions like pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). For
the first time, we also introduce regression models that estimate age and body

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unsupervised contrastive learning methods have recently seen significant
improvements, particularly through data augmentation strategies that aim to
produce robust and generalizable representations. However, prevailing data
augmentation methods, whether hand designed or based on foundation models, tend
to rely heavily on prior knowledge or external data. This dependence often
compromises their effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the applicability
of most existing data augmentation strategies is limited when transitioning to
other research domains, especially science-related data. This limitation stems
from the paucity of prior knowledge and labeled data available in these
domains. To address these challenges, we introduce DiffAug-a novel and
efficient Diffusion-based data Augmentation technique. DiffAug aims to ensure
that the augmented and original data share a smoothed latent space, which is
achieved through diffusion steps. Uniquely, unlike traditional methods, DiffAug
first mines sufficient prior semantic knowledge about the neighborhood. This
provides a constraint to guide the diffusion steps, eliminating the need for
labels, external data/models, or prior knowledge. Designed as an
architecture-agnostic framework, DiffAug provides consistent improvements.
Specifically, it improves image classification and clustering accuracy by
1.6%~4.5%. When applied to biological data, DiffAug improves performance by up
to 10.1%, with an average improvement of 5.8%. DiffAug shows good performance

grid operation. In this work, we propose a practical yet robust detection
approach that utilizes only readily available voltage magnitudes, eliminating

many existing detection methods based on change-point detection require prior
knowledge of outage patterns, which are unknown for real-world outage
scenarios. To remove this impractical requirement, we propose a data-driven
method to learn the parameters of the post-outage distribution through gradient
descent. However, directly using gradient descent presents feasibility issues.
To address this, we modify our approach by adding a Bregman divergence
constraint to control the trajectory of the parameter updates, which eliminates
the feasibility problems. As timely operation is the key nowadays, we prove
that the optimal parameters can be learned with convergence guarantees via
leveraging the statistical and physical properties of voltage data. We evaluate
our approach using many representative distribution grids and real load
profiles with 17 outage configurations. The results show that we can detect and
localize the outage in a timely manner with only voltage magnitudes and without

synergistically combines domain-aware and interpretable models with agnostic
machine learning techniques. In this work, we introduce GOKU-UI, an evolution

model's spectrum to incorporate other classes of differential equations, such
as Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), but also integrates attention
mechanisms and a novel multiple shooting training strategy in the latent space.
These modifications have led to a significant increase in its performance in
both reconstruction and forecast tasks, as demonstrated by our evaluation of
simulated and empirical data. Specifically, GOKU-UI outperformed all baseline
models on synthetic datasets even with a training set 16-fold smaller,
underscoring its remarkable data efficiency. Furthermore, when applied to
empirical human brain data, while incorporating stochastic Stuart-Landau
oscillators into its dynamical core, our proposed enhancements markedly
increased the model's effectiveness in capturing complex brain dynamics. This
augmented version not only surpassed all baseline methods in the reconstruction
task, but also demonstrated lower prediction error of future brain activity up
to 15 seconds ahead. By training GOKU-UI on resting state fMRI data, we encoded
whole-brain dynamics into a latent representation, learning a low-dimensional
dynamical system model that could offer insights into brain functionality and
open avenues for practical applications such as the classification of mental

behaviors, which are more suitable to be described by stochastic differential
equations under non-Gaussian L\'evy noise. Among these complex phenomena, the
most likely transition paths between metastable states are important since
these rare events may have a high impact in certain scenarios. Based on the
large deviation principle, the most likely transition path could be treated as
the minimizer of the rate function upon paths that connect two points. One of
the challenges to calculate the most likely transition path for stochastic
dynamical systems under non-Gaussian L\'evy noise is that the associated rate
function can not be explicitly expressed by paths. For this reason, we
formulate an optimal control problem to obtain the optimal state as the most
likely transition path. We then develop a neural network method to solve this
issue. Several experiments are investigated for both Gaussian and non-Gaussian
cases.]]></summary>

thriving research domain, particularly in the context of brain-computer
interfaces. Our study presents an innovative method that employs to classify
and reconstruct images from the ImageNet dataset using electroencephalography
(EEG) data from subjects that had viewed the images themselves (i.e. "brain
decoding"). We analyzed EEG recordings from 6 participants, each exposed to 50
images spanning 40 unique semantic categories. These EEG readings were
converted into spectrograms, which were then used to train a convolutional
neural network (CNN), integrated with a knowledge distillation procedure based
on a pre-trained Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP)-based image
classification teacher network. This strategy allowed our model to attain a
top-5 accuracy of 80%, significantly outperforming a standard CNN and various
RNN-based benchmarks. Additionally, we incorporated an image reconstruction
mechanism based on pre-trained latent diffusion models, which allowed us to
generate an estimate of the images which had elicited EEG activity. Therefore,
our architecture not only decodes images from neural activity but also offers a
credible image reconstruction from EEG only, paving the way for e.g. swift,
individualized feedback experiments. Our research represents a significant step
forward in connecting neural signals with visual cognition.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quantile Regression (QR) can be used to estimate aleatoric uncertainty in
deep neural networks and can generate prediction intervals. Quantifying
uncertainty is particularly important in critical applications such as clinical
diagnosis, where a realistic assessment of uncertainty is essential in
determining disease status and planning the appropriate treatment. The most
common application of quantile regression models is in cases where the
parametric likelihood cannot be specified. Although quantile regression is
quite robust to outlier response observations, it can be sensitive to outlier
covariate observations (features). Outlier features can compromise the
performance of deep learning regression problems such as style translation,
image reconstruction, and deep anomaly detection, potentially leading to
misleading conclusions. To address this problem, we propose a robust solution
for quantile regression that incorporates concepts from robust divergence. We
compare the performance of our proposed method with (i) least trimmed quantile
regression and (ii) robust regression based on the regularization of
case-specific parameters in a simple real dataset in the presence of outlier.
These methods have not been applied in a deep learning framework. We also
demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method by applying it to a
medical imaging translation task using diffusion models.]]></summary>

high-dimensional data in one domain, e.g., genetic data, to high dimensional
data in a second domain, e.g., brain imaging data. The standard approach in the
area are mass univariate analyses across genetic factors and imaging
phenotypes. That entails executing one genome-wide association study (GWAS) for
each pre-defined imaging measure. Although this approach has been tremendously
successful, one shortcoming is that phenotypes must be pre-defined.
Consequently, effects that are not confined to pre-selected regions of interest
or that reflect larger brain-wide patterns can easily be missed. In this work
we introduce a Partial Least Squares (PLS)-based framework, which we term
Cluster-Bootstrap PLS (CLUB-PLS), that can work with large input dimensions in
both domains as well as with large sample sizes. One key factor of the
framework is to use cluster bootstrap to provide robust statistics for single
input features in both domains. We applied CLUB-PLS to investigating the
genetic basis of surface area and cortical thickness in a sample of 33,000
subjects from the UK Biobank. We found 107 genome-wide significant
locus-phenotype pairs that are linked to 386 different genes. We found that a
vast majority of these loci could be technically validated at a high rate:
using classic GWAS or Genome-Wide Inferred Statistics (GWIS) we found that 85
locus-phenotype pairs exceeded the genome-wide suggestive (P<1e-05) threshold.]]></summary>

Models others propose are often time-consuming and lack sufficient accuracy,

global score functions. However, if local variables have direct and indirect
dependence simultaneously, the global optimization on score functions misses
edges between variables with indirect dependent relationship, of which scores
are smaller than those with direct dependent relationship. In this paper, we
present an identifiability condition based on a determined subset of parents to
identify the underlying DAG. By the identifiability condition, we develop a
two-phase algorithm namely optimal-tuning (OT) algorithm to locally amend the
global optimization. In the optimal phase, an optimization problem based on
first-order Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) gives an estimated
skeleton as the initial determined parents subset. In the tuning phase, the
skeleton is locally tuned by deletion, addition and DAG-formalization
strategies using the theoretically proved incremental properties of high-order
HSIC. Numerical experiments for different synthetic datasets and real-world
datasets show that the OT algorithm outperforms existing methods. Especially in
Sigmoid Mix model with the size of the graph being ${\rm\bf d=40}$, the
structure intervention distance (SID) of the OT algorithm is 329.7 smaller than
the one obtained by CAM, which indicates that the graph estimated by the OT

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sleep, a fundamental physiological process, occupies a significant portion of
our lives. Accurate classification of sleep stages serves as a crucial tool for
evaluating sleep quality and identifying probable sleep disorders. This work
introduces a novel methodology that utilises a SE-Resnet-Bi-LSTM architecture
to classify sleep into five separate stages. The classification process is
based on the analysis of single-channel electroencephalograms (EEGs). The
framework that has been suggested consists of two fundamental elements: a
feature extractor that utilises SE-ResNet, and a temporal context encoder that
use stacks of Bi-LSTM units.The effectiveness of our approach is substantiated
by thorough assessments conducted on three different datasets, namely
SLeepEDF-20, SleepEDF-78, and SHHS. Significantly, our methodology attains
notable levels of accuracy, specifically 87.5\%, 83.9\%, and 87.8\%, along with
macro-F1 scores of 82.5, 78.9, and 81.9 for the corresponding datasets.
Notably, we introduce the utilization of 1D-GradCAM visualization to shed light
on the decision-making process of our model in the realm of sleep stage
classification. This visualization method not only provides valuable insights
into the model's classification rationale but also aligns its outcomes with the
annotations made by sleep experts. One notable feature of our research is the
integration of an expedited training approach, which effectively preserves the
model's resilience in terms of performance. The experimental evaluations
conducted provide a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of our
proposed model in comparison to existing approaches, highlighting its potential
for practical applications.]]></summary>

acoustic units. This framework employs text in different source languages as
input to generate speech in the target language without the need for text

previous works for direct speech to speech translation systems, we use the same
pipeline to extract the acoustic units using a speech encoder combined with a
clustering algorithm. Once units are obtained, an encoder-decoder architecture
is trained to predict them. Then a vocoder generates speech from units. Our
approach for direct text to speech translation was tested on the new CVSS
corpus with two different text mBART models employed as initialisation. The
systems presented report competitive performance for most of the language pairs
evaluated. Besides, results show a remarkable improvement when initialising our
proposed architecture with a model pre-trained with more languages.]]></summary>

requires skilled content creators. There have been impressive improvements in
using machine learning to address different aspects of generating 3D content,
such as generating meshes, arranging geometry, synthesizing textures, etc. In
this paper we develop a model to generate Bidirectional Reflectance
Distribution Functions (BRDFs) from descriptive textual prompts. BRDFs are four
dimensional probability distributions that characterize the interaction of
light with surface materials. They are either represented parametrically, or by
tabulating the probability density associated with every pair of incident and
outgoing angles. The former lends itself to artistic editing while the latter
is used when measuring the appearance of real materials. Numerous works have
focused on hypothesizing BRDF models from images of materials. We learn a
mapping from textual descriptions of materials to parametric BRDFs. Our model
is first trained using a semi-supervised approach before being tuned via an
unsupervised scheme. Although our model is general, in this paper we
specifically generate parameters for MDL materials, conditioned on natural
language descriptions, within NVIDIA's Omniverse platform. This enables use
cases such as real-time text prompts to change materials of objects in 3D
environments such as "dull plastic" or "shiny iron". Since the output of our
model is a parametric BRDF, rather than an image of the material, it may be
used to render materials using any shape under arbitrarily specified viewing
and lighting conditions.]]></summary>

prevails to deliver high-performance task-specific models and can even learn
general task-agnostic representations for efficient finetuning to downstream
tasks. However, deep learning in resource-limited domains still faces multiple
challenges including (i) limited data, (ii) constrained model development cost,
and (iii) lack of adequate pre-trained models for effective finetuning. This
paper provides an overview of model reprogramming to bridge this gap. Model
reprogramming enables resource-efficient cross-domain machine learning by
repurposing and reusing a well-developed pre-trained model from a source domain
to solve tasks in a target domain without model finetuning, where the source
and target domains can be vastly different. In many applications, model
reprogramming outperforms transfer learning and training from scratch. This
paper elucidates the methodology of model reprogramming, summarizes existing
use cases, provides a theoretical explanation of the success of model
reprogramming, and concludes with a discussion on open-ended research questions
and opportunities. A list of model reprogramming studies is actively maintained

research for decades. One widely used methodology for this purpose is sparse
regression for nonlinear dynamics, known as SINDy. Despite several attempts,
noisy and scarce data still pose a severe challenge to the success of the SINDy
approach. In this work, we discuss a robust method to discover nonlinear
governing equations from noisy and scarce data. To do this, we make use of
neural networks to learn an implicit representation based on measurement data
so that not only it produces the output in the vicinity of the measurements but
also the time-evolution of output can be described by a dynamical system.
Additionally, we learn such a dynamic system in the spirit of the SINDy
framework. Leveraging the implicit representation using neural networks, we
obtain the derivative information -- required for SINDy -- using an automatic
differentiation tool. To enhance the robustness of our methodology, we further
incorporate an integral condition on the output of the implicit networks.
Furthermore, we extend our methodology to handle data collected from multiple
initial conditions. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methodology
to discover governing equations under noisy and scarce data regimes by means of
several examples and compare its performance with existing methods.]]></summary>

event-driven neural dynamics whose energy consumption depends on the number of
spikes exchanged between neurons over the course of the input presentation. In
typical implementations of an SNN classifier, decisions are produced after the
entire input sequence has been processed, resulting in latency and energy
consumption levels that are fairly uniform across inputs. Recently introduced
delay-adaptive SNNs tailor the inference latency -- and, with it, the energy
consumption -- to the difficulty of each example, by producing an early
decision when the SNN model is sufficiently ``confident''. In this paper, we
start by observing that, as an SNN processes input samples, its classification
decisions tend to be first under-confident and then over-confident with respect
to the decision's ground-truth, unknown, test accuracy. This makes it difficult
to determine a stopping time that ensures a desired level of accuracy. To
address this problem, we introduce a novel delay-adaptive SNN-based inference
methodology that, wrapping around any pre-trained SNN classifier, provides
guaranteed reliability for the decisions produced at input-dependent stopping
times. The approach entails minimal added complexity as compared to the
underlying SNN, requiring only thresholding and counting operations at run
time, and it leverages tools from conformal prediction (CP).]]></summary>

advancements in allowing Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason through
foresight and backtracking for global decision-making, it has overlooked the

These local uncertainties, intrinsic to LLMs given their potential for diverse
responses, remain a significant concern in the reasoning process. Addressing
this pivotal gap, we introduce the Tree of Uncertain Thoughts (TouT) - a
reasoning framework tailored for LLMs. Our TouT effectively leverages Monte
Carlo Dropout to quantify uncertainty scores associated with LLMs' diverse
local responses at these intermediate steps. By marrying this local uncertainty
quantification with global search algorithms, TouT enhances the model's
precision in response generation. We substantiate our approach with rigorous
experiments on two demanding planning tasks: Game of 24 and Mini Crosswords.

attacks, but are often tailored to one type of model or attack. The lack of
information on unknown potential attacks makes detecting adversarial examples
challenging. Additionally, attackers do not need to follow the rules made by
the defender. To address this problem, we take inspiration from the concept of
Applicability Domain in cheminformatics. Cheminformatics models struggle to
make accurate predictions because only a limited number of compounds are known
and available for training. Applicability Domain defines a domain based on the
known compounds and rejects any unknown compound that falls outside the domain.
Similarly, adversarial examples start as harmless inputs, but can be
manipulated to evade reliable classification by moving outside the domain of
the classifier. We are the first to identify the similarity between
Applicability Domain and adversarial detection. Instead of focusing on unknown
attacks, we focus on what is known, the training data. We propose a simple yet
robust triple-stage data-driven framework that checks the input globally and
locally, and confirms that they are coherent with the model's output. This
framework can be applied to any classification model and is not limited to
specific attacks. We demonstrate these three stages work as one unit,
effectively detecting various attacks, even for a white-box scenario.]]></summary>

setting where distributional shift exists among clients and some have unlabeled
data. The proposed framework, FedDaDiL, tackles the resulting challenge through
dictionary learning of empirical distributions. In our setting, clients'
distributions represent particular domains, and FedDaDiL collectively trains a
federated dictionary of empirical distributions. In particular, we build upon
the Dataset Dictionary Learning framework by designing collaborative
communication protocols and aggregation operations. The chosen protocols keep
clients' data private, thus enhancing overall privacy compared to its
centralized counterpart. We empirically demonstrate that our approach
successfully generates labeled data on the target domain with extensive
experiments on (i) Caltech-Office, (ii) TEP, and (iii) CWRU benchmarks.
Furthermore, we compare our method to its centralized counterpart and other

optimization tasks involving unknown high-dimensional (black-box) functions
that map a set of controllable variables to the outcomes of an expensive
experiment. Bayesian Optimization (BO) techniques are known to be effective in
tackling global optimization problems using a relatively small number objective
function evaluations, but their performance suffers when dealing with
high-dimensional outputs. To overcome the major challenge of dimensionality,
here we propose a deep learning framework for BO and sequential decision making
based on bootstrapped ensembles of neural architectures with randomized priors.
Using appropriate architecture choices, we show that the proposed framework can
approximate functional relationships between design variables and quantities of
interest, even in cases where the latter take values in high-dimensional vector
spaces or even infinite-dimensional function spaces. In the context of BO, we
augmented the proposed probabilistic surrogates with re-parameterized Monte
Carlo approximations of multiple-point (parallel) acquisition functions, as
well as methodological extensions for accommodating black-box constraints and
multi-fidelity information sources. We test the proposed framework against
state-of-the-art methods for BO and demonstrate superior performance across
several challenging tasks with high-dimensional outputs, including a
constrained multi-fidelity optimization task involving shape optimization of

remains a significant challenge, especially when encountering noisy
observations and no prior knowledge available. This study proposes R-DISCOVER,
a framework designed to robustly uncover open-form partial differential
equations (PDEs) from limited and noisy data. The framework operates through
two alternating update processes: discovering and embedding. The discovering
phase employs symbolic representation and a reinforcement learning (RL)-guided
hybrid PDE generator to efficiently produce diverse open-form PDEs with tree
structures. A neural network-based predictive model fits the system response
and serves as the reward evaluator for the generated PDEs. PDEs with superior
fits are utilized to iteratively optimize the generator via the RL method and
the best-performing PDE is selected by a parameter-free stability metric. The
embedding phase integrates the initially identified PDE from the discovering
process as a physical constraint into the predictive model for robust training.
The traversal of PDE trees automates the construction of the computational
graph and the embedding process without human intervention. Numerical
experiments demonstrate our framework's capability to uncover governing
equations from nonlinear dynamic systems with limited and highly noisy data and
outperform other physics-informed neural network-based discovery methods. This
work opens new potential for exploring real-world systems with limited

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance
in various vision-related tasks. The success of ViTs motivates adversaries to
perform backdoor attacks on ViTs. Although the vulnerability of traditional
CNNs to backdoor attacks is well-known, backdoor attacks on ViTs are
seldom-studied. Compared to CNNs capturing pixel-wise local features by
convolutions, ViTs extract global context information through patches and
attentions. Na\"ively transplanting CNN-specific backdoor attacks to ViTs
yields only a low clean data accuracy and a low attack success rate. In this
paper, we propose a stealth and practical ViT-specific backdoor attack
$TrojViT$. Rather than an area-wise trigger used by CNN-specific backdoor
attacks, TrojViT generates a patch-wise trigger designed to build a Trojan
composed of some vulnerable bits on the parameters of a ViT stored in DRAM
memory through patch salience ranking and attention-target loss. TrojViT
further uses minimum-tuned parameter update to reduce the bit number of the
Trojan. Once the attacker inserts the Trojan into the ViT model by flipping the
vulnerable bits, the ViT model still produces normal inference accuracy with
benign inputs. But when the attacker embeds a trigger into an input, the ViT
model is forced to classify the input to a predefined target class. We show
that flipping only few vulnerable bits identified by TrojViT on a ViT model
using the well-known RowHammer can transform the model into a backdoored one.
We perform extensive experiments of multiple datasets on various ViT models.
TrojViT can classify $99.64\%$ of test images to a target class by flipping
$345$ bits on a ViT for ImageNet.Our codes are available at

network control algorithms as one of its core capabilities. Data-driven
applications incorporate such algorithms to optimize radio access network (RAN)
functions via RAN intelligent controllers (RICs). Deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) algorithms are among the main approaches adopted in the O-RAN literature
to solve dynamic radio resource management problems. However, despite the
benefits introduced by the O-RAN RICs, the practical adoption of DRL algorithms
in real network deployments falls behind. This is primarily due to the slow
convergence and unstable performance exhibited by DRL agents upon deployment
and when facing previously unseen network conditions. In this paper, we address
these challenges by proposing transfer learning (TL) as a core component of the
training and deployment workflows for the DRL-based closed-loop control of
O-RAN functionalities. To this end, we propose and design a hybrid TL-aided
approach that leverages the advantages of both policy reuse and distillation TL
methods to provide safe and accelerated convergence in DRL-based O-RAN slicing.
We conduct a thorough experiment that accommodates multiple services, including
real VR gaming traffic to reflect practical scenarios of O-RAN slicing. We also
propose and implement policy reuse and distillation-aided DRL and non-TL-aided
DRL as three separate baselines. The proposed hybrid approach shows at least:
7.7% and 20.7% improvements in the average initial reward value and the
percentage of converged scenarios, and a 64.6% decrease in reward variance
while maintaining fast convergence and enhancing the generalizability compared
with the baselines.]]></summary>

On the one hand, the first considers adapting multiple heterogeneous labeled

attacks the problem of synthesizing a small summary containing all the
information about the datasets. We thus consider a new problem called MSDA-DD.
To solve it, we adapt previous works in the MSDA literature, such as
Wasserstein Barycenter Transport and Dataset Dictionary Learning, as well as DD
method Distribution Matching. We thoroughly experiment with this novel problem
on four benchmarks (Caltech-Office 10, Tennessee-Eastman Process, Continuous

unlike the usual regularization parameters, can induce posterior collapse
regardless of the dataset size. Thus, beta is a risky parameter that requires

mixture without prior knowledge of the sources or the mixing system. This is a
challenging problem that often requires making restrictive assumptions about
both the mixing system and the sources. In this paper, we propose a novel
method for addressing BSS of non-linear mixtures by leveraging the natural
feature subspace specialization ability of multi-encoder autoencoders with
fully self-supervised learning without strong priors. During the training
phase, our method unmixes the input into the separate encoding spaces of the
multi-encoder network and then remixes these representations within the decoder
for a reconstruction of the input. Then to perform source inference, we
introduce a novel encoding masking technique whereby masking out all but one of
the encodings enables the decoder to estimate a source signal. To this end, we
also introduce a so-called pathway separation loss that encourages sparsity
between the unmixed encoding spaces throughout the decoder's layers and a
so-called zero reconstruction loss on the decoder for coherent source
estimations. In order to carefully evaluate our method, we conduct experiments
on a toy dataset and with real-world biosignal recordings from a
polysomnography sleep study for extracting respiration.]]></summary>

beta. As the beta increases, the length of the plateau extends and then becomes
infinite beyond a certain beta threshold. This implies that the choice of beta,
unlike the usual regularization parameters, can induce posterior collapse
regardless of the dataset size. Thus, beta is a risky parameter that requires
careful tuning. Furthermore, considering the dataset-size dependence on the
rate-distortion curve, a relatively large dataset is required to obtain a
rate-distortion curve with high rates. Extensive numerical experiments support
our analysis.]]></summary>

sequential decision-making tasks, showcasing empirical quantum advantages. A
notable development is through quantum recurrent neural networks (QRNNs) for
memory-intensive tasks such as partially observable environments. However, QRL
models incorporating QRNN encounter challenges such as inefficient training of
QRL with QRNN, given that the computation of gradients in QRNN is both
computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work presents a novel
approach to address this challenge by constructing QRL agents utilizing
QRNN-based reservoirs, specifically employing quantum long short-term memory
(QLSTM). QLSTM parameters are randomly initialized and fixed without training.
The model is trained using the asynchronous advantage actor-aritic (A3C)
algorithm. Through numerical simulations, we validate the efficacy of our
QLSTM-Reservoir RL framework. Its performance is assessed on standard
benchmarks, demonstrating comparable results to a fully trained QLSTM RL model
with identical architecture and training settings.]]></summary>

shown to belong to the powerful Hilbertian family of (firmly) nonexpansive

experimental data will speed up the pace of scientific discovery. Previous
randomized algorithms exploit sparsity in PDE updates for acceleration. However
such methods are applicable to a limited class of decomposable PDEs, which have
sparse features in the value domain. We propose Reel, which accelerates the
learning of PDEs via random projection and has much broader applicability. Reel
exploits the sparsity by decomposing dense updates into sparse ones in both the
value and frequency domains. This decomposition enables efficient learning when
the source of the updates consists of gradually changing terms across large
areas (sparse in the frequency domain) in addition to a few rapid updates
concentrated in a small set of "interfacial" regions (sparse in the value
domain). Random projection is then applied to compress the sparse signals for
learning. To expand the model applicability, Taylor series expansion is used in
Reel to approximate the nonlinear PDE updates with polynomials in the
decomposable form. Theoretically, we derive a constant factor approximation
between the projected loss function and the original one with poly-logarithmic
number of projected dimensions. Experimentally, we provide empirical evidence
that our proposed Reel can lead to faster learning of PDE models (70-98%
reduction in training time when the data is compressed to 1% of its original

genomic studies to identify differentially expressed genes. However, due to
unmeasured confounders, many standard statistical approaches may be
substantially biased. This paper investigates the large-scale hypothesis
testing problem for multivariate generalized linear models in the presence of
confounding effects. Under arbitrary confounding mechanisms, we propose a
unified statistical estimation and inference framework that harnesses
orthogonal structures and integrates linear projections into three key stages.
It first leverages multivariate responses to separate marginal and uncorrelated
confounding effects, recovering the confounding coefficients' column space.
Subsequently, latent factors and primary effects are jointly estimated,
utilizing $\ell_1$-regularization for sparsity while imposing orthogonality
onto confounding coefficients. Finally, we incorporate projected and weighted
bias-correction steps for hypothesis testing. Theoretically, we establish
various effects' identification conditions and non-asymptotic error bounds. We
show effective Type-I error control of asymptotic $z$-tests as sample and
response sizes approach infinity. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method controls the false discovery rate by the Benjamini-Hochberg
procedure and is more powerful than alternative methods. By comparing
single-cell RNA-seq counts from two groups of samples, we demonstrate the
suitability of adjusting confounding effects when significant covariates are

multi-label scenario (MLZSL), wherein, the model is trained to recognize
multiple unseen classes within a sample (e.g., an image) based on seen classes
and auxiliary knowledge, e.g., semantic information. Existing methods usually
resort to analyzing the relationship of various seen classes residing in a
sample from the dimension of spatial or semantic characteristics, and transfer
the learned model to unseen ones. But they ignore the effective integration of
local and global features. That is, in the process of inferring unseen classes,
global features represent the principal direction of the image in the feature
space, while local features should maintain uniqueness within a certain range.
This integrated neglect will make the model lose its grasp of the main
components of the image. Relying only on the local existence of seen classes
during the inference stage introduces unavoidable bias. In this paper, we
propose a novel and effective group bi-enhancement framework for MLZSL, dubbed
GBE-MLZSL, to fully make use of such properties and enable a more accurate and
robust visual-semantic projection. Specifically, we split the feature maps into
several feature groups, of which each feature group can be trained
independently with the Local Information Distinguishing Module (LID) to ensure
uniqueness. Meanwhile, a Global Enhancement Module (GEM) is designed to
preserve the principal direction. Besides, a static graph structure is designed
to construct the correlation of local features. Experiments on large-scale
MLZSL benchmark datasets NUS-WIDE and Open-Images-v4 demonstrate that the
proposed GBE-MLZSL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods with large

quantum circuits with SU$(d)$-symmetry, building on and significantly
generalizing Jordan's Permutational Quantum Computing (PQC) formalism based on
Schur-Weyl duality connecting both SU$(d)$ and $S_n$ actions on qudits. In
particular, we utilize the Okounkov-Vershik approach to prove Harrow's
statement (Ph.D. Thesis 2005 p.160) on the equivalence between
$\operatorname{SU}(d)$ and $S_n$ irrep bases and to establish the
$S_n$-equivariant Convolutional Quantum Alternating Ans\"atze ($S_n$-CQA) using
Young-Jucys-Murphy (YJM) elements. We prove that $S_n$-CQA is able to generate
any unitary in any given $S_n$ irrep sector, which may serve as a universal
model for a wide array of quantum machine learning problems with the presence
of SU($d$) symmetry. Our method provides another way to prove the universality
of Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and verifies that 4-local
SU($d$) symmetric unitaries are sufficient to build generic SU($d$) symmetric
quantum circuits up to relative phase factors. We present numerical simulations
to showcase the effectiveness of the ans\"atze to find the ground state energy
of the $J_1$--$J_2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the rectangular and
Kagome lattices. Our work provides the first application of the celebrated
Okounkov-Vershik's $S_n$ representation theory to quantum physics and machine
learning, from which to propose quantum variational ans\"atze that strongly
suggests to be classically intractable tailored towards a specific optimization

executing action sequences for robots to accomplish long-horizon tasks in
physical environments. In this work, we introduce EmbodiedGPT, an end-to-end
multi-modal foundation model for embodied AI, empowering embodied agents with
multi-modal understanding and execution capabilities. To achieve this, we have
made the following efforts: (i) We craft a large-scale embodied planning
dataset, termed EgoCOT. The dataset consists of carefully selected videos from
the Ego4D dataset, along with corresponding high-quality language instructions.
Specifically, we generate a sequence of sub-goals with the "Chain of Thoughts"
mode for effective embodied planning. (ii) We introduce an efficient training
approach to EmbodiedGPT for high-quality plan generation, by adapting a 7B
large language model (LLM) to the EgoCOT dataset via prefix tuning. (iii) We
introduce a paradigm for extracting task-related features from LLM-generated
planning queries to form a closed loop between high-level planning and
low-level control. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of EmbodiedGPT
on embodied tasks, including embodied planning, embodied control, visual
captioning, and visual question answering. Notably, EmbodiedGPT significantly
enhances the success rate of the embodied control task by extracting more
effective features. It has achieved a remarkable 1.6 times increase in success
rate on the Franka Kitchen benchmark and a 1.3 times increase on the Meta-World
benchmark, compared to the BLIP-2 baseline fine-tuned with the Ego4D dataset.]]></summary>

individuals globally, and continuous monitoring coupled with automated seizure
detection appears as a necessity for effective patient treatment. To enable
long-term care in daily-life conditions, comfortable and smart wearable devices
with long battery life are required, which in turn set the demand for
resource-constrained and energy-efficient computing solutions. In this context,
the development of machine learning algorithms for seizure detection faces the
challenge of heavily imbalanced datasets. This paper introduces EpiDeNet, a new
lightweight seizure detection network, and Sensitivity-Specificity Weighted
Cross-Entropy (SSWCE), a new loss function that incorporates sensitivity and
specificity, to address the challenge of heavily unbalanced datasets. The
proposed EpiDeNet-SSWCE approach demonstrates the successful detection of
91.16% and 92.00% seizure events on two different datasets (CHB-MIT and
PEDESITE, respectively), with only four EEG channels. A three-window majority
voting-based smoothing scheme combined with the SSWCE loss achieves 3x
reduction of false positives to 1.18 FP/h. EpiDeNet is well suited for
implementation on low-power embedded platforms, and we evaluate its performance
on two ARM Cortex-based platforms (M4F/M7) and two parallel ultra-low power
(PULP) systems (GAP8, GAP9). The most efficient implementation (GAP9) achieves
an energy efficiency of 40 GMAC/s/W, with an energy consumption per inference
of only 0.051 mJ at high performance (726.46 MMAC/s), outperforming the best
ARM Cortex-based solutions by approximately 160x in energy efficiency. The
EpiDeNet-SSWCE method demonstrates effective and accurate seizure detection
performance on heavily imbalanced datasets, while being suited for
implementation on energy-constrained platforms.]]></summary>

avenues for cybersecurity challenges and underscoring the need for robust
intrusion detection systems. However, traditional security systems are designed
with a closed-world perspective and often face challenges in dealing with the
ever-evolving threat landscape, where new and unfamiliar attacks are constantly
emerging. In this paper, we introduce a framework aimed at mitigating the open
set recognition (OSR) problem in the realm of Network Intrusion Detection
Systems (NIDS) tailored for IoT environments. Our framework capitalizes on
image-based representations of packet-level data, extracting spatial and
temporal patterns from network traffic. Additionally, we integrate stacking and
sub-clustering techniques, enabling the identification of unknown attacks by
effectively modeling the complex and diverse nature of benign behavior. The
empirical results prominently underscore the framework's efficacy, boasting an
impressive 88\% detection rate for previously unseen attacks when compared
against existing approaches and recent advancements. Future work will perform
extensive experimentation across various openness levels and attack scenarios,
further strengthening the adaptability and performance of our proposed solution

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In many randomized experiments, the treatment effect of the long-term metric
(i.e. the primary outcome of interest) is often difficult or infeasible to
measure. Such long-term metrics are often slow to react to changes and
sufficiently noisy they are challenging to faithfully estimate in short-horizon
experiments. A common alternative is to measure several short-term proxy
metrics in the hope they closely track the long-term metric -- so they can be
used to effectively guide decision-making in the near-term. We introduce a new
statistical framework to both define and construct an optimal proxy metric for
use in a homogeneous population of randomized experiments. Our procedure first
reduces the construction of an optimal proxy metric in a given experiment to a
portfolio optimization problem which depends on the true latent treatment
effects and noise level of experiment under consideration. We then denoise the
observed treatment effects of the long-term metric and a set of proxies in a
historical corpus of randomized experiments to extract estimates of the latent
treatment effects for use in the optimization problem. One key insight derived
from our approach is that the optimal proxy metric for a given experiment is
not apriori fixed; rather it should depend on the sample size (or effective
noise level) of the randomized experiment for which it is deployed. To
instantiate and evaluate our framework, we employ our methodology in a large
corpus of randomized experiments from an industrial recommendation system and
construct proxy metrics that perform favorably relative to several baselines.]]></summary>

convolution has been applied in a wide range of fields such as traffic flow
prediction. However, current popular works of graph convolution cannot

would limit predictive accuracy. In this paper, a novel Attention-based Dynamic
Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (ADGCRNN) is proposed to improve
traffic flow prediction in highway transportation. Three temporal resolutions
of data sequence are effectively integrated by self-attention to extract
characteristics; multi-dynamic graphs and their weights are dynamically created
to compliantly combine the varying characteristics; a dedicated gated kernel
emphasizing highly relative nodes is introduced on these complete graphs to
reduce overfitting for graph convolution operations. Experiments on two public

of a real Web system prove practical benefit in highway transportation.]]></summary>

evaluated in a series of minigames, in which subjects were required to use
eight gestures to manipulate their game avatar to complete a task. Experimental
results indicated that, relative to baseline, the modified feedback condition

take treatment, so that optimal policy rules are merely suggestions in the
presence of human non-adherence to treatment recommendations. In these same
domains, there may be heterogeneity both in who responds in taking-up
treatment, and heterogeneity in treatment efficacy. While optimal treatment
rules can maximize causal outcomes across the population, access parity
constraints or other fairness considerations can be relevant in the case of
encouragement. For example, in social services, a persistent puzzle is the gap
in take-up of beneficial services among those who may benefit from them the
most. When in addition the decision-maker has distributional preferences over
both access and average outcomes, the optimal decision rule changes. We study
causal identification, statistical variance-reduced estimation, and robust
estimation of optimal treatment rules, including under potential violations of
positivity. We consider fairness constraints such as demographic parity in
treatment take-up, and other constraints, via constrained optimization. Our
framework can be extended to handle algorithmic recommendations under an
often-reasonable covariate-conditional exclusion restriction, using our
robustness checks for lack of positivity in the recommendation. We develop a
two-stage algorithm for solving over parametrized policy classes under general
constraints to obtain variance-sensitive regret bounds. We illustrate the
methods in two case studies based on data from randomized encouragement to

approach is a challenging problem for many data-driven applications. Existing
state-of-the-art methods for unsupervised clustering use different similarity
and distance functions but focus on either spatial or temporal features of the
data. Concentrating on joint deep representation learning of spatial and
temporal features, we propose Deep Spatiotemporal Clustering (DSC), a novel
algorithm for the temporal clustering of high-dimensional spatiotemporal data
using an unsupervised deep learning method. Inspired by the U-net architecture,
DSC utilizes an autoencoder integrating CNN-RNN layers to learn latent
representations of the spatiotemporal data. DSC also includes a unique layer
for cluster assignment on latent representations that uses the Student's
t-distribution. By optimizing the clustering loss and data reconstruction loss
simultaneously, the algorithm gradually improves clustering assignments and the
nonlinear mapping between low-dimensional latent feature space and
high-dimensional original data space. A multivariate spatiotemporal climate
dataset is used to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method. Our extensive
experiments show our approach outperforms both conventional and deep
learning-based unsupervised clustering algorithms. Additionally, we compared
the proposed model with its various variants (CNN encoder, CNN autoencoder,
CNN-RNN encoder, CNN-RNN autoencoder, etc.) to get insight into using both the
CNN and RNN layers in the autoencoder, and our proposed technique outperforms
these variants in terms of clustering results.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In deep learning, the load data with non-temporal factors are difficult to
process by sequence models. This problem results in insufficient precision of
the prediction. Therefore, a short-term load forecasting method based on
convolutional neural network (CNN), self-attention encoder-decoder network
(SAEDN) and residual-refinement (Res) is proposed. In this method, feature
extraction module is composed of a two-dimensional convolutional neural
network, which is used to mine the local correlation between data and obtain
high-dimensional data features. The initial load fore-casting module consists
of a self-attention encoder-decoder network and a feedforward neural network
(FFN). The module utilizes self-attention mechanisms to encode high-dimensional
features. This operation can obtain the global correlation between data.
Therefore, the model is able to retain important information based on the
coupling relationship between the data in data mixed with non-time series
factors. Then, self-attention decoding is per-formed and the feedforward neural
network is used to regression initial load. This paper introduces the residual
mechanism to build the load optimization module. The module generates residual
load values to optimize the initial load. The simulation results show that the
proposed load forecasting method has advantages in terms of prediction accuracy
and prediction stability.]]></summary>

raw signals of nanopore sequencers are converted into nucleotide sequences,
i.e., reads. State-of-the-art basecallers employ complex deep learning models
to achieve high basecalling accuracy. This makes basecalling
computationally-inefficient and memory-hungry; bottlenecking the entire genome
analysis pipeline. However, for many applications, the majority of reads do no
match the reference genome of interest (i.e., target reference) and thus are
discarded in later steps in the genomics pipeline, wasting the basecalling
computation. To overcome this issue, we propose TargetCall, the first
pre-basecalling filter to eliminate the wasted computation in basecalling.
TargetCall's key idea is to discard reads that will not match the target
reference (i.e., off-target reads) prior to basecalling. TargetCall consists of
two main components: (1) LightCall, a lightweight neural network basecaller
that produces noisy reads; and (2) Similarity Check, which labels each of these
noisy reads as on-target or off-target by matching them to the target
reference. TargetCall aims to filter out all off-target reads before
basecalling. The highly-accurate but slow basecalling is performed only on the
raw signals whose noisy reads are labeled as on-target. Our thorough
experimental evaluations using both real and simulated data show that
TargetCall 1) improves the end-to-end basecalling performance while maintaining
high sensitivity in keeping on-target reads, 2) maintains high accuracy in
downstream analysis, 3) precisely filters out up to 94.71% of off-target reads,
and 4) achieves better performance, throughput, sensitivity, precision, and
generality compared to prior works. We open-source TargetCall at

efficiently learn a rich representation of the input. However, for adapting to
downstream tasks, they require a sufficient amount of labeled data since their
rich features code not only objects but also less relevant image background. In
contrast, Instance Discrimination (ID) methods focus on objects. In this work,
we study how to combine the efficiency and scalability of MIM with the ability
of ID to perform downstream classification in the absence of large amounts of
labeled data. To this end, we introduce Masked Autoencoder Contrastive Tuning
(MAE-CT), a sequential approach that utilizes the implicit clustering of the
Nearest Neighbor Contrastive Learning (NNCLR) objective to induce abstraction
in the topmost layers of a pre-trained MAE. MAE-CT tunes the rich features such
that they form semantic clusters of objects without using any labels. Notably,
MAE-CT does not rely on hand-crafted augmentations and frequently achieves its
best performances while using only minimal augmentations (crop & flip).
Further, MAE-CT is compute efficient as it requires at most 10% overhead
compared to MAE re-training. Applied to large and huge Vision Transformer (ViT)
models, MAE-CT excels over previous self-supervised methods trained on ImageNet
in linear probing, k-NN and low-shot classification accuracy as well as in
unsupervised clustering accuracy. With ViT-H/16 MAE-CT achieves a new
state-of-the-art in linear probing of 82.2%.]]></summary>

optimisation space to run efficiently. In geometric quantum machine learning,
one achieves this by encoding group structure into parameterised quantum
circuits to include the symmetries of a problem as an inductive bias. However,
constructing such circuits is challenging as a concrete guiding principle has
yet to emerge. In this paper, we propose the use of spin networks, a form of
directed tensor network invariant under a group transformation, to devise SU(2)
equivariant quantum circuit ans\"atze -- circuits possessing spin rotation
symmetry. By changing to the basis that block diagonalises SU(2) group action,
these networks provide a natural building block for constructing parameterised
equivariant quantum circuits. We prove that our construction is mathematically
equivalent to other known constructions, such as those based on twirling and
generalised permutations, but more direct to implement on quantum hardware. The
efficacy of our constructed circuits is tested by solving the ground state
problem of SU(2) symmetric Heisenberg models on the one-dimensional triangular
lattice and on the Kagome lattice. Our results highlight that our equivariant
circuits boost the performance of quantum variational algorithms, indicating

influences precipitation prediction. It can facilitate accurate and expeditious
forecasting of short-term heavy rainfall bypassing the need for complex
Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models. In comparison to conventional
models, Deep Learning (DL)-based radar echo extrapolation algorithms exhibit
higher effectiveness and efficiency. Nevertheless, the development of reliable
and generalized echo extrapolation algorithm is impeded by three primary
challenges: cumulative error spreading, imprecise representation of sparsely
distributed echoes, and inaccurate description of non-stationary motion
processes. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel radar echo
extrapolation algorithm called Temporal-Spatial Parallel Transformer, referred
to as TempEE. TempEE avoids using auto-regression and instead employs a
one-step forward strategy to prevent cumulative error spreading during the
extrapolation process. Additionally, we propose the incorporation of a
Multi-level Temporal-Spatial Attention mechanism to improve the algorithm's
capability of capturing both global and local information while emphasizing
task-related regions, including sparse echo representations, in an efficient
manner. Furthermore, the algorithm extracts spatio-temporal representations
from continuous echo images using a parallel encoder to model the
non-stationary motion process for echo extrapolation. The superiority of our
TempEE has been demonstrated in the context of the classic radar echo
extrapolation task, utilizing a real-world dataset. Extensive experiments have
further validated the efficacy and indispensability of various components
within TempEE.]]></summary>

programs without actually running them with concrete data, and presents such
information as functions of input data sizes. Most of the analysis tools for
logic programs (and other languages) are based on setting up recurrence
relations representing (bounds on) the computational cost of predicates, and
solving them to find closed-form functions that are equivalent to (or a bound
on) them. Such recurrence solving is a bottleneck in current tools: many of the
recurrences that arise during the analysis cannot be solved with current
solvers, such as Computer Algebra Systems (CASs), so that specific methods for
different classes of recurrences need to be developed. We address such a
challenge by developing a novel, general approach for solving arbitrary,
constrained recurrence relations, that uses machine-learning sparse regression
techniques to guess a candidate closed-form function, and a combination of an
SMT-solver and a CAS to check whether such function is actually a solution of
the recurrence. We have implemented a prototype and evaluated it with
recurrences generated by a cost analysis system (the one in CiaoPP). The
experimental results are quite promising, showing that our approach can find
closed-form solutions, in a reasonable time, for classes of recurrences that
cannot be solved by such a system, nor by current CASs.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Historically, much of machine learning research has focused on the
performance of the algorithm alone, but recently more attention has been
focused on optimizing joint human-algorithm performance. Here, we analyze a
specific type of human-algorithm collaboration where the algorithm has access
to a set of $n$ items, and presents a subset of size $k$ to the human, who
selects a final item from among those $k$. This scenario could model content
recommendation, route planning, or any type of labeling task. Because both the
human and algorithm have imperfect, noisy information about the true ordering
of items, the key question is: which value of $k$ maximizes the probability
that the best item will be ultimately selected? For $k=1$, performance is
optimized by the algorithm acting alone, and for $k=n$ it is optimized by the
human acting alone. Surprisingly, we show that for multiple of noise models, it
is optimal to set $k \in [2, n-1]$ - that is, there are strict benefits to
collaborating, even when the human and algorithm have equal accuracy
separately. We demonstrate this theoretically for the Mallows model and
experimentally for the Random Utilities models of noisy permutations. However,
we show this pattern is reversed when the human is anchored on the algorithm's
presented ordering - the joint system always has strictly worse performance. We
extend these results to the case where the human and algorithm differ in their
accuracy levels, showing that there always exist regimes where a more accurate
agent would strictly benefit from collaborating with a less accurate one, but
these regimes are asymmetric between the human and the algorithm's accuracy.]]></summary>

domains, and methods based on machine learning have been widely adopted in the
field to monitor wear and spot defects before they lead to failures. Few
studies, however, have addressed the problem of censored data, in which failure
is not observed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to predict the time
to failure in ball bearings using survival analysis. First, we analyze bearing
data in the frequency domain and annotate when a bearing fails by comparing the
Kullback-Leibler divergence and the standard deviation between its break-in
frequency bins and its break-out frequency bins. Second, we train several
survival models to estimate the time to failure based on the annotated data and
covariates extracted from the time domain, such as skewness, kurtosis and
entropy. The models give a probabilistic prediction of risk over time and allow
us to compare the survival function between groups of bearings. We demonstrate
our approach on the XJTU and PRONOSTIA datasets. On XJTU, the best result is a
0.70 concordance-index and 0.21 integrated Brier score. On PRONOSTIA, the best
is a 0.76 concordance-index and 0.19 integrated Brier score. Our work motivates
further work on incorporating censored data in models for predictive
maintenance.]]></summary>

neural networks and gradient-based optimization. Understanding the behavior of
gradient descent however, and particularly its instability, has lagged behind
its empirical success. To add to the theoretical tools available to study
gradient descent we propose the principal flow (PF), a continuous time flow
that approximates gradient descent dynamics. To our knowledge, the PF is the
only continuous flow that captures the divergent and oscillatory behaviors of
gradient descent, including escaping local minima and saddle points. Through
its dependence on the eigendecomposition of the Hessian the PF sheds light on
the recently observed edge of stability phenomena in deep learning. Using our

specific facets of human-object interactions, a comprehensive physics-based
approach remains a challenge. Existing methods often focus on isolated segments
of the interaction process and rely on data-driven techniques that may result
in artifacts. In contrast, our proposed method embraces reinforcement learning
(RL) and physics simulation to mitigate the limitations of data-driven
approaches. Through a hierarchical framework, we first learn skill priors for
both body and hand movements in a decoupled setting. The generic skill priors
learn to decode a latent skill embedding into the motion of the underlying
part. A high-level policy then controls hand-object interactions in these
pretrained latent spaces, guided by task objectives of grasping and 3D target
trajectory following. It is trained using a novel reward function that combines
an adversarial style term with a task reward, encouraging natural motions while
fulfilling the task incentives. Our method successfully accomplishes the
complete interaction task, from approaching an object to grasping and
subsequent manipulation. We compare our approach against kinematics-based
baselines and show that it leads to more physically plausible motions.]]></summary>

techniques allows development of relatively complex monitoring systems in many
domains. Besides the traditional industrial domain, new application appears
also in biology and agriculture, where we could speak about the detection of
infections, parasites and weeds, but also about automated monitoring and early
warning systems. This is also connected with the introduction of the easily
accessible hardware and development kits such as Arduino, or RaspberryPi
family. In this paper, we survey 50 existing papers focusing on the methods of
automated beehive monitoring methods using the computer vision techniques,
particularly on the pollen and Varroa mite detection together with the bee
traffic monitoring. Such systems could also be used for the monitoring of the
honeybee colonies and for the inspection of their health state, which could
identify potentially dangerous states before the situation is critical, or to
better plan periodic bee colony inspections and therefore save significant
costs. Later, we also include analysis of the research trends in this
application field and we outline the possible direction of the new
explorations. Our paper is aimed also at veterinary and apidology professionals
and experts, who might not be familiar with machine learning to introduce them
to its possibilities, therefore each family of applications is opened by a
brief theoretical introduction and motivation related to its base method. We
hope that this paper will inspire other scientists to use machine learning
techniques for other applications in beehive monitoring.]]></summary>

unobserved confounders. Sensitivity analysis methods are commonly used to
estimate the policy value under the worst-case confounding over a given

of the uncertainty set for the sake of tractability, leading to overly
conservative estimation of the policy value. In this paper, we propose a
general estimator that provides a sharp lower bound of the policy value. It can
be shown that our estimator contains the recently proposed sharp estimator by
Dorn and Guo (2022) as a special case, and our method enables a novel extension
of the classical marginal sensitivity model using f-divergence. To construct
our estimator, we leverage the kernel method to obtain a tractable
approximation to the conditional moment constraints, which traditional
non-sharp estimators failed to take into account. In the theoretical analysis,
we provide a condition for the choice of the kernel which guarantees no
specification error that biases the lower bound estimation. Furthermore, we
provide consistency guarantees of policy evaluation and learning. In the
experiments with synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate the

pixel level over a five month test set horizon, out-performing simple
phase-folded models based on historical averaging. We also demonstrate that
embeddings learnt by EarthPT hold semantically meaningful information and could
be exploited for downstream tasks such as highly granular, dynamic land use
classification. Excitingly, we note that the abundance of EO data provides us
with -- in theory -- quadrillions of training tokens. Therefore, if we assume

the security and robustness of RL systems are worthy of more attention and
exploration. In particular, recent works have revealed that, in a multi-agent
RL environment, backdoor trigger actions can be injected into a victim agent
(a.k.a. Trojan agent), which can result in a catastrophic failure as soon as it
sees the backdoor trigger action. To ensure the security of RL agents against
malicious backdoors, in this work, we propose the problem of Backdoor Detection
in a multi-agent competitive reinforcement learning system, with the objective
of detecting Trojan agents as well as the corresponding potential trigger
actions, and further trying to mitigate their Trojan behavior. In order to
solve this problem, we propose PolicyCleanse that is based on the property that
the activated Trojan agents accumulated rewards degrade noticeably after
several timesteps. Along with PolicyCleanse, we also design a machine
unlearning-based approach that can effectively mitigate the detected backdoor.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods can accurately
detect Trojan agents, and outperform existing backdoor mitigation baseline
approaches by at least 3% in winning rate across various types of agents and

identically distributed (IID) data. They, on the other hand, suffer greatly
from heterogeneous environments, i.e., Non-IID data. Despite the fact that many
research projects have been done to address this issue, recent findings
indicate that they are still sub-optimal when compared to training on IID data.
In this work, we carefully analyze the existing methods in heterogeneous
environments. Interestingly, we find that regularizing the classifier's outputs
is quite effective in preventing performance degradation on Non-IID data.
Motivated by this, we propose Learning from Drift (LfD), a novel method for
effectively training the model in heterogeneous settings. Our scheme
encapsulates two key components: drift estimation and drift regularization.
Specifically, LfD first estimates how different the local model is from the
global model (i.e., drift). The local model is then regularized such that it
does not fall in the direction of the estimated drift. In the experiment, we
evaluate each method through the lens of the five aspects of federated
learning, i.e., Generalization, Heterogeneity, Scalability, Forgetting, and
Efficiency. Comprehensive evaluation results clearly support the superiority of
LfD in federated learning with Non-IID data.]]></summary>

our proposed model retains the benefits of using an utterance-level bottleneck,

SVQ-VAE achieves a statistically significant improvement in naturalness over

Wearable device-based prediction models allow for continuous health monitoring
under normal living conditions and could offer an alternative to identifying
older adults with cognitive impairments for early interventions. In this study,
we first derived novel wearable-based features related to circadian rhythms,
ambient light exposure, physical activity levels, sleep, and signal processing.
Then, we quantified the ability of wearable-based machine-learning models to
predict poor cognition based on outcomes from the Digit Symbol Substitution
Test (DSST), the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimers Disease
Word-Learning subtest (CERAD-WL), and the Animal Fluency Test (AFT). We found
that the wearable-based models had significantly higher AUCs when predicting
all three cognitive outcomes compared to benchmark models containing age, sex,
education, marital status, household income, diabetic status, depression
symptoms, and functional independence scores. In addition to uncovering
previously unidentified wearable-based features that are predictive of poor
cognition such as the standard deviation of the midpoints of each persons most
active 10-hour periods and least active 5-hour periods, our paper provides
proof-of-concept that wearable-based machine learning models can be used to
autonomously screen older adults for possible cognitive impairments. Such
models offer cost-effective alternatives to conducting initial screenings
manually in clinical settings.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A growing body of research has focused on the Reinforcement Learning (RL)
methods which allow the agent to learn from trial-and-error experiences
gathered during the interaction with the environment. Recently, offline RL
becomes a popular RL paradigm because it saves the interactions with
environments. In offline RL, data providers share large pre-collected datasets,
and others can train high-quality agents without interacting with the
environments. This paradigm has demonstrated effectiveness in critical tasks
like robot control, autonomous driving, etc. However, less attention is paid to
investigating the security threats to the offline RL system. This paper focuses
on backdoor attacks, where some perturbations are added to the data
(observations) such that given normal observations, the agent takes
high-rewards actions, and low-reward actions on observations injected with
triggers. In this paper, we propose Baffle (Backdoor Attack for Offline
Reinforcement Learning), an approach that automatically implants backdoors to
RL agents by poisoning the offline RL dataset, and evaluate how different
offline RL algorithms react to this attack. Our experiments conducted on four
tasks and four offline RL algorithms expose a disquieting fact: none of the
existing offline RL algorithms is immune to such a backdoor attack. Baffle
modifies $10\%$ of the datasets for four tasks. Agents trained on the poisoned
datasets perform well in normal settings. However, when triggers are presented,
the agents' performance decreases drastically by $63.2\%$, $53.9\%$, $64.7\%$,
and $47.4\%$ in the four tasks on average. The backdoor still persists after
fine-tuning poisoned agents on clean datasets. We further show that the
inserted backdoor is also hard to be detected by a popular defensive method.
This paper calls attention to developing more effective protection for the
open-source offline RL dataset.]]></summary>

systems makes it hard to decide what architecture and algorithm to use for a

replaces a complex system with a simpler, more interpretable surrogate. Drawing
inspiration from this, we construct a class of surrogate models for neural
networks using Gaussian processes. Rather than deriving kernels for infinite
neural networks, we learn kernels empirically from the naturalistic behavior of
finite neural networks. We demonstrate our approach captures existing phenomena
related to the spectral bias of neural networks, and then show that our

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent years, precision agriculture has gradually oriented farming closer
to automation processes to support all the activities related to field
management. Service robotics plays a predominant role in this evolution by
deploying autonomous agents that can navigate fields while performing tasks
without human intervention, such as monitoring, spraying, and harvesting. To
execute these precise actions, mobile robots need a real-time perception system
that understands their surroundings and identifies their targets in the wild.
Generalizing to new crops and environmental conditions is critical for
practical applications, as labeled samples are rarely available. In this paper,
we investigate the problem of crop segmentation and propose a novel approach to
enhance domain generalization using knowledge distillation. In the proposed
framework, we transfer knowledge from an ensemble of models individually
trained on source domains to a student model that can adapt to unseen target
domains. To evaluate the proposed method, we present a synthetic multi-domain
dataset for crop segmentation containing plants of variegate shapes and
covering different terrain styles, weather conditions, and light scenarios for
more than 50,000 samples. We demonstrate significant improvements in
performance over state-of-the-art methods and superior sim-to-real
generalization. Our approach provides a promising solution for domain
generalization in crop segmentation and has the potential to enhance a wide

\mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$ in $L^p(\mu)$ norm by sequentially querying its
values, for known compact real intervals $\mathcal{X}$, $\mathcal{Y}$ and a
known probability measure $\mu$ on $\cX$. For any function~$f$ we characterize
the minimum number of evaluations of $f$ that algorithms need to guarantee an
approximation $\hat{f}$ with an $L^p(\mu)$ error below $\epsilon$ after
stopping. Unlike worst-case results that hold uniformly over all $f$, our
complexity measure is dependent on each specific function $f$. To address this
problem, we introduce GreedyBox, a generalization of an algorithm originally
proposed by Novak (1992) for numerical integration. We prove that GreedyBox
achieves an optimal sample complexity for any function $f$, up to logarithmic
factors. Additionally, we uncover results regarding piecewise-smooth functions.
Perhaps as expected, the $L^p(\mu)$ error of GreedyBox decreases much faster
for piecewise-$C^2$ functions than predicted by the algorithm (without any
knowledge on the smoothness of $f$). A simple modification even achieves
optimal minimax approximation rates for such functions, which we compute
explicitly. In particular, our findings highlight multiple performance gaps
between adaptive and non-adaptive algorithms, smooth and piecewise-smooth

are distant in time from each other and from the final reward. These critical
steps are challenging to identify with traditional reinforcement learning (RL)
methods that rely on the Bellman equation for credit assignment. Here, we
present a new RL algorithm that uses offline contrastive learning to hone in on
critical steps. This algorithm, which we call contrastive introspection
(ConSpec), can be added to any existing RL algorithm. ConSpec learns a set of
prototypes for the critical steps in a task by a novel contrastive loss and
delivers an intrinsic reward when the current state matches one of these
prototypes. The prototypes in ConSpec provide two key benefits for credit
assignment: (1) They enable rapid identification of all the critical steps. (2)
They do so in a readily interpretable manner, enabling out-of-distribution
generalization when sensory features are altered. Distinct from other
contemporary RL approaches to credit assignment, ConSpec takes advantage of the
fact that it is easier to retrospectively identify the small set of steps that
success is contingent upon than it is to prospectively predict reward at every
step taken in the environment. Altogether, ConSpec improves learning in a
diverse set of RL tasks, including both those with explicit, discrete critical
steps and those with complex, continuous critical steps.]]></summary>

various facets of our daily existence. Solving attention regression is a
fundamental task in optimizing LLMs. In this work, we focus on giving a
provable guarantee for the one-layer attention network objective function
$L(X,Y) = \sum_{j_0 = 1}^n \sum_{i_0 = 1}^d ( \langle \langle \exp(
\mathsf{A}_{j_0} x ) , {\bf 1}_n \rangle^{-1} \exp( \mathsf{A}_{j_0} x ), A_{3}
Y_{*,i_0} \rangle - b_{j_0,i_0} )^2$. Here $\mathsf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n^2
\times d^2}$ is Kronecker product between $A_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ and
$A_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$. $A_3$ is a matrix in $\mathbb{R}^{n \times
d}$, $\mathsf{A}_{j_0} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d^2}$ is the $j_0$-th block of
$\mathsf{A}$. The $X, Y \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ are variables we want to
learn. $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ and $b_{j_0,i_0} \in \mathbb{R}$ is one
entry at $j_0$-th row and $i_0$-th column of $B$, $Y_{*,i_0} \in \mathbb{R}^d$
is the $i_0$-column vector of $Y$, and $x \in \mathbb{R}^{d^2}$ is the
vectorization of $X$.

In a multi-layer LLM network, the matrix $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ can
be viewed as the output of a layer, and $A_1= A_2 = A_3 \in \mathbb{R}^{n

be viewed as $QK^\top$ and $Y$ can be viewed as $V$. We provide an iterative
greedy algorithm to train loss function $L(X,Y)$ up $\epsilon$ that runs in
$\widetilde{O}( ({\cal T}_{\mathrm{mat}}(n,n,d) + {\cal

T}_{\mathrm{mat}}(a,b,c)$ denotes the time of multiplying $a \times b$ matrix
another $b \times c$ matrix, and $\omega\approx 2.37$ denotes the exponent of

impacts. Mitigating these risks is important, and the insurance industry is
central in this effort, using intricate statistical models for risk assessment.
However, these models often neglect key temporal and spatial hurricane patterns
and are limited by data scarcity. This study introduces a refined approach
combining the ARIMA model and K-MEANS to better capture hurricane trends, and
an Autoencoder for enhanced hurricane simulations. Our experiments show that
this hybrid methodology effectively simulate historical hurricane behaviors
while providing detailed projections of potential future trajectories and
intensities. Moreover, by leveraging a comprehensive yet selective dataset, our
simulations enrich the current understanding of hurricane patterns and offer
actionable insights for risk management strategies.]]></summary>

network can get the generalized function through training with a finite
dataset. The degree of generalization is a realization of the proximity scale
in the data space. Specifically, the scale is not clear if the dataset is
complicated. Here we consider a network for the distribution estimation of the
dataset. We show the estimation is unstable and the instability depends on the
data density and training duration. We derive the kernel-balanced equation,
which gives a short phenomenological description of the solution. The equation
tells us the reason for the instability and the mechanism of the scale. The

attraction (ROA) of an asymptotically stable equilibrium point without an
explicit model of the dynamics. Rather than leveraging approximate models with
bounded uncertainty to find a (robust) invariant set contained in the ROA, we
propose to learn sets that satisfy a more relaxed notion of containment known
as recurrence. We define a set to be $\tau$-recurrent (resp. $k$-recurrent) if
every trajectory that starts within the set, returns to it after at most $\tau$
seconds (resp. $k$ steps). We show that under mild assumptions a
$\tau$-recurrent set containing a stable equilibrium must be a subset of its
ROA. We then leverage this property to develop algorithms that compute inner
approximations of the ROA using counter-examples of recurrence that are
obtained by sampling finite-length trajectories. Our algorithms process samples
sequentially, which allow them to continue being executed even after an initial
offline training stage. We further provide an upper bound on the number of
counter-examples used by the algorithm, and almost sure convergence guarantees.]]></summary>

effectiveness in generating naturalistic behaviors. In this paper, we propose a
new learning framework in this paradigm for controlling physics-based
characters with significantly improved motion quality and diversity over
existing state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method uses reinforcement
learning (RL) to initially track and imitate life-like movements from
unstructured motion clips using the discrete information bottleneck, as adopted
in the Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE). This structure
compresses the most relevant information from the motion clips into a compact
yet informative latent space, i.e., a discrete space over vector quantized
codes. By sampling codes in the space from a trained categorical prior
distribution, high-quality life-like behaviors can be generated, similar to the
usage of VQ-VAE in computer vision. Although this prior distribution can be
trained with the supervision of the encoder's output, it follows the original
motion clip distribution in the dataset and could lead to imbalanced behaviors
in our setting. To address the issue, we further propose a technique named
prior shifting to adjust the prior distribution using curiosity-driven RL. The
outcome distribution is demonstrated to offer sufficient behavioral diversity
and significantly facilitates upper-level policy learning for downstream tasks.
We conduct comprehensive experiments using humanoid characters on two
challenging downstream tasks, sword-shield striking and two-player boxing game.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed framework is capable of controlling
the character to perform considerably high-quality movements in terms of
behavioral strategies, diversity, and realism. Videos, codes, and data are

in automated CQA ranking systems where similar questions (and answers) are

investigate a few aspects of this domain. Firstly, in addition to traditional
features like TF-IDF, BM25 etc., we introduce a BERT-based feature that
captures the semantic similarity between the question and answer. Secondly,
most of the existing research works have focused on features extracted only
from the question part; features extracted from answers have not been explored
extensively. We combine both types of features in a linear fashion. Thirdly,
using our proposed concepts, we conduct an empirical investigation with
different rank-learning algorithms, some of which have not been used so far in
CQA domain. On three standard CQA datasets, our proposed framework achieves

radar intelligently targets ice storms based on information collected by a
lookahead radiometer. Critical to the intelligent targeting is accurate
identification of storm/cloud types from eight bands of radiance collected by
the radiometer. The cloud types of interest are: clear sky, thin cirrus,
cirrus, rainy anvil, and convection core.

We describe multi-step use of Machine Learning and Digital Twin of the
Earth's atmosphere to derive such a classifier. First, a digital twin of
Earth's atmosphere called a Weather Research Forecast (WRF) is used generate
simulated lookahead radiometer data as well as deeper "science" hidden
variables. The datasets simulate a tropical region over the Caribbean and a
non-tropical region over the Atlantic coast of the United States. A K-means
clustering over the scientific hidden variables was utilized by human experts
to generate an automatic labelling of the data - mapping each physical data
point to cloud types by scientists informed by mean/centroids of hidden
variables of the clusters. Next, classifiers were trained with the inputs of
the simulated radiometer data and its corresponding label. The classifiers of a
random decision forest (RDF), support vector machine (SVM), Gaussian na\"ive
bayes, feed forward artificial neural network (ANN), and a convolutional neural
network (CNN) were trained. Over the tropical dataset, the best performing
classifier was able to identify non-storm and storm clouds with over 80%
accuracy in each class for a held-out test set. Over the non-tropical dataset,
the best performing classifier was able to classify non-storm clouds with over
90% accuracy and storm clouds with over 40% accuracy. Additionally both sets of
classifiers were shown to be resilient to instrument noise.]]></summary>

accuracy, managing risks, and fostering strategic financial decision-making.
Despite the development of financial market simulation methodologies, existing
frameworks often struggle with adapting to specialized simulation context. We
pinpoint the challenges as i) current financial datasets do not contain context
labels; ii) current techniques are not designed to generate financial data with
context as control, which demands greater precision compared to other
modalities; iii) the inherent difficulties in generating context-aligned,
high-fidelity data given the non-stationary, noisy nature of financial data. To
address these challenges, our contributions are: i) we proposed the Contextual
Market Dataset with market dynamics, stock ticker, and history state as
context, leveraging a market dynamics modeling method that combines linear
regression and Dynamic Time Warping clustering to extract market dynamics; ii)
we present Market-GAN, a novel architecture incorporating a Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN) for the controllable generation with context, an
autoencoder for learning low-dimension features, and supervisors for knowledge
transfer; iii) we introduce a two-stage training scheme to ensure that
Market-GAN captures the intrinsic market distribution with multiple objectives.
In the pertaining stage, with the use of the autoencoder and supervisors, we
prepare the generator with a better initialization for the adversarial training
stage. We propose a set of holistic evaluation metrics that consider alignment,
fidelity, data usability on downstream tasks, and market facts. We evaluate
Market-GAN with the Dow Jones Industrial Average data from 2000 to 2023 and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Accurately labeling biomedical data presents a challenge. Traditional
semi-supervised learning methods often under-utilize available unlabeled data.
To address this, we propose a novel reliability-based training data cleaning
method employing inductive conformal prediction (ICP). This method capitalizes
on a small set of accurately labeled training data and leverages ICP-calculated
reliability metrics to rectify mislabeled data and outliers within vast
quantities of noisy training data. The efficacy of the method is validated
across three classification tasks within distinct modalities: filtering
drug-induced-liver-injury (DILI) literature with title and abstract, predicting
ICU admission of COVID-19 patients through CT radiomics and electronic health
records, and subtyping breast cancer using RNA-sequencing data. Varying levels
of noise to the training labels were introduced through label permutation.
Results show significant enhancements in classification performance: accuracy
enhancement in 86 out of 96 DILI experiments (up to 11.4%), AUROC and AUPRC
enhancements in all 48 COVID-19 experiments (up to 23.8% and 69.8%), and
accuracy and macro-average F1 score improvements in 47 out of 48 RNA-sequencing
experiments (up to 74.6% and 89.0%). Our method offers the potential to
substantially boost classification performance in multi-modal biomedical
machine learning tasks. Importantly, it accomplishes this without necessitating
an excessive volume of meticulously curated training data.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In many randomized experiments, the treatment effect of the long-term metric
(i.e. the primary outcome of interest) is often difficult or infeasible to
measure. Such long-term metrics are often slow to react to changes and
sufficiently noisy they are challenging to faithfully estimate in short-horizon
experiments. A common alternative is to measure several short-term proxy
metrics in the hope they closely track the long-term metric -- so they can be
used to effectively guide decision-making in the near-term. We introduce a new
statistical framework to both define and construct an optimal proxy metric for
use in a homogeneous population of randomized experiments. Our procedure first
reduces the construction of an optimal proxy metric in a given experiment to a
portfolio optimization problem which depends on the true latent treatment
effects and noise level of experiment under consideration. We then denoise the
observed treatment effects of the long-term metric and a set of proxies in a
historical corpus of randomized experiments to extract estimates of the latent
treatment effects for use in the optimization problem. One key insight derived
from our approach is that the optimal proxy metric for a given experiment is
not apriori fixed; rather it should depend on the sample size (or effective
noise level) of the randomized experiment for which it is deployed. To
instantiate and evaluate our framework, we employ our methodology in a large
corpus of randomized experiments from an industrial recommendation system and
construct proxy metrics that perform favorably relative to several baselines.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We introduce beta diffusion, a novel generative modeling method that
integrates demasking and denoising to generate data within bounded ranges.
Using scaled and shifted beta distributions, beta diffusion utilizes
multiplicative transitions over time to create both forward and reverse
diffusion processes, maintaining beta distributions in both the forward
marginals and the reverse conditionals, given the data at any point in time.
Unlike traditional diffusion-based generative models relying on additive
Gaussian noise and reweighted evidence lower bounds (ELBOs), beta diffusion is
multiplicative and optimized with KL-divergence upper bounds (KLUBs) derived
from the convexity of the KL divergence. We demonstrate that the proposed KLUBs
are more effective for optimizing beta diffusion compared to negative ELBOs,
which can also be derived as the KLUBs of the same KL divergence with its two
arguments swapped. The loss function of beta diffusion, expressed in terms of
Bregman divergence, further supports the efficacy of KLUBs for optimization.
Experimental results on both synthetic data and natural images demonstrate the
unique capabilities of beta diffusion in generative modeling of range-bounded
data and validate the effectiveness of KLUBs in optimizing diffusion models,
thereby making them valuable additions to the family of diffusion-based
generative models and the optimization techniques used to train them.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Large language models (LLMs) have played a pivotal role in revolutionizing
various facets of our daily existence. Solving attention regression is a
fundamental task in optimizing LLMs. In this work, we focus on giving a
provable guarantee for the one-layer attention network objective function
$L(X,Y) = \sum_{j_0 = 1}^n \sum_{i_0 = 1}^d ( \langle \langle \exp(
\mathsf{A}_{j_0} x ) , {\bf 1}_n \rangle^{-1} \exp( \mathsf{A}_{j_0} x ), A_{3}
Y_{*,i_0} \rangle - b_{j_0,i_0} )^2$. Here $\mathsf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n^2
\times d^2}$ is Kronecker product between $A_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ and
$A_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$. $A_3$ is a matrix in $\mathbb{R}^{n \times
d}$, $\mathsf{A}_{j_0} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d^2}$ is the $j_0$-th block of
$\mathsf{A}$. The $X, Y \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ are variables we want to
learn. $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ and $b_{j_0,i_0} \in \mathbb{R}$ is one
entry at $j_0$-th row and $i_0$-th column of $B$, $Y_{*,i_0} \in \mathbb{R}^d$
is the $i_0$-column vector of $Y$, and $x \in \mathbb{R}^{d^2}$ is the
vectorization of $X$.

In a multi-layer LLM network, the matrix $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ can
be viewed as the output of a layer, and $A_1= A_2 = A_3 \in \mathbb{R}^{n
\times d}$ can be viewed as the input of a layer. The matrix version of $x$ can
be viewed as $QK^\top$ and $Y$ can be viewed as $V$. We provide an iterative
greedy algorithm to train loss function $L(X,Y)$ up $\epsilon$ that runs in
$\widetilde{O}( ({\cal T}_{\mathrm{mat}}(n,n,d) + {\cal
T}_{\mathrm{mat}}(n,d,d) + d^{2\omega}) \log(1/\epsilon) )$ time. Here ${\cal
T}_{\mathrm{mat}}(a,b,c)$ denotes the time of multiplying $a \times b$ matrix
another $b \times c$ matrix, and $\omega\approx 2.37$ denotes the exponent of
matrix multiplication.]]></summary>

unobserved confounders. Sensitivity analysis methods are commonly used to
estimate the policy value under the worst-case confounding over a given
uncertainty set. However, existing work often resorts to some coarse relaxation
of the uncertainty set for the sake of tractability, leading to overly
conservative estimation of the policy value. In this paper, we propose a
general estimator that provides a sharp lower bound of the policy value. It can
be shown that our estimator contains the recently proposed sharp estimator by
Dorn and Guo (2022) as a special case, and our method enables a novel extension
of the classical marginal sensitivity model using f-divergence. To construct
our estimator, we leverage the kernel method to obtain a tractable
approximation to the conditional moment constraints, which traditional
non-sharp estimators failed to take into account. In the theoretical analysis,
we provide a condition for the choice of the kernel which guarantees no
specification error that biases the lower bound estimation. Furthermore, we
provide consistency guarantees of policy evaluation and learning. In the
experiments with synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.]]></summary>

optimisation space to run efficiently. In geometric quantum machine learning,
one achieves this by encoding group structure into parameterised quantum
circuits to include the symmetries of a problem as an inductive bias. However,
constructing such circuits is challenging as a concrete guiding principle has
yet to emerge. In this paper, we propose the use of spin networks, a form of
directed tensor network invariant under a group transformation, to devise SU(2)
equivariant quantum circuit ans\"atze -- circuits possessing spin rotation
symmetry. By changing to the basis that block diagonalises SU(2) group action,
these networks provide a natural building block for constructing parameterised
equivariant quantum circuits. We prove that our construction is mathematically
equivalent to other known constructions, such as those based on twirling and
generalised permutations, but more direct to implement on quantum hardware. The
efficacy of our constructed circuits is tested by solving the ground state
problem of SU(2) symmetric Heisenberg models on the one-dimensional triangular
lattice and on the Kagome lattice. Our results highlight that our equivariant
circuits boost the performance of quantum variational algorithms, indicating

that bypasses the restrictions on covariate distributions imposed by modern
debiasing technology. We study the prevalent setting where the number of
features and samples are both large and comparable. In this context,
state-of-the-art debiasing technology uses a degrees-of-freedom correction to
remove shrinkage bias of regularized estimators and conduct inference. However,
this method requires that the observed samples are i.i.d., the covariates
follow a mean zero Gaussian distribution, and reliable covariance matrix
estimates for observed features are available. This approach struggles when (i)
covariates are non-Gaussian with heavy tails or asymmetric distributions, (ii)
rows of the design exhibit heterogeneity or dependencies, and (iii) reliable
feature covariance estimates are lacking.

To address these, we develop a new strategy where the debiasing correction is
a rescaled gradient descent step (suitably initialized) with step size
determined by the spectrum of the sample covariance matrix. Unlike prior work,
we assume that eigenvectors of this matrix are uniform draws from the
orthogonal group. We show this assumption remains valid in diverse situations
where traditional debiasing fails, including designs with complex row-column
dependencies, heavy tails, asymmetric properties, and latent low-rank
structures. We establish asymptotic normality of our proposed estimator
(centered and scaled) under various convergence notions. Moreover, we develop a
consistent estimator for its asymptotic variance. Lastly, we introduce a
debiased Principal Component Regression (PCR) technique using our
Spectrum-Aware approach. In varied simulations and real data experiments, we
observe that our method outperforms degrees-of-freedom debiasing by a margin.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Several fundamental problems in science and engineering consist of global
optimization tasks involving unknown high-dimensional (black-box) functions
that map a set of controllable variables to the outcomes of an expensive
experiment. Bayesian Optimization (BO) techniques are known to be effective in
tackling global optimization problems using a relatively small number objective
function evaluations, but their performance suffers when dealing with
high-dimensional outputs. To overcome the major challenge of dimensionality,
here we propose a deep learning framework for BO and sequential decision making
based on bootstrapped ensembles of neural architectures with randomized priors.
Using appropriate architecture choices, we show that the proposed framework can
approximate functional relationships between design variables and quantities of
interest, even in cases where the latter take values in high-dimensional vector
spaces or even infinite-dimensional function spaces. In the context of BO, we
augmented the proposed probabilistic surrogates with re-parameterized Monte
Carlo approximations of multiple-point (parallel) acquisition functions, as
well as methodological extensions for accommodating black-box constraints and
multi-fidelity information sources. We test the proposed framework against
state-of-the-art methods for BO and demonstrate superior performance across
several challenging tasks with high-dimensional outputs, including a
constrained multi-fidelity optimization task involving shape optimization of
rotor blades in turbo-machinery.]]></summary>

in the presence of noisy data, was first observed in neural network models
trained with gradient descent. To better understand this empirical observation,
we consider the generalization error of two-layer neural networks trained to

initialization. We assume the data comes from well-separated class-conditional
log-concave distributions and allow for a constant fraction of the training
labels to be corrupted by an adversary. We show that in this setting, neural
networks exhibit benign overfitting: they can be driven to zero training error,
perfectly fitting any noisy training labels, and simultaneously achieve minimax
optimal test error. In contrast to previous work on benign overfitting that
require linear or kernel-based predictors, our analysis holds in a setting

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Variable importance assessment has become a crucial step in machine-learning
applications when using complex learners, such as deep neural networks, on
large-scale data. Removal-based importance assessment is currently the
reference approach, particularly when statistical guarantees are sought to
justify variable inclusion. It is often implemented with variable permutation
schemes. On the flip side, these approaches risk misidentifying unimportant
variables as important in the presence of correlations among covariates. Here
we develop a systematic approach for studying Conditional Permutation
Importance (CPI) that is model agnostic and computationally lean, as well as
reusable benchmarks of state-of-the-art variable importance estimators. We show
theoretically and empirically that $\textit{CPI}$ overcomes the limitations of
standard permutation importance by providing accurate type-I error control.
When used with a deep neural network, $\textit{CPI}$ consistently showed top
accuracy across benchmarks. An empirical benchmark on real-world data analysis
in a large-scale medical dataset showed that $\textit{CPI}$ provides a more
parsimonious selection of statistically significant variables. Our results
suggest that $\textit{CPI}$ can be readily used as drop-in replacement for
permutation-based methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The swift progression of machine learning (ML) has not gone unnoticed in the
realm of statistical mechanics. ML techniques have attracted attention by the
classical density-functional theory (DFT) community, as they enable discovery
of free-energy functionals to determine the equilibrium-density profile of a
many-particle system. Within DFT, the external potential accounts for the
interaction of the many-particle system with an external field, thus, affecting
the density distribution. In this context, we introduce a statistical-learning
framework to infer the external potential exerted on a many-particle system. We
combine a Bayesian inference approach with the classical DFT apparatus to
reconstruct the external potential, yielding a probabilistic description of the
external potential functional form with inherent uncertainty quantification.
Our framework is exemplified with a grand-canonical one-dimensional particle
ensemble with excluded volume interactions in a confined geometry. The required
training dataset is generated using a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation where the
external potential is applied to the grand-canonical ensemble. The resulting
particle coordinates from the MC simulation are fed into the learning framework
to uncover the external potential. This eventually allows us to compute the
equilibrium density profile of the system by using the tools of DFT. Our
approach benchmarks the inferred density against the exact one calculated
through the DFT formulation with the true external potential. The proposed
Bayesian procedure accurately infers the external potential and the density
profile. We also highlight the external-potential uncertainty quantification
conditioned on the amount of available simulated data. The seemingly simple
case study introduced in this work might serve as a prototype for studying a
wide variety of applications, including adsorption and capillarity.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Artificial intelligence models and methods commonly lack causal
interpretability. Despite the advancements in interpretable machine learning
(IML) methods, they frequently assign importance to features which lack causal
influence on the outcome variable. Selecting causally relevant features among
those identified as relevant by these methods, or even before model training,
would offer a solution. Feature selection methods utilizing information
theoretical quantities have been successful in identifying statistically
relevant features. However, the information theoretical quantities they are
based on do not incorporate causality, rendering them unsuitable for such
scenarios. To address this challenge, this article proposes information
theoretical quantities that incorporate the causal structure of the system,
which can be used to evaluate causal importance of features for some given
outcome variable. Specifically, we introduce causal versions of entropy and
mutual information, termed causal entropy and causal information gain, which
are designed to assess how much control a feature provides over the outcome
variable. These newly defined quantities capture changes in the entropy of a
variable resulting from interventions on other variables. Fundamental results
connecting these quantities to the existence of causal effects are derived. The
use of causal information gain in feature selection is demonstrated,
highlighting its superiority over standard mutual information in revealing
which features provide control over a chosen outcome variable. Our
investigation paves the way for the development of methods with improved
interpretability in domains involving causation.]]></summary>

take treatment, so that optimal policy rules are merely suggestions in the
presence of human non-adherence to treatment recommendations. In these same
domains, there may be heterogeneity both in who responds in taking-up
treatment, and heterogeneity in treatment efficacy. While optimal treatment
rules can maximize causal outcomes across the population, access parity
constraints or other fairness considerations can be relevant in the case of
encouragement. For example, in social services, a persistent puzzle is the gap
in take-up of beneficial services among those who may benefit from them the
most. When in addition the decision-maker has distributional preferences over
both access and average outcomes, the optimal decision rule changes. We study
causal identification, statistical variance-reduced estimation, and robust
estimation of optimal treatment rules, including under potential violations of
positivity. We consider fairness constraints such as demographic parity in
treatment take-up, and other constraints, via constrained optimization. Our
framework can be extended to handle algorithmic recommendations under an
often-reasonable covariate-conditional exclusion restriction, using our
robustness checks for lack of positivity in the recommendation. We develop a
two-stage algorithm for solving over parametrized policy classes under general
constraints to obtain variance-sensitive regret bounds. We illustrate the
methods in two case studies based on data from randomized encouragement to

 To stay on top of the latest advancements in AI, look here first.

 Personalized Route Suggestions through AI
  
The AI model comprises 360 million parameters, using real-time data from Maps users to influence factors including travel time, road conditions, tolls, and personal preferences to suggest routes.
 This technology is grounded on "inverse reinforcement learning" (IRL), specifically a new IRL algorithm - "Receding Horizon Inverse Planning (RHIP)".
  
The Power of RHIP and AI in Maps
  
Google and Deepmind jointly worked to develop RHIP, using complex stochastic models in immediate vicinity areas, but switching to simpler deterministic methods for distant areas for power conservation.
 The AI improves route suggestions for both driving and two-wheeled vehicles by learning from Maps users' movements and behaviors over time.
 Google states that this is the largest application of inverse reinforcement learning for route planning to date.
  
Implementation and User Testing
  
Google has applied the algorithm to Maps data globally, but extensive user testing is needed to confirm if the technique consistently produces better routes.
 Previous attempts at using AI systems for route planning on a large scale have often failed due to the complexity of road networks.

 Github: https://github.com/aiwaves-cn/agents 
 Abstract:
  
Recent advances on large language models (LLMs) enable researchers and developers to build autonomous language agents that can automatically solve various tasks and interact with environments, humans, and other agents using natural language interfaces. We consider language agents as a promising direction towards artificial general intelligence and release Agents, an open-source library with the goal of opening up these advances to a wider non-specialist audience. Agents is carefully engineered to support important features including planning, memory, tool usage, multi-agent communication, and fine-grained symbolic control. Agents is user-friendly as it enables non-specialists to build, customize, test, tune, and deploy state-of-the-art autonomous language agents without much coding. The library is also research-friendly as its modularized design makes it easily extensible for researchers.

 I have about 100K images on my machine and I am looking for a tool that can help me do some QA on it.
 Example features I would love:
  
Search and visualize all images with a prefix "cls1_" or "cls2_"
 Easily rename file names if they're not named correctly
 
Visualize all captions associated with each image 
  
We can assume they have the same name but with extension ".txt" or ".captions"
 Or there's a metadata.json linking between "img_file" and "caption_file"
 
 
Easily edit captions in the dashboard
 
 I can also work with some kind of metadata file instead of relying on filename logic if it really helps a certain tool.
 I prefer a locally run, open-source tool. It would be a problem for me to upload this data to any online platform.
 Many thanks in advance for any help or guidance.

One of these steps to is calculate values from algorithmic and mathematical functions. In my training and testing data the values are around 12-15 decimal places. I then split the data without shuffling. Training, validation and testing averages at 75% accuracy. 
 Now my next step I wanted to do a "real world" data test where I collect the exact same data as my testing data and predict it using my previously built model but the values inside test_dataset1 are different to test_dataset2 within the last 6-9 decimal places even though the data is going through the exact same code. For example 
 Test_dataset1 Value : 1.123456789
 Test_dataset2 Value : 1.123456987
 This messes with my prediction and its making me wonder aswell as standrising my data should I be rounding my float values to say 4-6 decimal places?

 Can developers optimize apps for Google Tensor like they can for the Neural Engine?
 If not, how do developers take advantage of machine learning acceleration chips on Google Pixel or Android in general?
 If yes, let's say a developer optimizes their app for the Google TPU, will they need to re-optimize for other chips like Samsung's NPU or Qualcomm AI too? If not, how well do they run? Are they the same fast and efficient?

As a result, there is a growing demand for lightweight, yet high-quality face generation and editing models, which are often based on generative adversarial network (GAN) techniques.

 Abstract:
  
Transformers have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing, but comprehending their internal mechanisms remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel geometric perspective that elucidates the inner mechanisms of transformer operations. Our primary contribution is illustrating how layer normalization confines the latent features to a hyper-sphere, subsequently enabling attention to mold the semantic representation of words on this surface. This geometric viewpoint seamlessly connects established properties such as iterative refinement and contextual embeddings. We validate our insights by probing a pre-trained 124M parameter GPT-2 model. Our findings reveal clear query-key attention patterns in early layers and build upon prior observations regarding the subject-specific nature of attention heads at deeper layers. Harnessing these geometric insights, we present an intuitive understanding of transformers, depicting them as processes that model the trajectory of word particles along the hyper-sphere.

 The Python library hampel implements the Hampel Filter, which is generally used to detect anomalies in data with a timeseries structure. It basically consists of a sliding window of a parameterizable size.
 The library was in plain Python before (using pandas for all the sliding operations, median computation etc), but now it has been replaced by a Cython implementation, which speeds up things quite a bit! 😀
 It also provides much more valuable information (thresholds, median absolute deviations, etc.), allowing us to create plots like this one:

 Currently, I am building a Deep Learning model with the task of automatically generating random posts and tweets. The characteristic is that it must have the personality of the writer, for example the user is the CEO of company A, then the generated post must have the writing style of the CEO or company A, similar to other users.
 Actually, I don't know where to start solving this problem. I intend to use RWKV to do this problem but I'm not sure if it is a good direction or not. Is there any related research or can anyone who has done this problem give me some suggestions?

 Abstract:
  
Transformers have become the dominant model in deep learning, but the reason for their superior performance is poorly understood. Here, we hypothesize that the strong performance of Transformers stems from an architectural bias towards mesa-optimization, a learned process running within the forward pass of a model consisting of the following two steps: (i) the construction of an internal learning objective, and (ii) its corresponding solution found through optimization. To test this hypothesis, we reverse-engineer a series of autoregressive Transformers trained on simple sequence modeling tasks, uncovering underlying gradient-based mesa-optimization algorithms driving the generation of predictions. Moreover, we show that the learned forward-pass optimization algorithm can be immediately repurposed to solve supervised few-shot tasks, suggesting that mesa-optimization might underlie the in-context learning capabilities of large language models. Finally, we propose a novel self-attention layer, the mesa-layer, that explicitly and efficiently solves optimization problems specified in context. We find that this layer can lead to improved performance in synthetic and preliminary language modeling experiments, adding weight to our hypothesis that mesa-optimization is an important operation hidden within the weights of trained Transformers.

 So the definition of the recurrent representation of the retention mechanism is below

γ is a decay factor, and K, Q, and V have their standard transformer definitions.
 What confuses me is the derivation of Sn. The formula makes it look like a scalar. But if that's the case, are we saying that for a given token, the retention mechanism is just multiplying the Query by a scalar? That's surprising! How is that able to provide enough context?
 Here is some code I wrote with GPT to show my understanding of how it works. Is this correct? I use 3 arbitrary tokens of dimension 3, and then a pick arbitrary K Q and V matrices. I also initialize gamma to 0.5

 I have already tried Python libraries and methods such as indic-nlp, Levenshtein distance, UrduHack, Word2vec Urdu etc, but they weren't able to solve this problem.

 It seems like these are difficult times. Compare today with the WWII years, explaining how much we have to be grateful for.
 Bard said:
 I agree that these are difficult times. The world is facing many challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and political instability. However, I believe that we have much to be grateful for today compared to the WWII years.
 Here are just a few things:
 We live in a time of peace. World War II was a global conflict that caused the deaths of millions of people. Today, there are no major wars raging on.
 We have access to advanced medical care. During WWII, many people died from diseases that are now easily treatable. Today, we have antibiotics, vaccines, and other medical advances that have saved countless lives.
 We have a higher standard of living. In the WWII years, many people lived in poverty. Today, most people in the developed world have access to clean water, food, and shelter.
 We have more opportunities for education and advancement. In the WWII years, many people were denied an education because of their race, gender, or social class. Today, education is more accessible than ever before, and people from all backgrounds have the opportunity to succeed.
 We have a better understanding of the world. During WWII, there was a lot of misinformation and propaganda. Today, we have access to more information than ever before, and we can make more informed decisions about our lives.
 Of course, there are still many challenges that we face today. But I believe that we have come a long way since the WWII years, and we have much to be grateful for. Let us never forget the sacrifices that were made during that time, and let us continue to work towards a better future for all.

 I have a dataset that consists of 2D trajectories and I am aiming to develop an autoencoder architecture to learn a compressed set of features that reasonable represents and can reconstruct the trajectories. 
 The trajectories may look something like this as an example. A 2D image as input would seem to require a very sparse representation with high resolution to track the trajectory path. I am hoping there is a better way to input the path without requiring high resolution. 
 An alternative might be to use a LSTM structure to input as a sequence, although not sure that solves the resolution issue.
 Do you have any suggestions? I've worked with 1d time series and 2D images just fine but this is a bit different.

 I'm running llama-2-7b-chat-hf with 4bit quantization on a g5.2xlarge instance on sagemaker.
 The method I'm using is map_reduce (option 2)from this webpage https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/summarization)
 Of everything I've tried this is the only one that's been able to do decent summaries in a reasonable amount of time. However with really long articles (10,000+ words) it takes ~6 minutes before giving an output.
 I tried running this same thing on a g5.12xlarge instance which has 4 A10G gpus but it hasn't reduced the time by any noticeable amount.
 Is there anything else I could be doing to speed this up?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I asked ChatGPT to talk with Trump's jury about the 3-hour delay. Not bad.
 ChatGPT:
 Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, today, we present a compelling case that the three-hour delay in President Trump's response to the events of January 6th is, without a doubt, overwhelming and irrefutable evidence of his planning and conducting the insurrection that unfolded before our eyes.
 First, consider the timeline. As the violence escalated, President Trump did not immediately call for an end to the chaos. This delay allowed the mob to wreak havoc, endanger lives, and damage our democracy. A leader's duty is to protect the nation and its citizens, and a three-hour wait to act is inexplicable unless there was intent behind it.
 Second, let's talk about intent. In criminal law, intent matters. It's the difference between an accident and a crime. A deliberate delay in response to an unfolding insurrection suggests a guilty mind. President Trump had the power and the responsibility to intervene immediately. Yet, he chose not to, allowing the violence to escalate.
 Furthermore, we must consider his words leading up to and during the events of January 6th. His rhetoric could be interpreted as encouragement for his supporters to take matters into their own hands. This, coupled with the delay, paints a picture of a leader who not only knew what was happening but may have orchestrated it.
 Ladies and gentlemen, we are not here to pass judgment but to seek justice. The evidence of a three-hour delay in responding to the insurrection, along with the surrounding circumstances, presents a compelling case that President Trump planned and conducted this insurrection. It is our duty to hold individuals accountable for their actions, regardless of their position.

 "The film The Social Network is a dramatization of the founding of Facebook, and as such, it takes some liberties with the truth.

Every year our company receives mandates / updates from different parties. In turn, our development teams have to parse through heavy documentation to figure out what needs to change in our code. Ingesting the data is what takes the longest. Our goal is to feed the mandates documentation through an AI and have it return what is needed to be changed in our code. For example, something might say field 200 now needs to include a 6 digit date format vs the 4 digit date format we've had in years past. We have secured a license for Azure AI but honestly no idea if that is the right AI to use. I youtubed a bunch of videos on document processing but I'm also not sure if that is what we are trying to do. Any advice on this is much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07062 
 Abstract:
  
We explore the novel application of Large Language Models to code optimization. We present a 7B-parameter transformer model trained from scratch to optimize LLVM assembly for code size. The model takes as input unoptimized assembly and outputs a list of compiler options to best optimize the program. Crucially, during training, we ask the model to predict the instruction counts before and after optimization, and the optimized code itself. These auxiliary learning tasks significantly improve the optimization performance of the model and improve the model's depth of understanding.
 We evaluate on a large suite of test programs. Our approach achieves a 3.0% improvement in reducing instruction counts over the compiler, outperforming two state-of-the-art baselines that require thousands of compilations. Furthermore, the model shows surprisingly strong code reasoning abilities, generating compilable code 91% of the time and perfectly emulating the output of the compiler 70% of the time.

 Anyway, I'm searching for alternative methods, algoritms (NLP or not) and models... There are lots of info and different implementation on RAG, but as I can see noone put much effort to augment chunking quality. 
 Also, there are other approach than this one I'm currently using? bi-encoder (instructor) - > cross-encoder (reranking) - > LLM 
 Can someone share some resources, repo, lib or existing implementation of different chunking methods? (or simply discuss here some idea, though or approach)

 Cambridge University Press
 I am solving the problem I attach and I have a doubt in section (f). I have solved all the sections (a)-(e).
 In section (e) I have obtained that I need
 $$
 k \geq \frac{\lambda_{\text{max}}\left(\frac{2}{N} A^TA + 2\mu I\right)}{\lambda_{\text{min}}\left(\frac{2}{N} A^TA + 2\mu I\right)}log((f(x^0)-f(x_\mu)/\epsilon).
 $$
 However in section (f) asks for a tight upper bound but I only can think about the following bound:
 $f(\hat{x}) \leq f_\mu(x_\mu) + ||\hat{x}||^2+ \epsilon$,
 which is very simple.
 Do you think that I can obtain the result in (e) to obtain another bond, or what would you do?

 I'm trying to figure out what is the best way to use LLMs to analyse a very old software entirely written in C.
 I've tried to to some basic prompts with ChatGPT and it seems to recognise the language.
 The situation is that I've many .c files with thousands of lines and with a lot of redundant code.
 Moreover, since there are a lot of data structure with variables names not easily understandable, I need to provide some context to allow the model to trying to understand what the code does.
 My worry is that providing all the needed info + the file itself (even considering 1 file at a time) I could consume all the model context and therefore not leave room for generating anything of value.
 Has anyone had the opportunity to face similar problems? Ideas?

 Abstract:
  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results. However, existing models are expensive to train and deploy, and it is also difficult to expand their knowledge beyond pre-training data without forgetting previous knowledge. This paper proposes a new neural network architecture, ModuleFormer, that leverages modularity to improve the efficiency and flexibility of large language models. ModuleFormer is based on the Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE). Unlike the previous SMoE-based modular language model, which requires domain-labeled data to learn domain-specific experts, ModuleFormer can i…]]></summary>

 I wasn't doing any ml in some time and forgot basics. I was thinking that you may help me. So I trained svc model on small dataset (around 1400 unical records). I have 13 classes, which are badly distributed in the training set and inbalanced. 3 classes took around 80% of all. What the business wants is keep the 3 classes and categorize the rest as "Other" class. In the future they may be able to generate more training data for the remaining labels.
 How should I do it? I know I can assign everytning to "Other" class, before training with simple if then formula, but dont know if this is the right approach. Any sugestions? I know this may be some case of 1 vs all case, but don't know which exactly.
 Thanks in advance for any help.

 I was really excited that Mojo became publicly available and thinking which project can I implement to learn Mojo concepts. Since I have already ported llama2.c to pure Python, I decided why not try to port llama2.py to Mojo now.. And here is what I got
 First round of llama2.c vs llama2.🔥 battle. Mojo demonstrated 20% better performance than C in a single threaded execution of llama2 inference and 250x times better performance than Python
 https://i.redd.it/0gcwwfc2r7ob1.gif
 For reference Mojo is using SIMD vectorization, that's why it's performing great for matmul operations. In the other hand, it turned out that gcc also aggressively optimizes all for loops it can find, so I suggest this benchmark is pretty fair.
 ​
 Mojo natively supports SIMD vectorizations out of the box
 gcc aggressively vectorizing loops
 ​
 After that I decided to compare both solutions in multi-threaded (parallelized) mode, and now `llama2.c` strike back with help of OMP demonstrating 20% better performance than Mojo
 ​
 https://i.redd.it/gwymffods7ob1.gif
 I hope this post will be useful for all Machine Learning engineers/enthusiasts/students out there, ensuring we're up-to-date with Modular/Mojo's game-changing AI tech developments.
 Stay informed and ahead of the curve!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I'm currently at a crossroads with a decision that I believe many in this community might have faced or will face at some point: Should I use cloud-based GPU instances like AWS's p3.2xlarge EC2 (with Tesla V100) or invest in building a high-performance rig at home with multiple RTX 4090s for training a large language model?
 Context: I run a startup and we're currently fine-tuning an open source LLM, and the computational demands are of course high. We want to make an informed choice between using AWS's offerings or setting up a high-performance system at home to start.
 Cloud Option: AWS p3.2xlarge EC2
  
Cost: Approximately $3.06 per hour.
 Specifications: One Tesla V100 GPU, 8 vCPUs, 61 GiB RAM.
 Pros: Scalability, reliability, specialized software optimizations.
 Cons: Recurring costs, potential limitations on customization.
  
Home Rig Option: Multiple RTX 4090s
  
Cost: Around $1,600 for each 4090, but I'd own them.
 Specifications: Even higher TFLOPs than a V100, and memory isn't a constraint (24GB per card).
 Pros: One-time investment, flexibility, potentially higher raw computational power.
 Cons: Need to handle cooling, power, and system integration myself
  
I'd love to hear your thoughts, experiences, and recommendations. Here are some specific questions:
  
Performance: How many RTX 4090s would roughly equal the computational power of an AWS p3.2xlarge instance for ML tasks?
 Cost-Effectiveness: Given that we're a startup with limited resources, does it make more financial sense to invest upfront in hardware?
 Reliability and Maintenance: For those who have run multi-GPU setups at home, how reliable are they, and what maintenance work is required?
 Other Considerations: Are there factors I haven't considered that you think are critical?
  
Thank you in advance for sharing your insights!

Abstract:
  
The current trend of scaling language models involves increasing both parameter count and training dataset size. Extrapolating this trend suggests that training dataset size may soon be limited by the amount of text data available on the internet. Motivated by this limit, we investigate scaling language models in data-constrained regimes. Specifically, we run a large set of experiments varying the extent of data repetition and compute budget, ranging up to 900 billion training tokens and 9 billion parameter models. We find that with constrained data for a fixed compute budget, training with up to 4 epochs of repeated data yields negligible changes to loss compared to having unique data. However, with more repetition, the value of adding compute eventually decays to zero. We propose and empirically validate a scaling law for compute optimality that accounts for the decreasing value of repeated tokens and excess parameters. Finally, we experiment with approaches mitigating data scarcity, including augmenting the training dataset with code data or removing commonly used filters. Models and datasets from our 400 training runs are freely available at this https URL.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In less than a year since ChatGPT was introduced, it has become the fastest consumer application to register 100 million monthly active users. But how are consumers using other GenAI products apart from ChatGPT? An a16z Consumer report examines the top 50 GenAI web products (based on SimilarWeb data) to find out.
 To stay on top of the latest advancements in AI, look here first.
 https://preview.redd.it/f0kh5qag16ob1.png?width=2058&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cab11a31d384c068912c9fca32a000393b795d5
  
Proprietary models are dominating: 80% of the top 50 GenAI products didn’t exist a year ago—suggesting many of the most compelling consumer experiences are completely novel. Interestingly, 48% of these are bootstrapped—with no outside funding.
 ChatGPT holds a massive lead: ChatGPT alone accounts for 60% of the entire list's monthly traffic, with roughly 1.6 billion visits and 200 million monthly users as of June 2023.
 LLM assistants are dominating: LLMs, including Google’s Bard and Quora’s Poe, constitute 68% of total consumer traffic to the top 50. The other categories seeing significant traffic are AI companions and content-generation tools.
 GenAI marketing is mostly organic: Marketing for most of these products has been reliant on referrals, word of mouth, and other traditional marketing as they enter the market. About 90% of these companies are already monetizing, and most do so via a subscription model.
 GenAI and mobile adaptability: Given the extensive consumer time spent on mobile, an increase in mobile-first GenAI products is expected as the technology evolves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 Recently, I tried to follow fetch_pick_and_place.env in gymnasium_robotics to build a similar environment with Franka.
 I found that the core of this implementation is to use the mocap to control the end-effector, and then mocap derives joint angles using the built-in inverse kinematics algorithm.
 For the fetch_pick_and_place.env, mocap does not cause mutations and oscillations in configuration space. However, when I use mocap to control Franka, oscillations in joint space occur frequently, although I've minimized the step size of the mocap to ensure that the movement of the end-effector in Cartesian space is minor. Fetch and Franka are both redundant arms, I don't know why there is such a big difference in mocap performance.
 Here is the video to illustrate the above phenomenon
 Franka
 I've opened issues on mujoco and gymnasium robotics repositories, but it didn't initiate any discussion.
 Any help would be appreciated! Thanks!

Prompt Engineering seems like a pretty fresh field of study. Is it up and coming as a career path?
 People that specialize in this, what field(s) did you come from and how would you recommend diving into it?
 Considering my experience, would I be able to actually find work, freelancing or employed?
 How on earth do I get started in this world? It seems so insanely big and complicated but I am just fascinated by the idea of using written dialogue to manipulate the output of an LLM!
 From my very high overview of PE and the recent advances in AI, PE as a field of study and interest is going to expand exponentially, is that accurate?

 What is the best way to get my python code for the agent to run onto the spare PC? I know I can manually load copy the code over, but I'm looking for a more efficient method that will maintain any changes made to the source code. Maybe packaging up the python code within the sweep and having the agent download and execute it?

When I take the average of all iterations I get poor results (F1 score= 0.5), but if I pool all the predictions and compute the F1 score at the end, I achieve decent performance (F1 score =0.7). So, in my project, it is in my best interest to use the second approach, and somebody that I trust tells me that it is okay to do this approach. But I cannot seem to find a paper that says that this approach is acceptable or good. What do you guys think and do you have any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was thinking of some major challenges in modeling a generic real-world environment. Some of them are: adaptive agents, uncertain intentions, and lack of common knowledge.
 However, most of the papers I see on RL make some assumption or other violating one or more of these, like considering simple agents, assuming known knowledge about others' intentions, and considering that the models of other agents are known when irl an agent hardly has a model of other agents it interacts with apriori. 
 Consider an airport scenario where agents are trying to get into respective planes within a given time, and the gates to each plane allow one person at a time. Looking at the scenario from the view of a single agent, they know what they want, but they can't really make any assumptions about the intentions, strategy, and complexity of other agents beforehand. These other agents can be neutral or adversarial (competing for getting in the same plane) from the agent's viewpoint. All they can see is a restricted view of the motions of some of the other agents.
 What would you say could model and provide a solution in such a scenario? It is to be noted that other agents can change their strategies based on actions taken by you till now, and so can you. Due to having incomplete information, I fail to see the notion of an equilibrium, and the agents needn't be fully rational as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on a project that involves analyzing large samples of Java codes. My end goal is to perform classification based on these codes. For this, I've been trying to efficiently encode the full names of the methods (in the package.class.methodname format) in the Java code.
 Currently, I am experimenting with doc2vec. I'm treating the components of each method's full name (separated by dots) as individual documents. This allows me to produce vectors for each method name, and I evaluate the results by computing the cosine similarity between pairs of similar method names. The results were not good so far.
 Before moving to doc2vec, I tried using an LLM which gave me good results. However, the inference time was far too long, especially given the scale at which I'm working. I also considered using a Bag of Words model, but quickly realized it wouldn't be effective. Many of the method names in my samples are obfuscated, making this approach unsuitable.
 The issue I'm facing is that using the direct method names as features is not generalizing well for classification. A slight change in a method's name results in losing that particular feature, making my model fragile.
 What are some optimal encoding methods for small sentences (around 5-6 words) like these method names, that can scale well? 
 Also, Are there any specialized encoding techniques tailored for software code that I could use for this task?
 Any suggestions or insights would be really helpful. Thank you!

 Github: https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm 
 Blog: https://vllm.ai/ 
 Abstract:
  
High throughput serving of large language models (LLMs) requires batching sufficiently many requests at a time. However, existing systems struggle because the key-value cache (KV cache) memory for each request is huge and grows and shrinks dynamically. When managed inefficiently, this memory can be significantly wasted by fragmentation and redundant duplication, limiting the batch size. To address this problem, we propose PagedAttention, an attention algorithm inspired by the classical virtual memory and paging techniques in operating systems. On top of it, we build vLLM, an LLM serving system that achieves (1) near-zero waste in KV cache memory and (2) flexible sharing of KV cache within and across requests to further reduce memory usage. Our evaluations show that vLLM improves the throughput of popular LLMs by 2-4× with the same level of latency compared to the state-of-the-art systems, such as FasterTransformer and Orca. The improvement is more pronounced with longer sequences, larger models, and more complex decoding algorithms.

 Currently I am seeing this as a synthetic data generation problem: two approaches I am thinking of is 1) grounding (using viral examples to guide the prompt) and 2) filtering (finetuning an LLM to predict virality and filtering for the most viral generations)

Basically after my masters, I'll probably have only these two internships to show as a work experience, Probably won't be able to get an internship in an IT company unless i opt for remote work (which is also not guaranteed atm).
 Mu question, generally is Msc + 2 research internships + 1or 2 publications good enough to secure a decent job in R&D?

 I would love to create a small group of people who work together in AI.
 The project would be to create an AI that can infer new novel knowledge from existing datasets, as opposed to be being limited by operating within the training data. Specifically to be used in the quest to learn more about the universe.
 So I am looking for a team of likeminded individuals who want to grow in the field of AI.
 I'd love to setup a discord, subreddit and github profile to showcase our work.
 My introduction question is: How do we get AI's to expand upon current knowledge instead of just serving from the knowledge itself.
 Anyone interested in joining me in this?

Each of the corporations has promised to submit their software to internal and external audits, where independent experts can attack the models to see how they can be misused.
 
The organizations agreed to safeguard their intellectual property and make sure things like the weights of their proprietary neural networks don't leak, while giving users a way to easily report vulnerabilities or bugs.
 
All eight companies agreed to focus on research to investigate societal and civil risks AI might pose if they lead to discriminatory decision-making or have weaknesses in data privacy.

 I bring 2 years of experience from a European investment fund and a solid idea for a B2B SaaS solution targeting private equity investment funds. 
 This market is notoriously challenging to penetrate without insider knowledge. The timing couldn't be better. Similar kind of software is currently sold €20k per user by a semi-monopolistic boomer company that is ready to be disrupted.
 Offer:
 - Equity shared equally.
 - Ready to quit my job and go full-time on it, if I find the right co-founder.
 Ideal Partner:
 Seeking someone proficient in SQL for handling large datasets and able to integrate OpenAI's API within such datasets (technical AI skills required). While I'm based in Berlin and prefer a European co-founder, it's not mandatory, but meeting in person is a must before we commit.
 Don't be afraid to DM me if intrigued! Together, we can make it happen. Let's revolutionize the sector!

 "Caution: TensorFlow 2.10 was the last TensorFlow release that supported GPU on native-Windows. Starting with TensorFlow 2.11, you will need to install TensorFlow in WSL2, or install tensorflow or tensorflow-cpu and, optionally, try the TensorFlow-DirectML-Plugin"
 This is really upsetting! Most of the ML developers I know actually use Windows machines since we develop locally and only switch to Linux for deployment.
 I know WSL is an option, but it (1) can only use 50% RAM (2) doesnt use the native file system.
 I feel very betrayed. After sticking with, and even advocating for Tensorflow when everyone was (and still is) switching to PyTorch, TF dropped me! This is probably the final nail in the coffin for me. I will be switching to PyTorch as soon as I can :-(

 Psychology researchers at Swansea University are carrying out an original study to see whether artificial intelligence is able to generate infant faces between the ages of 0 and 7 years. AI generated pictures will be presented alongside real faces from an existing face database, with a sliding scale underneath that you will use to roughly estimate the age of the child’s face.
 The experiment should only take between 15 and 20 minutes

 What I want from this session is to present different ways of preprocessing the data for a deep learning model. I want to show different types of implementations, how those affect the final trained model, when to use which type of data preprocessing and things similar to this. It would be great if you can suggest me some topic, notebooks or datasets for the same. All the notebooks that show good implementation and affect of data preprocessing are absolutely welcome.
 Also, as this is **Keras** Community Day, I'll have to include more about data preprocessing using Keras and less about other libraries. 
 Also, if you could help me with this: I am confused between showing preprocessing using layers or doing the preprocessing without layers. I know this sounds vague, but if you have any idea about this, let me know.

Fine-tune a LLaMA LLM
 Transcribe videos with Whisper
 Train a custom stable diffusion model

 Someone asked me today "why are LLMs still non deterministic in their output when temperature is set to 0. Assume fixed model between runs on the same machine" 
 I was like WTF are you saying - the randomness in LLM comes from temperature - chat gpt etc.. might have other randomness in the process but we don't have exact info on this. What I know is that in a standard transformers architecture, temperature is the only parameter that can enduce non deterministic behaviour at inference time. 
 He was convinced that there was more to it "i spoke about this to other LLM experts and they also are not sure" 
 I'm like wtf - I start looking up online and do find some people who claim that temperature is not the only thing that influences stochasticity during inference, but I can't find an answer as to what it is exactly. 
 Anyone has a clue of what I am missing here? 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can a single layer neural network solve the XOR problem?
 Most answers say no, but with this one weird trick the answer is yes! And we don't even need a bias! The trick is to multiply the outputs of a single (2,2) linear layer. Here is how:
 class XorSolver(nn.Module): def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs) -> None: super().__init__(*args, **kwargs) self.layer = nn.Linear(2, 2, bias=False) # we don't even need a bias! def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor: z = self.layer.forward(x) y = z[:, 0] * z[:, 1] return y 
 This is the loss and model output after 5000 epochs:
 loss: 6.516383166399464e-08 Input: [[0. 0.] [0. 1.] [1. 0.] [1. 1.]] Model output: [0. 1. 1. 0.] Expected output: [0. 1. 1. 0.] Layer weight: [[-1.248097 1.2202195 ] [-0.80121976 0.81952316]] 
 The full implementation with training and inference - around 50 lines of code - can be found on GitHub.
 Why it works?
 Basically the model simulates a more sophisticated neuron which allows more interactions between the inputs.
 By multiplying the outputs of two neurons, we introduce a form of non-linearity that allows us to separate data that are not linearly separable, like in the XOR problem:
 f(x1, x2, w1, w2, w3, w4) = (x1 * w1 + x2 * w2) * (x1 * w3 + x2 * w4)
  
w1, w2 are learnable parameters of the first neuron
 w3, w4 are learnable parameters of the second neuron
 x1, x2 are inputs to the model

 First the customer, product, then the tech that will add the value the customer needs. 
 What do you think are the top reasons generative AI applications succeed?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://github.com/lowrollr/turbozero
 I've recently been working on TurboZero, a vectorized implementation of AlphaZero where model inference, search (MCTS), and environment simulation all run in parallel on the GPU. I've also implemented a self-contained training/evaluation pipeline, along with a few environments. I've written a wiki and a starter notebook for those who want to dig deeper. 
 This project is similar to DeepMind's mctx, but supports MCTS subtree persistence (unnecessary for MuZero, which is what mctx was mainly built to support), is written with PyTorch rather than JAX, and can also stand on its own and train models end-to-end.
 I hope to continue to expand and improve upon this as time allows, and I hope someone here might find it useful or interesting! 
 This is my first major open-source project of any real substance and I still don't have tons of experience with RL, so any feedback/advice is greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI Chatbots, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, can create incredibly cost-friendly software in record time, reveals a new study.
 To stay on top of the latest advancements in AI, look here first.
 https://preview.redd.it/rxpr6db3aynb1.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&s=721ff5d8f9d25b5e48fa26e2b335c1d20620a83a
 The AI Tech Company Experiment
  
Brown University and several Chinese University researchers put ChatGPT-powered AI bots to the test by making them run a hypothetical software development company, ChatDev.
 The AI chatbots were given specific roles and allocated respective stages based on the traditional waterfall model encompassing designing, coding, testing, and documenting.
 AI 'employees' functioned with minimal human input to complete their parts of the software development process.
  
Impressive Results
  
Assigning 70 tasks to ChatDev led to the completion of the entire software development process in under seven minutes at a cost of less than one dollar on average.
 A stunning 86.66% of the generated software systems performed flawlessly.
 Despite some language model errors and biases, the study demonstrates AI's immense potential in automating tasks - a boon, especially to junior programmers around the world.
  
Broader Implications
  
Powerfully generative AI technologies like ChatGPT can perform specific job functions, saving time, and boosting productivity in several industries.
 While coders find such tools beneficial, it's also critical to note that limitations and biases do exist in AI models which could potentially affect the software creation process.

Obviously I don't want to train the full-sized models and then compare them, thats a waste of money. So I'm thinking of training smaller versions (~100M) and then comparing those instead.
 My question is there some sort of best practice for this? Some smaller multiple of your full model size where it is best to compare? Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, all,
 I'm working on a GPT-powered game where the characters speak using API calls.
 For this, I need an inexpensive vector database that does not require an API, or at least if it does, it leverages the OpenAI API. Also, this vector database must be runnable on consumer-grade gaming hardware with a small search space (let's say 10-50 entries in the DB).
 Also, I need to package it with the game somehow. My game is in the Godot engine which can use Python with a plug-in. Other approaches I was considering is having a second process communicate with the game through a socket. Ideally the vector DB solution would be easy to install - that is, I could package it with a .exe, and simply run both without the player having to download anything else.
 Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I'm currently tasked with something at my company that I'm facing some difficulty with because it's not in my domain. My company has a service where we provide video chatting to users and match users with others based on various features.
 Currently I've implemented a simple model where we have separate embedding matrices for each user feature, create a user representation by aggregating these features, and performing regression between two users. The way that regression works is that the final score output from the model would act as a "matching score" and we'll match user A with the highest other user.
 The problem is that obviously running inference on every single pair of users is very slow and I need to speed this up.
 Some methods I thought about were to either use a feature store or perform sampling on users so we're not running inference on the entire users, but I'm not sure if this is optimal.
 Just curious what other people who have tackled problems like these have done and looking for second opinions. Thanks.

Routing in Google Maps remains one of our most helpful and frequently used features. Determining the best route from A to B requires making complex trade-offs between factors including the estimated time of arrival (ETA), tolls, directness, surface conditions (e.g., paved, unpaved roads), and user preferences, which vary across transportation mode and local geography. Often, the most natural visibility we have into travelers' preferences is by analyzing real-world travel patterns.



Learning preferences from observed sequential decision making behavior is a classic application of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Given a Markov decision process (MDP) — a formalization of the road network — and a set of demonstration traject…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I've been working on an AI data marketplace platform for a few months now. Users can buy, sell, request, and subscribe to data/datasets (and soon even train their ML/AI models using other users' datasets). One of our key features is the request feature, which allows users to submit data requests for free. These requests include descriptions, required fields, geographical scope, budget etc... Once a request is posted, it's sent to numerous companies, organizations, and data vendors that have the potential to fulfill it.
 I understand how frustrating the data acquisition process can be, so I designed this platform to be your one-stop shop for all data-related transactions. You no longer have to spend weeks or months dealing with different vendors and companies through slow emails. With our platform, you can request, negotiate, and purchase data all in one place, and it's completely free to post a request, by the way.
 We've already achieved some successes, and we hope to help more people access the datasets they need. After all, the best AI models are built on diverse and differentiating data. We've had some notable achievements, and we're eager to see if we can fulfill even more interesting dataset requests!

I also would like to remember in this that all foundation models could be improved if there would be no tokenizers: https://x.com/karpathy/status/1657949234535211009?s=20

 Abstract:
  
With their recent development, large language models (LLMs) have been found to exhibit a certain level of Theory of Mind (ToM), a complex cognitive capacity that is related to our conscious mind and that allows us to infer another's beliefs and perspective. While human ToM capabilities are believed to derive from the neural activity of a broadly interconnected brain network, including that of dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) neurons, the precise processes underlying LLM's capacity for ToM or their similarities with that of humans remains largely unknown. In this study, we drew inspiration from the dmPFC neurons subserving human ToM and employed a similar methodology to examine whether LLMs exhibit comparable characteristics. Surp…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I'm trying to create an alignment between source audio in a different language than the translated transcript. Essentially want to align the translated transcript with the word-level timestamps on an Audio, programmatically. I've tried to find different tools; some open-source ML models force alignment if the source audio and transcript language are the same. 
 My goal is to have audio in a dubbed language, which I generate using a translated transcript that has been originally transcribed from my audio. Alignment seems tough since languages are spoken at different rates, so I'm figuring out the best way to optimize alignment without having to speed up/slow down the audio too much for each sentence.

 The TTS quality is similar to Elevenlabs, and there are some sample clips on the home page.
 Stuff I'm working on:
 - Emotional speech (where you can select the emotion of the TTS). Right now you can already do it by putting the emotion in brackets: e.g. "[Angrily] Please go away!" but I want to make it better.
 - Music with vocals. Currently the model only generates instrumental music. I am retraining it/tweaking the model to allow for music with lyrics.
 - Faster Inference: Since I'm doing this all myself and I'm not rich, I don't have access to the best hardware. However, I am working on some optimizations like speculative decoding that should speed things up.
 Anyways, let me know if you have any questions/comments/feature suggestions/see any bugs! Feel free to DM me. Thanks.

 Our project (Kani) is a super lightweight and hackable alternative to frameworks like LangChain or simpleAIchat meant to help developers hook in callable functions or tools to chat models easily. With Kani, devs can write functions in pure python and just add one line (the @ai_function() decorator) to turn any function into an AI-callable function!
 Kani works with any model and has built-in tools for OpenAI, HuggingFace, LLaMAv2, Vicuna, and GGML with more to come. Kani also never does any prompt engineering under the hood and doesn't require learning complex library tools---all defaults are minimal and highly customizable.
 Check out our Colab for mini-examples of things like retrieval, web-search, model routing, etc. https://colab.research.google.com/github/zhudotexe/kani/blob/main/examples/colab_examples.ipynb

The financial institution believes Dojo’s applications will go beyond Tesla's Full-Self Driving (FSD) capabilities.
 To stay on top of the latest advancements in AI, look here first.

 Morgan Stanley's Bullish Prediction on Dojo
  
Morgan Stanley has suggested that Dojo might not just enhance Tesla's FSD technology, but could find use in other devices that make real-time decisions based on a visual field.
 Apart from raising Tesla’s valuation, this could potentially open up new markets for the company.
 Following this, Morgan Stanley has increased its target price for Tesla shares from $250 to $400 each.
  
Dojo Supercomputer Overview
  
Tesla has developed Dojo in-house, diverging from conventional AI accelerators and involving its own computing, networking, IO, and instruction set.
 At the heart of Dojo is the D1 AI accelerator processor, containing 354 custom CPU cores. Twenty-five D1 chips are combined to create a Dojo training tile, which could expedite Tesla’s move towards earning revenue from vehicle software.
  
Future Plans and Implications
  
Tesla could potentially become an AI-as-a-service provider to automakers in need of FSD capabilities with Dojo.
 As the development of Dojo continues, Tesla has invested in alternative AI infrastructures, including a cluster of 10,000 of Nvidia's most potent H100 accelerators.

What is the core diference between what the methods do and the backends? What are some core diferences between the backends? What is the main distinction between GPTQ and NF4? How does NF4 relate to QLoRa, is it the same or is it just a small part of QLoRa?
 Thanks in advance and i apologize for any ignorance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, everyone,
 I'm currently working on a computer vision project using the Oxford Pets Dataset, which consists of 37 different pet categories. I initially used a pre-trained ViT model with ImageNet weights model=vit_b_32(ViT_B_32_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V1), and it gave me an impressive accuracy of 88%. However, I want to modify the architecture of the ViT model and train it from scratch without relying on ImageNet weights.
 I'm aware that ViT models are data-hungry and that training from scratch (model=vit_b_32( )) can be challenging, especially with limited data. I've already applied data augmentation techniques to enhance my dataset, but I'm still struggling to achieve satisfactory results. My accuracy is currently only 7%.
 I'd appreciate any advice or tips from the community on how I can improve the performance of my scratch-trained ViT model. Are there any specific training strategies, hyperparameters, or architectural modifications that I should consider? How can I make the most out of my limited dataset to boost accuracy?
 Thank you in advance for your help!

For example: A user speak English in an Indian accent should have that accent cloned in the output audio as well. By default, tortoise is not good at doing that. It can clone the pitch of the voice really well but the accent is completely lost. I was wondering if fine tuning the model could get me what I want. Please do suggest. Also do suggest any methods on fine tuning it if it does in fact help my use case. Thanks a lot!
 Note: I've also tried bark, coqui and vall-e-x. They aren't that good for voice cloning from what I saw.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Somewhere in the world there's a person who is the smartest. Why stop there? There are ten people who are the smartest. And if they are on the Internet, AI will find them.
 Perhaps not yet. It probably needs to get smarter. Maybe by Gemini. Or GPT-5. But eventually an AI will analyze all of the content on the Internet, and determine from that data who are the ten most intelligent people on the planet, (whose material is online).
 Of course if AI can determine the top ten, it can certainly determine the top 100, and the top 1,000, and even the top 100,000. I suppose when that happens there will be a lot more human brain power available to solve our problems. Although by then AI will be solving them far better than we could, haha. 
 But think about it for a minute. There are very smart people out there who don't publish in traditional mass media channels. The geniuses among us who don't fit in so well, and are therefore resigned to the margins, remaining unrecognized. 
 Wouldn't it be great if AI discovered them, and gave them the validation they deserve? Wouldn't it be great to find out who they are so that they can better work on whatever.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been working on a simple ML classifier that predicts the size of a piece of clothing based in user body specifications (such as height, weight, age, etc). As we want to move the model to production, I’m keen on understanding the best strategies to evaluate its performance in a real-world setting.
 This is a small example of how we would “tag” our recommendations:
  
If the model predicts a size M, and the user buys and keeps it, it’s a correct prediction
 If the user buys and M and returns it due to size issues, it’s incorrect
 If the user buys a different size, returns it, and then buys the size initially recommended, it’s counted as correct.
  
Additionally since we cache user input data, when they visit the same product after a while, or if they visit different product pages, they don’t need to re-input. We need to determine if they looked at this recommendation or if they even took it into account, especially if some time has passed since the original recommendation was made.
 Main questions I have: 1. What scenarios might I be missing when tagging incorrect/correct predictions 2. How would you approach the data tagging issue in this context? 3. What would be the best strategy to determine if a recommendation was considered by the user or if it’s too old to be reliable?
 I’ve gotten some insights already but would love to hear more perspectives. Any feedback, experiences, or even related research would be much appreciated!

So this was my prompt:
  
Write 5 sentences that all end with the word 'apple'.
  
It was identical in all models. I only did this exactly once for each one. Here’s the results I got of how many of the 5 sentences ended in “apple”. I let “apples” count as an ending as well even though technically that is a fail. 
 Google palm: 0/5
 Falcon 180B: 0/5
 Bard: 1/5

 Gpt 3.5: 2/5
 Llama2 70b: 4/5
 GPT 4: 5/5

More generally, phi-1.5 (1.3B) exhibits many of the traits of much larger LLMs, both good – such as the ability to "think step by step" or perform some rudimentary in-context learning – and bad, including hallucinations and the potential for toxic and biased generations – encouragingly though, we are seeing improvement on that front thanks to the absence of web data. We open-source phi-1.5 to promote further research on these urgent topics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI, with its vast resource needs, is raising concerns over sustainability and environmental impact. Last year, Microsoft's data centers drained over 2,500 Olympic-sized swimming pools worth of water, reflecting a 34% increase from the previous year. Google also reported a 20% water consumption increase over the same period.
 To stay on top of the latest advancements in AI, look here first.

 A deeper look at AI's water footprint
  
The growth of AI and related technologies increases the need for vast server farms, which depend heavily on water for cooling purposes.
 The spike in water usage can be attributed primarily to AI, as per Shaolei Ren, a researcher at the UC, Riverside, who focuses on AI's environmental impact.
 For every 5 to 50 prompts submitted to ChatGPT, it consumes about 500 ml of water, according to an upcoming paper from Professor Ren's team.
  
Big Tech and Responsible Water Usage
  
Recognizing their significant water consumption, tech companies like Google have voiced concerns and are exploring ways to mitigate the negative effects.
 Google has committed to responsible water usage, which includes assessing where and how their water usage might affect surrounding areas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 "Hallucinations" seem to be one of the major blockers to the adoption of LLMs, especially in enterprise settings where seemingly plausible but false information/decisions can be disastrous.
 I am wondering whether or not current LLMs, like GPT4 or Llama 2 70b have reached the reasoning capabilities to be able not to hallucinate when fed the proper information.
 One can see a LLMs as college / high school students that have some basic reasoning and knowledge but might need to be nudged to answer business / scientific questions.
 What is your opinion on the topic? Is there for instance, a database of hallucinations, so that one could test that if the model would have answered properly if the right context was fed in the prompt?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've consulted all the AIs and all of the search engines I could think of and am still coming up short. 
 I'm pretty sure I just didn't make this up, somewhere between 2005 and 2015 there was a paper where the authors describe a method for using silicon neuron forests to predict traffic patterns. 
 They etched silicon columns onto a wafer and then submerged the wafer in an ionic solution. They sent electrical signals into the column array and recorded the output. As the signal was allowed to interact with the silicon in solution, the columns would begin to form small conductive tendrils or filaments to neighboring pillars. These filaments formed a neural network, which could be used to predict traffic patterns.
 I'm sure there were at least 2 papers that came out about this subject, but for the life of me I cannot find them. I've spent many many hours looking for at least one of the papers and am hoping for a longshot...that some kind internet stranger comes across this and can point me in the right direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Please let me know if there is a better sub for this!
 I trained a local voice model of my father, who recently passed away. He was a musician, and I found a handful of songs he had recorded in the 80's. Unfortunately but I only have a copy coming from an audio cassette, which I've digitized. There may be a copy on open reel somewhere in our basement but I haven't found it so far.
 Any, because dad was always writing and recording new songs, my training dataset consists of all original, high quality vocal stems at 96khz/24bit, spanning at least 20 years and consisting of about 30 ish minutes of audio. I also tried starting over but with a speech he gave as additional training, coming out to around 55 minutes of audio.
 I wanted to use his voice model to essentially remaster his original vocals from the cassette audio, and rerecord the rest of the instruments myself. I isolated the vocals using UVR (also tried mdx23), and tried to clean it up further as much as possible.
 The RVC vocals comes out alright, but due to the low quality of the audio, it seems to mess up certain words, for example "free" comes out as "fee". The SVC vocals came out with a closer tonality, but had many more artifacts, and pitch had a tendency to go up/down 2 octaves at the end of certain phrases.
 When using a higher quality sample (like one of my own vocal tracks), these issues aren't so prevalent, although rvc seems to create more of a hybrid sounding timbre than svc, blending the original voice + model rather than just the sound of the model.
 Happy to post samples of input/output audio, let me know!
 tl;dr
 high quality training data, low quality inference audio. Voice model is the same voice as input audio,
 1. tips for making the best of what I've got?
 2. any way to use text along with input audio and maintain original vibrato?
 3. any way to train a UVR/MDX model using a particular voice in order to better isolate that person?
 thanks :)

 Abstract: 
  
Recent efforts have incorporated large language models (LLMs) with external resources (e.g., the Internet) or internal control flows (e.g., prompt chaining) for tasks requiring grounding or reasoning. However, these efforts have largely been piecemeal, lacking a systematic framework for constructing a fully-fledged language agent. To address this challenge, we draw on the rich history of agent design in symbolic artificial intelligence to develop a blueprint for a new wave of cognitive language agents. We first show that LLMs have many of the same properties as production systems, and recent efforts to improve their grounding or reasoning mirror the development of cognitive architectures built around production systems. We then propose Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents (CoALA), a conceptual framework to systematize diverse methods for LLM-based reasoning, grounding, learning, and decision making as instantiations of language agents in the framework. Finally, we use the CoALA framework to highlight gaps and propose actionable directions toward more capable language agents in the future.

But I really want something that can chomp down a whole book and distill its essence without making "summaries of summaries", which tend to increase inaccuracy and errors. A good summary is concise and precise, and I want flexibility with bullet points and level of detail.
 Having issues with ChatGPT-based tools' token limits, and some that purport to support GPT4 (I could use that "advanced reasoning") but but have to fall back to GPT3 for various errors and reasons. So I'm open to Claude-based ones (may be too early, mo' tokens) and other proprietary engines.

 to an excel file.
 Here is my main code:
 gymnasium.env = snakeEnv() # data_manager = snakeEnv.get_data_manager() # Create an A2C model model = A2C("MlpPolicy", gymnasium.env, verbose=1, device="cuda") # Train the model (replace 'total_timesteps' with appropriate values) model.learn(total_timesteps=100_000, log_interval=1000) 
 Here is the relevant code in my agent file:
 class snakeEnv(gym.Env): def __init__(self): super(snakeEnv, self).__init__() # Define action and observation space # They must be gym.spaces objects # Example when using discrete actions: self.initNames() self.action_space = spaces.Discrete(3) self.gameCount = 0 self.record = 0 self.reward = 0 self.score = 0 self.game = SnakeGameAI(self.selectedChallenge) self.observation_space = spaces.Box(low=-1000, high=1000, shape=(11,), dtype=np.uint8) def step(self, action): self.reward, self.done, self.score = self.game.play_step(action) self.observation = self.getState(self.game) self.info = {} return self.observation, self.reward, self.done, self.info def reset(self): self.gameCount += 1 self.data_manager.logData(self.gameCount, self.score, self.record, self.reward, self.game.getDeathReason(),self.game.getHeadPos()) self.game.reset() observation = self.getState(self.game) if self.score > self.record: self.record = self.score return observation 
 It would be nice to be able to log the data in the reset function. I know how work with xslx files, the main things is just being able to get the model data.

 Explanation:
 An AI-driven compliance system ensuring adherence to evolving regulations, minimizing risks, and enabling businesses to operate confidently within legal boundaries. Pairing Large Language Models (LLMs) with blockchain technology to offer a range of benefits, particularly in the context of regulatory compliance.
 LLMs, powered by advanced natural language processing and machine learning capabilities, can enhance regulatory compliance processes in several ways. Firstly, they can automate the analysis of regulatory documents, helping businesses stay updated with evolving compliance requirements. LLMs can also assist in generating compliance reports, simplifying complex legal language into
 understandable summaries. Furthermore, by integrating LLMs into smart contracts, businesses
 can ensure that contract terms adhere to regulatory guidelines automatically.
 The integration of LLMs with blockchain can significantly improve regulatory compliance by automating document analysis, simplifying legal language, monitoring compliance in real-time, and enhancing customer interactions—all contributing to greater efficiency and accuracy in adhering to
 regulatory standards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone!
 I want to develop a DRL agent to play a turn-based 1v1 game and I'm starting to plan how to handle things in the future.
 One potential problem that I thought of is that there is a possible mid turn one-sided decision. An abstraction of the game would be like:
 There are two players: player A and player B. At the start of each turn, each player chooses an action between 3 possible actions. If player A chose a specific action (let's say action 1), the game asks player B to make a decision (let's say block or not block) and vice versa. Actions are calculated. Next turn starts.
 What would be a good approach to handle that? I thought of two possible solutions: 1. Anticipate the possibility of that mid turn decision beforehand adding a new dimension to the actions space (e.g. take action 3; if opponent takes action 1, block). That sounds that it could create credit assignment problems e.g. giving credit to the second action when it actually didn't happen. 2. Make two policies with shared value functions. That sounds complicated and I saw that previous works like DeepNash actually did that, but I don't know what problems could arise from that.
 Opinions/suggestions? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently trying to learn about how autodiff is used in gradient calculations. In the all sources I've came across, none can explicitly point to an authoritative, consistent or complete source on autodiff. I don't need examples of autodiff, I just need the full, generalized algorithm laid out.
 For example:
 I open this link: https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/spragunr/CS445/lectures/autodiff/autodiff.pdf which simply provides autodiff applied on an example, but not the description of the algorithm.
 The author of that link says if I need any more info, I should go to this other link: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/224140/step-by-step-example-of-reverse-mode-automatic-differentiation/235758#235758
 But this link doesn't even have topological sort as part of the operation. Therefore these descriptions of the autodiff is inconsistent and leaves me not knowing who to trust.
 Can someone point to some original paper on autodiff or a single source that describes this algorithm fully?
 I note here that this situation is completely different from backpropagation. The full backpropagation algorithm is impeccably laid out in peer-reviewed text books such as Learning from Data by Mustafa et al. and Optimization textbook by Chong and Zak. Furthermore, the algorithm defined in these two books are completely consistent with one another.

 Researchers at MIT and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute have developed an innovative AI-powered model called OncoNPC, designed to assist in identifying the origin of tumors in cancer patients where the primary site is unknown. For a small percentage of cancer patients, pinpointing the origin of their cancer can be incredibly challenging, making it difficult to select the most appropriate treatment, as many cancer drugs are designed for specific cancer types.
 Using machine learning, the researchers created OncoNPC, a computational model capable of analyzing the genetic sequences of approximately 400 genes. This model, based on genetic data routinely collected at Dana-Farbe…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I need to segment some short strings, they are about 100 tokens in length (BERT tokens), or 20-40 words. 1 segment per text.
 I'm currently using Spacy first, and if it fails, then use BERT. It's alright, but BERT is not really up to par to what I hope for. I'm wondering if there is some better use, as this is my first NLP project. I've trained the huggingface BertForTokenClassification to label the text as either part of segment, or not part. So binary token classification, then smooth out outliers and pick the longest segment of each text. Each string has only 1 segment.
 I've trained the BERT with 500 examples. I can easily make more train data, though training on my laptop takes time. If there are better/alternative approaches, I'd love to hear them. Regex rules etc. don't apply, which is why I'm using DL models. Especially I feel like I should segment the whole segment at a time, not by token.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to take a second to express my appreciation for the Folktables datasets!
 Folktables is a Python package that contains datasets derived from US Census data. The datasets cover topics about income, employment, health, transportation, and housing. They are quite useful for studying the effects of distribution shifts on ML models.
 For example, one could design experiments to:
 1. Study the model's performance under geographic distribution shifts:
 Each prediction problem in Folktables can be instantiated with data from every US state. So one could use Folktables to study questions around geographic distribution shifts. For example, we can train a classifier using data from California and then evaluate it on data from Michigan.
 2. Study the model's performance under temporal distribution shifts.
 Folktables contains data for several years, which in itself constitutes a form of temporal distribution shift. So, we can train a classifier using employment data from California in 2014 and evaluate how its equality of opportunity violation or accuracy varies over time.
 Finding non-synthetic (and open-access) datasets that exhibit these behaviors is so hard! Yet, it's quite easy to encounter them in production environments. 🫠
 So, big kudos to the UC Berkeley and Toyota Research Institute research teams for crafting these datasets.

 I read a book "Small unmanned aircraft: theory and practice" and watched few videos on YouTube that are reffering to this particular book. But there is a thing in correction step that I do not fully understand. To be clear, the correction looks as follows: x = x_(t-1) + K*(z - h(x))
 Both in the book and in videos, the state vector "x" is [roll, pitch]. But "z" and "h(x)" are the actual and predicted accelerometer readings [ax, ay, az]. So it looks to me, that they try to correct prediction of angles with readings in acceleration: [roll, pitch] = [roll, pitch]_(t-1) + K*[ax, ay, az].
 What am I missing?

 I wrote CNN using tensor flow to predict phenotypes (cognitive impairment (0/1) and language ability (0-3)) from .vcf files.
 I transformed the .vcf into tabular format and after determining which columns to keep, I have
 Chromosome Position Mutation (taken from ref/alt columns) Genotype
 And merged it with the phenotype data so basically every row has the cog and language scores.
 I feel like this is a bad way to go about doing this since the model is likely predicting cog/language scores for each mutation rather than each patient as a whole. Am I wrong? How can I fix this so it’s more of a composite of all mutations per subject that the model trains on?
 Thanks!

 Meta’s vision for its new AI model
  
Meta's aim is to create a powerful chatbot in line with OpenAI’s GPT-4 capabilities.
 The company has reportedly been in pursuit of Nvidia H100 AI-training chips and is amplifying its infrastructure.
 The idea is to independently train its new model without outsourcing to platforms like Microsoft's Azure.
  
Efforts and roadblocks
  
Meta plans to begin the training of this LLM early in 2024, emphasizing free access for companies.
 Despite its grand vision, Meta has encountered obstacles like researcher attrition and contentious resource allocation amidst multiple LLM projects.
 Noteworthy is the intense competition from major players such as Apple, Google, and Amazon to integrate widely generative AI in their user interface.
  
Broader implications
  
While OpenAI has not immediately revealed plans for a GPT-5, other tech giants are investing heavily. Apple's investment in its "Ajax" AI model signifies the increasing race to advanced AI.
 This move by Meta represents the ongoing trend of tech conglomerates expanding in the AI space, a fact revealed through Google and Microsoft’s use of AI in their productivity tools and Amazon's ongoing developments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work with device logs that are massive text files, filled with data that's hard to go through manually. I'm primarily interested in extracting specific events or insights, such as security incidents or device malfunctions. The conventional method would be to use regular expressions to filter out relevant information since the logs are structured, but I'm curious about leveraging Large Language Models for this task.
 I've experimented a bit with zero-shot learning for text summarization but didn't get satisfactory results. Before I invest more time into fine-tuning an LLM, I'd love to hear from anyone who has experience or advice on how to approach this problem.
 Could LLMs potentially make the process more efficient and effective? Any pointers or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Reddit,
 I'm working on a tool to pull data from highly irregular Excel files. I've gotten reasonable results which is extremely fast with standard Python coding, but it's far from perfect due to the lack of standardized templates. 
 Interestingly, when I tested ChatGPT-4 on a sample table, it did a decent job at data extraction. However, relying solely on GPT-4 has its downsides like token limits and slow processing speed (and data privacy issues). Plus, splitting the Excel sheet to fit within these limits results in loss of context and data.
 I'm considering fine-tuning a language model to post-process data that was in a Pandas DataFrame (perhaps converted to JSON). Has anyone had success with this approach or have alternative recommendations? I've tried Langchain, but it wasn't helpful.
 I have figured out to extract the relevant columns, but the post-processing part is where I am considering using an LLM which understands the domain and what needs to be extracted based on the examples I feed it.
 Looking forward to your thoughts! And would be happy to answer any additional questions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Tensorflow since 2017. I know it wasn't ideal or easy back then, but as an early adopter, I became very proficient with it and it has improved a lot since then. I have developed and deployed many custom models in low-level TF, both with and without utilizing the Keras abstractions. I am very comfortable with it in general.
 But I'm noticing now that Pytorch is gaining more popularity, all the younger practitioners, who got into deep learning within the last 3-5 years, are Pytorch adopters. I've also heard rumors that even googlers are also abandoning TF.
 I started playing around with Pytorch and as a TF expert, I couldn't help but getting annoyed at how far it is lagging behind in many abstractions and optimizations. I know things are getting better now with the Pytorch 2.0 and introducing some optimization such as the "compile" functionality, but still many of the pytorch project tools remain in beta such as Torchtext and I find many things very annoying, such as having to set the device and pass it on to layers if you want GPU acceleration, having to install Torchtext and other processing libraries separately, or having to use a Dataloader and the limited data type supports for torchdataset.
 Most people who have not mastered Tensorflow would not relate to my annoyance. Anyhow I'd really prefer to stay within my comfort zone and continue to develop and improve in TF, but if TF is dying, then I better not to, right? So should I convert? Is it indeed dying?

 HF accelerate seems quite popular nowadays and looks nice. However, in the past I've invested in learning things like Pytorch-Lightning which look good in a minimal example, but actually add more annoyance than they're worth.
 Pytorch also can do these things, and the boiler plate doesn't look worse at a glance:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm an undergrad student working on a machine learning project about motor imagery classification for BCI. One requirement for the project is that I need to implement LIME an explainable AI tool on my model. I ran into a problem rather quickly as my model accuracy quickly decreases as I try and add more subjects to the training data, I'm the publicly avaliable EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset from physio.net. The features I'm currently using for training my model are SVD entropy, Spectral Entropy, Hjorth mobility , Hjorth complexity and CSP components after applying overlapping filter bank.
 One method I've been suggested is to train models seperately for each subject, I don't know how to go about this should I construct a new model for each subject or should I keep the architecture but reset the training weight, also would this defeat the purpose of implementing LIME in the first place.
 I'm wondering if there's a way to deal with inter-subject variability without having to make/ train models for each subject seperately.
 I'm sorry if the choice of features doesn't make much sense since I'm basically self-taught and I have no prior knowledge about EEG or BCI
 TLDR; how do I deal with inter-subject variability without having to make/ train models for each subject seperately.

 I have developed a library, called 100gecs, that makes hyperparameter tuning on LightGBM and CatBoost models trivially easy.
 Background
 LightGBM and CatBoost are gradient boosted tree models, like XGBoost, and in many cases the best baseline model in supervised learning tasks on tabular data. They work by iteratively fitting trees on data, with each subsequent tree "correcting" on some level the prediction of the prior tree. Here's a good intro, if you want some more background on these methods.
 Hyperparameter tuning promises an optimally or near-optimally configured model, thus enabling you to get the best baseline model you possibly can.
 Summary
 100gecs provides custom child classes of LGBMClassifier, LGBMRegressor, CatBoostRegressor and CatBoostClassifier that can be …]]></summary>

 Looking at job postings, at least in Europe, it looks like the minimum required experience is around 3 years. There seems to be a good demand for mid-senior level positions, but a void for entry level. As I understand it, most DS departments are not big enough to spare resources for newbies that must be trained, the need is for a few but seasoned engineers. How far is my guess from the truth? 
 And, most importantly, how could new candidates (let's say recent MSc in Data Science, for instance) get into the industry? Through analyst/DE roles?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm attempting to address an issue related to electricity trading in the day-ahead market. The objective is to submit 24 bids for each hour. Each bid is represented as a vector of length 10, with 5 values indicating the price and the other 5 indicating the quantity of electricity. For instance, given a sample action vector [w, x, y, z, ...], it operates as follows: if the price is greater than w, buy/sell x units of electricity, if the price is greater than y, buy/sell z units of electricity, and so forth. I possess three years' worth of data, including crucial features like weather conditions, coal prices, wind speed, net load, forecasted load, locational marginal price, and more.
 Initially, I trained a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to tackle this problem, and it's performing quite well. However, the DQN provides a scalar action for each hour, neglecting price points. It acts regardless of the price. I'm aware that I can explore solutions like Proximal Policy Gradient to generate a vector action that includes both electricity unit amounts and prices.
 I have three questions:
  
Is it possible to solve this problem using Dynamic Programming techniques? While I understand it's not an exceedingly difficult problem, can I expect some results if I attempt to apply DP?
 
How challenging might it be to output a vector instead of a scalar, with the vector being monotonically increasing? What's the recommended approach for a problem of this nature? Is it worthwhile to explore RL and specifically Proximal Policy Optimization?
 
How would you approach such a problem while keeping it simple and avoiding unnecessary complexity? 
 
 Any guidance or insights would be greatly appreciated.

 They'll put in 10s or 100s of hours reinforcing the level. It'll play over and over again, selecting for what works, and dropping what doesn't. And over time, the AI will be amazing at that level.
 But, if you take that reinforced data, and move to level 2 of that game... it'll be practically useless.

Cloud Technology: It seems stable and beginner-friendly. I'm leaning here primarily because I've heard cybersecurity is saturated.
 Cybersecurity: Interested but cautious due to market saturation.
 Generative AI/Data: My true passion lies here, but I've gathered that projects matter more than certifications for entry-level roles in this niche, especially for someone without a degree.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, I'm Raynel, working on a CRM platform and actively considering the future integration of AI. One idea I'm particularly excited about is anticipatory customer support. The goal is to proactively address customer needs, perhaps even before they realize them, using ML-driven insights.
 Has anyone delved into this concept or tried implementing it? I'd love to hear thoughts, potential pitfalls, or even success stories. Thanks in advance for your insights!

I know that ML folks use statistics all the time, but I am often under the impression that it's mostly the basics. I understand that inference and prediction are inherently different, but I would assume the common knowledge will be much more vast.
 What is your perspective on that? Am I just missing the point? Is there room for improvement in the future? Do you think statistics literacy (advanced, not ANOVA or so) is common among ML practitioners?

 My Context:
 I have experience setting up linux systems, building computers by myself and training DL models (CNNs/GNNs/LLMs) in a corporate setting. I am venturing to the academic world where resources are more constrained and so I am wondering if there are any guides, tips on setting up a research computer lab that does AI. I do not expect to train from scratch an LLM but maybe finetuning an small LLM. I might also need to do a lot parallelizable IO work to preprocess data. I will talk with the IT department of the university but would like to have some ideas before that conversation.
 I would appreciate any tips or thoughts, particularly on:
 * How many GPUs/CPUs to buy? Balancing cost/compute.
 * Recommended software for managing resources.
 * Running 100s-1ks of CPU jobs in parallel.
 * Local compute cluster vs buying compute online.
 * Hyperparameter optimization and logging of metrics.
 * Anything else you can think of?

 Hi everyone, just wanted to share a dataset I've been working on for use in a personal project!
 GoodWiki is a 179 million token dataset of English Wikipedia articles collected on September 4, 2023, that have been marked as Good or Featured by Wikipedia editors. The dataset provides these articles in GitHub-flavored Markdown format, preserving layout features like lists, code blocks, math, and block quotes, unlike many other public Wikipedia datasets. Articles are accompanied by a short description of the page as well as any associated categories.
 Thanks to a careful conversion process from wikicode, the markup language used by Wikipedia, articles in GoodWiki are generally faithful reproductions of the corresponding original Wikipedia pages, minus references, files, infoboxes, and tables. Curated template transclusion and HTML tag handling have minimized instances where entire words and phrases are missing mid-sentence like in other public Wikipedia datasets.
 GoodWiki is more than 1.5 times larger (when compared using the same tokenizer) than the widely used WikiText-103 dataset by Merity et al., even after excluding article descriptions. Also limited to articles marked as Good or Featured, WikiText inspired GoodWiki.

Microsoft-backed OpenAI needed a lot of water to cool its powerful supercomputer as it taught its AI systems how to mimic human writing.
 
Leading tech developers like Microsoft, OpenAI, and Google have acknowledged the high costs associated with the growing demand for AI tools, including expensive semiconductors and increased water consumption.
 
Microsoft disclosed a 34% spike in global water consumption, largely attributed to its AI research.
 
A researcher estimates that ChatGPT uses 500 milliliters of water for every series of prompts or questions.

That being said, during deployment it is currently predicting 0 for all inputs regardless of how varied the inputs may be. However, during the testing phase my model had a varied accuracy rate of 75%-85%. I'm beginning to think that it is very likely that during the testing phase the model was predicting 0 for everything and just getting these higher accuracy rates because of the dominance of non-MVPs within my dataset. This all being said, I'm a noob to ML and decided it'd be best to come on here for help. Is that the likely reason and if so how do I go about fixing it? Furthermore, what other issues could cause this and how would I go about fixing it?

 2) Multiple robots tasked with a search and rescue like mission in a particular area. 
 Both are basically applications of n agents trying to collectively cover a region. 
 Can someone recommend some frameworks and libraries that can allow me to simulate these ideas? Also, I'd love to hear some other ideas as well which use multi-agent RL for robotic applications. For now I'm only targeting a simulation based project. If I get time later I'd love to implement them on hardware as well. Thanks in advance!

This makes it significantly faster and more reliable than other architectures, which is important for online or interactive applications. For lack of a better term, I'm referring to this as Unified Retrieval Augmented Generation (URAG).
 The closest I can find to this in the literature is TABR which utilizes recall to improve the performance of LLMs relative to tree based models, although this particular application of Retrieval is extremely computationally expensive for a slight performance improvement, unlike RAG for LLMs that seems to provide significant new capabilities to the model.
 Is there more research going on for what I'd refer to as URAG systems? We're building open source Python & JS SDKs to make the underlying SQL API more accessible, but I'm wondering if this community, or the academic community has already done more work in this area that we should be aware of.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Based on a bit of research and a lot of gut feeling, I offer the following speculation:
  
if you self-trained an LLM with a Python interpreter or Java compiler in a feedback loop where it learned from its own mistakes then it could become dramatically better at coding. It's actually a miracle that they are "decent" at coding despite getting virtually no feedback from an interpreter or compiler.
 one could train not merely on input and output, but also on an execution trace so the LLM learned HOW the interpreter got the result
 one could also train the model on how to install and invoke open source software and thus it would learn about a variety of languages, versions and runtimes
 this might also improve its logical reasoning skills in general
  
Admittedly, running programs is a lot more expensive than doing simple next-word prediction on pre-existing texts.
 But on the other hand, a corpus of a million program executions can also be used to train future LLMs. You can keep the execution information forever and re-use it as traditional next-token prediction input.

The first character that I launched yesterday is your typical valley girl - Alix - who hangs around tech and crypto people. She browses Twitter all day and writes tweets with her opinion of the stuff she comes by. With a unique mood generated for her every day, it's always a gamble to see who lands on her good or bad side.
 I would really appreciate it if you check her out and let me know what you think! I'm interested in further developing the project and making these synthetic entities equivalent to real people in entertaiment and companionship.

 For ongoing research I'm defining a decision problem in the form of an MDP. In a simple form, this MDP can be solved via Dynamic Programming. Of course I would like to scale up my MDP by including a sensor simulation, which renders the MDP to such a complexity that my next step is to use a DQN.
 My challenge is that I'm not sure how to represent my more complex MDP in a fitting DQN. Quite frankly, the more I look into DQN's, the more I wonder if my MDP is correctly defined. It would be great to hear your views and suggestions if you like to share.
 Definition of the MDP
 The MDP aims at detecting and chasing away a mosquito. For each distance step (discrete distances although it should be continuous), for instance Si, we cycle through an episode: we detect the mosquito…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Article | Notebook | GitHub
 There are a rapidly growing number of options in the vector database space. One of the more recent developments is the creation of new vector index plugins for traditional database systems such as pgvector. This is reminiscent of the discussion back in the mid 2010s on whether one should use full text search in the database or sync with an external system such as Elasticsearch.
 Just as with full text search, it will be tough for vector indexing in the database to compete with the more dedicated solutions past the simple use cases. For example, according the ANN-Benchmarks, the dedicated vector solutions score much higher.
 The desire to reduce stack complexity and the maturity of systems like Postgres make strong arguments to try to find a way to do it all in the database.
 The referenced article above proposes a way to integrate existing databases like PostgreSQL with vector indexes such as Faiss, Hnswlib, external vector databases and even keyword indexes like Elasticsearch. This opens up the possibility of combining Postgres features such as fine-grained access control with the performance of a dedicated vector index.

This narrative overlooks the responsibility of lawmakers and their regulatory inertia.
 
The media frames AI regulation as a matter of technical knowledge rather than moral consideration.
 
The New York Times highlights the slow congressional response to new technologies and the potential influence of lawmakers' financial interests in AI companies.
 
The media fails to question why lawmakers, who have profited from AI, cannot apply their knowledge to regulate it.
 
This lack of critical information in news sources defends the inaction of lawmakers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working on clustering groups of almost identical (but time shifted) signals together. These clusters will have varying sizes, and I don´t know what the final number of clusters will be. The database consists of up to 100 thousand signals (represented by 4000 long vectors as read from individual text files) which are already quite similar to each other. 
 Ideally I would just make a huge cross-correlation matrix but that is too computationally expensive. So is DTW. What I have done is to apply the fast fourier transform to get it into the frequency domain and therefore get rid of that time shift. Then I would apply a clustering algorithm. I have tried DBSCAN and hierarchical agglomerative clustering which work relatively well but don’t scale well to datasets of this size. Affinity propagation is quick and works okish but I don’t know how to optimise it. 
 Does anyone have any recommendation on which algorithm to use and how to optimise it? Was my idea to apply the fft good? I am not a computer scientist so I am really out of my element.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To review IPPO vs. MAPPO, first, let's revisit the paper "Is Independent Learning All You Need in the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge?". ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09533 ) The paper shows that simply applying PPO to the SMAC task to construct an IPPO (independent PPO) algorithm like IQL can surpass QMIX on SMAC. IPPO demonstrates the effectiveness of applying PPO to multi-agent systems.
 The paper further extends IPPO to MAPPO. The difference is that the critic of PPO uses the global state instead of the observation as input. Surprisingly, the global information does not enhance the actual performance of IPPO.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Data is the cornerstone of deep learning. This paper reveals that the
recently developed Diffusion Model is a scalable data engine for object
detection. Existing methods for scaling up detection-oriented data often
require manual collection or generative models to obtain target images,
followed by data augmentation and labeling to produce training pairs, which are
costly, complex, or lacking diversity. To address these issues, we
presentDiffusionEngine (DE), a data scaling-up engine that provides
high-quality detection-oriented training pairs in a single stage. DE consists
of a pre-trained diffusion model and an effective Detection-Adapter,
contributing to generating scalable, diverse and generalizable detection data
in a plug-and-play manner. Detection-Adapter is learned to align the implicit
semantic and location knowledge in off-the-shelf diffusion models with
detection-aware signals to make better bounding-box predictions. Additionally,
we contribute two datasets, i.e., COCO-DE and VOC-DE, to scale up existing
detection benchmarks for facilitating follow-up research. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that data scaling-up via DE can achieve significant improvements in
diverse scenarios, such as various detection algorithms, self-supervised
pre-training, data-sparse, label-scarce, cross-domain, and semi-supervised
learning. For example, when using DE with a DINO-based adapter to scale up
data, mAP is improved by 3.1% on COCO, 7.6% on VOC, and 11.5% on Clipart.]]></summary>

combining Federated Learning (FL) and graph models with respect to the
constrain of privacy and security. In order to make better use of the power of
graph model, some researchs also combine split learning(SL). However, there are
still several issues left unattended: 1) Clients might not be able to access
the server during inference phase; 2) The graph of clients designed manually in
the server model may not reveal the proper relationship between clients. This
paper proposes a new GNN-oriented split federated learning method, named node
{\bfseries M}asking and {\bfseries M}ulti-granularity {\bfseries M}essage
passing-based Federated Graph Model (M$^3$FGM) for the above issues. For the
first issue, the server model of M$^3$FGM employs a MaskNode layer to simulate
the case of clients being offline. We also redesign the decoder of the client
model using a dual-sub-decoders structure so that each client model can use its
local data to predict independently when offline. As for the second issue, a
new GNN layer named Multi-Granularity Message Passing (MGMP) layer enables each
client node to perceive global and local information. We conducted extensive
experiments in two different scenarios on two real traffic datasets. Results
show that M$^3$FGM outperforms the baselines and variant models, achieves the
best results in both datasets and scenarios.]]></summary>

due to their superior capability in learning node embeddings for various graph
inference tasks, but training them can raise privacy concerns. To address this,
we propose using link local differential privacy over decentralized nodes,
enabling collaboration with an untrusted server to train GNNs without revealing
the existence of any link. Our approach spends the privacy budget separately on
links and degrees of the graph for the server to better denoise the graph
topology using Bayesian estimation, alleviating the negative impact of LDP on
the accuracy of the trained GNNs. We bound the mean absolute error of the
inferred link probabilities against the ground truth graph topology. We then
propose two variants of our LDP mechanism complementing each other in different
privacy settings, one of which estimates fewer links under lower privacy
budgets to avoid false positive link estimates when the uncertainty is high,
while the other utilizes more information and performs better given relatively
higher privacy budgets. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid variant that combines
both strategies and is able to perform better across different privacy budgets.
Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms existing methods in
terms of accuracy under varying privacy budgets.]]></summary>

to adverse weather effects to long-term social and economic impacts on
societies. Computer simulations of atmospheric dynamics are, therefore, of
great importance for the well-being of our and future generations. Here, we
propose AtmoRep, a novel, task-independent stochastic computer model of
atmospheric dynamics that can provide skillful results for a wide range of
applications. AtmoRep uses large-scale representation learning from artificial
intelligence to determine a general description of the highly complex,
stochastic dynamics of the atmosphere from the best available estimate of the
system's historical trajectory as constrained by observations. This is enabled
by a novel self-supervised learning objective and a unique ensemble that
samples from the stochastic model with a variability informed by the one in the
historical record. The task-independent nature of AtmoRep enables skillful
results for a diverse set of applications without specifically training for
them and we demonstrate this for nowcasting, temporal interpolation, model
correction, and counterfactuals. We also show that AtmoRep can be improved with
additional data, for example radar observations, and that it can be extended to
tasks such as downscaling. Our work establishes that large-scale neural
networks can provide skillful, task-independent models of atmospheric dynamics.
With this, they provide a novel means to make the large record of atmospheric
observations accessible for applications and for scientific inquiry,
complementing existing simulations based on first principles.]]></summary>

privacy-preserving machine learning methods have been proposed. In the
clustering domain, various algorithms with a federated learning framework
(i.e., federated clustering) have been actively studied and showed high
clustering performance while preserving data privacy. However, most of the base
clusterers (i.e., clustering algorithms) used in existing federated clustering
algorithms need to specify the number of clusters in advance. These algorithms,
therefore, are unable to deal with data whose distributions are unknown or
continually changing. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a
privacy-preserving continual federated clustering algorithm. In the proposed
algorithm, an adaptive resonance theory-based clustering algorithm capable of
continual learning is used as a base clusterer. Therefore, the proposed
algorithm inherits the ability of continual learning. Experimental results with
synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed algorithm has superior
clustering performance to state-of-the-art federated clustering algorithms
while realizing data privacy protection and continual learning ability. The

massive amounts of training data, medical image datasets are often limited in
diversity and size. Transfer learning has the potential to bridge the gap
between related yet different domains. For medical applications, however, it
remains unclear whether it is more beneficial to pre-train on natural or
medical images. We aim to shed light on this problem by comparing
initialization on ImageNet and RadImageNet on seven medical classification
tasks. Our work includes a replication study, which yields results contrary to
previously published findings. In our experiments, ResNet50 models pre-trained
on ImageNet tend to outperform those trained on RadImageNet. To gain further
insights, we investigate the learned representations using Canonical
Correlation Analysis (CCA) and compare the predictions of the different models.
Our results indicate that, contrary to intuition, ImageNet and RadImageNet may
converge to distinct intermediate representations, which appear to diverge
further during fine-tuning. Despite these distinct representations, the
predictions of the models remain similar. Our findings show that the similarity
between networks before and after fine-tuning does not correlate with
performance gains, suggesting that the advantages of transfer learning might
not solely originate from the reuse of features in the early layers of a

different clustering quality measures, which try to provide a general measure

discuss the efficient medoid-based variant of the Silhouette, perform a
theoretical analysis of its properties, provide two fast versions for the
direct optimization, and discuss the use to choose the optimal number of
clusters. We combine ideas from the original Silhouette with the well-known PAM
algorithm and its latest improvements FasterPAM. One of the versions guarantees
equal results to the original variant and provides a run speedup of $O(k^2)$.
In experiments on real data with 30000 samples and $k$=100, we observed a
10464$\times$ speedup compared to the original PAMMEDSIL algorithm.

of a limited capacity model (student) by pushing its responses to match a
powerful model's (teacher). Albeit useful especially in the penultimate layer
and beyond, its action on student's feature transform is rather implicit,
limiting its practice in the intermediate layers. To explicitly embed the
teacher's knowledge in feature transform, we propose a learnable KD layer for
the student which improves KD with two distinct abilities: i) learning how to
leverage the teacher's knowledge, enabling to discard nuisance information, and
ii) feeding forward the transferred knowledge deeper. Thus, the student enjoys
the teacher's knowledge during the inference besides training. Formally, we
repurpose 1x1-BN-ReLU-1x1 convolution block to assign a semantic vector to each
local region according to the template (supervised by the teacher) that the
corresponding region of the student matches. To facilitate template learning in
the intermediate layers, we propose a novel form of supervision based on the
teacher's decisions. Through rigorous experimentation, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach on 3 popular classification benchmarks. Code is

large language model (LLM)-based agents such as GPT-4. However, many commercial
conversational agent development tools are pipeline-based and have limitations
in holding a human-like conversation. This paper investigates the capabilities
of LLMs to enhance pipeline-based conversational agents during two phases: 1)
in the design and development phase and 2) during operations. In 1) LLMs can
aid in generating training data, extracting entities and synonyms,
localization, and persona design. In 2) LLMs can assist in contextualization,
intent classification to prevent conversational breakdown and handle
out-of-scope questions, auto-correcting utterances, rephrasing responses,
formulating disambiguation questions, summarization, and enabling closed
question-answering capabilities. We conducted informal experiments with GPT-4
in the private banking domain to demonstrate the scenarios above with a
practical example. Companies may be hesitant to replace their pipeline-based
agents with LLMs entirely due to privacy concerns and the need for deep
integration within their existing ecosystems. A hybrid approach in which LLMs'
are integrated into the pipeline-based agents allows them to save time and
costs of building and running agents by capitalizing on the capabilities of
LLMs while retaining the integration and privacy safeguards of their existing

making long-term fairness a crucial consideration. It has been shown that when
ignoring the long-term effect, naively imposing fairness criterion in static
settings can actually exacerbate bias over time. To explicitly address biases
in sequential decision-making, recent works formulate long-term fairness
notions in Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework. They define the long-term
bias to be the sum of static bias over each time step. However, we demonstrate
that naively summing up the step-wise bias can cause a false sense of fairness
since it fails to consider the importance difference of different time steps
during transition. In this work, we introduce a long-term fairness notion
called Equal Long-term Benefit Rate (ELBERT), which explicitly considers
varying temporal importance and adapts static fairness principles to the
sequential setting. Moreover, we show that the policy gradient of Long-term
Benefit Rate can be analytically reduced to standard policy gradient. This
makes standard policy optimization methods applicable for reducing the bias,
leading to our proposed bias mitigation method ELBERT-PO. Experiments on three
sequential decision making environments show that ELBERT-PO significantly
reduces bias and maintains high utility. Code is available at

of new layers added to the architecture after applying LRD, it may not lead to
a high training/inference acceleration if the decomposition ranks are not small
enough. The issue is that using small ranks increases the risk of significant
accuracy drop after decomposition. In this paper, we propose two techniques for
accelerating low rank decomposed models without requiring to use small ranks
for decomposition. These methods include rank optimization and sequential
freezing of decomposed layers. We perform experiments on both convolutional and
transformer-based models. Experiments show that these techniques can improve
the model throughput up to 60% during training and 37% during inference when

the principle that good models should exclude parameters beyond those minimally
required to describe the systems they represent. This is because redundancy can
lead to incorrect estimates of model parameters from data, and thus inaccurate
or ambiguous conclusions. Here, we show how deep learning can be powerfully
leveraged to address Occam's razor. FixFit, our new method, uses a feedforward
deep neural network with a bottleneck layer to characterize and predict the
behavior of a given model from its input parameters. FixFit has three major
benefits. First, it provides a metric to quantify the original model's degree
of complexity. Second, it allows for the unique fitting of data. Third, it
provides an unbiased way to discriminate between experimental hypotheses that
add value versus those that do not. In two use cases, we demonstrate the broad
applicability of this method across scientific domains. To validate the method
using a known system, we apply FixFit to recover known composite parameters for
the Kepler orbit model. To illustrate how the method can be applied to less
well-established fields, we use it to identify parameters for a multi-scale
brain model and reduce the search space for viable candidate mechanisms.]]></summary>

DNNs.

In order to achieve safety of AD systems with DNN-based perception components
in a systematic and comprehensive approach, so-called safety concerns have been
introduced as a suitable structuring element. On the one hand, the concept of
safety concerns is -- by design -- well aligned to existing standards relevant
for safety of AD systems such as ISO 21448 (SOTIF). On the other hand, it has
already inspired several academic publications and upcoming standards on AI
safety such as ISO PAS 8800.

While the concept of safety concerns has been previously introduced, this

safety experts in the field. In particular, this paper introduces an additional
categorization for a better understanding as well as enabling cross-functional

series, are gaining traction for their expansive influence. While there is keen
interest in their applicability within medical domains such as psychology,
tangible explorations on real-world data remain scant. Concurrently, users on
social media platforms are increasingly vocalizing personal sentiments; under
specific thematic umbrellas, these sentiments often manifest as negative
emotions, sometimes escalating to suicidal inclinations. Timely discernment of
such cognitive distortions and suicidal risks is crucial to effectively
intervene and potentially avert dire circumstances. Our study ventured into
this realm by experimenting on two pivotal tasks: suicidal risk and cognitive
distortion identification on Chinese social media platforms. Using supervised
learning as a baseline, we examined and contrasted the efficacy of large
language models via three distinct strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, and
fine-tuning. Our findings revealed a discernible performance gap between the
large language models and traditional supervised learning approaches, primarily
attributed to the models' inability to fully grasp subtle categories. Notably,
while GPT-4 outperforms its counterparts in multiple scenarios, GPT-3.5 shows
significant enhancement in suicide risk classification after fine-tuning. To
our knowledge, this investigation stands as the maiden attempt at gauging large
language models on Chinese social media tasks. This study underscores the
forward-looking and transformative implications of using large language models
in the field of psychology. It lays the groundwork for future applications in

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Accurate segmentation of punctate white matter lesions (PWMLs) are
fundamental for the timely diagnosis and treatment of related developmental
disorders. Automated PWMLs segmentation from infant brain MR images is
challenging, considering that the lesions are typically small and low-contrast,
and the number of lesions may dramatically change across subjects. Existing
learning-based methods directly apply general network architectures to this
challenging task, which may fail to capture detailed positional information of
PWMLs, potentially leading to severe under-segmentations. In this paper, we
propose to leverage the idea of counterfactual reasoning coupled with the
auxiliary task of brain tissue segmentation to learn fine-grained positional
and morphological representations of PWMLs for accurate localization and
segmentation. A simple and easy-to-implement deep-learning framework (i.e.,
DeepPWML) is accordingly designed. It combines the lesion counterfactual map
with the tissue probability map to train a lightweight PWML segmentation
network, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a real-clinical dataset
of infant T1w MR images. The code is available at

diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. An important metric of cardiac function is
the left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), where lower EF is associated with
cardiomyopathy. Echocardiography is a popular diagnostic tool in cardiology,
with ultrasound being a low-cost, real-time, and non-ionizing technology.
However, human assessment of echocardiograms for calculating EF is
time-consuming and expertise-demanding, raising the need for an automated
approach. In this work, we propose using the M(otion)-mode of echocardiograms
for estimating the EF and classifying cardiomyopathy. We generate multiple
artificial M-mode images from a single echocardiogram and combine them using
off-the-shelf model architectures. Additionally, we extend contrastive learning
(CL) to cardiac imaging to learn meaningful representations from exploiting
structures in unlabeled data allowing the model to achieve high accuracy, even
with limited annotations. Our experiments show that the supervised setting
converges with only ten modes and is comparable to the baseline method while
bypassing its cumbersome training process and being computationally much more
efficient. Furthermore, CL using M-mode images is helpful for limited data
scenarios, such as having labels for only 200 patients, which is common in
medical applications.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dexterous manipulation tasks involving contact-rich interactions pose a
significant challenge for both model-based control systems and imitation
learning algorithms. The complexity arises from the need for multi-fingered
robotic hands to dynamically establish and break contacts, balance
non-prehensile forces, and control large degrees of freedom. Reinforcement
learning (RL) offers a promising approach due to its general applicability and
capacity to autonomously acquire optimal manipulation strategies. However, its
real-world application is often hindered by the necessity to generate a large
number of samples, reset the environment, and obtain reward signals. In this
work, we introduce an efficient system for learning dexterous manipulation
skills with RL to alleviate these challenges. The main idea of our approach is
the integration of recent advances in sample-efficient RL and replay buffer
bootstrapping. This combination allows us to utilize data from different tasks
or objects as a starting point for training new tasks, significantly improving
learning efficiency. Additionally, our system completes the real-world training
cycle by incorporating learned resets via an imitation-based pickup policy as
well as learned reward functions, eliminating the need for manual resets and
reward engineering. We demonstrate the benefits of reusing past data as replay
buffer initialization for new tasks, for instance, the fast acquisition of
intricate manipulation skills in the real world on a four-fingered robotic
hand. (Videos: https://sites.google.com/view/reboot-dexterous)]]></summary>

for improving the interpretability and trustworthiness of machine learning
models. While saliency maps have stolen the show for the last few years in the
XAI field, their ability to reflect models' internal processes has been
questioned. Although less in the spotlight, example-based XAI methods have
continued to improve. It encompasses methods that use examples as explanations
for a machine learning model's predictions. This aligns with the psychological
mechanisms of human reasoning and makes example-based explanations natural and
intuitive for users to understand. Indeed, humans learn and reason by forming
mental representations of concepts based on examples.

This paper provides an overview of the state-of-the-art in natural
example-based XAI, describing the pros and cons of each approach. A "natural"
example simply means that it is directly drawn from the training data without
involving any generative process. The exclusion of methods that require
generating examples is justified by the need for plausibility which is in some
regards required to gain a user's trust. Consequently, this paper will explore
the following family of methods: similar examples, counterfactual and
semi-factual, influential instances, prototypes, and concepts. In particular,
it will compare their semantic definition, their cognitive impact, and added
values. We hope it will encourage and facilitate future work on natural
example-based XAI.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adversarial examples, inputs designed to induce worst-case behavior in
machine learning models, have been extensively studied over the past decade.
Yet, our understanding of this phenomenon stems from a rather fragmented pool
of knowledge; at present, there are a handful of attacks, each with disparate
assumptions in threat models and incomparable definitions of optimality. In
this paper, we propose a systematic approach to characterize worst-case (i.e.,
optimal) adversaries. We first introduce an extensible decomposition of attacks
in adversarial machine learning by atomizing attack components into surfaces
and travelers. With our decomposition, we enumerate over components to create
576 attacks (568 of which were previously unexplored). Next, we propose the
Pareto Ensemble Attack (PEA): a theoretical attack that upper-bounds attack
performance. With our new attacks, we measure performance relative to the PEA
on: both robust and non-robust models, seven datasets, and three extended
lp-based threat models incorporating compute costs, formalizing the Space of
Adversarial Strategies. From our evaluation we find that attack performance to
be highly contextual: the domain, model robustness, and threat model can have a
profound influence on attack efficacy. Our investigation suggests that future
studies measuring the security of machine learning should: (1) be
contextualized to the domain & threat models, and (2) go beyond the handful of
known attacks used today.]]></summary>

for effective traffic management, public service, and urban planning. Despite
this importance, due to the limitations of urban sensing techniques, the data
quality from most sources is inadequate for monitoring crowd flow at each POI.
This renders the inference of accurate crowd flow from low-quality data a
critical and challenging task. The complexity is heightened by three key
factors: 1) \emph{The scarcity and rarity of labeled data}, 2) \emph{The
intricate spatio-temporal dependencies among POIs}, and 3) \emph{The myriad
correlations between precise crowd flow and GPS reports}.

To address these challenges, we recast the crowd flow inference problem as a
self-supervised attributed graph representation learning task and introduce a
novel \underline{C}ontrastive \underline{S}elf-learning framework for
\underline{S}patio-\underline{T}emporal data (\model). Our approach initiates
with the construction of a spatial adjacency graph founded on the POIs and
their respective distances. We then employ a contrastive learning technique to
exploit large volumes of unlabeled spatio-temporal data. We adopt a swapped
prediction approach to anticipate the representation of the target subgraph
from similar instances. Following the pre-training phase, the model is
fine-tuned with accurate crowd flow data. Our experiments, conducted on two
real-world datasets, demonstrate that the \model pre-trained on extensive noisy
data consistently outperforms models trained from scratch.]]></summary>

modern approximation. These approaches are able to produce accurate
approximations to nonsmooth and non-Lipschitz functions, including multivariate
domain functions. In this paper we compare the efficiency of function
approximation using rational approximation, neural network and their
combinations. It was found that rational approximation is superior to neural
network based approaches with the same number of decision variables. Our
numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of rational approximation,
even when the number of approximation parameters (that is, the dimension of the
corresponding optimisation problems) is small. Another important contribution
of this paper lies in the improvement of rational approximation algorithms.
Namely, the optimisation based algorithms for rational approximation can be
adjusted to in such a way that the conditioning number of the constraint
matrices are controlled. This simple adjustment enables us to work with high
dimension optimisation problems and improve the design of the neural network.
The main strength of neural networks is in their ability to handle models with
a large number of variables: complex models are decomposed in several simple
optimisation problems. Therefore the the large number of decision variables is
in the nature of neural networks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[$ $Acoustic-to-articulatory inversion (AAI) involves mapping from the
acoustic space to the articulatory space. Signal-processing features like the
MFCCs, have been widely used for the AAI task. For subjects with dysarthric
speech, AAI is challenging because of an imprecise and indistinct
pronunciation. In this work, we perform AAI for dysarthric speech using
representations from pre-trained self-supervised learning (SSL) models. We
demonstrate the impact of different pre-trained features on this challenging
AAI task, at low-resource conditions. In addition, we also condition x-vectors
to the extracted SSL features to train a BLSTM network. In the seen case, we
experiment with three AAI training schemes (subject-specific, pooled, and
fine-tuned). The results, consistent across training schemes, reveal that
DeCoAR, in the fine-tuned scheme, achieves a relative improvement of the
Pearson Correlation Coefficient (CC) by ${\sim}$1.81\% and ${\sim}$4.56\% for
healthy controls and patients, respectively, over MFCCs. In the unseen case, we
observe similar average trends for different SSL features. Overall, SSL
networks like wav2vec, APC, and DeCoAR, which are trained with feature
reconstruction or future timestep prediction tasks, perform well in predicting
dysarthric articulatory trajectories.]]></summary>

arising in applications where data is recorded over time and over multiple
channels. For example, a smartwatch can record the acceleration and orientation
of a person's motion, and these signals are recorded as multivariate time
series. We can classify this data to understand and predict human movement and
various properties such as fitness levels. In many applications classification
alone is not enough, we often need to classify but also understand what the
model learns (e.g., why was a prediction given, based on what information in
the data). The main focus of this paper is on analysing and evaluating
explanation methods tailored to Multivariate Time Series Classification (MTSC).
We focus on saliency-based explanation methods that can point out the most
relevant channels and time series points for the classification decision. We
analyse two popular and accurate multivariate time series classifiers, ROCKET
and dResNet, as well as two popular explanation methods, SHAP and dCAM. We
study these methods on 3 synthetic datasets and 2 real-world datasets and
provide a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the explanations provided.
We find that flattening the multivariate datasets by concatenating the channels
works as well as using multivariate classifiers directly and adaptations of
SHAP for MTSC work quite well. Additionally, we also find that the popular
synthetic datasets we used are not suitable for time series analysis.]]></summary>

distribution, diffusion-based generative models learn how to generate the data
by inferring a reverse diffusion chain. However, this approach is slow and
costly because it needs many forward and reverse steps. We propose a faster and
cheaper approach that adds noise not until the data become pure random noise,
but until they reach a hidden noisy data distribution that we can confidently
learn. Then, we use fewer reverse steps to generate data by starting from this
hidden distribution that is made similar to the noisy data. We reveal that the
proposed model can be cast as an adversarial auto-encoder empowered by both the
diffusion process and a learnable implicit prior. Experimental results show
even with a significantly smaller number of reverse diffusion steps, the

of the Particle-Swarm Optimization algorithm to autonomously explore and
optimize hyperparameters, a Multi-Head Attention mechanism to discern the

for computational efficiency. Our method undergoes rigorous evaluation using a
genuine electricity demand dataset. The results underscore its superiority in

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While recommender systems have significantly benefited from implicit
feedback, they have often missed the nuances of multi-behavior interactions
between users and items. Historically, these systems either amalgamated all
behaviors, such as \textit{impression} (formerly \textit{view}),
\textit{add-to-cart}, and \textit{buy}, under a singular 'interaction' label,
or prioritized only the target behavior, often the \textit{buy} action,
discarding valuable auxiliary signals. Although recent advancements tried
addressing this simplification, they primarily gravitated towards optimizing
the target behavior alone, battling with data scarcity. Additionally, they
tended to bypass the nuanced hierarchy intrinsic to behaviors. To bridge these
gaps, we introduce the \textbf{H}ierarchical \textbf{M}ulti-behavior
\textbf{G}raph Attention \textbf{N}etwork (HMGN). This pioneering framework
leverages attention mechanisms to discern information from both inter and
intra-behaviors while employing a multi-task Hierarchical Bayesian Personalized
Ranking (HBPR) for optimization. Recognizing the need for scalability, our
approach integrates a specialized multi-behavior sub-graph sampling technique.
Moreover, the adaptability of HMGN allows for the seamless inclusion of
knowledge metadata and time-series data. Empirical results attest to our
model's prowess, registering a notable performance boost of up to 64\% in
NDCG@100 metrics over conventional graph neural network methods.]]></summary>

However, learning the value function via bootstrapping often leads to unstable
training due to fast-changing target values. Target Networks are employed to
stabilize training by using an additional set of lagging parameters to estimate
the target values. Despite the popularity of Target Networks, their effect on
the optimization is still misunderstood. In this work, we show that they act as
an implicit regularizer which can be beneficial in some cases, but also have
disadvantages such as being inflexible and can result in instabilities, even
when vanilla TD(0) converges. To overcome these issues, we propose an explicit
Functional Regularization alternative that is flexible and a convex regularizer
in function space and we theoretically study its convergence. We conduct an
experimental study across a range of environments, discount factors, and
off-policiness data collections to investigate the effectiveness of the
regularization induced by Target Networks and Functional Regularization in
terms of performance, accuracy, and stability. Our findings emphasize that
Functional Regularization can be used as a drop-in replacement for Target
Networks and result in performance improvement. Furthermore, adjusting both the
regularization weight and the network update period in Functional
Regularization can result in further performance improvements compared to
solely adjusting the network update period as typically done with Target
Networks. Our approach also enhances the ability to networks to recover

value. Those risk values can be robustly estimated via using the remarkable
Catoni's method (Catoni, 2012). Thanks to the structure of Catoni-type
influence functions, we are able to establish excess risk upper bounds via

events over time. We ask a relatively basic question: how might we compare
these forecasters, either online or post-hoc, while avoiding unverifiable
assumptions on how the forecasts and outcomes were generated? In this paper, we
present a rigorous answer to this question by designing novel sequential
inference procedures for estimating the time-varying difference in forecast
scores. To do this, we employ confidence sequences (CS), which are sequences of
confidence intervals that can be continuously monitored and are valid at
arbitrary data-dependent stopping times ("anytime-valid"). The widths of our
CSs are adaptive to the underlying variance of the score differences.
Underlying their construction is a game-theoretic statistical framework, in
which we further identify e-processes and p-processes for sequentially testing
a weak null hypothesis -- whether one forecaster outperforms another on average
(rather than always). Our methods do not make distributional assumptions on the
forecasts or outcomes; our main theorems apply to any bounded scores, and we
later provide alternative methods for unbounded scores. We empirically validate
our approaches by comparing real-world baseball and weather forecasters.]]></summary>

a universal function approximator for generic antisymmetric functions, which
are ubiquitous in quantum physics. However, this procedure is a priori
factorially costly to implement, making it impractical for large numbers of
particles. The strategy also suffers from a sign problem. Namely, due to
near-exact cancellation of positive and negative contributions, the magnitude
of the antisymmetrized function may be significantly smaller than before
anti-symmetrization. We show that the anti-symmetric projection of a two-layer
neural network can be evaluated efficiently, opening the door to using a
generic antisymmetric layer as a building block in anti-symmetric neural
network Ansatzes. This approximation is effective when the sign problem is
controlled, and we show that this property depends crucially the choice of
activation function under standard Xavier/He initialization methods. As a
consequence, using a smooth activation function requires re-scaling of the

security, especially in recent rampant research in security breach such as
adversarial/membership attacks. To this end, \textit{unlearnable examples}
(UEs) have been recently proposed as a compelling protection, by adding
imperceptible perturbation to data so that models trained on them cannot
classify them accurately on original clean distribution. Unfortunately, we find
UEs provide a false sense of security, because they cannot stop unauthorized
users from utilizing other unprotected data to remove the protection, by
turning unlearnable data into learnable again. Motivated by this observation,
we formally define a new threat by introducing \textit{learnable unauthorized
examples} (LEs) which are UEs with their protection removed. The core of this
approach is a novel purification process that projects UEs onto the manifold of
LEs. This is realized by a new joint-conditional diffusion model which denoises
UEs conditioned on the pixel and perceptual similarity between UEs and LEs.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LE delivers state-of-the-art countering
performance against both supervised UEs and unsupervised UEs in various
scenarios, which is the first generalizable countermeasure to UEs across
supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Our code is available at

deep learning model architectures have underscored the need for more efficient
data representation and analysis techniques. This paper is motivated by the
work of Helal (2023) and aims to present a comprehensive overview of
tensorization. This transformative approach bridges the gap between the
inherently multidimensional nature of data and the simplified 2-dimensional
matrices commonly used in linear algebra-based machine learning algorithms.
This paper explores the steps involved in tensorization, multidimensional data
sources, various multiway analysis methods employed, and the benefits of these
approaches. A small example of Blind Source Separation (BSS) is presented
comparing 2-dimensional algorithms and a multiway algorithm in Python. Results
indicate that multiway analysis is more expressive. Contrary to the intuition
of the dimensionality curse, utilising multidimensional datasets in their
native form and applying multiway analysis methods grounded in multilinear
algebra reveal a profound capacity to capture intricate interrelationships
among various dimensions while, surprisingly, reducing the number of model
parameters and accelerating processing. A survey of the multi-away analysis
methods and integration with various Deep Neural Networks models is presented
using case studies in different domains.]]></summary>

due to the diversity of the global wrist motions and the precise finger control

learning and physics simulations to train a policy that controls the global and

single policy guided by a single hand pose reference. Moreover, to facilitate
the training of the precise finger control required for articulation, we
present a learning curriculum with increasing difficulty. It starts with
single-hand manipulation of stationary objects and continues with multi-agent
training including both hands and non-stationary objects. To evaluate our
method, we introduce Dynamic Object Grasping and Articulation, a task that
involves bringing an object into a target articulated pose. This task requires
grasping, relocation, and articulation. We show our method's efficacy towards

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Performance metrics for medical image segmentation models are used to measure
the agreement between the reference annotation and the predicted segmentation.
Usually, overlap metrics, such as the Dice, are used as a metric to evaluate
the performance of these models in order for results to be comparable. However,
there is a mismatch between the distributions of cases and difficulty level of
segmentation tasks in public data sets compared to clinical practice. Common
metrics fail to measure the impact of this mismatch, especially for clinical
data sets that include low signal pathologies, a difficult segmentation task,
and uncertain, small, or empty reference annotations. This limitation may
result in ineffective research of machine learning practitioners in designing
and optimizing models. Dimensions of evaluating clinical value include
consideration of the uncertainty of reference annotations, independence from
reference annotation volume size, and evaluation of classification of empty
reference annotations. We study how uncertain, small, and empty reference
annotations influence the value of metrics for medical image segmentation on an
in-house data set regardless of the model. We examine metrics behavior on the
predictions of a standard deep learning framework in order to identify metrics
with clinical value. We compare to a public benchmark data set (BraTS 2019)
with a high-signal pathology and certain, larger, and no empty reference
annotations. We may show machine learning practitioners, how uncertain, small,
or empty reference annotations require a rethinking of the evaluation and
optimizing procedures. The evaluation code was released to encourage further
analysis of this topic.

imitating expert demonstrations, allowing users to communicate their
instructions in an intuitive manner. Recent progress in LfD often relies on
kinesthetic teaching or teleoperation as the medium for users to specify the
demonstrations. Kinesthetic teaching requires physical handling of the robot,
while teleoperation demands proficiency with additional hardware. This paper
introduces an alternative paradigm for LfD called Diagrammatic Teaching.
Diagrammatic Teaching aims to teach robots novel skills by prompting the user
to sketch out demonstration trajectories on 2D images of the scene, these are
then synthesised as a generative model of motion trajectories in 3D task space.
Additionally, we present the Ray-tracing Probabilistic Trajectory Learning
(RPTL) framework for Diagrammatic Teaching. RPTL extracts time-varying
probability densities from the 2D sketches, applies ray-tracing to find
corresponding regions in 3D Cartesian space, and fits a probabilistic model of
motion trajectories to these regions. New motion trajectories, which mimic
those sketched by the user, can then be generated from the probabilistic model.
We empirically validate our framework both in simulation and on real robots,
which include a fixed-base manipulator and a quadruped-mounted manipulator.]]></summary>

(ITS), the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) plays a vital role in alleviating traffic
issues. Object detection is one of the key technologies in the IoV, which has
been widely used to provide traffic management services by analyzing timely and
sensitive vehicle-related information. However, the current object detection
methods are mostly based on centralized deep training, that is, the sensitive
data obtained by edge devices need to be uploaded to the server, which raises
privacy concerns. To mitigate such privacy leakage, we first propose a
federated learning-based framework, where well-trained local models are shared
in the central server. However, since edge devices usually have limited
computing power, plus a strict requirement of low latency in IoVs, we further
propose a sparse training process on edge devices, which can effectively
lighten the model, and ensure its training efficiency on edge devices, thereby
reducing communication overheads. In addition, due to the diverse computing
capabilities and dynamic environment, different sparsity rates are applied to
edge devices. To further guarantee the performance, we propose, FedWeg, an
improved aggregation scheme based on FedAvg, which is designed by the inverse
ratio of sparsity rates. Experiments on the real-life dataset using YOLO show
that the proposed scheme can achieve the required object detection rate while

remarkable ability to generate fitting responses to natural language
instructions. However, an open research question concerns the inherent biases

an LLM is dominantly written by persons with a specific political bias, we
might expect generated answers to share this bias. Current research work seeks
to de-bias such models, or suppress potentially biased answers. With this
demonstration, we take a different view on biases in instruction-tuning: Rather
than aiming to suppress them, we aim to make them explicit and transparent. To
this end, we present OpinionGPT, a web demo in which users can ask questions
and select all biases they wish to investigate. The demo will answer this
question using a model fine-tuned on text representing each of the selected
biases, allowing side-by-side comparison. To train the underlying model, we
identified 11 different biases (political, geographic, gender, age) and derived
an instruction-tuning corpus in which each answer was written by members of one
of these demographics. This paper presents OpinionGPT, illustrates how we
trained the bias-aware model and showcases the web application (available at

respond to multi-modality conditions, including audio, 3D point clouds, video,
and their embedding-space arithmetic by only image-text alignment training.
During training, we adopt a learnable bind network to align the embedding space
between LLaMA and ImageBind's image encoder. Then, the image features
transformed by the bind network are added to word tokens of all layers in
LLaMA, which progressively injects visual instructions via an attention-free
and zero-initialized gating mechanism. Aided by the joint embedding of
ImageBind, the simple image-text training enables our model to exhibit superior
multi-modality instruction-following capabilities. During inference, the
multi-modality inputs are fed into the corresponding ImageBind encoders, and
processed by a proposed visual cache model for further cross-modal embedding
enhancement. The training-free cache model retrieves from three million image
features extracted by ImageBind, which effectively mitigates the
training-inference modality discrepancy. Notably, with our approach,
ImageBind-LLM can respond to instructions of diverse modalities and demonstrate

the algorithm achieves zero time-average constraint violation, ensuring that
the average value of the constraint function satisfies the desired constraint.
The method is applied to both sampled instances from Gaussian processes and a
continuous stirred tank reactor parameter tuning problem; simulation results
show that the method simultaneously provides close-to-optimal performance and
maintains constraint feasibility on average. This contrasts current
state-of-the-art methods, which either suffer from large cumulative regret or
severe constraint violations for the case studies presented.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reinforcement learning algorithms often require finiteness of state and
action spaces in Markov decision processes (MDPs) (also called controlled
Markov chains) and various efforts have been made in the literature towards the
applicability of such algorithms for continuous state and action spaces. In
this paper, we show that under very mild regularity conditions (in particular,
involving only weak continuity of the transition kernel of an MDP), Q-learning
for standard Borel MDPs via quantization of states and actions (called
Quantized Q-Learning) converges to a limit, and furthermore this limit
satisfies an optimality equation which leads to near optimality with either
explicit performance bounds or which are guaranteed to be asymptotically
optimal. Our approach builds on (i) viewing quantization as a measurement
kernel and thus a quantized MDP as a partially observed Markov decision process
(POMDP), (ii) utilizing near optimality and convergence results of Q-learning
for POMDPs, and (iii) finally, near-optimality of finite state model
approximations for MDPs with weakly continuous kernels which we show to
correspond to the fixed point of the constructed POMDP. Thus, our paper
presents a very general convergence and approximation result for the
applicability of Q-learning for continuous MDPs.]]></summary>

of machine learning (ML). In practice, users are often interested in
multi-objective (MO) problems, i.e., optimizing potentially conflicting
objectives, like accuracy and energy consumption. To tackle this, the vast
majority of MO-ML algorithms return a Pareto front of non-dominated machine
learning models to the user. Optimizing the hyperparameters of such algorithms
is non-trivial as evaluating a hyperparameter configuration entails evaluating
the quality of the resulting Pareto front. In literature, there are known
indicators that assess the quality of a Pareto front (e.g., hypervolume, R2) by
quantifying different properties (e.g., volume, proximity to a reference
point). However, choosing the indicator that leads to the desired Pareto front
might be a hard task for a user. In this paper, we propose a human-centered
interactive HPO approach tailored towards multi-objective ML leveraging
preference learning to extract desiderata from users that guide the
optimization. Instead of relying on the user guessing the most suitable
indicator for their needs, our approach automatically learns an appropriate
indicator. Concretely, we leverage pairwise comparisons of distinct Pareto
fronts to learn such an appropriate quality indicator. Then, we optimize the
hyperparameters of the underlying MO-ML algorithm towards this learned
indicator using a state-of-the-art HPO approach. In an experimental study
targeting the environmental impact of ML, we demonstrate that our approach
leads to substantially better Pareto fronts compared to optimizing based on a
wrong indicator pre-selected by the user, and performs comparable in the case
of an advanced user knowing which indicator to pick.]]></summary>

maximum changes in the output concerning the input, taking into account
associated irrelevant biased factors. It is an efficient and provable method
for examining the output stability of machine learning models without incurring
additional computation costs. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which
operate on non-Euclidean data, have gained significant attention. However, no
previous research has investigated the GNN Lipschitz bounds to shed light on
stabilizing model outputs, especially when working on non-Euclidean data with
inherent biases. Given the inherent biases in common graph data used for GNN
training, it poses a serious challenge to constraining the GNN output
perturbations induced by input biases, thereby safeguarding fairness during
training. Recently, despite the Lipschitz constant's use in controlling the
stability of Euclideanneural networks, the calculation of the precise Lipschitz
constant remains elusive for non-Euclidean neural networks like GNNs,
especially within fairness contexts. To narrow this gap, we begin with the
general GNNs operating on an attributed graph, and formulate a Lipschitz bound
to limit the changes in the output regarding biases associated with the input.
Additionally, we theoretically analyze how the Lipschitz constant of a GNN
model could constrain the output perturbations induced by biases learned from
data for fairness training. We experimentally validate the Lipschitz bound's
effectiveness in limiting biases of the model output. Finally, from a training
dynamics perspective, we demonstrate why the theoretical Lipschitz bound can
effectively guide the GNN training to better trade-off between accuracy and
fairness.]]></summary>

resulted in the development of various risk estimators, yet they neglect the

to take into account communities such as different age or income brackets, in
tasks of chronic disease prediction. We propose a novel approach for binary
decision-making, which hierarchically builds community-based PU models and then
aggregates their deliverables. Our method can explicate each PU model on the
tree for the optimized non-leaf PU node splitting. Furthermore, a mask-recovery
data augmentation strategy enables sufficient training of the model in
individual communities. Additionally, the proposed approach includes an
adversarial PU risk estimator to capture hierarchical PU-relationships, and a
model fusion network that integrates data from each tree path, resulting in
robust binary classification results. We demonstrate the superior performance
of PUtree as well as its variants on two benchmarks and a new

crucial in planning its supply and consumption and optimizing the cost of
obtaining it, mainly by industrial entities. However, in times of threats to
its supply, it is also a critical element that guarantees the supply of this
raw material to meet individual consumers' needs, ensuring society's energy
security. This article introduces a novel multistep ahead forecasting of
natural gas consumption with change point detection integration for model
collection selection with continual learning capabilities using data stream
processing. The performance of the forecasting models based on the proposed
approach is evaluated in a complex real-world use case of natural gas
consumption forecasting. We employed Hoeffding tree predictors as forecasting
models and the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) algorithm for the change point
detection procedure. The change point detection integration enables selecting a
different model collection for successive time frames. Thus, three model
collection selection procedures (with and without an error feedback loop) are
defined and evaluated for forecasting scenarios with various densities of
detected change points. These models were compared with change point agnostic
baseline approaches. Our experiments show that fewer change points result in a
lower forecasting error regardless of the model collection selection procedure
employed. Also, simpler model collection selection procedures omitting
forecasting error feedback leads to more robust forecasting models suitable for

underwater acoustic data by leveraging a model trained on a broad spectrum of
non-underwater (aerial) sounds. Recognizing the challenge in labeling vast
amounts of underwater data, we propose a two-fold methodology to accelerate
this labor-intensive procedure.

The first part of our approach involves PCA and UMAP visualization of the
underwater data using the feature vectors of an aerial sound recognition model.
This enables us to cluster the data in a two dimensional space and listen to
points within these clusters to understand their defining characteristics. This
innovative method simplifies the process of selecting candidate labels for
further training.

In the second part, we train a neural network model using both the selected
underwater data and the non-underwater dataset. We conducted a quantitative
analysis to measure the precision, recall, and F1 score of our model for
recognizing airgun sounds, a common type of underwater sound. The F1 score
achieved by our model exceeded 84.3%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach in analyzing underwater acoustic data.

High-Energy Physics experiments. Tracking is exceptionally computationally
challenging and fielded solutions, relying on traditional algorithms, do not

answer. We argue that a complexity-reduced problem description and the data
representing it, will facilitate the solution exploration workflow. We provide
the REDuced VIrtual Detector (REDVID) as a complexity-reduced detector model
and particle collision event simulator combo. REDVID is intended as a
simulation-in-the-loop, to both generate synthetic data efficiently and to
simplify the challenge of ML model design. The fully parametric nature of our
tool, with regards to system-level configuration, while in contrast to
physics-accurate simulations, allows for the generation of simplified data for
research and education, at different levels. Resulting from the reduced
complexity, we showcase the computational efficiency of REDVID by providing the
computational cost figures for a multitude of simulation benchmarks. As a
simulation and a generative tool for ML-assisted solution design, REDVID is
highly flexible, reusable and open-source. Reference data sets generated with

the ranking matches the observations? This problem, known as rank aggregation,
has found many applications in sports, recommendation systems, and other web
applications. As it is generally NP-hard to find a global ranking that
minimizes the mismatch (known as the Kemeny optimization), we focus on the
Erd\"os-R\'enyi outliers (ERO) model for this ranking problem. Here, each
pairwise comparison is a corrupted copy of the true score difference. We
investigate spectral ranking algorithms that are based on unnormalized and
normalized data matrices. The key is to understand their performance in
recovering the underlying scores of each item from the observed data. This
reduces to deriving an entry-wise perturbation error bound between the top
eigenvectors of the unnormalized/normalized data matrix and its population
counterpart. By using the leave-one-out technique, we provide a sharper
$\ell_{\infty}$-norm perturbation bound of the eigenvectors and also derive an
error bound on the maximum displacement for each item, with only $\Omega(n\log
n)$ samples. Our theoretical analysis improves upon the state-of-the-art
results in terms of sample complexity, and our numerical experiments confirm

properties of data or context, in which the model operates, change over time
leading to a decrease in its performance. Therefore, maintaining a constant
monitoring process for machine learning model performance is crucial in order
to proactively prevent any potential performance regression. However,
supervised drift detection methods require human annotation and consequently
lead to a longer time to detect and mitigate the drift. In our proposed
unsupervised drift detection method, we follow a two step process. Our first
step involves encoding a sample of production data as the target distribution,
and the model training data as the reference distribution. In the second step,
we employ a kernel-based statistical test that utilizes the maximum mean
discrepancy (MMD) distance metric to compare the reference and target
distributions and estimate any potential drift. Our method also identifies the
subset of production data that is the root cause of the drift. The models
retrained using these identified high drift samples show improved performance

are a type of IQ test that requires deriving an abstract "concept" from a set
of positive and negative "support" images, and then classifying whether or not
a new query image depicts the key concept. On Bongard-HOI, a benchmark for
natural-image Bongard problems, existing methods have only reached 66% accuracy
(where chance is 50%). Low accuracy is often attributed to neural nets' lack of
ability to find human-like symbolic rules. In this work, we point out that many
existing methods are forfeiting accuracy due to a much simpler problem: they do
not incorporate information contained in the support set as a whole, and rely
instead on information extracted from individual supports. This is a critical
issue, because unlike in few-shot learning tasks concerning object
classification, the "key concept" in a typical Bongard problem can only be
distinguished using multiple positives and multiple negatives. We explore a
variety of simple methods to take this cross-image context into account, and
demonstrate substantial gains over prior methods, leading to new
state-of-the-art performance on Bongard-LOGO (75.3%) and Bongard-HOI (72.45%)

a well-functioning personalized pricing policy in place is essential to
effective business making. Typically, such a policy must be derived from
observational data, which introduces several challenges. While the problem of
``endogeneity'' is prominently studied in the established pricing literature,
the problem of selection bias (or, more precisely, bid selection bias) is not.
We take a step towards understanding the effects of selection bias by posing
pricing as a problem of causal inference. Specifically, we consider the
reaction of a customer to price a treatment effect. In our experiments, we
simulate varying levels of selection bias on a semi-synthetic dataset on
mortgage loan applications in Belgium. We investigate the potential of
parametric and nonparametric methods for the identification of individual
bid-response functions. Our results illustrate how conventional methods such as
logistic regression and neural networks suffer adversely from selection bias.
In contrast, we implement state-of-the-art methods from causal machine learning
and show their capability to overcome selection bias in pricing data.]]></summary>

Adversarial Neural Operator (GANO) that combines recent advancements in machine
learning and open access strong motion data sets to generate three-component
acceleration time histories conditioned on moment magnitude ($M$), rupture
distance ($R_{rup}$), time-average shear-wave velocity at the top $30m$
($V_{S30}$), and tectonic environment or style of faulting. We use Neural
Operators, a resolution invariant architecture that guarantees that the model
training is independent of the data sampling frequency. We first present the
conditional ground-motion synthesis algorithm (referred to heretofore as
cGM-GANO) and discuss its advantages compared to previous work. Next, we verify
the cGM-GANO framework using simulated ground motions generated with the
Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) Broadband Platform (BBP). We
lastly train cGM-GANO on a KiK-net dataset from Japan, showing that the
framework can recover the magnitude, distance, and $V_{S30}$ scaling of Fourier
amplitude and pseudo-spectral accelerations. We evaluate cGM-GANO through
residual analysis with the empirical dataset as well as by comparison with
conventional Ground Motion Models (GMMs) for selected ground motion scenarios.
Results show that cGM-GANO produces consistent median scaling with the GMMs for
the corresponding tectonic environments. The largest misfit is observed at
short distances due to the scarcity of training data. With the exception of
short distances, the aleatory variability of the response spectral ordinates is
also well captured, especially for subduction events due to the adequacy of
training data. Applications of the presented framework include generation of
risk-targeted ground motions for site-specific engineering applications.]]></summary>

block-based computational neural network tailored for medical image
segmentation on IoT and edge platforms. Conventional U-Net-based models face
challenges in meeting the speed and efficiency demands of real-time clinical
applications, such as disease monitoring, radiation therapy, and image-guided
surgery. LDMRes-Net overcomes these limitations with its remarkably low number
of learnable parameters (0.072M), making it highly suitable for
resource-constrained devices. The model's key innovation lies in its dual
multi-residual block architecture, which enables the extraction of refined
features on multiple scales, enhancing overall segmentation performance. To
further optimize efficiency, the number of filters is carefully selected to
prevent overlap, reduce training time, and improve computational efficiency.
The study includes comprehensive evaluations, focusing on segmentation of the
retinal image of vessels and hard exudates crucial for the diagnosis and
treatment of ophthalmology. The results demonstrate the robustness,

robots in the context of the RoboCup Standard Platform League, with a primary
focus on detecting the ball. The challenge lies in detecting a dynamic object
in varying lighting conditions and blurred images caused by fast movements. To
address this challenge, the paper presents a convolutional neural network
architecture designed specifically for computationally constrained robotic
platforms. The proposed CNN is trained to achieve high precision classification
of single objects in image patches and to determine their precise spatial
positions. The paper further integrates Early Exits into the existing
high-precision CNN architecture to reduce the computational cost of easily
rejectable cases in the background class. The training process involves a
composite loss function based on confidence and positional losses with dynamic
weighting and data augmentation. The proposed approach achieves a precision of
100% on the validation dataset and a recall of almost 87%, while maintaining an
execution time of around 170 $\mu$s per hypotheses. By combining the proposed
approach with an Early Exit, a runtime optimization of more than 28%, on
average, can be achieved compared to the original CNN. Overall, this paper
provides an efficient solution for an enhanced detection of objects, especially
the ball, in computationally constrained robotic platforms.]]></summary>

an unknown digital video with its source device, within a closed set of
possible devices. The existing techniques in source detection of digital videos
try to find a fingerprint of the actual source in the video in form of PRNU
(Photo Response Non--Uniformity), and match it against the SPN (Sensor Pattern
Noise) of each possible device. The highest correlation indicates the correct
source. We investigate the problem of identifying a video source through a
feature based approach using machine learning. In this paper, we present a
blind forensic technique of video source authentication and identification,
based on feature extraction, feature selection and subsequent source
classification. The main aim is to determine whether a claimed source for a
video is actually its original source. If not, we identify its original source.
Our experimental results prove the efficiency of the proposed method compared

training, where the data remains on the client side (i.e., IoT devices), and
only model updates of clients are shared iteratively for collaborative
learning. However, this process is vulnerable to privacy attacks and Byzantine
attacks: the local model updates shared throughout the FL network will leak
private information about the local training data, and they can also be
maliciously crafted by Byzantine attackers to disturb the learning. In this
paper, we propose a new FL scheme that guarantees rigorous privacy and
simultaneously enhances system robustness against Byzantine attacks. Our
approach introduces sparsification- and momentum-driven variance reduction into
the client-level differential privacy (DP) mechanism, to defend against
Byzantine attackers. The security design does not violate the privacy guarantee
of the client-level DP mechanism; hence, our approach achieves the same
client-level DP guarantee as the state-of-the-art. We conduct extensive
experiments on both IID and non-IID datasets and different tasks and evaluate
the performance of our approach against different Byzantine attacks by
comparing it with state-of-the-art defense methods. The results of our
experiments show the efficacy of our framework and demonstrate its ability to
improve system robustness against Byzantine attacks while achieving a strong
privacy guarantee.]]></summary>

making that prediction, providing insights in the performance of the

security in the modern world. Their ubiquity aids in monitoring suspicious
activities effectively. However, in densely populated environments, continuous
active monitoring becomes impractical, necessitating the development of
intelligent surveillance systems. AI integration in the surveillance domain was
a big revolution, however, speed issues have prevented its widespread
implementation in the field. It has been observed that quantum artificial
intelligence has led to a great breakthrough. Quantum artificial
intelligence-based surveillance systems have shown to be more accurate as well
as capable of performing well in real-time scenarios, which had never been seen

Quantum-RetinaNet strikes a balance between accuracy and speed. This innovative
integration positions it as a game-changer, addressing the challenges of active
monitoring in densely populated scenarios. As demand for efficient surveillance
solutions continues to grow, Quantum-RetinaNet offers a compelling alternative
to existing CNN models, upholding accuracy standards without sacrificing
real-time performance. The unique attributes of Quantum-RetinaNet have
far-reaching implications for the future of intelligent surveillance. With its
enhanced processing speed, it is poised to revolutionize the field, catering to

attributed the composition of data augmentations as a crucial factor for their
strong representation learning capabilities. While regional dropout strategies
have proven to guide models to focus on lesser indicative parts of the objects
in supervised methods, it hasn't been adopted by self-supervised methods for
generating positive pairs. This is because the regional dropout methods are not
suitable for the input sampling process of the self-supervised methodology.
Whereas dropping informative pixels from the positive pairs can result in
inefficient training, replacing patches of a specific object with a different
one can steer the model from maximizing the agreement between different
positive pairs. Moreover, joint embedding representation learning methods have
not made robustness their primary training outcome. To this end, we propose the
ViewMix augmentation policy, specially designed for self-supervised learning,
upon generating different views of the same image, patches are cut and pasted
from one view to another. By leveraging the different views created by this
augmentation strategy, multiple joint embedding-based self-supervised
methodologies obtained better localization capability and consistently
outperformed their corresponding baseline methods. It is also demonstrated that
incorporating ViewMix augmentation policy promotes robustness of the
representations in the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our

slow inference speed in semantic segmentation. In our research we identify 25
proposed distillation loss terms from 14 publications in the last 4 years.
Unfortunately, a comparison of terms based on published results is often
impossible, because of differences in training configurations. A good
illustration of this problem is the comparison of two publications from 2022.
Using the same models and dataset, Structural and Statistical Texture
Distillation (SSTKD) reports an increase of student mIoU of 4.54 and a final
performance of 29.19, while Adaptive Perspective Distillation (APD) only
improves student performance by 2.06 percentage points, but achieves a final
performance of 39.25. The reason for such extreme differences is often a
suboptimal choice of hyperparameters and a resulting underperformance of the
student model used as reference point. In our work, we reveal problems of
insufficient hyperparameter tuning by showing that distillation improvements of
two widely accepted frameworks, SKD and IFVD, vanish when hyperparameters are
optimized sufficiently. To improve comparability of future research in the
field, we establish a solid baseline for three datasets and two student models
and provide extensive information on hyperparameter tuning. We find that only

problem through reconstructing the missing modalities, it increases unnecessary
computational cost, which could be just as critical, especially for large,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We present a deep-dive into a real-world robotic learning system that, in
previous work, was shown to be capable of hundreds of table tennis rallies with
a human and has the ability to precisely return the ball to desired targets.
This system puts together a highly optimized perception subsystem, a high-speed
low-latency robot controller, a simulation paradigm that can prevent damage in
the real world and also train policies for zero-shot transfer, and automated
real world environment resets that enable autonomous training and evaluation on
physical robots. We complement a complete system description, including
numerous design decisions that are typically not widely disseminated, with a
collection of studies that clarify the importance of mitigating various sources
of latency, accounting for training and deployment distribution shifts,
robustness of the perception system, sensitivity to policy hyper-parameters,
and choice of action space. A video demonstrating the components of the system

in-context learning abilities including natural language processing (NLP) tasks
and challenging mathematical reasoning. However, due to the lack of
process-supervision, applying PLMs to mathematical reasoning tasks often fail
to generate correct reasoning steps and final answer even though solutions have
high probabilities. To unleash the mathematical reasoning of finetuned-LLMs
without any further fineutuning steps, we propose a method to endow LLMs with
immediate reaction and delicate reasoning system via Monte Carlo Tree
Search(MCTS) and a light energy function to rank the decision steps. In
particular, We first re-formalize the finetuned-LLMs to a Residual-based Energy
Model~(Residual-EBM) and apply noise contrastive estimation to estimate the
parameters of energy function . Then we use MCTS with energy function as path
verifier to search the output space and evaluating the reasoning path. Through
extensive experiments on two mathematical reasoning benchmarks, namely GSM8k
and MATH, we reveal the extraordinary capabilities of our method that improve
the pass@1 of the finetuned-model without further finetuning or RLHF alignment

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The analysis of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is an important step
in remote sensing applications, and it is a challenging problem due to its
inherent speckle noise. One typical solution is to model the data using the
$G_I^0$ distribution and extract its roughness information, which in turn can
be used in posterior imaging tasks, such as segmentation, classification and
interpretation. This leads to the need of quick and reliable estimation of the
roughness parameter from SAR data, especially with high resolution images.
Unfortunately, traditional parameter estimation procedures are slow and prone
to estimation failures. In this work, we proposed a neural network-based
estimation framework that first learns how to predict underlying parameters of
$G_I^0$ samples and then can be used to estimate the roughness of unseen data.
We show that this approach leads to an estimator that is quicker, yields less
estimation error and is less prone to failures than the traditional estimation
procedures for this problem, even when we use a simple network. More
importantly, we show that this same methodology can be generalized to handle
image inputs and, even if trained on purely synthetic data for a few seconds,
is able to perform real time pixel-wise roughness estimation for high
resolution real SAR imagery.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Synthetic Time Series Generation (TSG) is crucial in a range of applications,
including data augmentation, anomaly detection, and privacy preservation.
Although significant strides have been made in this field, existing methods
exhibit three key limitations: (1) They often benchmark against similar model
types, constraining a holistic view of performance capabilities. (2) The use of
specialized synthetic and private datasets introduces biases and hampers
generalizability. (3) Ambiguous evaluation measures, often tied to custom
networks or downstream tasks, hinder consistent and fair comparison.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce \textsf{TSGBench}, the inaugural
TSG Benchmark, designed for a unified and comprehensive assessment of TSG
methods. It comprises three modules: (1) a curated collection of publicly
available, real-world datasets tailored for TSG, together with a standardized
preprocessing pipeline; (2) a comprehensive evaluation measures suite including
vanilla measures, new distance-based assessments, and visualization tools; (3)
a pioneering generalization test rooted in Domain Adaptation (DA), compatible
with all methods. We have conducted extensive experiments across ten real-world
datasets from diverse domains, utilizing ten advanced TSG methods and twelve
evaluation measures, all gauged through \textsf{TSGBench}. The results
highlight its remarkable efficacy and consistency. More importantly,
\textsf{TSGBench} delivers a statistical breakdown of method rankings,
illuminating performance variations across different datasets and measures, and
offering nuanced insights into the effectiveness of each method.]]></summary>

performing almost on par with VTM-20.0 on the distortion end. EGIC is simple to

several image analysis tasks in the computer-aided diagnosis scheme for
mammography. The training of an efficacious deep learning model requires large
data with diverse styles and qualities. The diversity of data often comes from
the use of various scanners of vendors. But, in practice, it is impractical to
collect a sufficient amount of diverse data for training. To this end, a novel
contrastive learning is developed to equip the deep learning models with better
style generalization capability. Specifically, the multi-style and multi-view
unsupervised self-learning scheme is carried out to seek robust feature
embedding against style diversity as a pretrained model. Afterward, the
pretrained network is further fine-tuned to the downstream tasks, e.g., mass
detection, matching, BI-RADS rating, and breast density classification. The
proposed method has been evaluated extensively and rigorously with mammograms
from various vendor style domains and several public datasets. The experimental
results suggest that the proposed domain generalization method can effectively
improve performance of four mammographic image tasks on the data from both seen
and unseen domains, and outperform many state-of-the-art (SOTA) generalization
methods.]]></summary>

adversarial robustness of deep learning models. These methods are based on a
new class of optimal-transport-regularized divergences, constructed via an
infimal convolution between an information divergence and an optimal-transport
(OT) cost. We use these as tools to enhance adversarial robustness by
maximizing the expected loss over a neighborhood of distributions, a technique
known as distributionally robust optimization. Viewed as a tool for
constructing adversarial samples, our method allows samples to be both
transported, according to the OT cost, and re-weighted, according to the
information divergence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on
malware detection and image recognition applications and find that, to our
knowledge, it outperforms existing methods at enhancing the robustness against

model heterogeneity in federated learning, where clients possess models with
different network structures. To track this problem, we propose a novel
framework called pFedHR, which leverages heterogeneous model reassembly to
achieve personalized federated learning. In particular, we approach the problem
of heterogeneous model personalization as a model-matching optimization task on
the server side. Moreover, pFedHR automatically and dynamically generates
informative and diverse personalized candidates with minimal human
intervention. Furthermore, our proposed heterogeneous model reassembly
technique mitigates the adverse impact introduced by using public data with
different distributions from the client data to a certain extent. Experimental
results demonstrate that pFedHR outperforms baselines on three datasets under
both IID and Non-IID settings. Additionally, pFedHR effectively reduces the
adverse impact of using different public data and dynamically generates diverse

outcome, the "dose response", is relevant in a variety of domains, from
healthcare to business, economics, and beyond. Such effects, also known as
continuous-valued treatment effects, are typically estimated from observational
data, which may be subject to dose selection bias. This means that the
allocation of doses depends on pre-treatment covariates. Previous studies have
shown that conventional machine learning approaches fail to learn accurate
individual estimates of dose responses under the presence of dose selection
bias. In this work, we propose CBRNet, a causal machine learning approach to
estimate an individual dose response from observational data. CBRNet adopts the
Neyman-Rubin potential outcome framework and extends the concept of balanced
representation learning for overcoming selection bias to continuous-valued
treatments. Our work is the first to apply representation balancing in a
continuous-valued treatment setting. We evaluate our method on a newly proposed
benchmark. Our experiments demonstrate CBRNet's ability to accurately learn
treatment effects under selection bias and competitive performance with respect
to other state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

networks on graph-structured data. In this paper, we introduce a simple, yet
very effective graph convolutional network with skip connections for
semi-supervised anomaly detection. The proposed layerwise propagation rule of
our model is theoretically motivated by the concept of implicit fairing in
geometry processing, and comprises a graph convolution module for aggregating
information from immediate node neighbors and a skip connection module for
combining layer-wise neighborhood representations. This propagation rule is
derived from the iterative solution of the implicit fairing equation via the
Jacobi method. In addition to capturing information from distant graph nodes
through skip connections between the network's layers, our approach exploits
both the graph structure and node features for learning discriminative node
representations. These skip connections are integrated by design in our
proposed network architecture. The effectiveness of our model is demonstrated
through extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, achieving better or
comparable anomaly detection results against strong baseline methods. We also
demonstrate through an ablation study that skip connection helps improve the

only to restart the process over again once new data becomes available. A much
cheaper and more efficient solution would be to enable the continual
pre-training of these models, i.e. updating pre-trained models with new data
instead of re-training them from scratch. However, the distribution shift
induced by novel data typically results in degraded performance on past data.
Taking a step towards efficient continual pre-training, in this work, we
examine the effect of different warm-up strategies. Our hypothesis is that the
learning rate must be re-increased to improve compute efficiency when training
on a new dataset. We study the warmup phase of models pre-trained on the Pile
(upstream data, 300B tokens) as we continue to pre-train on SlimPajama
(downstream data, 297B tokens), following a linear warmup and cosine decay
schedule. We conduct all experiments on the Pythia 410M language model
architecture and evaluate performance through validation perplexity. We
experiment with different pre-training checkpoints, various maximum learning
rates, and various warmup lengths. Our results show that while rewarming models
first increases the loss on upstream and downstream data, in the longer run it
improves the downstream performance, outperforming models trained from

improve the handling of missing data in decision tree regressors and
classifiers. Unlike other approaches, the Trinary decision tree does not assume
that missing values contain any information about the response. Both
theoretical calculations on estimator bias and numerical illustrations using
real data sets are presented to compare its performance with established
algorithms in different missing data scenarios (Missing Completely at Random

outperforms its peers in MCAR settings, especially when data is only missing
out-of-sample, while lacking behind in IM settings. A hybrid model, the
TrinaryMIA tree, which combines the Trinary tree and the Missing In Attributes

the potential drawback of slower training speed, the Trinary tree offers a

for quantum-enhanced support vector machines, a kernel-based classifier,
enabling access to high-dimensional Hilbert space. Our method employs a
multi-objective genetic algorithm that simultaneously maximizes classification
accuracy while minimizing both the local and non-local gate costs of the
quantum feature map's circuit. To achieve this, we define distinct fitness
functions for local gates and entanglement gates. Comparisons with classical
classifiers are given in order to understand the advantages of using quantum
machine learning. Surprisingly, our experiments reveal that the optimal
configuration of quantum circuits for the quantum kernel method incorporates a
proportional number of non-local gates for entanglement, contrary to previous
literature where non-local gates were largely suppressed.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that the separability indexes of data can be
effectively leveraged to determine the number of non-local gates required for
the quantum support vector machine's feature maps. This insight can
significantly aid in selecting appropriate parameters, such as the entanglement
parameter, in various quantum programming packages like quiskit.org based on
data analysis. Our findings offer valuable guidance for enhancing the

applications, where graphs can represent various multimedia data types such as
images, videos, and social networks. Previous efforts have applied graph neural
networks (GNNs) in balanced situations where the class distribution is
balanced. However, real-world data typically exhibit long-tailed class
distributions, resulting in a bias towards the head classes when using GNNs and
limited generalization ability over the tail classes. Recent approaches mainly
focus on re-balancing different classes during model training, which fails to
explicitly introduce new knowledge and sacrifices the performance of the head
classes. To address these drawbacks, we propose a novel framework called
Retrieval Augmented Hybrid Network (RAHNet) to jointly learn a robust feature
extractor and an unbiased classifier in a decoupled manner. In the feature
extractor training stage, we develop a graph retrieval module to search for
relevant graphs that directly enrich the intra-class diversity for the tail
classes. Moreover, we innovatively optimize a category-centered supervised
contrastive loss to obtain discriminative representations, which is more
suitable for long-tailed scenarios. In the classifier fine-tuning stage, we
balance the classifier weights with two weight regularization techniques, i.e.,
Max-norm and weight decay. Experiments on various popular benchmarks verify the
superiority of the proposed method against state-of-the-art approaches.]]></summary>

each step, they adequately tune the interaction of biomechanical muscle
dynamics and neuronal signals to be robust against uncertainties in ground
conditions. However, it is still not fully understood how the nervous system
resolves the musculoskeletal redundancy to solve the multi-objective control
problem considering stability, robustness, and energy efficiency. In computer
simulations, energy minimization has been shown to be a successful optimization
target, reproducing natural walking with trajectory optimization or
reflex-based control methods. However, these methods focus on particular
motions at a time and the resulting controllers are limited when compensating
for perturbations. In robotics, reinforcement learning~(RL) methods recently
achieved highly stable (and efficient) locomotion on quadruped systems, but the
generation of human-like walking with bipedal biomechanical models has required
extensive use of expert data sets. This strong reliance on demonstrations often
results in brittle policies and limits the application to new behaviors,
especially considering the potential variety of movements for high-dimensional
musculoskeletal models in 3D. Achieving natural locomotion with RL without
sacrificing its incredible robustness might pave the way for a novel approach

compute-hungry, short, high-resolution simulations to ML emulators. However,
this hybrid ML-physics simulation approach requires domain-specific treatment
and has been inaccessible to ML experts because of lack of training data and
relevant, easy-to-use workflows. We present ClimSim, the largest-ever dataset

simulations, developed by a consortium of climate scientists and ML
researchers. It consists of 5.7 billion pairs of multivariate input and output
vectors that isolate the influence of locally-nested, high-resolution,
high-fidelity physics on a host climate simulator's macro-scale physical state.

The dataset is global in coverage, spans multiple years at high sampling
frequency, and is designed such that resulting emulators are compatible with
downstream coupling into operational climate simulators. We implement a range
of deterministic and stochastic regression baselines to highlight the ML
challenges and their scoring. The data

which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the
theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly
understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we
explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\boldsymbol{X})=\langle
\boldsymbol{Xv}, \texttt{softmax}(\boldsymbol{XWp})\rangle$, where
$\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and
$(\boldsymbol{v},\boldsymbol{W},\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We
prove that running gradient descent on $\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently
$\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that
separates $\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly
formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our
results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize
$\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings
$\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader
regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of
attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\boldsymbol{v}$
and $\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions
under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective
hard-margin SVM solutions where $\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features
based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\boldsymbol{p}$
is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we
verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.]]></summary>

learning of single index models, i.e. functions that depend on a 1-dimensional
projection of the input data, is governed by their information exponent.
However, these results are only concerned with isotropic data, while in
practice the input often contains additional structure which can implicitly
guide the algorithm. In this work, we investigate the effect of a spiked
covariance structure and reveal several interesting phenomena. First, we show
that in the anisotropic setting, the commonly used spherical gradient dynamics
may fail to recover the true direction, even when the spike is perfectly
aligned with the target direction. Next, we show that appropriate weight
normalization that is reminiscent of batch normalization can alleviate this
issue. Further, by exploiting the alignment between the (spiked) input
covariance and the target, we obtain improved sample complexity compared to the
isotropic case. In particular, under the spiked model with a suitably large
spike, the sample complexity of gradient-based training can be made independent
of the information exponent while also outperforming lower bounds for
rotationally invariant kernel methods.]]></summary>

scientific and engineering disciplines. However, traditional numerical solvers
are limited by the choice of step sizes when estimating integration, resulting
in a trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency. To address this

(NeurVec), which can compensate for integration errors and enable larger time
step sizes in simulations. Our extensive experiments on a variety of complex
dynamical system benchmarks demonstrate that NeurVec exhibits remarkable
generalization capability on a continuous phase space, even when trained using
limited and discrete data. NeurVec significantly accelerates traditional
solvers, achieving speeds tens to hundreds of times faster while maintaining
high levels of accuracy and stability. Moreover, NeurVec's simple-yet-effective

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the last decades, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has been intensively
studied by the Machine Learning community. Despite its versatility and
excellent performance, the optimization of large models via SGD still is a
time-consuming task. To reduce training time, it is common to distribute the
training process across multiple devices. Recently, it has been shown that the
convergence of asynchronous SGD (ASGD) will always be faster than mini-batch
SGD. However, despite these improvements in the theoretical bounds, most ASGD
convergence-rate proofs still rely on a centralized parameter server, which is
prone to become a bottleneck when scaling out the gradient computations across
many distributed processes.

In this paper, we present a novel convergence-rate analysis for decentralized
and asynchronous SGD (DASGD) which does not require partial synchronization
among nodes nor restrictive network topologies. Specifically, we provide a
bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sigma\epsilon^{-2}) +
\mathcal{O}(QS_{avg}\epsilon^{-3/2}) + \mathcal{O}(S_{avg}\epsilon^{-1})$ for
the convergence rate of DASGD, where $S_{avg}$ is the average staleness between
models, $Q$ is a constant that bounds the norm of the gradients, and $\epsilon$
is a (small) error that is allowed within the bound. Furthermore, when
gradients are not bounded, we prove the convergence rate of DASGD to be
$\mathcal{O}(\sigma\epsilon^{-2}) +
\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\hat{S}_{avg}\hat{S}_{max}}\epsilon^{-1})$, with
$\hat{S}_{max}$ and $\hat{S}_{avg}$ representing a loose version of the average
and maximum staleness, respectively. Our convergence proof holds for a fixed
stepsize and any non-convex, homogeneous, and L-smooth objective function. We
anticipate that our results will be of high relevance for the adoption of DASGD
by a broad community of researchers and developers.]]></summary>

diverse range of activation functions. An activation function set $\mathscr{A}$
is defined to encompass the majority of commonly used activation functions,

\mathscr{A}$, a $\mathtt{ReLU}$ network of width $N$ and depth $L$ can be
approximated to arbitrary precision by a $\varrho$-activated network of width
$4N$ and depth $2L$ on any bounded set. This finding enables the extension of

to hallucinations, i.e., generating content that deviates from facts seen
during pretraining. We propose a simple decoding strategy for reducing
hallucinations with pretrained LLMs that does not require conditioning on

the next-token distribution by contrasting the differences in logits obtained
from projecting the later layers versus earlier layers to the vocabulary space,
exploiting the fact that factual knowledge in an LLMs has generally been shown
to be localized to particular transformer layers. We find that this Decoding by
Contrasting Layers (DoLa) approach is able to better surface factual knowledge
and reduce the generation of incorrect facts. DoLa consistently improves the
truthfulness across multiple choices tasks and open-ended generation tasks, for
example improving the performance of LLaMA family models on TruthfulQA by
12-17% absolute points, demonstrating its potential in making LLMs reliably

based on which we provide two recipes for producing classes of
one-hidden-neuron NNs that provably cannot be fully characterized by a type of

square interpolator exhibits unbounded test errors when dealing with noisy
data. In this paper, we study how ensemble stabilizes and thus improves the
generalization performance, measured by the out-of-sample prediction risk, of
an individual interpolator. We focus on bagged linear interpolators, as bagging
is a popular randomization-based ensemble method that can be implemented in
parallel. We introduce the multiplier-bootstrap-based bagged least square
estimator, which can then be formulated as an average of the sketched least
square estimators. The proposed multiplier bootstrap encompasses the classical
bootstrap with replacement as a special case, along with a more intriguing
variant which we call the Bernoulli bootstrap.

Focusing on the proportional regime where the sample size scales
proportionally with the feature dimensionality, we investigate the
out-of-sample prediction risks of the sketched and bagged least square
estimators in both underparametrized and overparameterized regimes. Our results
reveal the statistical roles of sketching and bagging. In particular, sketching
modifies the aspect ratio and shifts the interpolation threshold of the minimum
$\ell_2$ norm estimator. However, the risk of the sketched estimator continues
to be unbounded around the interpolation threshold due to excessive variance.
In stark contrast, bagging effectively mitigates this variance, leading to a
bounded limiting out-of-sample prediction risk. To further understand this
stability improvement property, we establish that bagging acts as a form of
implicit regularization, substantiated by the equivalence of the bagged
estimator with its explicitly regularized counterpart. We also discuss several
extensions.]]></summary>

diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as of 5 pathological controls
have been collected and analysed by Raman spectroscopy (RS). We investigated
whether the raw and preprocessed Raman spectra could be used to distinguish AD
from controls. First, we applied standard Machine Learning (ML) methods
obtaining unsatisfactory results. Then, we applied ML to a set of topological
descriptors extracted from raw spectra, achieving a very good classification
accuracy (>87%). Although our results are preliminary, they indicate that RS
and topological analysis together may provide an effective combination to
confirm or disprove a clinical diagnosis of AD. The next steps will include
enlarging the dataset of CSF samples to validate the proposed method better
and, possibly, to understand if topological data analysis could support the
characterization of AD subtypes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep metric learning (DML) aims to minimize empirical expected loss of the
pairwise intra-/inter- class proximity violations in the embedding space. We
relate DML to feasibility problem of finite chance constraints. We show that
minimizer of proxy-based DML satisfies certain chance constraints, and that the
worst case generalization performance of the proxy-based methods can be
characterized by the radius of the smallest ball around a class proxy to cover
the entire domain of the corresponding class samples, suggesting multiple
proxies per class helps performance. To provide a scalable algorithm as well as
exploiting more proxies, we consider the chance constraints implied by the
minimizers of proxy-based DML instances and reformulate DML as finding a
feasible point in intersection of such constraints, resulting in a problem to
be approximately solved by iterative projections. Simply put, we repeatedly
train a regularized proxy-based loss and re-initialize the proxies with the
embeddings of the deliberately selected new samples. We applied our method with
4 well-accepted DML losses and show the effectiveness with extensive
evaluations on 4 popular DML benchmarks. Code is available at:

from exploding and vanishing gradient problems. Numerous solutions have been
proposed such as normalisation techniques or limiting activation functions to
linear rectifying units. In this work we follow a different approach which is
particularly applicable to closed-loop learning of forward models where
back-propagation makes exclusive use of the sign of the error signal to prime
the learning, whilst a global relevance signal modulates the rate of learning.
This is inspired by the interaction between local plasticity and a global
neuromodulation. For example, whilst driving on an empty road, one can allow
for slow step-wise optimisation of actions, whereas, at a busy junction, an
error must be corrected at once. Hence, the error is the priming signal and the
intensity of the experience is a modulating factor in the weight change. The
advantages of this Prime and Modulate paradigm is twofold: it is free from
normalisation and it makes use of relevant cues from the environment to enrich
the learning. We present a mathematical derivation of the learning rule in
z-space and demonstrate the real-time performance with a robotic platform. The
results show a significant improvement in the speed of convergence compared to
that of the conventional back-propagation.]]></summary>

intelligence whose bottlenecks include huge computational expenses, power, and

show that fault-tolerant quantum computing could possibly provide provably
efficient resolutions for generic (stochastic) gradient descent algorithms,
scaling as $\mathcal{O}(T^2 \times \text{polylog}(n))$, where $n$ is the size
of the models and $T$ is the number of iterations in the training, as long as
the models are both sufficiently dissipative and sparse, with small learning
rates. Based on earlier efficient quantum algorithms for dissipative
differential equations, we find and prove that similar algorithms work for
(stochastic) gradient descent, the primary algorithm for machine learning. In
practice, we benchmark instances of large machine learning models from 7
million to 103 million parameters. We find that, in the context of sparse
training, a quantum enhancement is possible at the early stage of learning
after model pruning, motivating a sparse parameter download and re-upload

been recently extended to exploit prior knowledge on the cardinality of each
cluster. Such knowledge is used to increase performance as well as solution
quality. In this paper, we propose a global optimization approach based on the
branch-and-cut technique to solve the cardinality-constrained MSSC. For the
lower bound routine, we use the semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation
recently proposed by Rujeerapaiboon et al. [SIAM J. Optim. 29(2), 1211-1239,
(2019)]. However, this relaxation can be used in a branch-and-cut method only
for small-size instances. Therefore, we derive a new SDP relaxation that scales
better with the instance size and the number of clusters. In both cases, we
strengthen the bound by adding polyhedral cuts. Benefiting from a tailored
branching strategy which enforces pairwise constraints, we reduce the
complexity of the problems arising in the children nodes. For the upper bound,
instead, we present a local search procedure that exploits the solution of the
SDP relaxation solved at each node. Computational results show that the
proposed algorithm globally solves, for the first time, real-world instances of
size 10 times larger than those solved by state-of-the-art exact methods.]]></summary>

attributed to the areas of Statistics and Machine Learning in order to obtain
the benefits of both approaches. In this article, the statistical technique
lasso for variable selection is represented through a neural network. It is
observed that, although both the statistical approach and its neural version
have the same objective function, they differ due to their optimization. In
particular, the neural version is usually optimized in one-step using a single
validation set, while the statistical counterpart uses a two-step optimization
based on cross-validation. The more elaborated optimization of the statistical
method results in more accurate parameter estimation, especially when the
training set is small. For this reason, a modification of the standard approach
for training neural networks, that mimics the statistical framework, is
proposed. During the development of the above modification, a new optimization
algorithm for identifying the significant variables emerged. Experimental

a specified region in the original scene. We allow local editing by localizing
a 3D ROI box in the input scene, and blend the content synthesized inside the

obtain natural looking and view-consistent results, we leverage existing and
new geometric priors and 3D augmentations for improving the visual fidelity of
the final result. We test our framework both qualitatively and quantitatively

pre-training has shown a remarkable potential to boost the performance of
fundamental models in 2D vision. However, in 3D vision, the over-reliance on
Transformer-based backbones and the unordered nature of point clouds have
restricted the further development of generative pre-training. In this paper,
we propose a novel 3D-to-2D generative pre-training method that is adaptable to
any point cloud model. We propose to generate view images from different
instructed poses via the cross-attention mechanism as the pre-training scheme.
Generating view images has more precise supervision than its point cloud
counterpart, thus assisting 3D backbones to have a finer comprehension of the
geometrical structure and stereoscopic relations of the point cloud.
Experimental results have proved the superiority of our proposed 3D-to-2D
generative pre-training over previous pre-training methods. Our method is also
effective in boosting the performance of architecture-oriented approaches,

like robotic teleoperation given noisy, high-dimensional command signals (e.g.,
from a brain-computer interface). Recent advances in human-in-the-loop machine
learning enable such systems to improve by interacting with users, but tend to
be limited by the amount of data that they can collect from individual users in
practice. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm to
address this by training an interface to map raw command signals to actions
using a combination of offline pre-training and online fine-tuning. To address
the challenges posed by noisy command signals and sparse rewards, we develop a
novel method for representing and inferring the user's long-term intent for a
given trajectory. We primarily evaluate our method's ability to assist users
who can only communicate through noisy, high-dimensional input channels through
a user study in which 12 participants performed a simulated navigation task by
using their eye gaze to modulate a 128-dimensional command signal from their
webcam. The results show that our method enables successful goal navigation
more often than a baseline directional interface, by learning to denoise user
commands signals and provide shared autonomy assistance. We further evaluate on
a simulated Sawyer pushing task with eye gaze control, and the Lunar Lander
game with simulated user commands, and find that our method improves over
baseline interfaces in these domains as well. Extensive ablation experiments
with simulated user commands empirically motivate each component of our method.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) relying only on image-level
supervision is a promising approach to deal with the need for Segmentation
networks, especially for generating a large number of pixel-wise masks in a
given dataset. However, most state-of-the-art image-level WSSS techniques lack
an understanding of the geometric features embedded in the images since the
network cannot derive any object boundary information from just image-level
labels. We define a boundary here as the line separating an object and its
background, or two different objects. To address this drawback, we are
proposing our novel ReFit framework, which deploys state-of-the-art class
activation maps combined with various post-processing techniques in order to
achieve fine-grained higher-accuracy segmentation masks. To achieve this, we
investigate a state-of-the-art unsupervised segmentation network that can be
used to construct a boundary map, which enables ReFit to predict object
locations with sharper boundaries. By applying our method to WSSS predictions,
we achieved up to 10% improvement over the current state-of-the-art WSSS
methods for medical imaging. The framework is open-source, to ensure that our
results are reproducible, and accessible online at

do not provide an estimate of the probability density around the samples.
However, it has been noted that maximizing the log-likelihood within an
energy-based setting can lead to an adversarial framework where the
discriminator provides unnormalized density (often called energy). We further
develop this perspective, incorporate importance sampling, and show that 1)
Wasserstein GAN performs a biased estimate of the partition function, and we
propose instead to use an unbiased estimator; and 2) when optimizing for
likelihood, one must maximize generator entropy. This is hypothesized to
provide a better mode coverage. Different from previous works, we explicitly
compute the density of the generated samples. This is the key enabler to
designing an unbiased estimator of the partition function and computation of
the generator entropy term. The generator density is obtained via a new type of
flow network, called one-way flow network, that is less constrained in terms of
architecture, as it does not require a tractable inverse function. Our
experimental results show that our method converges faster, produces comparable
sample quality to GANs with similar architecture, successfully avoids
over-fitting to commonly used datasets and produces smooth low-dimensional
latent representations of the training data.]]></summary>

large language model (LLM)-based agents such as GPT-4. However, many commercial
conversational agent development tools are pipeline-based and have limitations
in holding a human-like conversation. This paper investigates the capabilities
of LLMs to enhance pipeline-based conversational agents during two phases: 1)
in the design and development phase and 2) during operations. In 1) LLMs can
aid in generating training data, extracting entities and synonyms,
localization, and persona design. In 2) LLMs can assist in contextualization,
intent classification to prevent conversational breakdown and handle
out-of-scope questions, auto-correcting utterances, rephrasing responses,
formulating disambiguation questions, summarization, and enabling closed
question-answering capabilities. We conducted informal experiments with GPT-4
in the private banking domain to demonstrate the scenarios above with a
practical example. Companies may be hesitant to replace their pipeline-based
agents with LLMs entirely due to privacy concerns and the need for deep
integration within their existing ecosystems. A hybrid approach in which LLMs'
are integrated into the pipeline-based agents allows them to save time and
costs of building and running agents by capitalizing on the capabilities of
LLMs while retaining the integration and privacy safeguards of their existing

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Distribution shifts are all too common in real-world applications of machine
learning. Domain adaptation (DA) aims to address this by providing various
frameworks for adapting models to the deployment data without using labels.
However, the domain shift scenario raises a second more subtle challenge: the
difficulty of performing hyperparameter optimisation (HPO) for these adaptation
algorithms without access to a labelled validation set. The unclear validation
protocol for DA has led to bad practices in the literature, such as performing
HPO using the target test labels when, in real-world scenarios, they are not
available. This has resulted in over-optimism about DA research progress
compared to reality. In this paper, we analyse the state of DA when using good
evaluation practice, by benchmarking a suite of candidate validation criteria
and using them to assess popular adaptation algorithms. We show that there are
challenges across all three branches of domain adaptation methodology including
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA), Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA), and
Test Time Adaptation (TTA). While the results show that realistically
achievable performance is often worse than expected, they also show that using
proper validation splits is beneficial, as well as showing that some previously
unexplored validation metrics provide the best options to date. Altogether, our
improved practices covering data, training, validation and hyperparameter
optimisation form a new rigorous pipeline to improve benchmarking, and hence
research progress, within this important field going forward.]]></summary>

costly because it needs many forward and reverse steps. We propose a faster and
cheaper approach that adds noise not until the data become pure random noise,
but until they reach a hidden noisy data distribution that we can confidently
learn. Then, we use fewer reverse steps to generate data by starting from this
hidden distribution that is made similar to the noisy data. We reveal that the
proposed model can be cast as an adversarial auto-encoder empowered by both the
diffusion process and a learnable implicit prior. Experimental results show
even with a significantly smaller number of reverse diffusion steps, the

rely on Gaussian process inference. Unfortunately, Gaussian process inference
scales cubically with the number of data points, limiting applicability to

in the presence of computational-statistical gaps. We begin by considering
offline sparse parity learning, a supervised classification problem which
admits a statistical query lower bound for gradient-based training of a
multilayer perceptron. This lower bound can be interpreted as a multi-resource
tradeoff frontier: successful learning can only occur if one is sufficiently
rich (large model), knowledgeable (large dataset), patient (many training
iterations), or lucky (many random guesses). We show, theoretically and
experimentally, that sparse initialization and increasing network width yield
significant improvements in sample efficiency in this setting. Here, width
plays the role of parallel search: it amplifies the probability of finding
"lottery ticket" neurons, which learn sparse features more sample-efficiently.
Finally, we show that the synthetic sparse parity task can be useful as a proxy
for real problems requiring axis-aligned feature learning. We demonstrate
improved sample efficiency on tabular classification benchmarks by using wide,

Nano Board and experimented with it with six applications, including two
self-designed and four benchmark applications. Under different deadline
constraints, our approach can quickly derive a DVFS governor that can adapt to
performance requirements and outperform the built-in Linux approach in energy
saving. On Mibench workloads, with performance slack ranging from 0.04 s to 0.4
s, the proposed method can save 3% - 11% more energy compared to Ondemand.
AudioReg and FaceReg applications tested have 5%- 14% energy-saving
improvement. We have open-sourced the implementation of our in-kernel quantized
neural network engine. The codebase can be found at:

applications due to their high energy and power density. Their market was
estimated to be up to 48 billion U.S. dollars in 2022. However, the widespread
adoption of Li-ion batteries has resulted in counterfeit cell production, which
can pose safety hazards to users. Counterfeit cells can cause explosions or
fires, and their prevalence in the market makes it difficult for users to
detect fake cells. Indeed, current battery authentication methods can be
susceptible to advanced counterfeiting techniques and are often not adaptable
to various cells and systems. In this paper, we improve the state of the art on
battery authentication by proposing two novel methodologies, DCAuth and
EISthentication, which leverage the internal characteristics of each cell
through Machine Learning models. Our methods automatically authenticate
lithium-ion battery models and architectures using data from their regular
usage without the need for any external device. They are also resilient to the
most common and critical counterfeit practices and can scale to several
batteries and devices. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed
methodologies, we analyze time-series data from a total of 20 datasets that we
have processed to extract meaningful features for our analysis. Our methods
achieve high accuracy in battery authentication for both architectures (up to
0.99) and models (up to 0.96). Moreover, our methods offer comparable
identification performances. By using our proposed methodologies, manufacturers
can ensure that devices only use legitimate batteries, guaranteeing the
operational state of any system and safety measures for the users.]]></summary>

events over time. We ask a relatively basic question: how might we compare
these forecasters, either online or post-hoc, while avoiding unverifiable
assumptions on how the forecasts and outcomes were generated? In this paper, we
present a rigorous answer to this question by designing novel sequential
inference procedures for estimating the time-varying difference in forecast
scores. To do this, we employ confidence sequences (CS), which are sequences of
confidence intervals that can be continuously monitored and are valid at
arbitrary data-dependent stopping times ("anytime-valid"). The widths of our
CSs are adaptive to the underlying variance of the score differences.
Underlying their construction is a game-theoretic statistical framework, in
which we further identify e-processes and p-processes for sequentially testing
a weak null hypothesis -- whether one forecaster outperforms another on average
(rather than always). Our methods do not make distributional assumptions on the
forecasts or outcomes; our main theorems apply to any bounded scores, and we
later provide alternative methods for unbounded scores. We empirically validate
our approaches by comparing real-world baseball and weather forecasters.]]></summary>

the ranking matches the observations? This problem, known as rank aggregation,
has found many applications in sports, recommendation systems, and other web
applications. As it is generally NP-hard to find a global ranking that
minimizes the mismatch (known as the Kemeny optimization), we focus on the
Erd\"os-R\'enyi outliers (ERO) model for this ranking problem. Here, each
pairwise comparison is a corrupted copy of the true score difference. We
investigate spectral ranking algorithms that are based on unnormalized and
normalized data matrices. The key is to understand their performance in
recovering the underlying scores of each item from the observed data. This
reduces to deriving an entry-wise perturbation error bound between the top
eigenvectors of the unnormalized/normalized data matrix and its population
counterpart. By using the leave-one-out technique, we provide a sharper
$\ell_{\infty}$-norm perturbation bound of the eigenvectors and also derive an
error bound on the maximum displacement for each item, with only $\Omega(n\log
n)$ samples. Our theoretical analysis improves upon the state-of-the-art
results in terms of sample complexity, and our numerical experiments confirm

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Interpolators are unstable. For example, the mininum $\ell_2$ norm least
square interpolator exhibits unbounded test errors when dealing with noisy
data. In this paper, we study how ensemble stabilizes and thus improves the
generalization performance, measured by the out-of-sample prediction risk, of
an individual interpolator. We focus on bagged linear interpolators, as bagging
is a popular randomization-based ensemble method that can be implemented in
parallel. We introduce the multiplier-bootstrap-based bagged least square
estimator, which can then be formulated as an average of the sketched least
square estimators. The proposed multiplier bootstrap encompasses the classical
bootstrap with replacement as a special case, along with a more intriguing
variant which we call the Bernoulli bootstrap.

Focusing on the proportional regime where the sample size scales
proportionally with the feature dimensionality, we investigate the
out-of-sample prediction risks of the sketched and bagged least square
estimators in both underparametrized and overparameterized regimes. Our results
reveal the statistical roles of sketching and bagging. In particular, sketching
modifies the aspect ratio and shifts the interpolation threshold of the minimum
$\ell_2$ norm estimator. However, the risk of the sketched estimator continues
to be unbounded around the interpolation threshold due to excessive variance.
In stark contrast, bagging effectively mitigates this variance, leading to a
bounded limiting out-of-sample prediction risk. To further understand this
stability improvement property, we establish that bagging acts as a form of
implicit regularization, substantiated by the equivalence of the bagged
estimator with its explicitly regularized counterpart. We also discuss several
extensions.]]></summary>

(KG) that incorporates the dimension of time. Reasoning on TKGs is a crucial
task that aims to predict future facts based on historical occurrences. The key
challenge lies in uncovering structural dependencies within historical
subgraphs and temporal patterns. Most existing approaches model TKGs relying on
entity modeling, as nodes in the graph play a crucial role in knowledge
representation. However, the real-world scenario often involves an extensive
number of entities, with new entities emerging over time. This makes it
challenging for entity-dependent methods to cope with extensive volumes of
entities, and effectively handling newly emerging entities also becomes a
significant challenge. Therefore, we propose Temporal Inductive Path Neural
Network (TiPNN), which models historical information in an entity-independent
perspective. Specifically, TiPNN adopts a unified graph, namely history
temporal graph, to comprehensively capture and encapsulate information from
history. Subsequently, we utilize the defined query-aware temporal paths to
model historical path information related to queries on history temporal graph
for the reasoning. Extensive experiments illustrate that the proposed model not
only attains significant performance enhancements but also handles inductive
settings, while additionally facilitating the provision of reasoning evidence
through history temporal graphs.]]></summary>

However, learning the value function via bootstrapping often leads to unstable
training due to fast-changing target values. Target Networks are employed to
stabilize training by using an additional set of lagging parameters to estimate
the target values. Despite the popularity of Target Networks, their effect on
the optimization is still misunderstood. In this work, we show that they act as
an implicit regularizer which can be beneficial in some cases, but also have
disadvantages such as being inflexible and can result in instabilities, even
when vanilla TD(0) converges. To overcome these issues, we propose an explicit
Functional Regularization alternative that is flexible and a convex regularizer
in function space and we theoretically study its convergence. We conduct an
experimental study across a range of environments, discount factors, and
off-policiness data collections to investigate the effectiveness of the
regularization induced by Target Networks and Functional Regularization in
terms of performance, accuracy, and stability. Our findings emphasize that
Functional Regularization can be used as a drop-in replacement for Target
Networks and result in performance improvement. Furthermore, adjusting both the
regularization weight and the network update period in Functional
Regularization can result in further performance improvements compared to
solely adjusting the network update period as typically done with Target

been recently extended to exploit prior knowledge on the cardinality of each
cluster. Such knowledge is used to increase performance as well as solution
quality. In this paper, we propose a global optimization approach based on the
branch-and-cut technique to solve the cardinality-constrained MSSC. For the
lower bound routine, we use the semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation
recently proposed by Rujeerapaiboon et al. [SIAM J. Optim. 29(2), 1211-1239,
(2019)]. However, this relaxation can be used in a branch-and-cut method only
for small-size instances. Therefore, we derive a new SDP relaxation that scales
better with the instance size and the number of clusters. In both cases, we
strengthen the bound by adding polyhedral cuts. Benefiting from a tailored
branching strategy which enforces pairwise constraints, we reduce the
complexity of the problems arising in the children nodes. For the upper bound,
instead, we present a local search procedure that exploits the solution of the
SDP relaxation solved at each node. Computational results show that the
proposed algorithm globally solves, for the first time, real-world instances of

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Early warnings for dynamical transitions in complex systems or
high-dimensional observation data are essential in many real world
applications, such as gene mutation, brain diseases, natural disasters,
financial crises, and engineering reliability. To effectively extract early
warning signals, we develop a novel approach: the directed anisotropic
diffusion map that captures the latent evolutionary dynamics in low-dimensional
manifold. Applying the methodology to authentic electroencephalogram (EEG)
data, we successfully find the appropriate effective coordinates, and derive
early warning signals capable of detecting the tipping point during the state
transition. Our method bridges the latent dynamics with the original dataset.
The framework is validated to be accurate and effective through numerical
experiments, in terms of density and transition probability. It is shown that
the second coordinate holds meaningful information for critical transition in
various evaluation metrics.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Advances in Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) have almost entirely closed the
gap between SSL and Supervised Learning at a fraction of the number of labels.
However, recent performance improvements have often come \textit{at the cost of
significantly increased training computation}. To address this, we propose
Curriculum Batch Size (CBS), \textit{an unlabeled batch size curriculum which
exploits the natural training dynamics of deep neural networks.} A small
unlabeled batch size is used in the beginning of training and is gradually
increased to the end of training. A fixed curriculum is used regardless of
dataset, model or number of epochs, and reduced training computations is
demonstrated on all settings. We apply CBS, strong labeled augmentation,
Curriculum Pseudo Labeling (CPL) \citep{FlexMatch} to FixMatch \citep{FixMatch}
and term the new SSL algorithm Fast FixMatch. We perform an ablation study to
show that strong labeled augmentation and/or CPL do not significantly reduce
training computations, but, in synergy with CBS, they achieve optimal
performance. Fast FixMatch also achieves substantially higher data utilization
compared to previous state-of-the-art. Fast FixMatch achieves between
$2.1\times$ - $3.4\times$ reduced training computations on CIFAR-10 with all
but 40, 250 and 4000 labels removed, compared to vanilla FixMatch, while
attaining the same cited state-of-the-art error rate \citep{FixMatch}. Similar
results are achieved for CIFAR-100, SVHN and STL-10. Finally, Fast MixMatch
achieves between $2.6\times$ - $3.3\times$ reduced training computations in
federated SSL tasks and online/streaming learning SSL tasks, which further
demonstrate the generializbility of Fast MixMatch to different scenarios and
tasks.]]></summary>

aspect of many applications including classification and clustering. Existing
measures may fail to capture similarities due to local trends (shapes) and may
even produce misleading results. Our goal is to develop a measure that looks
for similar trends occurring around similar times and is easily interpretable
for researchers in applied domains. This is particularly useful for
applications where time-series have a sequence of meaningful local trends that
are ordered, such as in epidemics (a surge to an increase to a peak to a
decrease). We propose a novel measure, DTW+S, which creates an interpretable
"closeness-preserving" matrix representation of the time-series, where each
column represents local trends, and then it applies Dynamic Time Warping to
compute distances between these matrices. We present a theoretical analysis
that supports the choice of this representation. We demonstrate the utility of
DTW+S in ensemble building and clustering of epidemic curves. We also
demonstrate that our approach results in better classification compared to
Dynamic Time Warping for a class of datasets, particularly when local trends
rather than scale play a decisive role.]]></summary>

for fast and accurate estimation of post-physical synthesis circuit delay and
area metrics from pre-physical synthesis circuit netlists. Once trained,
GraPhSyM provides accurate visibility of final design metrics to early EDA
stages, such as logic synthesis, without running the slow physical synthesis
flow, enabling global co-optimization across stages. Additionally, the swift
and precise feedback provided by GraPhSyM is instrumental for
machine-learning-based EDA optimization frameworks. Given a gate-level netlist
of a circuit represented as a graph, GraPhSyM utilizes graph structure,
connectivity, and electrical property features to predict the impact of
physical synthesis transformations such as buffer insertion and gate sizing.
When trained on a dataset of 6000 prefix adder designs synthesized at an
aggressive delay target, GraPhSyM can accurately predict the post-synthesis
delay (98.3%) and area (96.1%) metrics of unseen adders with a fast 0.22s
inference time. Furthermore, we illustrate the compositionality of GraPhSyM by
employing the model trained on a fixed delay target to accurately anticipate
post-synthesis metrics at a variety of unseen delay targets. Lastly, we report
promising generalization capabilities of the GraPhSyM model when it is
evaluated on circuits different from the adders it was exclusively trained on.
The results show the potential for GraPhSyM to serve as a powerful tool for
advanced optimization techniques and as an oracle for EDA machine learning
frameworks.]]></summary>

agent rapidly adapt to various stationary reward functions randomly sampled
from a fixed distribution. In such situations, the successor representation
(SR) is a popular framework which supports rapid policy evaluation by
decoupling a policy's expected discounted, cumulative state occupancies from a
specific reward function. However, in the natural world, sequential tasks are
rarely independent, and instead reflect shifting priorities based on the
availability and subjective perception of rewarding stimuli. Reflecting this
disjunction, in this paper we study the phenomenon of diminishing marginal
utility and introduce a novel state representation, the $\lambda$
representation ($\lambda$R) which, surprisingly, is required for policy
evaluation in this setting and which generalizes the SR as well as several
other state representations from the literature. We establish the $\lambda$R's
formal properties and examine its normative advantages in the context of
machine learning, as well as its usefulness for studying natural behaviors,
particularly foraging.]]></summary>

toward the development of therapeutics for complex diseases such as Alzheimer's
disease (AD). However, most machine learning approaches developed for
prediction of disease progression are either single-task or single-modality
models, which can not be directly adopted to our setting involving multi-task
learning with high dimensional images. Moreover, most of those approaches are
trained on a single dataset (i.e. cohort), which can not be generalized to
other cohorts. We propose a novel multimodal multi-task deep learning model to
predict AD progression by analyzing longitudinal clinical and neuroimaging data
from multiple cohorts. Our proposed model integrates high dimensional MRI
features from a 3D convolutional neural network with other data modalities,
including clinical and demographic information, to predict the future
trajectory of patients. Our model employs an adversarial loss to alleviate the
study-specific imaging bias, in particular the inter-study domain shifts. In
addition, a Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) optimization technique is
applied to further improve model generalization. The proposed model is trained
and tested on various datasets in order to evaluate and validate the results.
Our results showed that 1) our model yields significant improvement over the
baseline models, and 2) models using extracted neuroimaging features from 3D
convolutional neural network outperform the same models when applied to

the interaction between an attacker and a defender as a partially observed
stochastic game. To solve the game we follow an approach where attack and

feasibility of this approach for small infrastructures but do not scale to
realistic scenarios due to the exponential growth in computational complexity
with the infrastructure size. We address this problem by introducing a method
that recursively decomposes the game into subgames which can be solved in
parallel. Applying optimal stopping theory we show that the best response
strategies in these subgames exhibit threshold structures, which allows us to
compute them efficiently. To solve the decomposed game we introduce an
algorithm called Decompositional Fictitious Self-Play (DFSP), which learns Nash
equilibria through stochastic approximation. We evaluate the learned strategies
in an emulation environment where real intrusions and response actions can be
executed. The results show that the learned strategies approximate an

both the perception and production of emotions. The subjectivity of emotions
poses significant challenges in developing accurate and robust computational
models. This thesis examines critical facets of emotion recognition, beginning
with the collection of diverse datasets that account for psychological factors
in emotion production.

To handle the challenge of non-representative training data, this work
collects the Multimodal Stressed Emotion dataset, which introduces controlled
stressors during data collection to better represent real-world influences on
emotion production. To address issues with label subjectivity, this research
comprehensively analyzes how data augmentation techniques and annotation
schemes impact emotion perception and annotator labels. It further handles
natural confounding variables and variations by employing adversarial networks
to isolate key factors like stress from learned emotion representations during
model training. For tackling concerns about leakage of sensitive demographic
variables, this work leverages adversarial learning to strip sensitive
demographic information from multimodal encodings. Additionally, it proposes
optimized sociological evaluation metrics aligned with cost-effective,
real-world needs for model testing.

This research advances robust, practical emotion recognition through
multifaceted studies of challenges in datasets, labels, modeling, demographic
and membership variable encoding in representations, and evaluation. The
groundwork has been laid for cost-effective, generalizable emotion recognition
models that are less likely to encode sensitive demographic information.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Survival analysis is a valuable tool for estimating the time until specific
events, such as death or cancer recurrence, based on baseline observations.
This is particularly useful in healthcare to prognostically predict clinically
important events based on patient data. However, existing approaches often have
limitations; some focus only on ranking patients by survivability, neglecting
to estimate the actual event time, while others treat the problem as a
classification task, ignoring the inherent time-ordered structure of the
events. Furthermore, the effective utilization of censored samples - training
data points where the exact event time is unknown - is essential for improving
the predictive accuracy of the model. In this paper, we introduce CenTime, a
novel approach to survival analysis that directly estimates the time to event.
Our method features an innovative event-conditional censoring mechanism that
performs robustly even when uncensored data is scarce. We demonstrate that our
approach forms a consistent estimator for the event model parameters, even in
the absence of uncensored data. Furthermore, CenTime is easily integrated with
deep learning models with no restrictions on batch size or the number of
uncensored samples. We compare our approach with standard survival analysis
methods, including the Cox proportional-hazard model and DeepHit. Our results
indicate that CenTime offers state-of-the-art performance in predicting
time-to-death while maintaining comparable ranking performance. Our
implementation is publicly available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Causal inference plays a vital role in diverse domains like epidemiology,
healthcare, and economics. De-confounding and counterfactual prediction in
observational data has emerged as a prominent concern in causal inference
research. While existing models tackle observed confounders, the presence of
unobserved confounders remains a significant challenge, distorting causal
inference and impacting counterfactual outcome accuracy. To address this, we
propose a novel variational learning model of unobserved confounders for
counterfactual inference (VLUCI), which generates the posterior distribution of
unobserved confounders. VLUCI relaxes the unconfoundedness assumption often
overlooked by most causal inference methods. By disentangling observed and
unobserved confounders, VLUCI constructs a doubly variational inference model
to approximate the distribution of unobserved confounders, which are used for
inferring more accurate counterfactual outcomes. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate VLUCI's superior performance
in inferring unobserved confounders. It is compatible with state-of-the-art
counterfactual inference models, significantly improving inference accuracy at
both group and individual levels. Additionally, VLUCI provides confidence
intervals for counterfactual outcomes, aiding decision-making in risk-sensitive
domains. We further clarify the considerations when applying VLUCI to cases
where unobserved confounders don't strictly conform to our model assumptions
using the public IHDP dataset as an example, highlighting the practical
advantages of VLUCI.]]></summary>

Handling non-diffuse effects, such as global illumination or cast shadows, has
long been a challenge in face relighting. Prior work often assumes Lambertian
surfaces, simplified lighting models or involves estimating 3D shape, albedo,
or a shadow map. This estimation, however, is error-prone and requires many
training examples with lighting ground truth to generalize well. Our work
bypasses the need for accurate estimation of intrinsic components and can be
trained solely on 2D images without any light stage data, multi-view images, or
lighting ground truth. Our key idea is to leverage a conditional diffusion
implicit model (DDIM) for decoding a disentangled light encoding along with
other encodings related to 3D shape and facial identity inferred from
off-the-shelf estimators. We also propose a novel conditioning technique that
eases the modeling of the complex interaction between light and geometry by
using a rendered shading reference to spatially modulate the DDIM. We achieve
state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmark Multi-PIE and can
photorealistically relight in-the-wild images. Please visit our page:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most common things that a genealogist is tasked with is the
gathering of a person's initial family history, normally via in-person
interviews or with the use of a platform such as ancestry.com, as this can
provide a strong foundation upon which a genealogist may build. However, the
ability to conduct these interviews can often be hindered by both geographical
constraints and the technical proficiency of the interviewee, as the
interviewee in these types of interviews is most often an elderly person with a
lower than average level of technical proficiency. With this in mind, this
study presents what we believe, based on prior research, to be the first
chatbot geared entirely towards the gathering of family histories, and explores
the viability of utilising such a chatbot by comparing the performance and
usability of such a method with the aforementioned alternatives. With a
chatbot-based approach, we show that, though the average time taken to conduct
an interview may be longer than if the user had used ancestry.com or
participated in an in-person interview, the number of mistakes made and the
level of confusion from the user regarding the UI and process required is lower
than the other two methods. Note that the final metric regarding the user's
confusion is not applicable for the in-person interview sessions due to its
lack of a UI. With refinement, we believe this use of a chatbot could be a
valuable tool for genealogists, especially when dealing with interviewees who
are based in other countries where it is not possible to conduct an in-person
interview.]]></summary>

attributed to the areas of Statistics and Machine Learning in order to obtain
the benefits of both approaches. In this article, the statistical technique
lasso for variable selection is represented through a neural network. It is
observed that, although both the statistical approach and its neural version
have the same objective function, they differ due to their optimization. In
particular, the neural version is usually optimized in one-step using a single
validation set, while the statistical counterpart uses a two-step optimization
based on cross-validation. The more elaborated optimization of the statistical
method results in more accurate parameter estimation, especially when the
training set is small. For this reason, a modification of the standard approach
for training neural networks, that mimics the statistical framework, is
proposed. During the development of the above modification, a new optimization
algorithm for identifying the significant variables emerged. Experimental
results, using synthetic and real data sets, show that this new optimization

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The utility of reinforcement learning is limited by the alignment of reward
functions with the interests of human stakeholders. One promising method for
alignment is to learn the reward function from human-generated preferences
between pairs of trajectory segments, a type of reinforcement learning from
human feedback (RLHF). These human preferences are typically assumed to be
informed solely by partial return, the sum of rewards along each segment. We
find this assumption to be flawed and propose modeling human preferences
instead as informed by each segment's regret, a measure of a segment's
deviation from optimal decision-making. Given infinitely many preferences
generated according to regret, we prove that we can identify a reward function
equivalent to the reward function that generated those preferences, and we
prove that the previous partial return model lacks this identifiability
property in multiple contexts. We empirically show that our proposed regret
preference model outperforms the partial return preference model with finite
training data in otherwise the same setting. Additionally, we find that our
proposed regret preference model better predicts real human preferences and
also learns reward functions from these preferences that lead to policies that
are better human-aligned. Overall, this work establishes that the choice of
preference model is impactful, and our proposed regret preference model
provides an improvement upon a core assumption of recent research. We have open
sourced our experimental code, the human preferences dataset we gathered, and
our training and preference elicitation interfaces for gathering a such a
dataset.]]></summary>

mixture of $k$ Gaussians up to total variation distance $\alpha$ while
satisfying $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP. This is the first finite sample

assumptions on the GMMs.

To solve the problem, we devise a new framework which may be useful for other
tasks. On a high level, we show that if a class of distributions (such as
Gaussians) is (1) list decodable and (2) admits a "locally small'' cover
[BKSW19] with respect to total variation distance, then the class of its
mixtures is privately learnable. The proof circumvents a known barrier

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent works have demonstrated that the sample complexity of gradient-based
learning of single index models, i.e. functions that depend on a 1-dimensional
projection of the input data, is governed by their information exponent.
However, these results are only concerned with isotropic data, while in
practice the input often contains additional structure which can implicitly
guide the algorithm. In this work, we investigate the effect of a spiked
covariance structure and reveal several interesting phenomena. First, we show
that in the anisotropic setting, the commonly used spherical gradient dynamics
may fail to recover the true direction, even when the spike is perfectly
aligned with the target direction. Next, we show that appropriate weight
normalization that is reminiscent of batch normalization can alleviate this
issue. Further, by exploiting the alignment between the (spiked) input
covariance and the target, we obtain improved sample complexity compared to the
isotropic case. In particular, under the spiked model with a suitably large
spike, the sample complexity of gradient-based training can be made independent
of the information exponent while also outperforming lower bounds for
rotationally invariant kernel methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Typical technique in knowledge distillation (KD) is regularizing the learning
of a limited capacity model (student) by pushing its responses to match a
powerful model's (teacher). Albeit useful especially in the penultimate layer
and beyond, its action on student's feature transform is rather implicit,
limiting its practice in the intermediate layers. To explicitly embed the
teacher's knowledge in feature transform, we propose a learnable KD layer for
the student which improves KD with two distinct abilities: i) learning how to
leverage the teacher's knowledge, enabling to discard nuisance information, and
ii) feeding forward the transferred knowledge deeper. Thus, the student enjoys
the teacher's knowledge during the inference besides training. Formally, we
repurpose 1x1-BN-ReLU-1x1 convolution block to assign a semantic vector to each
local region according to the template (supervised by the teacher) that the
corresponding region of the student matches. To facilitate template learning in
the intermediate layers, we propose a novel form of supervision based on the
teacher's decisions. Through rigorous experimentation, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach on 3 popular classification benchmarks. Code is

improve the handling of missing data in decision tree regressors and
classifiers. Unlike other approaches, the Trinary decision tree does not assume
that missing values contain any information about the response. Both
theoretical calculations on estimator bias and numerical illustrations using
real data sets are presented to compare its performance with established
algorithms in different missing data scenarios (Missing Completely at Random
(MCAR), and Informative Missingness (IM)). Notably, the Trinary tree
outperforms its peers in MCAR settings, especially when data is only missing
out-of-sample, while lacking behind in IM settings. A hybrid model, the
TrinaryMIA tree, which combines the Trinary tree and the Missing In Attributes
(MIA) approach, shows robust performance in all types of missingness. Despite
the potential drawback of slower training speed, the Trinary tree offers a
promising and more accurate method of handling missing data in decision tree
algorithms.]]></summary>

from real-life patient records by emulating a randomized trial before
individualizing decisions, eg with machine learning. Our framework highlights
the most important pitfalls and considerations in analysing EHRs or claims data
to draw causal conclusions. We illustrate the various choices in studying the

in the presence of computational-statistical gaps. We begin by considering
offline sparse parity learning, a supervised classification problem which
admits a statistical query lower bound for gradient-based training of a
multilayer perceptron. This lower bound can be interpreted as a multi-resource
tradeoff frontier: successful learning can only occur if one is sufficiently
rich (large model), knowledgeable (large dataset), patient (many training
iterations), or lucky (many random guesses). We show, theoretically and
experimentally, that sparse initialization and increasing network width yield
significant improvements in sample efficiency in this setting. Here, width
plays the role of parallel search: it amplifies the probability of finding
"lottery ticket" neurons, which learn sparse features more sample-efficiently.
Finally, we show that the synthetic sparse parity task can be useful as a proxy
for real problems requiring axis-aligned feature learning. We demonstrate
improved sample efficiency on tabular classification benchmarks by using wide,
sparsely-initialized MLP models; these networks sometimes outperform tuned

maximizing the expected loss over a neighborhood of distributions, a technique
known as distributionally robust optimization. Viewed as a tool for
constructing adversarial samples, our method allows samples to be both
transported, according to the OT cost, and re-weighted, according to the

malware detection and image recognition applications and find that, to our
knowledge, it outperforms existing methods at enhancing the robustness against
adversarial attacks. $ARMOR_D$ yields the robustified accuracy of $98.29\%$

learning system using a seemingly inconsequential modification to a piece of
input data. Paradoxically, empirical evidence indicates that even systems which
are robust to large random perturbations of the input data remain susceptible
to small, easily constructed, adversarial perturbations of their inputs. Here,
we show that this may be seen as a fundamental feature of classifiers working
with high dimensional input data. We introduce a simple generic and
generalisable framework for which key behaviours observed in practical systems
arise with high probability -- notably the simultaneous susceptibility of the
(otherwise accurate) model to easily constructed adversarial attacks, and
robustness to random perturbations of the input data. We confirm that the same
phenomena are directly observed in practical neural networks trained on
standard image classification problems, where even large additive random noise
fails to trigger the adversarial instability of the network. A surprising
takeaway is that even small margins separating a classifier's decision surface
from training and testing data can hide adversarial susceptibility from being
detected using randomly sampled perturbations. Counterintuitively, using
additive noise during training or testing is therefore inefficient for
eradicating or detecting adversarial examples, and more demanding adversarial
training is required.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Time series classification is an important data mining task that has received
a lot of interest in the past two decades. Due to the label scarcity in
practice, semi-supervised time series classification with only a few labeled
samples has become popular. Recently, Similarity-aware Time Series
Classification (SimTSC) is proposed to address this problem by using a graph
neural network classification model on the graph generated from pairwise
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance of batch data. It shows excellent accuracy
and outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models in several few-label
settings. However, since SimTSC relies on pairwise DTW distances, the quadratic
complexity of DTW limits its usability to only reasonably sized datasets. To
address this challenge, we propose a new efficient semi-supervised time series
classification technique, LB-SimTSC, with a new graph construction module.
Instead of using DTW, we propose to utilize a lower bound of DTW, LB_Keogh, to
approximate the dissimilarity between instances in linear time, while retaining
the relative proximity relationships one would have obtained via computing DTW.
We construct the pairwise distance matrix using LB_Keogh and build a graph for
the graph neural network. We apply this approach to the ten largest datasets
from the well-known UCR time series classification archive. The results
demonstrate that this approach can be up to 104x faster than SimTSC when
constructing the graph on large datasets without significantly decreasing
classification accuracy.]]></summary>

Finally, we developed a graph embedding protocol to ascertain the structure of
the p-BKG, thereby calculating the relevance scores of those candidates with

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We study the problem of estimating mixtures of Gaussians under the constraint
of differential privacy (DP). Our main result is that $\tilde{O}(k^2 d^4
\log(1/\delta) / \alpha^2 \varepsilon)$ samples are sufficient to estimate a
mixture of $k$ Gaussians up to total variation distance $\alpha$ while
satisfying $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP. This is the first finite sample
complexity upper bound for the problem that does not make any structural
assumptions on the GMMs.

To solve the problem, we devise a new framework which may be useful for other
tasks. On a high level, we show that if a class of distributions (such as
Gaussians) is (1) list decodable and (2) admits a "locally small'' cover
[BKSW19] with respect to total variation distance, then the class of its
mixtures is privately learnable. The proof circumvents a known barrier
indicating that, unlike Gaussians, GMMs do not admit a locally small cover

monitoring and management indispensable. Acoustic traffic monitoring (ATM)
offers a cost-effective and efficient alternative to more computationally

development of acoustic traffic monitoring and vehicle-type classification
algorithms, which contain audio recordings of moving vehicles. The dataset
contain four classes- Trucks, Cars, Motorbikes, and a No-vehicle class.
Additionally, we propose a novel and efficient way to accurately classify these
acoustic signals using cepstrum and spectrum based local and global audio
features, and a multi-input neural network. Experimental results show that our
methodology improves upon the established baselines of previous works and
achieves an accuracy of 91.98% and 96.66% on MVD and MVDA Datasets,

unsupervised manner during training. Understanding how those representations
encode human-interpretable concepts is a fundamental problem. One prominent
approach for the identification of concepts in neural representations is
searching for a linear subspace whose erasure prevents the prediction of the
concept from the representations. However, while many linear erasure algorithms
are tractable and interpretable, neural networks do not necessarily represent
concepts in a linear manner. To identify non-linearly encoded concepts, we
propose a kernelization of a linear minimax game for concept erasure. We
demonstrate that it is possible to prevent specific non-linear adversaries from
predicting the concept. However, the protection does not transfer to different
nonlinear adversaries. Therefore, exhaustively erasing a non-linearly encoded
concept remains an open problem.]]></summary>

improving customer satisfaction by adding personalized value to services.
Behavior analysis reveals both general and detailed patterns in the interaction
of customers with a store items and other people, providing store managers with
insight into customer preferences. Several solutions aim to utilize this data
by recognizing specific behaviors through statistical visualization. However,
current approaches are limited to the analysis of small customer behavior sets,
utilizing conventional methods to detect behaviors. They do not use deep
learning techniques such as deep neural networks, which are powerful methods in
the field of computer vision. Furthermore, these methods provide limited
figures when visualizing the behavioral data acquired by the system. In this
study, we propose a framework that includes three primary parts: mathematical
modeling of customer behaviors, behavior analysis using an efficient deep

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Personalized federated learning has received an upsurge of attention due to
the mediocre performance of conventional federated learning (FL) over
heterogeneous data. Unlike conventional FL which trains a single global
consensus model, personalized FL allows different models for different clients.
However, existing personalized FL algorithms only implicitly transfer the
collaborative knowledge across the federation by embedding the knowledge into
the aggregated model or regularization. We observed that this implicit
knowledge transfer fails to maximize the potential of each client's empirical
risk toward other clients. Based on our observation, in this work, we propose
Personalized Global Federated Learning (PGFed), a novel personalized FL
framework that enables each client to personalize its own global objective by
explicitly and adaptively aggregating the empirical risks of itself and other
clients. To avoid massive (O(N^2)) communication overhead and potential privacy
leakage while achieving this, each client's risk is estimated through a
first-order approximation for other clients' adaptive risk aggregation. On top
of PGFed, we develop a momentum upgrade, dubbed PGFedMo, to more efficiently
utilize clients' empirical risks. Our extensive experiments on four datasets
under different federated settings show consistent improvements of PGFed over
previous state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Labeling neural network submodules with human-legible descriptions is useful
for many downstream tasks: such descriptions can surface failures, guide
interventions, and perhaps even explain important model behaviors. To date,
most mechanistic descriptions of trained networks have involved small models,
narrowly delimited phenomena, and large amounts of human labor. Labeling all
human-interpretable sub-computations in models of increasing size and
complexity will almost certainly require tools that can generate and validate
descriptions automatically. Recently, techniques that use learned models
in-the-loop for labeling have begun to gain traction, but methods for
evaluating their efficacy are limited and ad-hoc. How should we validate and
compare open-ended labeling tools? This paper introduces FIND (Function
INterpretation and Description), a benchmark suite for evaluating the building
blocks of automated interpretability methods. FIND contains functions that
resemble components of trained neural networks, and accompanying descriptions
of the kind we seek to generate. The functions are procedurally constructed
across textual and numeric domains, and involve a range of real-world
complexities, including noise, composition, approximation, and bias. We
evaluate new and existing methods that use language models (LMs) to produce
code-based and language descriptions of function behavior. We find that an
off-the-shelf LM augmented with only black-box access to functions can
sometimes infer their structure, acting as a scientist by forming hypotheses,
proposing experiments, and updating descriptions in light of new data. However,
LM-based descriptions tend to capture global function behavior and miss local
corruptions. These results show that FIND will be useful for characterizing the
performance of more sophisticated interpretability methods before they are
applied to real-world models.]]></summary>

modern media and entertainment sectors, gaming and Augmented/Virtual Reality
industries. Many methods have been proposed to recreate the HDR counterparts of
input Low Dynamic Range (LDR) images/videos given a single exposure or
multi-exposure LDRs. The state-of-the-art methods focus primarily on the
preservation of the reconstruction's structural similarity and the pixel-wise
accuracy. However, these conventional approaches do not emphasize preserving
the artistic intent of the images in terms of human visual perception, which is
an essential element in media, entertainment and gaming. In this paper, we
attempt to study and fill this gap. We propose an architecture called
ArtHDR-Net based on a Convolutional Neural Network that uses multi-exposed LDR
features as input. Experimental results show that ArtHDR-Net can achieve
state-of-the-art performance in terms of the HDR-VDP-2 score (i.e., mean
opinion score index) while reaching competitive performance in terms of PSNR
and SSIM.]]></summary>

frames on graphs with compact supports based on a series of hierarchical
partitions. Starting from our abstract construction that generalizes previous
methods based on partition trees, we are able to flexibly incorporate subgraph
Laplacians into our design of graph frames. Consequently, our general methods
permit adjusting the (subgraph) vanishing moments of the framelets and extra
properties, such as directionality, for efficiently representing graph signals
with path-like supports. Several variants are explicitly defined and tested.
Experimental results show our proposed graph frames perform superiorly in

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi-task learning (MTL) is a powerful approach in deep learning that
leverages the information from multiple tasks during training to improve model
performance. In medical imaging, MTL has shown great potential to solve various
tasks. However, existing MTL architectures in medical imaging are limited in
sharing information across tasks, reducing the potential performance
improvements of MTL. In this study, we introduce a novel attention-based MTL
framework to better leverage inter-task interactions for various tasks from
pixel-level to image-level predictions. Specifically, we propose a Cross-Task
Attention Network (CTAN) which utilizes cross-task attention mechanisms to
incorporate information by interacting across tasks. We validated CTAN on four
medical imaging datasets that span different domains and tasks including:
radiation treatment planning prediction using planning CT images of two
different target cancers (Prostate, OpenKBP); pigmented skin lesion
segmentation and diagnosis using dermatoscopic images (HAM10000); and COVID-19
diagnosis and severity prediction using chest CT scans (STOIC). Our study
demonstrates the effectiveness of CTAN in improving the accuracy of medical
imaging tasks. Compared to standard single-task learning (STL), CTAN
demonstrated a 4.67% improvement in performance and outperformed both widely
used MTL baselines: hard parameter sharing (HPS) with an average performance
improvement of 3.22%; and multi-task attention network (MTAN) with a relative
decrease of 5.38%. These findings highlight the significance of our proposed
MTL framework in solving medical imaging tasks and its potential to improve
their accuracy across domains.]]></summary>

animal diseases by analyzing electronic medical records (EMRs), such as notes
and veterinary records. However, learning representations to capture entities
and relations with literal information in KGs is challenging as the KGs show
heterogeneous properties and various types of literal information. Meanwhile,
the existing methods mostly aim to preserve graph structures surrounding target
nodes without considering different types of literals, which could also carry
significant information. In this paper, we propose a knowledge graph embedding
model for the efficient diagnosis of animal diseases, which could learn various
types of literal information and graph structure and fuse them into unified
representations, namely LiteralKG. Specifically, we construct a knowledge graph
that is built from EMRs along with literal information collected from various
animal hospitals. We then fuse different types of entities and node feature
information into unified vector representations through gate networks. Finally,
we propose a self-supervised learning task to learn graph structure in pretext
tasks and then towards various downstream tasks. Experimental results on link
prediction tasks demonstrate that our model outperforms the baselines that
consist of state-of-the-art models. The source code is available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN) collects information on cancer patients
by receiving cancer messages from different medical entities (e.g., medical
labs, and hospitals) in Norway. Such messages are validated by an automated
cancer registry system: GURI. Its correct operation is crucial since it lays
the foundation for cancer research and provides critical cancer-related
statistics to its stakeholders. Constructing a cyber-cyber digital twin (CCDT)
for GURI can facilitate various experiments and advanced analyses of the
operational state of GURI without requiring intensive interactions with the
real system. However, GURI constantly evolves due to novel medical diagnostics
and treatment, technological advances, etc. Accordingly, CCDT should evolve as
well to synchronize with GURI. A key challenge of achieving such
synchronization is that evolving CCDT needs abundant data labelled by the new
GURI. To tackle this challenge, we propose EvoCLINICAL, which considers the
CCDT developed for the previous version of GURI as the pretrained model and
fine-tunes it with the dataset labelled by querying a new GURI version.
EvoCLINICAL employs a genetic algorithm to select an optimal subset of cancer
messages from a candidate dataset and query GURI with it. We evaluate
EvoCLINICAL on three evolution processes. The precision, recall, and F1 score
are all greater than 91%, demonstrating the effectiveness of EvoCLINICAL.
Furthermore, we replace the active learning part of EvoCLINICAL with random
selection to study the contribution of transfer learning to the overall
performance of EvoCLINICAL. Results show that employing active learning in
EvoCLINICAL increases its performances consistently.]]></summary>

Differential privacy (DP) is a rigorous mathematical definition of privacy. DP algorithms are randomized to protect user data by ensuring that the probability of any particular output is nearly unchanged when a data point is added or removed. Therefore, the output of a DP algorithm does not disclose the presence of any one data point. There has been significant progress in both foundational research and adoption of differential privacy with contributions such as the Privacy Sandbox and Google Open Source Library.


ML and data analytics algorithms can often be described as performing multiple basic computation steps on the same dataset. When each such step is differentially private, so is the output, but with …]]></summary>

 I'm currently exploring the idea of a solution tailored for ML engineers and technologists. While I have a background in recruiting, I've often found myself dissatisfied with the typical recruitment process. It seems that many recruiters don't always appreciate the importance of working with candidates or understand the impact on people's livelihoods and careers. 
 What I'm proposing is the creation of a career representation firm specifically designed for purpose-driven technologists specializing in data, product, and hardware careers. This firm would advocate for the career interests of the most passionate ML engineers. 
 Our representation would encompass: 
 - Strategic Career Development: Crafting a strategic approach to help engineers secure opportunities aligned with their desired projects and professional development. 
 - Impact Matching: Identifying and connecting engineers with projects and teams where their technical skills, career goals, and personal interests can have the greatest positive impact, ensuring that your work aligns with your values and aspirations. 
 - Industry Leadership: Positioning you as an industry leader by marketing your expertise and securing speaking engagements at conferences and other events, enhancing your professional visibility and reputation. 
 In return for this representation, engineers would commit to a 3% fee deducted from their salary, which would support the services provided by the firm. 
 Would you be interested in participating in such a service? If not, would you consider recommending it to someone you know? If you are in favor of this idea, what makes you believe it would be advantageous for others even if it might not be your preference? Do you think you could personally benefit from this type of career representation?

These ads feature digitally created potential 'girlfriends' with large breasts and tight clothing, and some even use popular children's TV characters to promote 'NSFW pics' apps.
 
NBC News found 35 app developers running sexually explicit ads on Meta-owned apps, and 14 app developers running similar ads on TikTok.
 
The marketing push is part of an AI gold rush, capitalizing on the surge of interest in AI and benefiting from a double standard that hurts real human sex workers.
 
Researchers believe that the gender-based slant in these ads reflects social media platforms allowing sex-related ads only if the intended audience is men.
 
Meta and TikTok have stepped up their removal of sexually explicit AI ads after NBC News contacted them, but questions remain about how the ads got through their filters in the first place.
 
Similar ads also appear in the Apple and Google app stores, although the extent of advertising there is unknown.

 Pretty interesting to see the different methods emerge and how some attempt to simulate how code runs.

 so I've been researching a little about transformers and meanwhile I had to understand sinusoidal positional embedding. I have found two implementations for this, after testing both approaches I found they compute different embeddings for the same position/timestep with the same embedding dimensions... shouldn't it be equal if the position and embedding dimensions are the same?
 This is getting me confused, because now I don't know which implementation should I consider... Do you have any suggestions to where I can look?
 Thank you :)

Especially with more complex stories, like Game of Thrones. At the moment I'm reading Wheel of Time, a rather long fantasy series. I had the idea to build the following WebApp:
 There is online each chapter of the series summarized separately. So in the WebApp I could ask questions about the content. In addition, I can indicate which chapter I am reading, so that it is ensured not to spoil the user.
 I want to avoid to train a model. I would prefer to use one of the existing open-source models, like llama. A first, primitive idea: give the LLM all the summaries and the user's question. But this would mean to give all summaries as input every time. Not only that this approach would not be elegant, the restriction in the input size (number of words) would make this possibly even impossible.
 Feel free to share your ideas how i could solve this :)

 I was suddenly inspired to make a WH Gladius bot.
 Background: I recently got into the game, it seems very interesting to me personally, but alas, there are not enough guides on it for you to learn how to play at a high level. I don’t intend to spend hundreds of hours to master the base, so I decided to try something like RARL so that this thing would learn, and I could analyze its moves, change the conditions and thus start playing at an intermediate level faster.
 However, a superficial analysis revealed that the game does not have an API at all. Let's say I could grab some stats using Cheat Engine and OllyDbg, but I have no idea how to fit it into the gym. Or does gym as env need to pass a link to the client from the machine so that it only restarts it?
 In general, if anyone has done something similar, I ask for a link to a guide or a similar example.
 All the best

I managed to find some details about this model, including details about its topology and tokenizer, and I was even able to peek in and see several of its top predictions while typing!

 Hopefully this can give some insight into some of the trade-offs that Apple went through to put a model on every iPhone and MacBook — it’s small, it has a pretty narrow scope, and it’s not very capable on its own. Let me know what you think!

 Many comments rightfully pointed that the map we trained on:
 - lacked difficult features like jumps, airbrakes, drifts, ...
 - had not widely been played by humans
 We have now trained the same AI on the game's most prestigious map: Hockolicious. We also prepared a video describing the approach with much more detail.
 Here is our result :) AI Beats Hockolicious, Trackmania's Most Prestigious Map
 Note: We are still using a convolutional neural network with a structure similar to Nature's DQN paper. I am curious whether other architectures (the ResNet-like in the IMPALA paper ?) could help. Do you have any suggestions on how the neural network's vision head should be structured for that specific task?

 Many comments rightfully pointed that the map we trained on:
 - lacked difficult features like jumps, airbrakes, drifts, ...
 - had not widely been played by humans
 We have now trained the same AI on the game's most prestigious map: Hockolicious. We also prepared a video describing the approach with much more detail.

 i have recently started working on a project, where I need to animate an image of a face in real time to speak sentences. Essentially I am trying to build a face for my own large language model. I know of Nvidia's Audio2Face and Metahuman, but these are all in 3D and take a lot of time rendering the lip and eye animations. I need something, which works only with a bit of latency.
 ​
 Does anyone know a service or a repo I could use to animate a 2D picture to speak text?

 I am trying to work on a project in which I use drone imagery to detect objects that are in close formations with each other. I do this for the purpose of counting particular objects, as well as to check if an object has moved (by making a prediction on drone imagery that is taken later).
 Create masks?
 I'm now trying to understand what methodology/models make sense. First of all, should I be looking at creating masks, or do bounding boxes suffice? My idea was that masks are better, since bounding boxes overlap with each other and can miss that an object has moved slightly, Or am I wrong and are masks just an extra hassle? Or shouldn't I be looking at bounding boxes or masks at all?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think there's a lot of confusion around AI agents today and it's mainly because of lack of definition and using the wrong terminology.
 We've been talking to many companies who are claiming they're working on agents but when you look under the hood, they are really just chains.
 I just listened to the Latent Space pod with Harrison Chase (Founder of Langchain) and I really liked how he thinks about chains vs agents.
 Chains: sequence of tasks in a more rigid order, where you have more control, more predictability.
 Agents: handling the edge-cases, the long-tail of things that can happen.
 And the most important thing is that it's not an OR question but an AND one: you can use them in the same application by starting with chains -> figuring our the edge-cases -> using agents to deal with them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys! I need some help here.. many days trying to get good results but without success. So I already have the voice I want to use (edited with uvr5 and it sounds really great, without any echo or noise on the background), I trained it on aivc so that I can generate this voice verbalizing the text content I need. I used high quality - it took like 40min to generate each phrase - and it is ok, but still a little robotic. So I installed RVC and trained a model with the original voice (edited with the uvr5) just like I did the training on aivc. So I loaded the trained model on the inference tab and I selected the audio to be processed - the generated audio files from aivc. Even selecting the harvest mode, the output was worse than the generated files from aivc. I even tried to record my own voice speaking the text but it does not sound good. My trained model on rvc has 500 epochs, and it may be a very good model to use, yet idk what I’m doing wrong. Maybe I’m misusing rvc, so what I need is to improve the realism of my aivc(or tortoise) generated voices, simple as that, is rvc the best option to do this? If yes, how? Any help please would be much appreciated thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Would you kindly share noteworthy papers that have caught your interest concerning the weights of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)? I am looking for any innovative paper that has something to do with weights of the physics-informed neural networks or deep neural networks in general and its manipulation.
 Specifically, I am seeking innovative papers on weight manipulation in physics-informed neural networks.
 For instance papers like:
  
Weight initialization algorithm for physics-informed neural networks using finite differences
 Transfer Learning with Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Efficient Simulation of Branched Flows
  
Note that I am referring to the actual weights of the neural network and not the weights of the loss terms.
 I have to add that ideas from transfer learning are welcome too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi ML community, I have been working on benchmarking publicly available LLMs these past couple of weeks. More precisely, I am interested on the finetuning piece since a lot of businesses are starting to entertain the idea of self-hosting LLMs trained on their proprietary data rather than relying on third party APIs. To this point, I am tracking the following 4 pillars of evaluation that businesses are typically look into: - Performance - Time to train an LLM - Cost to train an LLM - Inference (throughput / latency / cost per token)
 For each LLM, my aim is to benchmark them for popular tasks, i.e., classification and summarization. Moreover, I would like to compare them against each other.
 So far, I have benchmarked Flan-T5-Large, Falcon-7B and RedPajama and have found them to be very efficient in low-data situations, i.e., when there are very few annotated samples. Llama2-7B/13B and Writer’s Palmyra are in the pipeline.
 But there’s so many LLMs out there! In case this work interests you, would be great to join forces.
 GitHub repo attached — feedback is always welcome :)

 Happy hacking!

Turbulence is ubiquitous in environmental and engineering fluid flows, and is encountered routinely in everyday life.

However, despite its importance, our current understanding and our ability to reliably predict such flows remains limited. This is mainly attributed to the highly chaotic nature a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let me give you a quick intro. My engineering experience primarily revolved around data processing, analytics, and distributed systems. Nonetheless, I had a desire to learn about ML, and imho the best way to learn is to work on a practical project. So, that's precisely what I did. A few months ago, I embarked on an exciting journey with a friend, and together, we've created http://github.com/huggingbench/huggingbench.
 Now, after three months, I find myself seeking validation for some of my assumptions from the broader community. If you'd like to learn more about our motivations and the path we've taken check out the blog post https://medium.com/@niksa.jakovljevic/introducing-huggingbench-a-path-to-optimized-model-serving-a17cecc8d3ec.
 What I'd like to gather from individuals with machine learning models in production is their level of investment in optimizing inference. Is this a commonplace practice? I acknowledge that it can vary on a case-by-case basis, but I'm still hopeful of identifying prevailing trends. After conversing with a few companies, I've come to the impression that only the truly large players (those spending six figures or more on inference per month) place significant emphasis on inference optimization, which is entirely understandable. Nevertheless, I sense that there are numerous low hanging fruits that could result in substantial cost savings, even for typical startups.
 Could it be that the entire machine learning field is still in its infancy, and many engineers may not be fully considering or prioritizing such optimizations? Perhaps businesses are not giving as much attention to cost considerations? Alternatively, there might be technical challenges I'm not yet aware of. In any case, I would greatly appreciate hearing your insights on the subject of inference optimization.

 EntitySeg dataset
 Dense image segmentation tasks (e.g., semantic, panoptic) are useful for image editing, but existing methods can hardly generalize well in an in-the-wild setting where there are unrestricted image domains, classes, and image resolution and quality variations. Motivated by these observations, we construct a new entity segmentation dataset, with a strong focus on high-quality dense segmentation in the wild. The dataset contains images spanning diverse image domains and entities, along with plentiful high-resolution images and high-quality mask annotations for training and testing.
 We have now released the dataset at https://github.com/adobe-research/EntitySeg-Dataset

 So, I've been messing around with ML and I must say, the hardware requirements can be a real buzzkill... I mean, not everyone's got a huge GPU lying around or the money to rent a dedicated cloud instance.
 What are your hacks for pulling off decent model training without selling a kidney?
 Here's what I'm curious about:
  
CPU: Is anyone else training models on their CPU? How's that working out for you? What are some workarounds you've tried to make it less painful?
 Cloud: Who's been dabbling in cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure? Are they worth the pennies or complicated to set up?
 Big Dataset: How do you handle a massive dataset with a standard storage space?
  
Let's help each other get those models trained without going broke! :D
 Cheers!

 Basically, I want a neural network to learn the simple polynomial pattern of a set of arrays of the form [x,y], with y = x², where the first coordinates are uniformly distributed random numbers in the interval [0,1].
 I started with a model with 2 hidden layers of size two and 'tanh' activation functions, and an output layer with 'linear' activation function. 
 I've then experimented with both additional hidden layers and with increasing the sizes of these layers. Finally, I've tested both the 'adam' and 'sgd' optimizers and the loss functions 'meanSquaredError' and 'meanAbsolutePercentageError'.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the LOw-Memory Optimization paper one of the main ideas towards reducing memory usage in training LLMs is to replace a fancy optimizer like Adam with simple SGD. The reason is that Adam maintains "the optimizer state", which accounts for about 75% of the memory used. In contrast, SGD does not store any intermediate state, as they say on page one. So far, so good.
 https://preview.redd.it/b0dj2nzscumb1.png?width=1055&format=png&auto=webp&s=1712f8500b5cbfb3773cee00ea980175491dddbf
 On page six they have pie charts and a table showing memory usage for Adam, SGD, and LOMO. Here's where I got confused. The pie chart for SGD shows that the optimizer state accounts for nearly 50% of the memory used (weight, gradients and activations are shown separately). It's a major WTF moment: WHAT OPTIMIZER STATE? Can anybody understand and explain this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Medicine's field transformation is being driven by artificial intelligence (AI). However, an important debatable question arises: Will AI ever have a place in this field, or will it remain exclusive to doctors and medical pros?
 Opponents of automated AI diagnosis and treatment contend that machines cannot be relied upon to preserve patient health and lives. Bugs in AI algorithms might cause incorrect diagnoses and treatment prescriptions, leaving them cautious. Individual differences, the doubt is whether AI can truly empathize with patients.
 By contrast, advocates of AI in medicine contend that the technology can considerably improve diagnosis and treatment accuracy. Faster and more accurate than humans, machines can analyze large amounts of data. Not only does it identify rare and complex diseases, but it also saves time and resources. By incorporating AI, clinicians receive additional tips and signals to make more judicious choices.
 Where medical specialists are in short supply, AI can prove especially valuable. This approach can help with shortages in health systems.
 And what do you think?

I did my thesis on Parkinson disease binary classification on 3D structural brain mri, and the dataset has significantly small amount of data(around 80 samples); but due to high resolution and complex data structure I was able achieve around 70% accuracy.
 But now at 2023 using deep neural network only isnot enough to publish in a good journal. Currently I am learning about GAN and attention mechanism, but completely noob on this area. For my journal to get published, I have planned on applying some key operations. But I am not sure if they would work or not. So needed some advice on this regard.
  
Applying tranfer learning: as my dataset has very small amount of data. I was thinking if its possible to pre train a CNN Architecture with some other structural mri data of a different disease and then apply to my dataset? ( for example: brain tumor dataset has the same type of three dimensional data structure, but has comparatively good amount of data)
 
Applying attention mechanism: how should I approach on learning about attention mechanism? 
 
 Any other advices will be appreciated, thank you!

This is true of owning land, money, cars, houses, art, mines, oil-wells, factories, corporations, relationships, loyalties, copyrights, brands, patents or anything else that is owned by you, me or those ever-superior “others”.
 In a society where change occurs gradually, we become accustomed to the narratives that bind us together and determine who possesses significant wealth, resources, attention, power, fame, and other ego-gratifying treasures, and who has access to only meager portions of these.
 However, when societies change and new types of goods appear, there might be no agreement about who gets to own these. For example, while the con…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forrester predicts that generative AI will replace 2.4 million US jobs by 2030, mostly white-collar roles, such as technical writers, proofreaders, copywriters, and administrative positions. But ironically, other forms of automation will displace more jobs.
 To stay on top of the latest advancements in AI, look here first.
 (Chart showing how much different types of jobs can expect to be influenced by technology)
 Concerns about Generative AI
  
While the Generative AI impact is significant, other forms of automation are set to cause more widespread job displacement.
 The most impacted group will be middle-class, college-educated, white-collar workers, specifically those earning above $60,000 annually.
  
Creative professionals stand to benefit
  
Interestingly, workers in creative industries will likely utilize generative AI tools in their jobs rather than being replaced. This includes editors, writers, authors, poets, and lyricists.
 However, the use of such tools as ChatGPT may result in inconsistent outputs and even "coherent nonsense", leading to potential performance issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone! I want to implement a document similarity program and was looking into LLMs as a means of accomplishing this task. 
 I have ~10,000 documents that are "scams" because of some specific reason (all are verified); now I want to check if a new document is similar to any of the documents in the corpus of 10k scam documents. 
 Right now I've implemented a winnowing solution which normalizes text, breaks it up into windows, and then calculates the intersection between a document and each document in the corpus. HOWEVER, this method is pretty computationally expensive (for this many documents a single comparison cycle can take upwards of 3-4 minutes especially when windows are NOT precomputed). 
 How might I approach this problem? Because my data is pretty well structured, supervised learning might be a good approach but so might be setting up recursive chunking for the 10k document corpus and then using LLMs to access if this current legal document has any similarity, but I would love to hear your thoughts!

 ​
 In my opinion the real dystopia will be when politicians sit own with big tech lobbyists and big rights holders and decide that training as it is currently done, for free and open source models and others is illegal. Then the big players would actually win, since they have enough resources to license datasets and will certainly do so willingly and gladly, if it is clear that the jurisdiction keeps all the small players and open source out.

 Github: https://github.com/modelscope/modelscope-agent
 Abstract:
  
Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities to comprehend human intentions, engage in reasoning, and design planning-like behavior. To further unleash the power of LLMs to accomplish complex tasks, there is a growing trend to build agent framework that equips LLMs, such as ChatGPT, with tool-use abilities to connect with massive external APIs. In this work, we introduce ModelScope-Agent, a general and customizable agent framework for real-world applications, based on open-source LLMs as controllers. It provides a user-friendly system library, with customizable engine design to support model training on multiple open-source LLMs, while also enabling seamless integration with both model APIs and common APIs in a unified way. To equip the LLMs with tool-use abilities, a comprehensive framework has been proposed spanning over tool-use data collection, tool retrieval, tool registration, memory control, customized model training, and evaluation for practical real-world applications. Finally, we showcase ModelScopeGPT, a real-world intelligent assistant of ModelScope Community based on the ModelScope-Agent framework, which is able to connect open-source LLMs with more than 1000 public AI models and localized community knowledge in ModelScope.

Uber https://www.uber.com/en-CA/blog/deepeta-how-uber-predicts-arrival-times/
 Stripe https://stripe.com/blog/how-we-built-it-stripe-radar
 Most CTR papers coming from google are also NN based (like https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05310)
 Meta mentions NNs in their recommender system (also kind of a large scale tabular problem there) https://engineering.fb.com/2023/08/09/ml-applications/scaling-instagram-explore-recommendations-system
 Lyft forecasting https://medium.com/this-week-in-machine-learning-ai/causal-models-in-practice-at-lyft-with-sean-taylor-1e62efd62385
  
What's your intuition on DL vs GBDT on (very)large-scale tabular datasets? Have you heard of other such examples (or the reverse)? 
 Are there any particularly interesting open large tabular datasets on which I could test this? I guess datasets should also be wide/hard/with large intrinsic dimention (whatever that means) so there is something to learn with scale (the above examples sure feel good in this way).

Any suggestions on what libraries I should go with (I have expeirence with Pytorch but open to learn anything other than that which might be better. I came across pytorch3d but not sure if it's good ) what are the basics that are needed and how should I learn them? Also it seems there are not much datasets on this field.

Time series forecasting is critical to various real-world applications, from demand forecasting to pandemic spread prediction. In multivariate time series forecasting (forecasting multiple variants at the same time), one can split existing methods into two categories: univariate models and multivariate models. Univariate models focus on inter-series interactions or temporal patterns that encompass trends and seasonal patterns on a time series with a single variable. Examples of such trends and seasonal patterns might be the way mortgage rates increase due to inflation, and how traffic peaks during rush hour. In addition to inter-series patterns, multivariate models process intr…]]></summary>

 To stay on top of the latest advancements in AI, look here first.

 Musk's AI Integration Plan
  
Musk is contemplating merging Neuralink and Tesla, alongside his xAI startup, to create a comprehensive artificial intelligence model.
 Leveraging the text data from Twitter and real-world images from Tesla's Full Self-Driving network, he intends to develop AI chatbots and physical robots capable of real-world navigation.
  
Reasoning Behind the Merge
  
A concern that AI could potentially render humans obsolete led Musk to found xAI for AI safety.
 Musk is targeting to create an AI that can generate computer software and a politically unbiased chatbot rival to ChatGPT.
  
Twitter and Tesla as AI Datasets
  
Despite criticism, Musk's acquisition of Twitter offers access to vast user data for AI training.
 In addition, the Autopilot and Full-Self Driving systems of Tesla, with billions of collected camera images, serve as valuable resources to build physical robot AI.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After our first blog post gained some attention from folks interested in applied fine-tuning, we now have a follow-up post that discusses all sorts of things we learned while working with LoRA.
 We hope that this helps engineers and other folks in the community to improve their fine-tuning.
 Here's what you can expect from the post:
 We compare full-parameter fine-tuning with LoRA and answer questions around the strengths and weaknesses of the two techniques. We train the Llama 2 models on three real-world use cases and demonstrate that using LoRA involves a trade-off between serving efficiency and model quality, which varies according to the specific task at hand. Additionally, we offer insights into how to stabilize training with LoRA through intelligent prompting techniques. We further show that adopting a lower learning rate can enhance the reliability of the resulting model checkpoints.

 Assume I have data for forex / stocks day trading, where my data/columns are:
 1) price of last 50 ticks (a tick is the price at that moment in time, the smallest movement possibly that you can get for that currency)
 2) If we should be in a trade (and direction of trade. where 1 = trade going up. 2 = trade going down. 0 = we should not be in a trade).
 I have tried classification (I generalized the tick price by changing it to pct_change() ) but accuracy is low.
 would it be possible to reverse engineer through reinforcement learning given these data? I am actually more interested in the trade exiting only (so if trade is currently has value of 1 then it became 0 or 2, it means we should exit existing trade). 
 any guide on how to go about this? Yes I know it will be hard. but if humans can teach a robot to walk, maybe hopefully an agent can be taught to learn to exit a trade based on historucal data?
 I have done preliminary readings, and is PPO the best way to go? or DQN? assuming I will use stable baseline3. I am also open to using other Python libraries.
 Thank you.

 I'm working on a card game similar to Hearthstone or Magic: The Gathering, i.e. a game where two players battle with decks of cards coming from a large collection (for instance, there are around 4000 cards in Hearthstone).
 Actions are limited to three things:
  
Play a card (potentially on a target)
 Use a card on a target
 End the turn
  
I'm looking at building AI for it, and am investigating using machine learning for it. I know very little on the subject (I am a game engineer with a reasonable experience of cloud / AWS stuff), but it seems to me that it might be a good fit: features would be the state of the board (i.e. all the cards in play or in hand or in deck), the turn, and whether the current player has won that game or not (eventually), and label would be the action taken (that turn).
 I was looking at SageMaker, hoping that it would streamline and allow me to try something relatively easily, but I immediately found it complicated and quite unclear.
 I would be very grateful if anyone could point me at resources describing at a high level what a full ML pipeline could look like (i.e. what software can injest this kind of data, what software can provide inference, etc.). For instance, would it be saner to "just" get started with Spark on EMR for this kind of problem domain?
 I hope I'm not too wide off the mark with those questions, and thanks in advance!

Each image is tagged by humans such as ['1girl', 'thigh_highs', 'blue eyes'], however, many images are missing tags due to there being so many. I've filtered the tags (classes) down to the 15k most common. Although the top classes have 100k or more examples, many rare classes only have a few hundred tags (long tail problem?). 
 This is my first time training on such a large dataset, and I'm planning on using Convnext due to close to SOTA accuracy and fast training speed. Perhaps vit or a transformer architecture may benefit from such a large dataset? However, vit trains way slower even on my 4090. 
 What are some tips and tricks for training on such a large noisy dastaset? Existing models such as deepdanbooru work well on common classes, but struggles on rare classes in my testing. 
 I assume class unbalance will be a huge problem, as the 100k classes will dominate the loss compared to the rarer classes. Perhaps focal loss or higher sampling ratio for rare classes?
 For missing labels, I'm planning on using psuedolabeling (self distillation) to fix the missing labels. What is the best practice when generating psuedolabels? 
 ​
 Any tips or experiences with training on large unbalanced noisy datasets you could contribute would be greatly appreciated!

 I have a project I would need help with. We need to build a MVP (minimum viable product) of a combination of two models.
 A model that recommend the best channel to use performing a task. And then after that a model to recommend the best time today to perform that task in given channel.
 We have a set of features already defined. Some are in the data and some are generated from the data.
 Looking for someone who could work on this as a freelancer.
 Our preferred environment would be AWS SageMaker, but honestly not a necessity at this point as this is a MVP.
 Due to the reason I want to keep this "secret" for a while, I will not disclose all the details in this post.
 End product that I am waiting for includes (but not restricted to): - Model Training script that evaluates if the new model is more accurate as the previous model (some level of version control) - Model prediction API that will accept the data and prepare it for the models, run the prediction, return the result with accuracy.

The video is meant to provide some intuition on RL as a concept as well as a basic understanding of how these different projects work under the hood. There are way too many great RL projects, so I didn’t try to make it an exhaustive list (I’m gonna do more videos later talking about more projects - maybe make a series out of it), but I chose four that I’ve personally worked with in the past/find really insightful and educational (DQN/Atari, Alpha GO, DeepMimic, and Dactyl). Thanks for reading.
 Here is the link, hope you guys check it out. All feedback is appreciated!

On the surface it sounds similar to teaching the robot to walk, but it's not. We can train the robot to make it walk easily these days. But I'm not sure how to teach it to minic an action that we perform. Because each time a new action can be given to the robot and it has to minic that action (it's sort of like a supervised data that the robot has to memorize) Is there a way to do it? is it some branch of machine learning that I'm not aware?
 The robot is a humanoid simulation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Martian Lawyers Club (MLC) has raised $2.2 million in a pre-seed round to develop AI-based game personalization technology.
 
Unlike other companies that focus on generating game assets, MLC is focused on the systems that form the core of a game.
 
The company aims to create games that feel like a conversation, where players provide input and the game responds in a way that wasn't pre-defined by the developer.
 
MLC plans to provide an SDK that allows developers to design the game experience without having to create every interaction from scratch.
 
Developers will have access to a sandbox experience where they can design the game, and the SDK will also have guardrails to ensure the generative AI system stays within boundaries.
 
MLC is currently working on its first game, a collectible card game, to test out its SDK.
 
The company is the first spin-off from INSAIT, an AI-centric tech institute, and has received funding from Fly Ventures, System.One, and Amar Shah.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all !
 Reading through articles online and reading through sub reddit I have seen some people use LLMs (mainly through openAI) for nlp specific tasks (NER, Text classification, etc.). I was a bit surprised as smaller (~100 million) size models already like RoBERTa exist for such cases.
 Not much content online about this beside this recent paper : https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.10092.pdf
 Highly recommend reading it, here are a few take aways:
  
Most LLM benchmarks today focus on capabilities like understanding, reasoning and Q&A. They often overlook performance on specific nlp tasks like text classification, NER, etc.
 Llama 2 (70b) required fine-tuning to beat GPT 3.5 in some tasks. Both were still overall outperformed by RoBERTa.
 In certain cases GPT4 did better. However smaller open models provide more advantages in terms of speed, cost and transparency.
 The difference of speed/latency (often more important than accuracy in production) and the cost differences between LLMs and "Smaller" models is mind blowing in my view (see screenshots)
  
​
 Cost, speed and throughput comparaison
 How good the models do on various tasks/datasets
 Note: Not saying benchmarks are a source of truth, just found the analysis interesting, always take benchmarks with a grain of salt. 
 If you're using LLMs for anything else beside text generation, I'm curious to know more about your experience so far :) cheers!

A short while ago I was laid off for reasons unrelated to AI. The way I see it, this is an excellent opportunity to make a career pivot. I have an intermediate understanding of JavaScript, React, Node and Linux. I have a good understanding of other technologies and languages too but specialize in web-dev. not saying web-dev will be done by AI but my very specialized niche will be gone way before I am ready to retire.
  
 Can anyone recommend any good online courses? If you could even recommend a good article or two? I really don't know where to start. There are so many different buzz words floating around right now and it feels like it would be easy to waste a bunch of time learning AI related stuff that is outdated or leading to a deadend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Problem: I have a quite complex model that is written in C that takes parameters as an input and estimates a curve as an output. I would like to optimize the parameters by comparing the output with the real measurements using ML methods such as stochastic gradient descent.
 ​
 Question: Is there any possible way to use white box optimizers to optimize the parameters of my C-model without adapting the model itself? Is there a framework that I could use?
 ​
 What I tried: I tried using frameworks such as tensorflow or pytorch and tried to include the compiled C-model in Python. However, gradient tracking does not work when using C functions. I tried doing the optimization in C++ by using libtorch. I realized that for gradient tracking it is essential to only use torch methods. I cannot adapt the C functions to torch functions. I don't want to use black box optimizers since they require good knowledge of the parameters that I will not have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey fellow Redditors,
 I've been wondering about a question lately about the inner workings of large language models like GPT-3.5 and I'm hoping some of you knowledgeable folks can shed some light on this. My curiosity centers around how these models manage to perform translation tasks as an emergent property of next token prediction.
 So, here's my question: Does the training data for models like GPT-3.5 contain text explicitly linking between languages, such as a dictionary, or do they learn translation by assigning similarity between words in different languages based on mathematical metrics like cosine distance?So in that sense, being indepedently trained on several textbooks of different languages (not on the same topic), they would be able to link languages simply by their arithmetic properties? I hope that's making sense.
 For instance, if you look at words like "queen" in English and "rainha" in Portuguese, they share a certain similarity that could be quantified using mathematical similarity metrics. I'm wondering if through this similar vector assignment, the models learn what means what.
 I'm more leaning towards the latter, but I'm too lazy to pursue this empirically.As a follow up question, does this mean that if we are able to predict whale conversation, we would be able to translate it to English as well?
 Thanks in advance for any input you can provide! 🤓

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, if you have explored using Llama-2 in doing sentiment analysis, just wanted to get your experience in how Llama-2 perform in this task?
 I have tried using GPT and it’s pretty accurate.
 If Llama-2 isn’t all that good in sentiment analysis, which other open LLM would you recommend? 
 Thank heaps!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, I've been trying to replicate the method described in the paper "AMP: Adversarial Motion Priors for Stylized Physics-Based Character Control" by training an agent in Isaac Gym using GAIL. However, I've encountered some issues. After adding the discriminator network, the discriminator's loss function stabilizes at around 0.3, and I'm unsure if this value is too high. Additionally, it is strange that the value loss of my value network can reach values between 80 and 90. I want to know if anyone else has experienced a similar situation and what might be the reasons behind these issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent survey by GitLab reveals a growing trend among organizations implementing AI in their software development processes, deeming it essential to stay competitive.
 To stay on top of the latest advancements in AI, look here first.
 GitLab Survey
 AI becomes crucial for software development
  
GitLab's report reveals that most respondents (83%) consider AI essential for their software development, regardless of their position, job level, or years of experience.
 Most organizations have deemed AI adoption successful, with 90% stating confidence in using AI tools daily.
  
Areas of AI application and concerns about its integration
  
AI's application in software development extends beyond simply generating codes, focusing more on natural language chatbots, automated test generation, and tracking machine learning model experiments.
 However, despite the growing adoption, concerns about AI-generated codes lacking copyright protection (48%) and potentially introducing vulnerabilities (39%) are rising.
 The rising fear of AI replacing existing roles is evident, with 57% predicting that their jobs might be threatened within five years.
  
The need for training and the real-world implications of AI integration
  
As AI permeates workplaces, nearly 81% believe they require more training.
 Interestingly, those with more AI experience were less likely to link it with productivity gains and faster cycle times, highlighting the importance of human verification in AI-generated codes for ensuring error-free, secure, and copyright-compliant production.

 I’m an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer. I want to be a practitioner. Building, deploying, and evaluating models to solve problems.
 Ideally I want to land a job in Tech as an MLE. I struggle at times to stay committed to building side projects, studying ML algos, etc.
 I have a background in hardware specific C++ SWE stuff for 3.5 yrs, but not much in the way of ML and web backend. I do have a decent amount of python coding from other experiences and it’s my preferred language.
 Would anyone be interested in forming a discord to talk about what we are doing to prepare, practice interview each other, stay accountable to each other, etc?
 Had a few people show interest in r/ArtificialInteligence already
 If so comment below! Let’s do this!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Insilico Medicine, an AI-driven biotech company, has announced its AI-designed COVID-19 drug is entering Phase I clinical trials. Promising to deliver lasting results against all variants, this could become the first viable alternative to Paxlovid.
 To stay on top of such cutting-edge advancements in AI, look here first.
 Insilico's breakthrough medicine, ISM3312
  
Generated using Artificial Intelligence, ISM3312 may offer the superior solution to the constraints of current oral medication, Paxlovid.
 Insilico’s new drug could address the limitations of Paxlovid, including unpleasant side effects and drug resistance due to constant COVID mutation.
 Preclinical studies reveal the drug’s potential in reducing the viral load in lung tissue and mitigating lung inflammation.
  
Development powered by AI
  
Identified via AI-driven platform PandaOmics, the drug effectively targets crucial proteins in the coronavirus.
 Using Chemistry42, a generative chemistry platform, Insilico generated new molecules built to suppress this protein, creating ISM3312.
 Given the success, the company patented ISM3312, which is currently undergoing Phase I Clinical trials, with results expected by end 2023.
  
The Implications
  
Dr. Harvey Castro, an emergency medicine physician, encourages doctors to remain cautious but also recognizes the promise of AI-generated drugs like ISM3312.
 With the trials in progress, the medical community is closely monitoring it as it could redefine the treatment course for COVID and other similar viruses.
 Insilico's venture exhibits AI's potential in accelerating effective drug discovery, prompting the need for consistent tracking of AI's transformation of healthcare and other fields.

 Our first prototype was focused on small models built with Scikit-Learn and XGBoost, but pretty quickly we got a lot of requests to support bigger, more complex models built on Tensorflow, Pytorch and Transformers.
 From detecting model dependencies to building out auto-scaling compute, it's been a lot of fun working through the challenges to make this product scale.
 We've built a few tutorials to showcase deploying some interesting and complex models to REST Endpoints. The latest one we released is a tutorial showing how to deploy a Grounding DINO model to a Rest API Endpoint for open-set object detection with prompts.

 But I assume children learn what words mean and the intuition behind them, by hearing the word and associating it with visuals or a specific scenario in front of them which helps them to add context to that word and how it is used.
 If we were to emulate how children learn words, could we or is there an architecture that allows us to take an input word, find images with the input word in there (Object detection) and then extract the context from the images (other objects and their position and relation to the input word) then convert that context to phrases and query those phrases the next time that a word is inputted to see other phrases or words that are similar to the input word based on whether or not they appear in the images of the input word.
 Not sure if it makes sense or if it is even useful compared to embeddings but I was thinking about how we could emulate how children learn words to see if we could draw influence from that. Just wondering if there’s a similar approach to this where we use context from images to find similar words and phrases to some input.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently doing named entity recognition with a bert model. Its working fine so far, so I am now trying to ameliorate my results. Usually my first thought when I try to augment my ML models is input data preprocessing. In case of NER stop word removal and removal of punctuation, numbers and one-character words came to mind - they are hardly ever named entities so I woulndt loose many training examples. However, NER does in fact require context to work, so removing stuff could prove harmfull in the end? I am kind of torn. Should I do it? Are there better data augmentation approaches? I would be really thankfull for any kind of hint

If you share my trepidation for model performance in the face of data sparsity, or you simply suffer from anxiety uncertainty, you might be tempted into the Bayesian world. Years later at the precipice of your career (and mental health degeneracy) you over-engineer probabilistic models so intractable that would stress Lord Bayes himself into stomach ulcers. The solution? Approximate inference, the true antihero to model simplification. I wrote a brief primer for those who enjoy maths and those who disdain it, in both cases it's impossible to avoid using maths while discussing Bayesian statistics so I kept it as light as I could.

With multi-modal pre-training, we can directly query the image content based on a set of questions of interest and the model will be able to answer these questions. This enables users to chat with the image to confirm if it contains any inappropriate content that violates the organization’s policies. We use the powerful generating capability of LLMs to generate the final decision including safe/unsafe labels and category type. In addition, by designing a prompt, we can make an LLM generate the defined output format, such as JSON format. The designed prompt template allows the LLM to determine if the image violates the moderation policy, identify the category of violation, explain why, and provide the output in a structured JSON format.]]></summary>

I have the .pcap files of a whole month and and for each day there are multiple devices that communicated each other. So the file of each day is from 700 MB to 2 or 3 GB.
 My initial idea was to only maintain the header of the packets and to discard the data payload. But even in this case the dataset remains huge and the number of entries is crazy.
 What I should do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 I am training an agent via PPO. The environment is a node removal ('n' number of actions which are nodes on the graph) with evaluation after each node removed. the state is represented by a trained graph attention network in the environment with the average of the node embeddings on the graph representing the state of dimension size 'n'. The embedding of the a node that has been removed is subtracted from overall graph embedding representation to represent the 'removal' of that node. 
 However, I want to absolutely be certain, that given a state representation, in a new unseen graph, the agent will not select a node that is absent from that graph. In the event that the state representation may not be granular enough and might cause the agent to think that a node on the graph is present when it is not, are there ways to mitigate this? Two ideas I have are:
  
mask actions for nodes that are not present (this is already done after node removal to prevent the agent from selecting the same node again), but is this valid to do in an unseen graph if I a priori mask nodes that are not present in the action space
 Inject a second input to the policy network such as a one-hot encoding of nodes that have already been selected as an input in addition to the state representation of the graph, so that it models finer dependencies between the state and action taken. However is this valid? 
  
Any thoughts are appreciated! thank you!

 I've voiced over 500 videos for a YouTube channel and have the accompanying voiceover audio and scripts.
 I'd like to train a very robust AI to generate VoiceOver locally and not use an online service using the extensive amount of audio/scripts I have stored.
 My hardware is a 3070 and 12700.
 All other solutions have been online such as Elevenlabs.
 This will be a secondary service I could provide alongside bespoke voice over.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been running hyperparameter optimization for an LGBM multi-classifier model with randomized search with 10fold stratified cv as well as oversampling on each fold using SMOTE as follows:
 # Create a pipeline with SMOTE oversampling smote_pipeline = make_pipeline(SMOTE(random_state=42), lgbm_clf) # Initialize 10-fold stratified cross-validation cv = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=10, shuffle=True, random_state=42) # Initialize RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning using the pipeline random_search = RandomizedSearchCV( estimator=smote_pipeline, param_distributions=param_dist_with_prefix, n_iter=n_iter, scoring=f1_macro_scorer, n_jobs=n_cores, pre_dispatch=n_cores, cv=cv, random_state=42 
 I wanted do incorporate early stopping based on the validation set from the nth iteration of cv. However this does not seem possible using the current API if I am correct.
 If I wanted to use a predefined validation set the code would be sth like this but I want to perform validation using 10 fold-cv validation set only:.
 mode l= lgb.LGBMClassifier() clf = RandomizedSearchCV( model, parameters, fit_params={ 'early_stopping_rounds':20, 'eval_set':[(X,y)] }, cv=cv ) 
 My questions are:
 1- Does it make sense to use early stopping during randomized search?
 2- Do you know a way I could do it?
 3- If not, is it a good idea to use randomized search without early stopping and train a new model with early stopping using the best parameters resulting from randomized search?
 Bonus Question: Does it make sense to run randomized search with f1_macro scoring from sklearn instead of multilogloss in case of imbalanced classes?

 I was wondering how other people keep lab notes, and especially what you find useful to record and how you structure the notes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am currently working on predicting 2D deformations of objects. These objects are available as 2D contours in my code. I am splitting these contours into 1000 points with an equal distance in the direction of the x axis. I have about 70 data entries. 
 The following picture shows one of these objects:
 Comparison before and after
 The red data series contains the points before and the blue series contains the points after the deformation.
 My model should take in a series of coordinates before the deformation. Using this information the model should predict the coordinates after the deformation. 
 I have tried using the LSTM Model from keras. Unfortunately I wasn't able to produce useful results. The way I structured my data is the following:
 [
 [
 [x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], ... 1000 coordinate pairs
 ], [
 [x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...
 ],
 .... 70 entries
 ] 
 The structure for the input and the output series is the same. 
 When trying to train the model I have a very low loss and low validation loss as well:
 Overview during training of model
 The test loss is also quite similar:
 Overview test loss
 However when looking into the predictions I get results like these:
 Visualized prediction after training
 The prediction is not close to what it should be like. Also the prediction seems to not change even when changing the input. 
 ​
 Do you have an idea about why my ML model does not work? Are there examples on this topic available? Should I change my approach in any way?
 Thank you in advance! Any help is appreciated!
 ​
 If you need my jupyter-notebook, it would be great if somebody could tell me, how to link files on Reddit :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks! I wanted to advertise Equinox -- my now-surprisingly-popular ( :D ) JAX library for numerical models. These days that often means "neural networks", but I like to emphasise that this also includes ODEs/SDEs/linear solves, etc.
 Here's the GitHub link: https://github.com/patrick-kidger/equinox
 For those already using JAX, then Equinox is interesting because (a) it ships with a NN library, and (b) this is built around the idea that "everything is a pytree", which makes things easy to reason about and easy to compose. Furthermore (c) Equinox offers advanced tools like true runtime errors, out-of-place pytree surgery, and checkpointed while loops, and AFAIK in the JAX ecosystem these are unique to Equinox.
 For those most familiar with PyTorch: for many use cases (sciML in particular), JAX has a much stronger compiler, more advanced autodiff, etc. And whilst JAX itself is akin to the torch.* namespace, libraries like Equinox are then akin to the torch.nn.* namespace.
 Because of its speed and features, right now JAX+Equinox is my favourite approach to numerical computing. So I'd love for some more people to try it. What do you think?

While often, it did feel like drinking Kool-Aid, buying in to these groups like yoga and climbing, I knew I was not there to rub elbows, but to discover the how behind it. Some leaders of some groups did create a barrier of entry, a necessary proving point, but I have always seen these loops to jump through as a challenge - once completed - a spy. Every skill you have learned has prepared you not to be better at that skill, but to learn a new skill with more ease. It is uncomfortable to learn something new, like drinking from a fire hydrant, but the more sips you take from that blasting surge of water, the more you realize it is all part of the process. We get blasted, we sip, we get overwhelmed, we come back. Just because there is a tool that regulates the blasting, that holds our hand through the overwhelm, does not mean all our hard work has been for nothing. In fact, it means we are more prepared, more primed, to receive all of the beauty and knowledge coming our way. Now, friends, we become CURATORS. :) xo

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am learning about natural language processing now. Technically, is this a way for a computer to input language of a person and then convert it into machine code (0s and 1s)? Or, is this a way to turn human language into some computer language like Python, and then turn into machine code as a second step?
 I am assuming that NLP has only just recently become widely used (like in Chat GPT). Was it a huge jump to go from a machine understanding a computer programming language like Python to a machine understanding ordinary human language? Why was it so much more difficult to train computers to understand the later?
 Thanks!

 Code: https://zenodo.org/record/8037309
 Abstract:
  
Neuromodulators in the brain act globally at many forms of synaptic plasticity, represented as metaplasticity, which is rarely considered by existing spiking (SNNs) and nonspiking artificial neural networks (ANNs). Here, we report an efficient brain-inspired computing algorithm for SNNs and ANNs, referred to here as neuromodulation-assisted credit assignment (NACA), which uses expectation signals to induce defined levels of neuromodulators to selective synapses, whereby the long-term synaptic potentiation and depression are modified in a nonlinear manner depending on the neuromodulator level. The NACA algorithm achieved high recognition accuracy with substantially reduced computational cost in learning spatial and temporal classification tasks. Notably, NACA was also verified as efficient for learning five different class continuous learning tasks with varying degrees of complexity, exhibiting a markedly mitigated catastrophic forgetting at low computational cost. Mapping synaptic weight changes showed that these benefits could be explained by the sparse and targeted synaptic modifications attributed to expectation-based global neuromodulation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many natural language processing tasks benefit from long inputs, but processing long documents with Transformers is expensive -- not only due to quadratic attention complexity but also from applying feedforward and projection layers to every token. However, not all tokens are equally important, especially for longer documents. 
 CoLT5, a long-input Transformer model that builds on this intuition by employing conditional computation, devoting more resources to important tokens in both feedforward and attention layers. CoLT5 can effectively and tractably make use of extremely long inputs, showing strong gains up to 64k input length.
 In this video, we walk through the ColT5 paper and explain what is T5, longT5, UL2 and PEGASUS, then discuss how ColT5 has advantage over previous methods for few-shot and 1-shot tasks.

 Abstract:
  
Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) have been shown to effectively encode positional information in transformer-based language models. However, these models fail to generalize past the sequence length they were trained on. We present YaRN (Yet another RoPE extensioN method), a compute-efficient method to extend the context window of such models, requiring 10x less tokens and 2.5x less training steps than previous methods. Using YaRN, we show that LLaMA models can effectively utilize and extrapolate to context lengths much longer than their original pre-training would allow, while also surpassing previous the state-of-the-art at context window extension. In addition, we demonstrate that YaRN exhibits the capability to extrapolate beyond the limited context of a fine-tuning dataset. We publish the checkpoints of Llama 2 7B/13B fine-tuned using YaRN with 64k and 128k context windows at https://github.com/jquesnelle/yarn .

 What is your experience regarding image sequences from videos in the training datasets? 
 My intuition is, that the added information to the dataset from one video isn't proportional to the number of frames. The network probably can't learn much more from 30 frames with little variation in comparison to a single image (at least if you use augmentations). What do you think about this? Or do you even know any research in the direction of this question?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My question is more focused on the pre-processing side, rather than the training side of things.
 I have a local RAG Q&A pipeline set up for personal documents (local regulations, technical manuals, stuff like that), and I'm looking for ways to improve it. 
 All the documents I'm working with are consistently structured, with nested bullets of varying depth making up most of the structure. So far I've been manually writing/tweaking a python script I wrote to recursively extract the nested bullets and duplicate their hierarchy parents' content for each of the inner-most bullets, that way each bullet has all the contextual content it needs to be valuable in a vacuum. 
 So something like: (a) 1. A. B.
 Would turn into: (a) + 1. + A. (a) + 1. + B.
 This works well in the sense that my LLM does a wonderful job answering my questions and citing the right sources, but the lion's share of my work goes into the tweaking of my parser scripts, or creating new ones entirely. I've played around with semantic segmentation via embedding models, but it doesn't really work here since I'm trying to retain the nested structure of the document for citation accuracy.
 Does anyone have any ideas for ots solutions that address this kind of thing? I can't be the only person who has run into this type of problem, but I've been having a really hard time finding relevant libraries/software that can even get me 80% of the way there.
 Also, I'm totally happy to hear what you guys have done and how's it's worked out/what walls you've hit!
 Edit: I suppose I should have included my current attempt as well, so it's doesn't look like I'm treating this subreddit like Google lol

 I have questions about data contracts!
 Schema evolution, where the schema of the destination evolves based on incoming data is nice for ingesting transactional data.
 However, there are scenarios where we might not want this automatic evolution. For example, when other parts of our infrastructure require a fixed schema or when we want to store only data that conforms to the current schema. This is where a data contract comes into play.
 Our plan is to implement a straightforward version of this concept initially. We're considering introducing settings on the pipeline to control schema evolution, and here are some modes we're thinking about:

 Tired of working hard on cleaning and parsing its responses to trigger a flow?
 Struggling to strip unhelpful prefixes (such as "Sure! " or "I am just a language model!")?
 Having to wait on retries in cases of unexpected outputs?
 Getting random responses on the same query?
 Need a "quick and dirty" text classifier? Don't have enough training data?

 The short of the paper is they show that an AI algorithm that can only learn via sampling from human action is unable to tractably simulate human behavior. I have seen papers like this one by u/alcanthro questioning the validity of the result, but I want to point out two objections to the paper that stand even if the result is true.
 ​
 1 - It only seems to apply for AIs trained to mimic humans via sampling human behavior: 
 The paper assumes the AI is trained via an arbitrary machine learning algo M that samples from possible human behaviors in given situations. This matches pretty well to how a lot of LLMs are pretrained (guess the next token), but doesn't seem to apply to any sort of reinforcement learning, since in those situations you are not training the …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This was a small project I was working upon which adds a recurrent prior to attention-based models. 
 This allows integrating an adaptive-computation mechanism, leading to much better length-extrapolation capabilities (compared to vanilla transformers). On some tasks, I'm able to OOD extrapolate to quite an appreciable extent!
 Its also (relatively) quite parallelizable with slightly different training regimes - thus, hopefully being scalable as well. Being lightweight, it might be useful for inferencing as it saves on memory (trading off compute instead).
 It's interesting to think that MHSA might contain an implicit inductive bias that prevents extrapolation. Replacing that with other variants helps a lot - I go in detail in the writeup!

 More specifically, if I want to replicate the paper in 3 months full time (as a student with some experience in ML), what would be the best approach to the UI part of the paper. What if deployment is a concern? I was intially thinking of simple python frameworks like PySimpleGui, or maybe something more comprehensive like PyQt.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How MoEs (sparsely gated ones) are trained appear to be rather opaque from looking at literature (e.g. GLAM and similar papers). 
 From my intuition it would make sense that it works either by:
 Each expert being trained on a subset of data (the data they are supposed to have expertise in) to predict a token given a previous token, or to predict a token given a contextual embedding. This would mean the expert MLPs are frozen, and the only thing concerning the experts that we train with the transformer is the gating mechanism. 
 or
 The experts are trained in the same training loop as the transformer (e.g. backprop over the whole network), but that each of the experts are only trained on a subset of the data corresponding to their expertise (e.g. as we perform the training loop and we run upon data from our math dataset, then we backprop through the math expert mlp)
 ​
 Could anyone help me resolve my confusion and point me in the right direction for how these are trained? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scammers are now using AI to create realistic voice deepfakes, aiming to trick people into transferring money. By mimicking real customer voices, this new type of voice fraud attempts to exploit bank security systems and deceive call center agents.
 To make sure you're updated about the latest AI trends, look here first.
 Increasing prevalence and sophistication of voice frauds
  
A rise in AI-generated voice frauds has been noted this year, with one major case featuring an investor in Florida whose voice was synthetically duplicated to deceive his bank.
 Voice authentication vendor Nuance detected its first successful deepfake attack on a financial services client late last year.
 These scams are facilitated by the wide availability of voice samples online, coupled with the growth of AI capabilities and hackers' access to stolen bank account details.
  
Defending against evolving AI threats
  
Currently, only a small percentage of fraud calls to large financial companies are AI-generated. Most attacks have targeted credit card service call centers.
 Fraudsters are advancing their techniques, now able to convert speech to a specific target's voice in real-time using advanced AI systems like Microsoft's VALL-E.
 With most of these security measures focusing on call centers and automated systems, individual calls to high-ranking officials remain a vulnerability.

 In my university, there are not a lot of companies visiting for campus placement this year so I decided to go on the offcampus job hunt. I'm a final year student (in masters but bachelors was unrelated to CS) and no work experience. 
 I have further personal goals for which I'd need a steady and good income. I decided if I could get a remote job it would be really beneficial for me as my living costs would be saved and I'll be paid much more than what India offers freshers(since I'll be paid in dollars or euros). 
 However, I need advice in various domains: 1. Should I focus on one of ML/DL/ Data science or multiple ? 2. Any resources that could help me learn ? 3. Projects that help me stand out from the crowd? 4. Where can I start looking for remote work(websites, etc)? 5. Any other personal advice is appreciated!

 In deep learning finetuning pre-trained model was performed by taking some pretrained models like resnet, vgg and unfreezing some of it's final layers.
 Is it the same when finetuning pretrained ViT models? Or do we have to take pretrained ViT and train all the parameters on our own data ?
 On this tutorials https://theaisummer.com/hugging-face-vit/, they have not freezed any pretrained layers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09853
 abstract.
 This paper investigates the rational thinking capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-round argumentative debates by exploring the impact of fallacious arguments on their logical reasoning performance. More specifically, we present Logic Competence Measurement Benchmark (LOGICOM), a diagnostic benchmark to assess the robustness of LLMs against logical fallacies. LOGICOM involves two agents: a persuader and a debater engaging in a multi-round debate on a controversial topic, where the persuader tries to convince the debater of the correctness of its claim. First, LOGICOM assesses the potential of LLMs to change their opinions through reasoning. Then, it evaluates the debater’s performance in logical reasoning by contrasting the scenario where the persuader employs logical fallacies against one where logical reasoning is used. We use this benchmark to evaluate the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 using a dataset containing controversial topics, claims, and reasons supporting them. Our findings indicate that both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can adjust their opinion through reasoning. However, when presented with logical fallacies, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are erroneously convinced 41% and 69% more often, respectively, compared to when logical reasoning is used. Finally, we introduce a new dataset containing over 5k pairs of logical vs. fallacious arguments. The source code and dataset of this work are made publicly available.
 GPT3.5 vulnerable to false information generated by itself!

 "At this step you're saying you encode responders as 1 and non-responders as 0 but you actually did it the other way around."
 "That groupby statement isn't doing what you think it's doing."
 "When you created your target variable by labeling people with this ratio >= 30%, you accidentally failed to capture a ton of actual responders, because the floating-point arithmetic used to derive this column is calculating people with actual values of 0.30 as 0.2999999999999998."

 DINOv2 for advanced visual tasks
  
Meta has made the powerful DINOv2 model available under the Apache 2.0 license, employing self-supervised learning to enhance image segmentation and depth estimation.
 This broader use model encourages further innovation and practical application in the computer vision community, driving progress in the AI industry.
  
FACET for enhanced AI fairness
  
Given the inherent difficulty and risks in ensuring fairness in computer vision, Meta introduced FACET.
 FACET has been developed to benchmark fairness across computer vision models performing tasks such as detection or classification, considering a wide array of demographic attributes.
 This revolutionary tool enables a better understanding of potential biases in AI models, helping to address fairness and robustness concerns.
  
Wider implications
  
Preliminary studies indicate performance disparities across some demographic groups within computer vision models. FACET allows researchers to track these divergences and monitor the implementation of corrective measures.
 Meta actively encourages researchers to use FACET for fairness benchmarking in other visual/multimodal tasks. For instance, the DINOv2 model's performance was analyzed with FACET — facilitating insights into potential biases.

 I will provide you with link to github code so you can see both input dataset, how my onehot encoding and decoding works and implementation of VAE, with current reconstruction_loss and kl_loss fuctions that make my loss function.
 dataset - amp.csv
 onehotencoding -- tools.py
 main code -- VAE-onehot-testing.ipynb
 https://github.com/aronta/Master-thesis-Generating-de-novo-peptides-using-variational-autoencoder-model/blob/main/VAE-onehot-testing.ipynb
 Firstly, just to explain dataset. I have sequences of peptides represented with onehot encoded sequences which I am using as input for my model. Current VAE model, both encoder and deocder are based on LSTM layer as a main way for this VAE to learn connections between inputed sequences and to make sense of it all.
 Main Issue
 Issue is that the latent space im getting doesn't look good no matter what i do. (pictures of plots are on link). So i have tried scalling kl loss (and also warming it up -- because many papers say its a good way) but it doesn't change the end result. Maybe there is problem in the implementation of the VAE, i am realy not sure.
 The main goal would be (like in all VAE implementations) generating new sequences from latent spaces that make sense, opposed to the current outputs that im getting.
 My guess
 There is a problem with optimizing loss function, but i could be completely wrong (maybe the model is wrong for the input I have, or onehotencoding isn't even a good way to represent data entering LSTM layer).

My current use cases including two known languages and a set of documents which have the two languages mixed in (code switching, due to translation error). I'm training an ML model to make the output monolingual (leaned towards a designated language), so I need a reliable measure to estimate whether the ML model is making progress or not. Currently, I use lingua with the `compute_language_confidence_values()` function but the prediction is quite poor.
 For example, given a piece of text in Japanese and English:
 from lingua import Language, LanguageDetectorBuilder languages = [Language.ENGLISH, Language.JAPANESE] detector = LanguageDetectorBuilder.from_languages(*languages).build() detector.compute_language_confidence_values("わかりません hey do you understand me hey oh really") >>> [ConfidenceValue(language=Language.ENGLISH, value=1.0), ConfidenceValue(language=Language.JAPANESE, value=0.0)] 
 So it's not quite correct (should be 0.8-0.2 or something similar), does anyone have any advice ? Or are there better softwares out there ?

 Comgra (computation graph analysis) is a library you can use with pytorch to extract all the tensor data you care about and visualize it graphically in a browser.
 This allows for a much more detailed analysis of what is happening than the usual approach of using tensorboard. You can go investigate tensors as training proceeds, drill down into individual neurons, inspect single data sets that are of special interest to you, track gradients, compare statistics between different training runs, and more.
 This tool has saved me a ton of time in my research by letting me check my hypotheses much more quickly than normal and by helping me understand how the different parts of my network really interact.
 I hope this tool can save other people just as much time as it did me. I'm also open for suggestions on how to improve it further: Since I'm already gathering and visualizing a lot of network information, adding more automated analysis would not be much extra work.

 ReST uses a bootsrap-like method to produce its own extended dataset and trains on ever higher-quality subsets of it to improve its own reward. The method allows for re-using the same generated data multiple times and thus has an efficiency advantage with respect to Online RL techniques like PPO.
 ​
 Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08998
 ​
 Abstract:
 Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) can improve the quality of large language model's (LLM) outputs by aligning them with human preferences. We propose a simple algorithm for aligning LLMs with human preferences inspired by growing batch reinforcement learning (RL), which we call Reinforced Self-Training (ReST). Given an initial LLM policy, ReST produces a dataset by generating samples from the policy, which are then used to improve the LLM policy using offline RL algorithms. ReST is more efficient than typical online RLHF methods because the training dataset is produced offline, which allows data reuse. While ReST is a general approach applicable to all generative learning settings, we focus on its application to machine translation. Our results show that ReST can substantially improve translation quality, as measured by automated metrics and human evaluation on machine translation benchmarks in a compute and sample-efficient manner.

I am trying to understand how this would play out with GAN's, I know that in general training is generally unstable and there are a lot of issues such as memorization and mode collapse under this regime, but I am looking for a theoretical result, for instance we know that GAN's converge under ideal conditions and we also know that MAML converges, can we make any comments on the convergence properties of GAN's when trained using MAML, ideally a neat trick to know if they will converge based on what we already know? The proof for MAML convergence is fairly complicated and I expect that a proof that has additional second order gradient terms and feedback loops will probably involve a lot of work and I am wondering if anyone could provide some sort of insight or intuition as to what such a result would look like?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Problem: Given time series data of the last few years, one data point per day (eg price of a product or sales made this day). My job is to predict the next 7 days, ie. 7 scalars. 
 Approach: Train one model for each time lag. The first model predicts tomorrow, the second model the day after tomorrow and so on (7 models in total). The features are the last prices of the last 7 days and some saisonal features (calendar week, price on this day last year and so on). 
 Question: is there anything wrong with this approach? It doesn’t feel like the most elegant method to train 7 separate models. The problem with using a single model is, that this model must be able to predict 7 values of different points in time (and i don’t want to give the model input data of 7 days and let it predict all 7 scalars at once. The model should only use the features of a single day to predict this day). The 2 other to options I have considered are to train an autoregressive model (model just learns to predict the next day. To predict the day after tomorrow you give it its own prediction as input). Or to build a „time-lag“ feature, which tells the model how far in the future this datapoint lies. But this doesn’t make sense, because there is nothing like a weekly trend or so. 
 What do you think? The autoregressive approach is elegant, but its implementation and maintenance is complex.

 **Correct me if I misunderstand in any.
 From my understanding, Model-Free RL (MFRL) is generally used for control tasks where environment is not accessible. It takes a sample of an experience from the environment and uses it to adjust its policy, either policy-based, value-based, and actor-critic. Model-Based RL (MBRL) uses a transition model to optimize the optimal policy like in model predictive control (MPC).
 I am interested in using RL for control multiple and continuous actions in continuous stochastic environment. For now, I am moving around DDPG. Do you have any suggested algorithm that match to my task?

 I've stumbled across FinRL recently and would like to hire some help to develop some FinRL code. 
 What's the market like for RL? I know all the rage is LLM's but how different is RL and does the labour market care about the difference?
 Based in Canada fyi. Won't be hiring for a few months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey All,
 I have to read in multiple JSON files with each one containing objects in an array.
 For each file I want to create a data frame (A matrix might also work) where the rows and columns are just integers pointing to a string. Like this
 ​
  
 - 0 1 2 
  
 0 dsad asd ad 
  1 asd asd grth 
  2 ter xc wer 
 
 ​
 Using the same JSON file I also want to process the objects inside the arrays using the dataframe (matrix) above. So the process (pipeline) would be something like:
  |==> Create Matrix =======>| JSON file =>| | ===> Use matrix to process object. |==> Individual objects ==>| 
 ​
 I have been looking through the docs but still unsure how to do this.
  
Should I use a dataframe or a spark matrix?
 How do I split the objects into parts and also generate the matrix?
 How do I combine dataframes which isn't joining?
  
Just a point in the right direction would be great. Thanks in advance for this relatively simple question.

 Can someone here please help me with this algorithm? 
 What is the “Boosting” part of the algorithm?
 To my (limited) understanding XGBoost is an ensemble learning algorithm that uses many decision trees (efficiently), where each tree tries to correct the loss of the previous one. 
 But I’m not sure how this is connected to “Boosting” and then it’s cousin “Bagging”
 Any intuition that may help me here?

 Musk assures only publicly accessible data will be used, safeguarding private user information like DMs.
 However, with X having disbanded its press operation, more specific details about the data collected and its intended use still need to be provided.
  
Unfolding plans of Musk
  
Despite X's quiet stance on AI, Musk recently launched xAI, aspiring "to understand the true nature of the universe."
 xAI's homepage discloses plans to sync with X closely, possibly using collected user data to progress the mission.
 A competitive stance against LinkedIn suggests a possible additional motive for data collection, speculating an enhanced job and education section on X.
 Despite concerns about selling user data for revenue, concrete evidence is needed to support this argument, reflecting Twitter's previous strategy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am struggling to understand one part of the FAQ of the transformer reinforcement learning library from HuggingFace:
  
What Is the Concern with Negative KL Divergence?
 If you generate text by purely sampling from the model distribution things work fine in general. But when you use the generate method there are a few caveats because it does not always purely sample depending on the settings which can cause KL-divergence to go negative. Essentially when the active model achieves log_p_token_active < log_p_token_ref we get negative KL-div. This can happen in a several cases:
 top-k sampling: the model can smooth out the probability distribution causing the top-k tokens having a smaller probability than those of the reference model but they still are selected
 min_length: this ignores the EOS token until min_length is reached. thus the model can assign a very high log prob to the EOS token and very low prob to all others until min_length is reached
 batched generation: finished sequences in a batch are padded until all generations are finished. The model can learn to assign very low probabilities to the padding tokens unless they are properly masked or removed.These are just a few examples. Why is negative KL an issue? The total reward R is computed R = r - beta * KL so if the model can learn how to drive KL-divergence negative it effectively gets a positive reward. In many cases it can be much easier to exploit such a bug in the generation than actually learning the reward function. In addition the KL can become arbitrarily small thus the actual reward can be very small compared to it.
  
I understand why the KL-divergence that is computed here is an approximation that can be negative as opposed to the real one. However, I cannot wrap my head around the details of why these specific sampling parameters would lead to negative KL-divergence. Could someone elaborate on these points?

The edited review comment now discusses entirely different point.
 We would like to raise this concern to AC but the thing is that we didn’t save the original review comment, and the “revision history” for some reason doesn’t show the previous content, other than the entry that there was previous version. But this revision history overall isn’t inconsistent (showing the last two history after the discussion period, but the ones before the period is not shown) 
 Can reviewers delete their own revision history in OpenReview tool? I don’t know if this is a bug or they deleted them with an intention.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! I've noticed that most beginner-level tutorials on recommender systems primarily focus on model training, with limited information about deploying them in a production environment. Additionally, the different usage of models in the recall (retrieval) and ranking modules can indeed be confusing for beginners.
 Recently, I've been working on a recommender system project that encompasses both offline development and online deployment, covering both recall and ranking modules. The entire project is developed using Python and executed on a single laptop. All components are contained within Docker, ensuring no impact on the local environment. 
 The GitHub repo: https://github.com/akiragy/recsys_pipeline
 You can follow the commands provided in the README to run it. 
 This project primarily utilizes PyTorch, Redis, Elasticsearch, Feast Feature Store, Triton Inference Server, and Flask. 
 PyTorch is used for training the FM model for recall and the DeepFM model for ranking. 
 Redis serves as the store for user terms and vectors, while Elasticsearch is used to create an item term index and a vector index. Redis and Elasticsearch form the recall module. 
 Feast is utilized to store user and item features, while Triton serves as a real-time prediction engine. Feast and Triton form the ranking module. 
 Flask is deployed as the web server, receiving recommendation requests and returning responses. 
 Thanks for checking it out!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We released another preprint on a neuro-symbolic approach called "metacognitive error correction and detection rules" (EDCR). The idea is that if you have a trained neural model, you can symbolically fine tune the results with rules. In this initial study, we apply it to the classification of GPS movement traces.
 Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_OV4lap_rk
 Preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14250
 Code: https://github.com/lab-v2/Error-Detection-and-Correction
 Further information: https://neurosymbolic.asu.edu/metacognition/ 
 In the example below, we show the results for a single class. The rules detect errors by identifying classifications that may be incorrect and then re-assign to a new class. While recall can drop for a given class, we can bound the drop in recall with a hyperparameter - but this is guaranteed to improve precision. This is illustrated in the below figure. We show this approach leads to an overall improvement in accuracy over the base model, including the state-of-the-art. We also examine the effects when encountering classes not seen in the model's training data.
 We provide theoretical as well as empirical results and believe this approach can be used in other use-cases in the future.

But the probabilities are decreasing with each and every move performed and they are overfitting to one move which is an invalid move (same case for both dqn and a2c) so in the bellman equation i removed the next reward prediction and put constant value of 1 to check whether it is at least trying to increase the probability for valid moves but that doesnt seems to be the case because it is still giving probability of 1 for an invalid move. and there is also this case where the probabilities are getting so small they are becoming nan values. can someone provide some insights for me to look into

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 I'm the founder of a generative AI consultancy and we build gen AI powered products for other companies. We've been doing this for 18 months now and I thought I share our learnings - it might help others.
 ​
  
It's a never ending battle to keep up with the latest tools and developments. 
 
By the time you ship your product it's already using an outdated tech-stack. 
 
There are no best-practices yet. You need to make a bet on tools/processes and hope that things won't change much by the time you ship (they will, see point 2). 
 
If your generative AI product doesn't have a VC-backed competitor, there will be one soon. 
 
In order to win you need one of the two things: either (1) the best distribution or (2) the generative AI component is hidden in your product so others don't/can't copy you. 
 
AI researchers / data scientists are suboptimal choice for AI engineering. They're expensive, won't be able to solve most of your problems and likely want to focus on more fundamental problems rather than building products. 
 
Software engineers make the best AI engineers. They are able to solve 80% of your problems right away and they are motivated because they can "work in AI". 
 
Product designers need to get more technical, AI engineers need to get more product-oriented. The gap currently is too big and this leads to all sorts of problems during product development. 
 
Demo bias is real and it makes it 10x harder to deliver something that's in alignment with your client's expectation. Communicating this effectively is a real and underrated skill. 
 
There's no such thing as off-the-shelf AI generated content yet. Current tools are not reliable enough, they hallucinate, make up stuff and produce inconsistent results (applies to text, voice, image and video).

One of the main problems in road segmentation by using depth was that if a region is flat, such as walls, it may be detected as road. This was already a known phenomenon and to overcome this, surface normal estimation was used. But, SNE requires dense depth images. Instead, we used a multi-task architecture, and used surface normals as an auxiliary loss, which reduced computation time significantly and also we don't need a dense depth image. Only LiDAR (which is sparse in nature) is sufficient.

 If you want to stay on top of the latest trends and insights in AI, look here first.

 AI’s evolving role in tackling the opioid crisis
  
With a legacy of over 1 million overdose deaths since 1999, the opioid crisis has stubbornly resisted traditional preventive and regulatory measures. The latest AI-fueled developments offer newfound hope.
 Groundbreaking AI innovations are focusing on identifying individuals at potential risk, monitoring treatment progress, and predicting relapse probabilities. Decoding social media behavior offers an effective outlet for early intervention.
 More radically, AI-enabled wearable devices are being developed to detect overdose symptoms and automatically deliver lifesaving treatment.
  
AI: A double-edged sword?
  
Despite its promising potential, AI application in this sphere also raises concerns around privacy rights and misinformation. Facial recognition technology could lead to discrimination, while the risk of false data being fed into chatbots causing harm cannot be undermined.
 Trust in AI and its appropriate deployment will be crucial to ensuring its positive contribution rather than being a dystopian threat.

state-of-the-art knowledge graph embedding models in the context of a recent

based on the HITS@10 score over previous work on the same biomedical knowledge

method. We demonstrate that knowledge graph embedding models are applicable in
practice by evaluating the best-performing model on four tasks that represent
real-life polypharmacy situations. Results suggest that knowledge learnt from
large biomedical knowledge graphs can be transferred to such downstream use

to determine the quality of soybean sprouts: normal, broken, spotted, and
broken and spotted, for the development of AI-aided automatic quality
inspection technology. For semantic segmentation, images with varying
complexity, from single sprout images to images with multiple sprouts, along
with human-labelled mask images, are included. The label has 4 different
classes: background, head, body, tail. The dataset also provides images and
masks for the image decomposition task, including two separate sprout images
and their combined form. Lastly, 5 physical features of sprouts (head length,
body length, body thickness, tail length, weight) are provided for image-based
measurement tasks. This dataset is expected to be a valuable resource for a
wide range of research and applications in the advanced analysis of images of
soybean sprouts. Also, we hope that this dataset can assist researchers

distributed learning refers to the process of training learning models on
distributed data sources. In our setting a set of agents need to cooperatively
train a learning model from streaming data. Differently from federated
learning, the proposed approach does not rely on a central server but only on
peer-to-peer communications among the agents. This approach is often used in
scenarios where data cannot be moved to a centralized location due to privacy,
security, or cost reasons. In order to overcome the absence of a central
server, we propose a distributed algorithm that relies on a quantized,
finite-time coordination protocol to aggregate the locally trained models.
Furthermore, our algorithm allows for the use of stochastic gradients during
local training. Stochastic gradients are computed using a randomly sampled
subset of the local training data, which makes the proposed algorithm more
efficient and scalable than traditional gradient descent. In our paper, we
analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of the mean distance
from the online solution. Finally, we present numerical results for a logistic

applications require decomposing such structures for further processing in
computer graphics. In the last decade, several methods were proposed to tackle
this problem, at the cost of intensive computational times. Recently, machine
learning has proven to be effective for the segmentation task on 3D structures.
Nevertheless, these state-of-the-art methods are often hardly generalizable and
require dividing the learned model into several specific classes of objects to
avoid overfitting. We present a data-driven approach leveraging deep learning
to encode a mapping function prior to mesh segmentation for multiple
applications. Our network reproduces a neighborhood map using our knowledge of
the \textsl{Shape Diameter Function} (SDF) method using similarities among
vertex neighborhoods. Our approach is resolution-agnostic as we downsample the
input meshes and query the full-resolution structure solely for neighborhood
contributions. Using our predicted SDF values, we can inject the resulting
structure into a graph-cut algorithm to generate an efficient and robust mesh
segmentation while considerably reducing the required computation times.]]></summary>

learn better policies than the behavior policy used for data collection. In
contrast to behavior cloning, which assumes the data is collected from expert
demonstrations, offline RL can work with non-expert data and multimodal
behavior policies. However, offline RL algorithms face challenges in handling
distribution shifts and effectively representing policies due to the lack of
online interaction during training. Prior work on offline RL uses conditional
diffusion models to represent multimodal behavior in the dataset. Nevertheless,
these methods are not tailored toward alleviating the out-of-distribution state
generalization. We introduce a novel method, named State Reconstruction for
Diffusion Policies (SRDP), incorporating state reconstruction feature learning
in the recent class of diffusion policies to address the out-of-distribution
generalization problem. State reconstruction loss promotes more descriptive
representation learning of states to alleviate the distribution shift incurred
by the out-of-distribution (OOD) states. We design a novel 2D Multimodal
Contextual Bandit environment to illustrate the OOD generalization of SRDP
compared to prior algorithms. In addition, we assess the performance of our
model on D4RL continuous control benchmarks, namely the navigation of an 8-DoF
ant and forward locomotion of half-cheetah, hopper, and walker2d, achieving

Low-accuracy leaves give less valid explanations, which could be interpreted as

we extend each leaf with a separate tree-based model. The shallow tree provides

annotation process. Hence, training a deep-learning model with only raw data
can easily lead to overfitting. One solution to this problem is to augment the
raw data with various transformations, improving the model's ability to
generalize to new data. However, manually configuring a generic augmentation
combination and parameters for different datasets is non-trivial due to
inconsistent acquisition approaches and data distributions. Therefore,
automatic data augmentation is proposed to learn favorable augmentation
strategies for different datasets while incurring large GPU overhead. To this
end, we present a novel method, called Dynamic Data Augmentation (DDAug), which
is efficient and has negligible computation cost. Our DDAug develops a
hierarchical tree structure to represent various augmentations and utilizes an
efficient Monte-Carlo tree searching algorithm to update, prune, and sample the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising research direction for
building power-efficient information processing systems, especially for
temporal tasks such as speech recognition. In SNNs, delays refer to the time
needed for one spike to travel from one neuron to another. These delays matter
because they influence the spike arrival times, and it is well-known that
spiking neurons respond more strongly to coincident input spikes. More
formally, it has been shown theoretically that plastic delays greatly increase
the expressivity in SNNs. Yet, efficient algorithms to learn these delays have
been lacking. Here, we propose a new discrete-time algorithm that addresses
this issue in deep feedforward SNNs using backpropagation, in an offline
manner. To simulate delays between consecutive layers, we use 1D convolutions
across time. The kernels contain only a few non-zero weights - one per synapse
- whose positions correspond to the delays. These positions are learned
together with the weights using the recently proposed Dilated Convolution with
Learnable Spacings (DCLS). We evaluated our method on three datasets: the
Spiking Heidelberg Dataset (SHD), the Spiking Speech Commands (SSC) and its
non-spiking version Google Speech Commands v0.02 (GSC) benchmarks, which
require detecting temporal patterns. We used feedforward SNNs with two or three
hidden fully connected layers, and vanilla leaky integrate-and fire neurons. We
showed that fixed random delays help and that learning them helps even more.
Furthermore, our method outperformed the state-of-the-art in the three datasets
without using recurrent connections and with substantially fewer parameters.
Our work demonstrates the potential of delay learning in developing accurate
and precise models for temporal data processing. Our code is based on PyTorch /
SpikingJelly and available at: https://github.com/Thvnvtos/SNN-delays]]></summary>

framework that allows researchers to define reproducible and comparable
clinical ML experiments; we offer an end-to-end solution from cohort definition
to model evaluation. The framework natively supports most open-access ICU
datasets (MIMIC III/IV, eICU, HiRID, AUMCdb) and is easily adaptable to future
ICU datasets. Combined with a transparent preprocessing pipeline and extensible
training code for multiple ML and deep learning models, YAIB enables unified
model development. Our benchmark comes with five predefined established
prediction tasks (mortality, acute kidney injury, sepsis, kidney function, and
length of stay) developed in collaboration with clinicians. Adding further
tasks is straightforward by design. Using YAIB, we demonstrate that the choice
of dataset, cohort definition, and preprocessing have a major impact on the
prediction performance - often more so than model class - indicating an urgent
need for YAIB as a holistic benchmarking tool. We provide our work to the
clinical ML community to accelerate method development and enable real-world
clinical implementations. Software Repository:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We present MedShapeNet, a large collection of anatomical shapes (e.g., bones,
organs, vessels) and 3D surgical instrument models. Prior to the deep learning
era, the broad application of statistical shape models (SSMs) in medical image
analysis is evidence that shapes have been commonly used to describe medical
data. Nowadays, however, state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning algorithms in
medical imaging are predominantly voxel-based. In computer vision, on the
contrary, shapes (including, voxel occupancy grids, meshes, point clouds and
implicit surface models) are preferred data representations in 3D, as seen from
the numerous shape-related publications in premier vision conferences, such as
the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), as
well as the increasing popularity of ShapeNet (about 51,300 models) and
Princeton ModelNet (127,915 models) in computer vision research. MedShapeNet is
created as an alternative to these commonly used shape benchmarks to facilitate
the translation of data-driven vision algorithms to medical applications, and
it extends the opportunities to adapt SOTA vision algorithms to solve critical
medical problems. Besides, the majority of the medical shapes in MedShapeNet
are modeled directly on the imaging data of real patients, and therefore it
complements well existing shape benchmarks comprising of computer-aided design
(CAD) models. MedShapeNet currently includes more than 100,000 medical shapes,
and provides annotations in the form of paired data. It is therefore also a
freely available repository of 3D models for extended reality (virtual reality
- VR, augmented reality - AR, mixed reality - MR) and medical 3D printing. This
white paper describes in detail the motivations behind MedShapeNet, the shape
acquisition procedures, the use cases, as well as the usage of the online shape
search portal: https://medshapenet.ikim.nrw/]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adversarial examples (AEs) for DNNs have been shown to be transferable: AEs
that successfully fool white-box surrogate models can also deceive other
black-box models with different architectures. Although a bunch of empirical
studies have provided guidance on generating highly transferable AEs, many of
these findings lack explanations and even lead to inconsistent advice. In this
paper, we take a further step towards understanding adversarial
transferability, with a particular focus on surrogate aspects. Starting from
the intriguing little robustness phenomenon, where models adversarially trained
with mildly perturbed adversarial samples can serve as better surrogates, we
attribute it to a trade-off between two predominant factors: model smoothness
and gradient similarity. Our investigations focus on their joint effects,
rather than their separate correlations with transferability. Through a series
of theoretical and empirical analyses, we conjecture that the data distribution
shift in adversarial training explains the degradation of gradient similarity.
Building on these insights, we explore the impacts of data augmentation and
gradient regularization on transferability and identify that the trade-off
generally exists in the various training mechanisms, thus building a
comprehensive blueprint for the regulation mechanism behind transferability.
Finally, we provide a general route for constructing better surrogates to boost
transferability which optimizes both model smoothness and gradient similarity
simultaneously, e.g., the combination of input gradient regularization and
sharpness-aware minimization (SAM), validated by extensive experiments. In
summary, we call for attention to the united impacts of these two factors for
launching effective transfer attacks, rather than optimizing one while ignoring
the other, and emphasize the crucial role of manipulating surrogate models.]]></summary>

transformer (CNN-Transformer) for medical image segmentation. The proposed
Hybrid Decoder, based on MaxViT-block, is designed to harness the power of both
the convolution and self-attention mechanisms at each decoding stage with a
nominal memory and computational burden. The inclusion of multi-axis
self-attention, within each decoder stage, significantly enhances the
discriminating capacity between the object and background regions, thereby
helping in improving the segmentation efficiency. In the Hybrid Decoder block,
the fusion process commences by integrating the upsampled lower-level decoder
features, obtained through transpose convolution, with the skip-connection
features derived from the hybrid encoder. Subsequently, the fused features
undergo refinement through the utilization of a multi-axis attention mechanism.
The proposed decoder block is repeated multiple times to progressively segment
the nuclei regions. Experimental results on MoNuSeg18 and MoNuSAC20 dataset
demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed technique. Our MaxViT-UNet
outperformed the previous CNN-based (UNet) and Transformer-based (Swin-UNet)
techniques by a considerable margin on both of the standard datasets. The

models, synthesizing a sequence of animated frames that are both photorealistic
and temporally coherent is still in its infancy. While off-the-shelf
billion-scale datasets for image generation are available, collecting similar
video data of the same scale is still challenging. Also, training a video
diffusion model is computationally much more expensive than its image
counterpart. In this work, we explore finetuning a pretrained image diffusion
model with video data as a practical solution for the video synthesis task. We
find that naively extending the image noise prior to video noise prior in video
diffusion leads to sub-optimal performance. Our carefully designed video noise
prior leads to substantially better performance. Extensive experimental
validation shows that our model, Preserve Your Own Correlation (PYoCo), attains
SOTA zero-shot text-to-video results on the UCF-101 and MSR-VTT benchmarks. It
also achieves SOTA video generation quality on the small-scale UCF-101
benchmark with a $10\times$ smaller model using significantly less computation

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Personalized prediction is a machine learning approach that predicts a
person's future observations based on their past labeled observations and is
typically used for sequential tasks, e.g., to predict daily mood ratings. When
making personalized predictions, a model can combine two types of trends: (a)
trends shared across people, i.e., person-generic trends, such as being happier
on weekends, and (b) unique trends for each person, i.e., person-specific
trends, such as a stressful weekly meeting. Mixed effect models are popular
statistical models to study both trends by combining person-generic and
person-specific parameters. Though linear mixed effect models are gaining
popularity in machine learning by integrating them with neural networks, these
integrations are currently limited to linear person-specific parameters: ruling
out nonlinear person-specific trends. In this paper, we propose Neural Mixed
Effect (NME) models to optimize nonlinear person-specific parameters anywhere
in a neural network in a scalable manner. NME combines the efficiency of neural
network optimization with nonlinear mixed effects modeling. Empirically, we
observe that NME improves performance across six unimodal and multimodal
datasets, including a smartphone dataset to predict daily mood and a
mother-adolescent dataset to predict affective state sequences where half the
mothers experience at least moderate symptoms of depression. Furthermore, we
evaluate NME for two model architectures, including for neural conditional
random fields (CRF) to predict affective state sequences where the CRF learns
nonlinear person-specific temporal transitions between affective states.
Analysis of these person-specific transitions on the mother-adolescent dataset
shows interpretable trends related to the mother's depression symptoms.]]></summary>

fields to group mixed numeric and categorical data. In many algorithms, a
predefined distance measurement is used to cluster data points based on their
dissimilarity. While there exist numerous distance-based measures for data with
pure numerical attributes and several ordered and unordered categorical
metrics, an efficient and accurate distance for mixed-type data that utilizes
the continuous and discrete properties simulatenously is an open problem. Many
metrics convert numerical attributes to categorical ones or vice versa. They
handle the data points as a single attribute type or calculate a distance
between each attribute separately and add them up. We propose a metric called
KDSUM that uses mixed kernels to measure dissimilarity, with cross-validated
optimal bandwidth selection. We demonstrate that KDSUM is a shrinkage method

acknowledging the variability of residual variances across covariates in the

achieve this, we propose a novel framework where the Gaussian process is
coupled with a covariate-induced precision matrix process, adopting a mixture
formulation. This approach enables the modeling of heteroscedastic covariance
functions across covariates. To mitigate the computational challenges posed by
sampling, we employ variational inference to approximate the posterior and
facilitate posterior predictive modeling. Additionally, our training process
leverages an EM algorithm featuring closed-form M-step updates to efficiently
evaluate the heteroscedastic covariance function. A notable feature of our
model is its consistent performance on multivariate responses, accommodating
various types (continuous or categorical) seamlessly. Through a combination of
simulations and real-world applications in climatology, we illustrate the
model's prowess and advantages. By overcoming the limitations of traditional
Gaussian process models, our proposed framework offers a robust and versatile
tool for a wide array of applications.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Fourier neural operator (FNO) is a powerful technique for learning
surrogate maps for partial differential equation (PDE) solution operators. For
many real-world applications, which often require high-resolution data points,
training time and memory usage are significant bottlenecks. While there are
mixed-precision training techniques for standard neural networks, those work
for real-valued datatypes on finite dimensions and therefore cannot be directly
applied to FNO, which crucially operates in the (complex-valued) Fourier domain
and in function spaces. On the other hand, since the Fourier transform is
already an approximation (due to discretization error), we do not need to
perform the operation at full precision. In this work, we (i) profile memory
and runtime for FNO with full and mixed-precision training, (ii) conduct a
study on the numerical stability of mixed-precision training of FNO, and (iii)
devise a training routine which substantially decreases training time and
memory usage (up to 34%), with little or no reduction in accuracy, on the
Navier-Stokes and Darcy flow equations. Combined with the recently proposed
tensorized FNO (Kossaifi et al., 2023), the resulting model has far better
performance while also being significantly faster than the original FNO.]]></summary>

motivate mathematically and show empirically that generalisation to tasks that

remarkably good performance. However, the choice of model highly relies on the
characteristics of the input time series and the fixed distribution that the
model is based on. Due to the fact that the probability distributions cannot be
averaged over different models straightforwardly, the current time series model
ensemble methods cannot be directly applied to improve the robustness and
accuracy of forecasting. To address this issue, we propose pTSE, a multi-model
distribution ensemble method for probabilistic forecasting based on Hidden
Markov Model (HMM). pTSE only takes off-the-shelf outputs from member models
without requiring further information about each model. Besides, we provide a
complete theoretical analysis of pTSE to prove that the empirical distribution
of time series subject to an HMM will converge to the stationary distribution
almost surely. Experiments on benchmarks show the superiority of pTSE overall

analysis of text and images grounded in the discussion context. This is done by
leveraging graph transformers to capture the contextual relationships in the

processing modalities separately. We compare the performance of our model to

large scale computations. In this paper, we show that MMD flows with Riesz
kernels $K(x,y) = - \Vert x-y\Vert^r$, $r \in (0,2)$ have exceptional
properties which allow their efficient computation. We prove that the MMD of
Riesz kernels coincides with the MMD of their sliced version. As a consequence,
the computation of gradients of MMDs can be performed in the one-dimensional
setting. Here, for $r=1$, a simple sorting algorithm can be applied to reduce
the complexity from $O(MN+N^2)$ to $O((M+N)\log(M+N))$ for two measures with
$M$ and $N$ support points. As another interesting follow-up result, the MMD of
compactly supported measures can be estimated from above and below by the
Wasserstein-1 distance. For the implementations we approximate the gradient of
the sliced MMD by using only a finite number $P$ of slices. We show that the
resulting error has complexity $O(\sqrt{d/P})$, where $d$ is the data

MMD gradient flows by neural networks even for image applications. We

of air traffic management (ATM) systems. Models of aircraft operated under
instrument flight rules (IFR) require capturing the variability inherent in how
aircraft follow standard flight procedures. The variability in aircraft
behavior varies among flight stages. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic
model that can learn the variability from the procedural data and flight tracks

model is used to learn the deviations of aircraft trajectories from their
procedures. Given new procedures, we can generate synthetic trajectories by
sampling a series of deviations from the trained Gaussian distributions and
reconstructing the aircraft trajectory using the deviations and the procedures.
We extend this method to capture pairwise correlations between aircraft and
show how a pairwise model can be used to generate traffic involving an
arbitrary number of aircraft. We demonstrate the proposed models on the arrival

unfairness issues on graphs involve both attributes and topological structures.
Existing work on fair graph learning simply assumes that attributes of all
nodes are available for model training and then makes fair predictions. In
practice, however, the attributes of some nodes might not be accessible due to
missing data or privacy concerns, which makes fair graph learning even more
challenging. In this paper, we propose FairAC, a fair attribute completion
method, to complement missing information and learn fair node embeddings for
graphs with missing attributes. FairAC adopts an attention mechanism to deal
with the attribute missing problem and meanwhile, it mitigates two types of
unfairness, i.e., feature unfairness from attributes and topological unfairness
due to attribute completion. FairAC can work on various types of homogeneous
graphs and generate fair embeddings for them and thus can be applied to most
downstream tasks to improve their fairness performance. To our best knowledge,
FairAC is the first method that jointly addresses the graph attribution
completion and graph unfairness problems. Experimental results on benchmark
datasets show that our method achieves better fairness performance with less
sacrifice in accuracy, compared with the state-of-the-art methods of fair graph
learning. Code is available at: https://github.com/donglgcn/FairAC.]]></summary>

convert them into dense, grid-like input representations before using an
off-the-shelf network. However, selecting the appropriate representation for
the task traditionally requires training a neural network for each
representation and selecting the best one based on the validation score, which
is very time-consuming. This work eliminates this bottleneck by selecting
representations based on the Gromov-Wasserstein Discrepancy (GWD) between raw
events and their representation. It is about 200 times faster to compute than
training a neural network and preserves the task performance ranking of event
representations across multiple representations, network backbones, datasets,
and tasks. Thus finding representations with high task scores is equivalent to
finding representations with a low GWD. We use this insight to, for the first
time, perform a hyperparameter search on a large family of event
representations, revealing new and powerful representations that exceed the
state-of-the-art. Our optimized representations outperform existing
representations by 1.7 mAP on the 1 Mpx dataset and 0.3 mAP on the Gen1
dataset, two established object detection benchmarks, and reach a 3.8% higher
classification score on the mini N-ImageNet benchmark. Moreover, we outperform
state-of-the-art by 2.1 mAP on Gen1 and state-of-the-art feed-forward methods
by 6.0 mAP on the 1 Mpx datasets. This work opens a new unexplored field of
explicit representation optimization for event-based learning.]]></summary>

executing diverse manipulation tasks from visual observations in unstructured
real-world environments. To achieve this goal, the robot needs to have a
comprehensive understanding of the 3D structure and semantics of the scene. In
this work, we present $\textbf{GNFactor}$, a visual behavior cloning agent for
multi-task robotic manipulation with $\textbf{G}$eneralizable $\textbf{N}$eural
feature $\textbf{F}$ields. GNFactor jointly optimizes a generalizable neural
field (GNF) as a reconstruction module and a Perceiver Transformer as a
decision-making module, leveraging a shared deep 3D voxel representation. To
incorporate semantics in 3D, the reconstruction module utilizes a
vision-language foundation model ($\textit{e.g.}$, Stable Diffusion) to distill
rich semantic information into the deep 3D voxel. We evaluate GNFactor on 3
real robot tasks and perform detailed ablations on 10 RLBench tasks with a
limited number of demonstrations. We observe a substantial improvement of
GNFactor over current state-of-the-art methods in seen and unseen tasks,
demonstrating the strong generalization ability of GNFactor. Our project

involving more than two entities. In scenarios where explicit hypergraphs are
not readily available, it is desirable to infer a meaningful hypergraph
structure from the node features to capture the intrinsic relations within the
data. However, existing methods either adopt simple pre-defined rules that fail
to precisely capture the distribution of the potential hypergraph structure, or
learn a mapping between hypergraph structures and node features but require a
large amount of labelled data, i.e., pre-existing hypergraph structures, for
training. Both restrict their applications in practical scenarios. To fill this
gap, we propose a novel smoothness prior that enables us to design a method to
infer the probability for each potential hyperedge without labelled data as
supervision. The proposed prior indicates features of nodes in a hyperedge are
highly correlated by the features of the hyperedge containing them. We use this
prior to derive the relation between the hypergraph structure and the node
features via probabilistic modelling. This allows us to develop an unsupervised
inference method to estimate the probability for each potential hyperedge via
solving an optimisation problem that has an analytical solution. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our method can learn
meaningful hypergraph structures from data more efficiently than existing
hypergraph structure inference methods.]]></summary>

by obscuring their faces. These methods, however, can degrade the quality of
photos, and they usually do not preserve the utility of faces, i.e., their age,
gender, pose, and facial expression. Recently, GANs, such as StyleGAN, have
been proposed, which generate realistic, high-quality imaginary faces. In this
paper, we investigate the use of StyleGAN in generating de-identified faces
through style mixing. We examined this de-identification method for preserving
utility and privacy by implementing several face detection, verification, and
identification attacks and conducting a user study. The results from our
extensive experiments, human evaluation, and comparison with two
state-of-the-art methods, i.e., CIAGAN and DeepPrivacy, show that StyleGAN
performs on par or better than these methods, preserving users' privacy and
images' utility. In particular, the results of the machine learning-based
experiments show that StyleGAN0-4 preserves utility better than CIAGAN and
DeepPrivacy while preserving privacy at the same level. StyleGAN0-3 preserves
utility at the same level while providing more privacy. In this paper, for the
first time, we also performed a carefully designed user study to examine both
privacy and utility-preserving properties of StyleGAN0-3, 0-4, and 0-5, as well
as CIAGAN and DeepPrivacy from the human observers' perspectives. Our
statistical tests showed that participants tend to verify and identify
StyleGAN0-5 images more easily than DeepPrivacy images. All the methods but
StyleGAN0-5 had significantly lower identification rates than CIAGAN. Regarding
utility, as expected, StyleGAN0-5 performed significantly better in preserving
some attributes. Among all methods, on average, participants believe gender has
been preserved the most while naturalness has been preserved the least.]]></summary>

model, termed stochastic configuration machines (SCMs), to stress effective

with binarized implementation, the model storage of SCMs can be significantly
compressed while retaining favourable prediction performance. Besides the
architecture of the SCM learner model and its learning algorithm, as an
important part of this contribution, we also provide a theoretical basis on the

from researchers due to its wide range of applications.As conversation has a
natural graph structure,numerous approaches used to model ERC based on graph
convolutional networks (GCNs) have yielded significant results.However,the
aggregation approach of traditional GCNs suffers from the node information
redundancy problem,leading to node discriminant information
loss.Additionally,single-layer GCNs lack the capacity to capture long-range
contextual information from the graph. Furthermore,the majority of approaches
are based on textual modality or stitching together different modalities,
resulting in a weak ability to capture interactions between modalities. To
address these problems, we present the relational bilevel aggregation graph
convolutional network (RBA-GCN), which consists of three modules: the graph
generation module (GGM), similarity-based cluster building module (SCBM) and
bilevel aggregation module (BiAM). First, GGM constructs a novel graph to
reduce the redundancy of target node information.Then,SCBM calculates the node
similarity in the target node and its structural neighborhood, where noisy
information with low similarity is filtered out to preserve the discriminant
information of the node. Meanwhile, BiAM is a novel aggregation method that can
preserve the information of nodes during the aggregation process. This module
can construct the interaction between different modalities and capture
long-range contextual information based on similarity clusters. On both the
IEMOCAP and MELD datasets, the weighted average F1 score of RBA-GCN has a
2.17$\sim$5.21\% improvement over that of the most advanced method.Our code is

from the equilibrium region of the ground electronic state potential energy
surface, sampling from direct adiabatic dynamics. However, many chemical
reactions entail significant molecular deformations, notably bond breaking. We
demonstrate the constrained distribution of internal coordinates and energies

introduce the xxMD (Extended Excited-state Molecular Dynamics) dataset, derived
from non-adiabatic dynamics. This dataset encompasses energies and forces
ascertained from both multireference wave function theory and density
functional theory. Furthermore, its nuclear configuration spaces authentically

However, its limited customization options hinder users from accurately
describing desired outputs. For example, plain text makes it hard to specify
continuous quantities, such as the precise RGB color value or importance of
each word. Furthermore, creating detailed text prompts for complex scenes is
tedious for humans to write and challenging for text encoders to interpret. To
address these challenges, we propose using a rich-text editor supporting
formats such as font style, size, color, and footnote. We extract each word's
attributes from rich text to enable local style control, explicit token
reweighting, precise color rendering, and detailed region synthesis. We achieve
these capabilities through a region-based diffusion process. We first obtain
each word's region based on attention maps of a diffusion process using plain
text. For each region, we enforce its text attributes by creating
region-specific detailed prompts and applying region-specific guidance, and
maintain its fidelity against plain-text generation through region-based

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unlike conventional grid and mesh based methods for solving partial
differential equations (PDEs), neural networks have the potential to break the
curse of dimensionality, providing approximate solutions to problems where
using classical solvers is difficult or impossible. While global minimization
of the PDE residual over the network parameters works well for boundary value
problems, catastrophic forgetting impairs the applicability of this approach to
initial value problems (IVPs). In an alternative local-in-time approach, the
optimization problem can be converted into an ordinary differential equation
(ODE) on the network parameters and the solution propagated forward in time;
however, we demonstrate that current methods based on this approach suffer from
two key issues. First, following the ODE produces an uncontrolled growth in the
conditioning of the problem, ultimately leading to unacceptably large numerical
errors. Second, as the ODE methods scale cubically with the number of model
parameters, they are restricted to small neural networks, significantly
limiting their ability to represent intricate PDE initial conditions and
solutions. Building on these insights, we develop Neural IVP, an ODE based IVP
solver which prevents the network from getting ill-conditioned and runs in time
linear in the number of parameters, enabling us to evolve the dynamics of
challenging PDEs with neural networks.]]></summary>

reasoning, a crucial aspect of many security tasks. However, existing LLM
architectures for code are often borrowed from other domains like natural
language processing, raising concerns about their generalization and robustness
to unseen code. A key generalization challenge is to incorporate the knowledge
of code semantics, including control and data flow, into the LLM architectures.

Drawing inspiration from examples of convolution layers exploiting
translation symmetry, we explore how code symmetries can enhance LLM
architectures for program analysis and modeling. We present a rigorous
group-theoretic framework that formally defines code symmetries as
semantics-preserving transformations and provides techniques for precisely
reasoning about symmetry preservation within LLM architectures. Using this
framework, we introduce a novel variant of self-attention that preserves
program symmetries, demonstrating its effectiveness in generalization and
robustness through detailed experimental evaluations across different binary
and source code analysis tasks. Overall, our code symmetry framework offers
rigorous and powerful reasoning techniques that can guide the future
development of specialized LLMs for code and advance LLM-guided program
reasoning tasks.]]></summary>

source code to express the software semantics, but the compiler converts it to
a binary format that the CPU can directly execute. Therefore, binary code
analysis is critical to applications in reverse engineering and computer
security tasks where source code is not available. However, unlike source code
and natural language that contain rich semantic information, binary code is
typically difficult for human engineers to understand and analyze. While
existing work uses AI models to assist source code analysis, few studies have
considered binary code. In this paper, we propose a COntrastive learning Model
for Binary cOde Analysis, or COMBO, that incorporates source code and comment
information into binary code during representation learning. Specifically, we
present three components in COMBO: (1) a primary contrastive learning method
for cold-start pre-training, (2) a simplex interpolation method to incorporate
source code, comments, and binary code, and (3) an intermediate representation
learning algorithm to provide binary code embeddings. Finally, we evaluate the
effectiveness of the pre-trained representations produced by COMBO using three
indicative downstream tasks relating to binary code: algorithmic functionality
classification, binary code similarity, and vulnerability detection. Our
experimental results show that COMBO facilitates representation learning of
binary code visualized by distribution analysis, and improves the performance
on all three downstream tasks by 5.45% on average compared to state-of-the-art
large-scale language representation models. To the best of our knowledge, COMBO
is the first language representation model that incorporates source code,
binary code, and comments into contrastive code representation learning and
unifies multiple tasks for binary code analysis.]]></summary>

alternative for full fine-tuning so as to adapt pre-trained vision models to
downstream tasks, which only tunes a small number of parameters while freezing
the vast majority ones to ease storage burden and optimization difficulty.
However, existing PEFT methods introduce trainable parameters to the same
positions across different tasks depending solely on human heuristics and
neglect the domain gaps. To this end, we study where to introduce and how to
allocate trainable parameters by proposing a novel Sensitivity-aware visual
Parameter-efficient fine-Tuning (SPT) scheme, which adaptively allocates
trainable parameters to task-specific important positions given a desired
tunable parameter budget. Specifically, our SPT first quickly identifies the
sensitive parameters that require tuning for a given task in a data-dependent
way. Next, our SPT further boosts the representational capability for the
weight matrices whose number of sensitive parameters exceeds a pre-defined
threshold by utilizing existing structured tuning methods, e.g., LoRA [23] or
Adapter [22], to replace directly tuning the selected sensitive parameters
(unstructured tuning) under the budget. Extensive experiments on a wide range
of downstream recognition tasks show that our SPT is complementary to the
existing PEFT methods and largely boosts their performance, e.g., SPT improves
Adapter with supervised pre-trained ViT-B/16 backbone by 4.2% and 1.4% mean
Top-1 accuracy, reaching SOTA performance on FGVC and VTAB-1k benchmarks,
respectively. Source code is at https://github.com/ziplab/SPT]]></summary>

candidate approaches for learning on neuromorphic chips learn by contrasting
one set of network states with another. These Contrastive Learning (CL)

capable of harnessing CL. In this study, we build on recent work exploring how

form of learning can be made temporally local, and can still function even if
many of the dynamical requirements of standard training procedures are relaxed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In autonomous driving, data augmentation is commonly used for improving 3D
object detection. The most basic methods include insertion of copied objects
and rotation and scaling of the entire training frame. Numerous variants have
been developed as well. The existing methods, however, are considerably limited
when compared to the variety of the real world possibilities. In this work, we
develop a diversified and realistic augmentation method that can flexibly
construct a whole-body object, freely locate and rotate the object, and apply
self-occlusion and external-occlusion accordingly. To improve the diversity of
the whole-body object construction, we develop an iterative method that
stochastically combines multiple objects observed from the real world into a
single object. Unlike the existing augmentation methods, the constructed
objects can be randomly located and rotated in the training frame because
proper occlusions can be reflected to the whole-body objects in the final step.
Finally, proper self-occlusion at each local object level and
external-occlusion at the global frame level are applied using the Hidden Point
Removal (HPR) algorithm that is computationally efficient. HPR is also used for
adaptively controlling the point density of each object according to the
object's distance from the LiDAR. Experiment results show that the proposed
DR.CPO algorithm is data-efficient and model-agnostic without incurring any
computational overhead. Also, DR.CPO can improve mAP performance by 2.08% when
compared to the best 3D detection result known for KITTI dataset. The code is

on-demand communication protocol that tailors the communication of each pair of

times of agents are highly heterogeneous, and its communication complexity
depends on the empirical pull times of agents. ODC is a generic protocol that

functions for deep neural networks (DNNs). As it counts 1 for positive
variables and 0 for others, its intrinsic characteristics (e.g., discontinuity
and no viable information of subgradients) impede its development for several
decades. Even if there is an impressive body of work on designing DNNs with
continuous activation functions that can be deemed as surrogates of the step
function, it is still in the possession of some advantageous properties, such
as complete robustness to outliers and being capable of attaining the best
learning-theoretic guarantee of predictive accuracy. Hence, in this paper, we
aim to train DNNs with the step function used as an activation function (dubbed
as 0/1 DNNs). We first reformulate 0/1 DNNs as an unconstrained optimization
problem and then solve it by a block coordinate descend (BCD) method. Moreover,
we acquire closed-form solutions for sub-problems of BCD as well as its
convergence properties. Furthermore, we also integrate
$\ell_{2,0}$-regularization into 0/1 DNN to accelerate the training process and
compress the network scale. As a result, the proposed algorithm has a high
performance on classifying MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. As a result, the
proposed algorithm has a desirable performance on classifying MNIST,
FashionMNIST, Cifar10, and Cifar100 datasets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The main goal of Few-Shot learning algorithms is to enable learning from
small amounts of data. One of the most popular and elegant Few-Shot learning
approaches is Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). The main idea behind this
method is to learn the shared universal weights of a meta-model, which are then
adapted for specific tasks. However, the method suffers from over-fitting and
poorly quantifies uncertainty due to limited data size. Bayesian approaches
could, in principle, alleviate these shortcomings by learning weight
distributions in place of point-wise weights. Unfortunately, previous
modifications of MAML are limited due to the simplicity of Gaussian posteriors,
MAML-like gradient-based weight updates, or by the same structure enforced for
universal and adapted weights.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework for Bayesian MAML called
BayesianHMAML, which employs Hypernetworks for weight updates. It learns the
universal weights point-wise, but a probabilistic structure is added when
adapted for specific tasks. In such a framework, we can use simple Gaussian
distributions or more complicated posteriors induced by Continuous Normalizing
Flows.]]></summary>

global model without disclosing their data. Previous researches often require
training the complete model parameters. However, the emergence of powerful
pre-trained models makes it possible to achieve higher performance with fewer
learnable parameters in FL. In this paper, we propose a federated adaptive
prompt tuning algorithm, FedAPT, for multi-domain collaborative image
classification with powerful foundation models, like CLIP. Compared with direct
federated prompt tuning, our core idea is to adaptively unlock specific domain
knowledge for each test sample in order to provide them with personalized
prompts. To implement this idea, we design an adaptive prompt tuning module,
which consists of a meta prompt, an adaptive network, and some keys. The server
randomly generates a set of keys and assigns a unique key to each client. Then
all clients cooperatively train the global adaptive network and meta prompt
with the local datasets and the frozen keys. Ultimately, the global aggregation
model can assign a personalized prompt to CLIP based on the domain features of
each test sample. We perform extensive experiments on two multi-domain image
classification datasets across two different settings - supervised and
unsupervised. The results show that FedAPT can achieve better performance with
less than 10\% of the number of parameters of the fully trained model, and the
global model can perform well in diverse client domains simultaneously.]]></summary>

quality prediction for millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications. Previous
studies have proposed machine learning-based methods to predict received signal
strength for future time periods using time series of depth images to mitigate
the line-of-sight (LOS) path blockage by pedestrians in mmWave communication.
However, these image-based methods have limited applicability due to privacy
concerns as camera images may contain sensitive information. This study
proposes a point cloud-based method for mmWave link quality prediction and
demonstrates its feasibility through experiments. Point clouds represent
three-dimensional (3D) spaces as a set of points and are sparser and less
likely to contain sensitive information than camera images. Additionally, point
clouds provide 3D position and motion information, which is necessary for
understanding the radio propagation environment involving pedestrians. This
study designs the mmWave link quality prediction method and conducts realistic
indoor experiments, where the link quality fluctuates significantly due to
human blockage, using commercially available IEEE 802.11ad-based 60 GHz
wireless LAN devices and Kinect v2 RGB-D camera and Velodyne VLP-16 light
detection and ranging (LiDAR) for point cloud acquisition. The experimental
results showed that our proposed method can predict future large attenuation of
mmWave received signal strength and throughput induced by the LOS path blockage
by pedestrians with comparable or superior accuracy to image-based prediction
methods. Hence, our point cloud-based method can serve as a viable alternative
to image-based methods.]]></summary>

user interface (UI) can significantly reduce interaction costs. While UI
optimization can be informed by user studies evaluating design options, this

problem of incorporating ontologies into embedding-based query answering models
by defining the task of embedding-based ontology-mediated query answering. We
propose various integration strategies into prominent representatives of
embedding models that involve (1) different ontology-driven data augmentation
techniques and (2) adaptation of the loss function to enforce the ontology
axioms. We design novel benchmarks for the considered task based on the LUBM
and the NELL KGs and evaluate our methods on them. The achieved improvements in
the setting that requires both inductive and deductive reasoning are from 20%
to 55% in HITS@3.]]></summary>

excited states of a quantum system which is a natural generalization of the
estimation of ground states. The method has no free parameters and requires no
explicit orthogonalization of the different states, instead transforming the
problem of finding excited states of a given system into that of finding the
ground state of an expanded system. Expected values of arbitrary observables
can be calculated, including off-diagonal expectations between different states
such as the transition dipole moment. Although the method is entirely general,
it works particularly well in conjunction with recent work on using neural
networks as variational Ansatze for many-electron systems, and we show that by
combining this method with the FermiNet and Psiformer Ansatze we can accurately
recover vertical excitation energies and oscillator strengths on molecules as
large as benzene. Beyond the examples on molecules presented here, we expect
this technique will be of great interest for applications of variational
quantum Monte Carlo to atomic, nuclear and condensed matter physics.]]></summary>

our correspondence-based explanations are found to be more useful to users than
kNN explanations. Our explanations help users more accurately reject AI's wrong

from sparse point segmentation to dense voxel segmentation, where the objective
is to predict the semantic occupancy of each voxel in the concerned 3D space.
The dense nature of the prediction space has rendered existing efficient
2D-projection-based methods (e.g., bird's eye view, range view, etc.)
ineffective, as they can only describe a subspace of the 3D scene. To address
this, we propose a cylindrical tri-perspective view to represent point clouds
effectively and comprehensively and a PointOcc model to process them
efficiently. Considering the distance distribution of LiDAR point clouds, we
construct the tri-perspective view in the cylindrical coordinate system for
more fine-grained modeling of nearer areas. We employ spatial group pooling to
maintain structural details during projection and adopt 2D backbones to
efficiently process each TPV plane. Finally, we obtain the features of each
point by aggregating its projected features on each of the processed TPV planes
without the need for any post-processing. Extensive experiments on both 3D
occupancy prediction and LiDAR segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that the
proposed PointOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance with much faster speed.
Specifically, despite only using LiDAR, PointOcc significantly outperforms all
other methods, including multi-modal methods, with a large margin on the
OpenOccupancy benchmark. Code: https://github.com/wzzheng/PointOcc.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Federated Learning (FL) requires frequent exchange of model parameters, which
leads to long communication delay, especially when the network environments of
clients vary greatly. Moreover, the parameter server needs to wait for the
slowest client (i.e., straggler, which may have the largest model size, lowest
computing capability or worst network condition) to upload parameters, which
may significantly degrade the communication efficiency. Commonly-used client
selection methods such as partial client selection would lead to the waste of
computing resources and weaken the generalization of the global model. To
tackle this problem, along a different line, in this paper, we advocate the
approach of model parameter dropout instead of client selection, and
accordingly propose a novel framework of Federated learning scheme with
Differential parameter Dropout (FedDD). FedDD consists of two key modules:
dropout rate allocation and uploaded parameter selection, which will optimize
the model parameter uploading ratios tailored to different clients'
heterogeneous conditions and also select the proper set of important model
parameters for uploading subject to clients' dropout rate constraints.
Specifically, the dropout rate allocation is formulated as a convex
optimization problem, taking system heterogeneity, data heterogeneity, and
model heterogeneity among clients into consideration. The uploaded parameter
selection strategy prioritizes on eliciting important parameters for uploading
to speedup convergence. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the convergence
of the proposed FedDD scheme. Extensive performance evaluations demonstrate
that the proposed FedDD scheme can achieve outstanding performances in both
communication efficiency and model convergence, and also possesses a strong
generalization capability to data of rare classes.]]></summary>

controllers for systems operating in stochastic and potentially adversarial
environments. Automatic synthesis tools, however, require a model of the
environment to construct controllers. In this work, we introduce a model-free
reinforcement learning (RL) approach to derive controllers from given LTL
specifications even when the environment is completely unknown. We model the
problem as a stochastic game (SG) between the controller and the adversarial
environment; we then learn optimal control strategies that maximize the
probability of satisfying the LTL specifications against the worst-case
environment behavior. We first construct a product game using the deterministic
parity automaton (DPA) translated from the given LTL specification. By deriving
distinct rewards and discount factors from the acceptance condition of the DPA,
we reduce the maximization of the worst-case probability of satisfying the LTL
specification into the maximization of a discounted reward objective in the
product game; this enables the use of model-free RL algorithms to learn an
optimal controller strategy. To deal with the common scalability problems when
the number of sets defining the acceptance condition of the DPA (usually
referred as colors), is large, we propose a lazy color generation method where
distinct rewards and discount factors are utilized only when needed, and an
approximate method where the controller eventually focuses on only one color.
In several case studies, we show that our approach is scalable to a wide range
of LTL formulas, significantly outperforming existing methods for learning
controllers from LTL specifications in SGs.]]></summary>

Our novel, validated image representation for time series consistently and

many applications. However, their mathematical properties are generally not

neural network is then inferred from the properties of the ODE vector field.
Besides injecting more structure into the network architectures, this modelling
procedure allows a better theoretical understanding of their behaviour. We
present two universal approximation results and demonstrate how to impose some
particular properties on the neural networks. A particular focus is on
1-Lipschitz architectures including layers that are not 1-Lipschitz. These

multiple tasks by exploiting the correlations between different outputs.
Generally, MOGPs models assume a flat correlation structure between the
outputs. However, such a formulation does not account for more elaborate
relationships, for instance, if several replicates were observed for each
output (which is a typical setting in biological experiments). This paper
proposes an extension of MOGPs for hierarchical datasets (i.e. datasets for
which the relationships between observations can be represented within a tree
structure). Our model defines a tailored kernel function accounting for
hierarchical structures in the data to capture different levels of correlations
while leveraging the introduction of latent variables to express the underlying
dependencies between outputs through a dedicated kernel. This latter feature is
expected to significantly improve scalability as the number of tasks increases.
An extensive experimental study involving both synthetic and real-world data
from genomics and motion capture is proposed to support our claims.]]></summary>

calorimeter (ECAL) is a crucial operational tool that allows ECAL experts to
quickly identify, localize, and diagnose a broad range of detector issues that
would otherwise hinder physics-quality data taking. Although the existing ECAL
DQM system has been continuously updated to respond to new problems, it remains
one step behind newer and unforeseen issues. Using unsupervised deep learning,
a real-time autoencoder-based anomaly detection system is developed that is
able to detect ECAL anomalies unseen in past data. After accounting for spatial
variations in the response of the ECAL and the temporal evolution of anomalies,
the new system is able to efficiently detect anomalies while maintaining an
estimated false discovery rate between $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-4}$, beating existing
benchmarks by about two orders of magnitude. The real-world performance of the
system is validated using anomalies found in 2018 and 2022 LHC collision data.
Additionally, first results from deploying the autoencoder-based system in the
CMS online DQM workflow for the ECAL barrel during Run 3 of the LHC are
presented, showing its promising performance in detecting obscure issues that

block polymer morphology evolution for large domains over long timescales. The
strategy exploits the separation of characteristic times between coarse-grained
particle evolution on the monomer scale and slow morphological evolution over
mesoscopic scales. In contrast to empirical continuum models, the proposed
approach learns stochastically driven defect annihilation processes directly
from particle-based simulations. A UNet architecture that respects different
boundary conditions is adopted, thereby allowing periodic and fixed substrate
boundary conditions of arbitrary shape. Physical concepts are also introduced
via the loss function and symmetries are incorporated via data augmentation.
The model is validated using three different use cases. Explainable artificial
intelligence methods are applied to visualize the morphology evolution over
time. This approach enables the generation of large system sizes and long
trajectories to investigate defect densities and their evolution under
different types of confinement. As an application, we demonstrate the
importance of accessing late-stage morphologies for understanding particle
diffusion inside a single block. This work has implications for directed

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A vast number of systems across the world use algorithmic decision making
(ADM) to (partially) automate decisions that have previously been made by
humans. When designed well, these systems promise more objective decisions
while saving large amounts of resources and freeing up human time. However,
when ADM systems are not designed well, they can lead to unfair decisions which
discriminate against societal groups. The downstream effects of ADMs critically
depend on the decisions made during the systems' design and implementation, as
biases in data can be mitigated or reinforced along the modeling pipeline. Many
of these design decisions are made implicitly, without knowing exactly how they
will influence the final system. It is therefore important to make explicit the
decisions made during the design of ADM systems and understand how these
decisions affect the fairness of the resulting system.

To study this issue, we draw on insights from the field of psychology and
introduce the method of multiverse analysis for algorithmic fairness. In our
proposed method, we turn implicit design decisions into explicit ones and
demonstrate their fairness implications. By combining decisions, we create a
grid of all possible "universes" of decision combinations. For each of these
universes, we compute metrics of fairness and performance. Using the resulting
dataset, one can see how and which decisions impact fairness. We demonstrate
how multiverse analyses can be used to better understand variability and
robustness of algorithmic fairness using an exemplary case study of predicting
public health coverage of vulnerable populations for potential interventions.
Our results illustrate how decisions during the design of a machine learning
system can have surprising effects on its fairness and how to detect these
effects using multiverse analysis.]]></summary>

dataset spanning 122 language variants. Significantly expanding the language
coverage of natural language understanding (NLU) benchmarks, this dataset

curated to discriminate between models with different levels of general
language comprehension. The English dataset on its own proves difficult enough
to challenge state-of-the-art language models. Being fully parallel, this
dataset enables direct comparison of model performance across all languages. We
use this dataset to evaluate the capabilities of multilingual masked language
models (MLMs) and large language models (LLMs). We present extensive results
and find that despite significant cross-lingual transfer in English-centric
LLMs, much smaller MLMs pretrained on balanced multilingual data still
understand far more languages. We also observe that larger vocabulary size and

low-resource languages. Overall, Belebele opens up new avenues for evaluating

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its inception in "Attention Is All You Need", transformer architecture
has led to revolutionary advancements in NLP. The attention layer within the
transformer admits a sequence of input tokens $X$ and makes them interact
through pairwise similarities computed as softmax$(XQK^\top X^\top)$, where
$(K,Q)$ are the trainable key-query parameters. In this work, we establish a
formal equivalence between the optimization geometry of self-attention and a
hard-margin SVM problem that separates optimal input tokens from non-optimal
tokens using linear constraints on the outer-products of token pairs. This
formalism allows us to characterize the implicit bias of 1-layer transformers
optimized with gradient descent: (1) Optimizing the attention layer with
vanishing regularization, parameterized by $(K,Q)$, converges in direction to
an SVM solution minimizing the nuclear norm of the combined parameter
$W=KQ^\top$. Instead, directly parameterizing by $W$ minimizes a Frobenius norm
objective. We characterize this convergence, highlighting that it can occur
toward locally-optimal directions rather than global ones. (2) Complementing
this, we prove the local/global directional convergence of gradient descent
under suitable geometric conditions. Importantly, we show that
over-parameterization catalyzes global convergence by ensuring the feasibility
of the SVM problem and by guaranteeing a benign optimization landscape devoid
of stationary points. (3) While our theory applies primarily to linear
prediction heads, we propose a more general SVM equivalence that predicts the
implicit bias with nonlinear heads. Our findings are applicable to arbitrary
datasets and their validity is verified via experiments. We also introduce
several open problems and research directions. We believe these findings
inspire the interpretation of transformers as a hierarchy of SVMs that
separates and selects optimal tokens.]]></summary>

shared model without transferring their local data. FL reduces the
communication overhead, making it a promising learning method in UAV-enhanced
wireless networks with scarce energy resources. Despite the potential,
implementing FL in UAV-enhanced networks is challenging, as conventional UAV
placement methods that maximize coverage increase the FL delay significantly.
Moreover, the uncertainty and lack of a priori information about crucial
variables, such as channel quality, exacerbate the problem. In this paper, we
first analyze the statistical characteristics of a UAV-enhanced wireless sensor
network (WSN) with energy harvesting. We then develop a model and solution
based on the multi-objective multi-armed bandit theory to maximize the network
coverage while minimizing the FL delay. Besides, we propose another solution
that is particularly useful with large action sets and strict energy
constraints at the UAVs. Our proposal uses a scalarized best-arm identification
algorithm to find the optimal arms that maximize the ratio of the expected
reward to the expected energy cost by sequentially eliminating one or more arms
in each round. Then, we derive the upper bound on the error probability of our
multi-objective and cost-aware algorithm. Numerical results show the

derived from graph convolutional networks have shown significant success. These
indicators, achieved by representing feed-forward structures as component
graphs through one-hot encoding, face a limitation: their inability to evaluate
architecture performance across varying search spaces. In contrast, handcrafted
performance indicators (zero-shot NAS), which use the same architecture with
random initialization, can generalize across multiple search spaces. Addressing
this limitation, we propose a novel approach for zero-shot NAS using deep
learning. Our method employs Fourier sum of sines encoding for convolutional
kernels, enabling the construction of a computational feed-forward graph with a
structure similar to the architecture under evaluation. These encodings are
learnable and offer a comprehensive view of the architecture's topological
information. An accompanying multi-layer perceptron (MLP) then ranks these
architectures based on their encodings. Experimental results show that our
approach surpasses previous methods using graph convolutional networks in terms
of correlation on the NAS-Bench-201 dataset and exhibits a higher convergence
rate. Moreover, our extracted feature representation trained on each
NAS-Benchmark is transferable to other NAS-Benchmarks, showing promising
generalizability across multiple search spaces. The code is available at:

recommendation, as a sub-domain, aims to amalgamate longitudinal patient
history with medical knowledge, assisting physicians in prescribing safer and
more accurate medication combinations. Existing methods overlook the inherent
long-tail distribution in medical data, lacking balanced representation between
head and tail data, which leads to sub-optimal model performance. To address
this challenge, we introduce StratMed, a model that incorporates an innovative
relevance stratification mechanism. It harmonizes discrepancies in data
long-tail distribution and strikes a balance between the safety and accuracy of
medication combinations. Specifically, we first construct a pre-training method
using deep learning networks to obtain entity representation. After that, we
design a pyramid-like data stratification method to obtain more generalized
entity relationships by reinforcing the features of unpopular entities. Based
on this relationship, we designed two graph structures to express medication
precision and safety at the same level to obtain visit representations.
Finally, the patient's historical clinical information is fitted to generate
medication combinations for the current health condition. Experiments on the
MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate that our method has outperformed current
state-of-the-art methods in four evaluation metrics (including safety and

as the amplification of subspaces only depends on the spectrum of the

being dominated by a low-dimensional subspace with an asymptotic convergence
rate independent of the feature transformations. This causes a rank collapse of
the node representations, resulting in over-smoothing when smooth vectors span
this subspace, and over-correlation even when over-smoothing is avoided. Guided
by our theory, we propose a sum of Kronecker products as a beneficial property
that can provably prevent over-smoothing, over-correlation, and rank collapse.

static trajectory data without requiring real-time environment interactions.
Recent studies have shown the feasibility of framing offline RL as a sequence
modeling task, where the sole aim is to predict actions based on prior context
using the transformer architecture. However, the limitation of this single task
learning approach is its potential to undermine the transformer model's
attention mechanism, which should ideally allocate varying attention weights
across different tokens in the input context for optimal prediction. To address
this, we reformulate offline RL as a multi-objective optimization problem,
where the prediction is extended to states and returns. We also highlight a
potential flaw in the trajectory representation used for sequence modeling,
which could generate inaccuracies when modeling the state and return
distributions. This is due to the non-smoothness of the action distribution
within the trajectory dictated by the behavioral policy. To mitigate this
issue, we introduce action space regions to the trajectory representation. Our
experiments on D4RL benchmark locomotion tasks reveal that our propositions
allow for more effective utilization of the attention mechanism in the
transformer model, resulting in performance that either matches or outperforms

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this article, the optimal sample complexity of learning the underlying
interaction/dependencies of a Linear Dynamical System (LDS) over a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG) is studied. The sample complexity of learning a DAG's
structure is well-studied for static systems, where the samples of nodal states
are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). However, such a study is
less explored for DAGs with dynamical systems, where the nodal states are
temporally correlated. We call such a DAG underlying an LDS as \emph{dynamical}
DAG (DDAG). In particular, we consider a DDAG where the nodal dynamics are
driven by unobserved exogenous noise sources that are wide-sense stationary
(WSS) in time but are mutually uncorrelated, and have the same {power spectral
density (PSD)}. Inspired by the static settings, a metric and an algorithm
based on the PSD matrix of the observed time series are proposed to reconstruct
the DDAG. The equal noise PSD assumption can be relaxed such that
identifiability conditions for DDAG reconstruction are not violated. For the
LDS with WSS (sub) Gaussian exogenous noise sources, it is shown that the
optimal sample complexity (or length of state trajectory) needed to learn the
DDAG is $n=\Theta(q\log(p/q))$, where $p$ is the number of nodes and $q$ is the
maximum number of parents per node. To prove the sample complexity upper bound,
a concentration bound for the PSD estimation is derived, under two different
sampling strategies. A matching min-max lower bound using generalized Fano's
inequality also is provided, thus showing the order optimality of the proposed
algorithm.]]></summary>

non-convex and non-smooth in a federated setting where the data is distributed
across a multitude of devices. Due to the decentralized nature of federated
environments, distributed learning becomes essential for scalability and
adaptability. Moreover, these environments are often plagued by outlier data,
which presents substantial challenges to conventional methods, particularly in
maintaining estimation accuracy and ensuring algorithm convergence. To mitigate
these challenges, we propose a method that adopts an $L_1$-norm robust
formulation within a distributed sub-gradient framework, explicitly designed to
handle these obstacles. Our approach addresses the problem in its original
form, without resorting to iterative simplifications or approximations,
resulting in enhanced computational efficiency and improved estimation
accuracy. We demonstrate that our method converges to a stationary point,
highlighting its effectiveness and reliability. Through numerical simulations,
we confirm the superior performance of our approach, notably in outlier-rich
environments, which surpasses existing state-of-the-art localization methods.]]></summary>

and it has been repeatedly associated with increased mortality. Forecasting
future service demand has the potential patient outcomes. Despite active
research on the subject, several gaps remain: 1) proposed forecasting models

(ML), 2) amount of multivariable input data has been limited and 3) discrete
performance metrics have been rarely reported. In this study, we document the
performance of a set of advanced ML models in forecasting ED occupancy 24 hours
ahead. We use electronic health record data from a large, combined ED with an
extensive set of explanatory variables, including the availability of beds in
catchment area hospitals, traffic data from local observation stations, weather
variables, etc. We show that N-BEATS and LightGBM outpeform benchmarks with 11
% and 9 % respective improvements and that DeepAR predicts next day crowding
with an AUC of 0.76 (95 % CI 0.69-0.84). To the best of our knowledge, this is

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The rapid development of blockchain has led to more and more funding pouring
into the cryptocurrency market, which also attracted cybercriminals' interest
in recent years. The Ponzi scheme, an old-fashioned fraud, is now popular on
the blockchain, causing considerable financial losses to many crypto-investors.
A few Ponzi detection methods have been proposed in the literature, most of
which detect a Ponzi scheme based on its smart contract source code or opcode.
The contract-code-based approach, while achieving very high accuracy, is not
robust: first, the source codes of a majority of contracts on Ethereum are not
available, and second, a Ponzi developer can fool a contract-code-based
detection model by obfuscating the opcode or inventing a new profit
distribution logic that cannot be detected (since these models were trained on
existing Ponzi logics only). A transaction-based approach could improve the
robustness of detection because transactions, unlike smart contracts, are
harder to be manipulated. However, the current transaction-based detection
models achieve fairly low accuracy. We address this gap in the literature by
developing new detection models that rely only on the transactions, hence
guaranteeing the robustness, and moreover, achieve considerably higher
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score than existing transaction-based
models. This is made possible thanks to the introduction of novel
time-dependent features that capture Ponzi behaviours characteristics derived
from our comprehensive data analyses on Ponzi and non-Ponzi data from the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The vulnerabilities to backdoor attacks have recently threatened the
trustworthiness of machine learning models in practical applications.
Conventional wisdom suggests that not everyone can be an attacker since the
process of designing the trigger generation algorithm often involves
significant effort and extensive experimentation to ensure the attack's
stealthiness and effectiveness. Alternatively, this paper shows that there
exists a more severe backdoor threat: anyone can exploit an easily-accessible
algorithm for silent backdoor attacks. Specifically, this attacker can employ
the widely-used lossy image compression from a plethora of compression tools to
effortlessly inject a trigger pattern into an image without leaving any
noticeable trace; i.e., the generated triggers are natural artifacts. One does
not require extensive knowledge to click on the "convert" or "save as" button
while using tools for lossy image compression. Via this attack, the adversary
does not need to design a trigger generator as seen in prior works and only
requires poisoning the data. Empirically, the proposed attack consistently
achieves 100% attack success rate in several benchmark datasets such as MNIST,
CIFAR-10, GTSRB and CelebA. More significantly, the proposed attack can still
achieve almost 100% attack success rate with very small (approximately 10%)
poisoning rates in the clean label setting. The generated trigger of the
proposed attack using one lossy compression algorithm is also transferable
across other related compression algorithms, exacerbating the severity of this
backdoor threat. This work takes another crucial step toward understanding the
extensive risks of backdoor attacks in practice, urging practitioners to
investigate similar attacks and relevant backdoor mitigation methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Decentralized federated learning (DFL) has gained popularity due to its
practicality across various applications. Compared to the centralized version,
training a shared model among a large number of nodes in DFL is more
challenging, as there is no central server to coordinate the training process.
Especially when distributed nodes suffer from limitations in communication or
computational resources, DFL will experience extremely inefficient and unstable
training. Motivated by these challenges, in this paper, we develop a novel
algorithm based on the framework of the inexact alternating direction method
(iADM). On one hand, our goal is to train a shared model with a sparsity
constraint. This constraint enables us to leverage one-bit compressive sensing
(1BCS), allowing transmission of one-bit information among neighbour nodes. On
the other hand, communication between neighbour nodes occurs only at certain
steps, reducing the number of communication rounds. Therefore, the algorithm
exhibits notable communication efficiency. Additionally, as each node selects
only a subset of neighbours to participate in the training, the algorithm is
robust against stragglers. Additionally, complex items are computed only once
for several consecutive steps and subproblems are solved inexactly using
closed-form solutions, resulting in high computational efficiency. Finally,
numerical experiments showcase the algorithm's effectiveness in both
communication and computation.]]></summary>

support systems (DSSs). The best-performing predictive models used in AI-based
DSSs lack transparency. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to
create AI systems that can explain their rationale to human users. Local
explanations in XAI can provide information about the causes of individual
predictions in terms of feature importance. However, a critical drawback of
existing local explanation methods is their inability to quantify the
uncertainty associated with a feature's importance. This paper introduces an
extension of a feature importance explanation method, Calibrated Explanations
(CE), previously only supporting classification, with support for standard
regression and probabilistic regression, i.e., the probability that the target
is above an arbitrary threshold. The extension for regression keeps all the
benefits of CE, such as calibration of the prediction from the underlying model
with confidence intervals, uncertainty quantification of feature importance,
and allows both factual and counterfactual explanations. CE for standard
regression provides fast, reliable, stable, and robust explanations. CE for
probabilistic regression provides an entirely new way of creating probabilistic
explanations from any ordinary regression model and with a dynamic selection of
thresholds. The performance of CE for probabilistic regression regarding
stability and speed is comparable to LIME. The method is model agnostic with
easily understood conditional rules. An implementation in Python is freely
available on GitHub and for installation using pip making the results in this
paper easily replicable.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Detection of tumors in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) plays an essential
role in the early diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer. Deep learning models
backboned by fully convolutional neural networks (FCNNs) have become the
dominant model for segmenting 3D computerized tomography (CT) scans. However,
since their convolution layers suffer from limited kernel size, they are not
able to capture long-range dependencies and global context. To tackle this
restriction, vision transformers have been introduced to solve FCNN's locality
of receptive fields. Although transformers can capture long-range features,
their segmentation performance decreases with various tumor sizes due to the
model sensitivity to the input patch size. While finding an optimal patch size
improves the performance of vision transformer-based models on segmentation
tasks, it is a time-consuming and challenging procedure. This paper proposes a
technique to select the vision transformer's optimal input multi-resolution
image patch size based on the average volume size of metastasis lesions. We
further validated our suggested framework using a transfer-learning technique,
demonstrating that the highest Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) performance
was obtained by pre-training on training data with a larger tumour volume using
the suggested ideal patch size and then training with a smaller one. We
experimentally evaluate this idea through pre-training our model on a
multi-resolution public dataset. Our model showed consistent and improved
results when applied to our private multi-resolution mCRC dataset with a
smaller average tumor volume. This study lays the groundwork for optimizing
semantic segmentation of small objects using vision transformers. The

location labels, which imposes a high deployment cost. This paper develops a
region-based radio map from received signal strength (RSS) measurements without
location labels. The construction is based on a set of blindly collected RSS
measurement data from a device that visits each region in an indoor area
exactly once, where the footprints and timestamps are not recorded. The main
challenge is to cluster the RSS data and match clusters with the physical
regions. Classical clustering algorithms fail to work as the RSS data naturally
appears as non-clustered due to multipaths and noise. In this paper, a signal
subspace model with a sequential prior is constructed for the RSS data, and an
integrated segmentation and clustering algorithm is developed, which is shown
to find the globally optimal solution in a special case. Furthermore, the
clustered data is matched with the physical regions using a graph-based
approach. Based on real measurements from an office space, the proposed scheme
reduces the region localization error by roughly 50% compared to a weighted
centroid localization (WCL) baseline, and it even outperforms some supervised
localization schemes, including k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector
machine (SVM), and deep neural network (DNN), which require labeled data for

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The success of existing multi-view clustering (MVC) relies on the assumption
that all views are complete. However, samples are usually partially available
due to data corruption or sensor malfunction, which raises the research of
incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC). Although several anchor-based IMVC
methods have been proposed to process the large-scale incomplete data, they
still suffer from the following drawbacks: i) Most existing approaches neglect
the inter-view discrepancy and enforce cross-view representation to be
consistent, which would corrupt the representation capability of the model; ii)
Due to the samples disparity between different views, the learned anchor might
be misaligned, which we referred as the Anchor-Unaligned Problem for Incomplete
data (AUP-ID). Such the AUP-ID would cause inaccurate graph fusion and degrades
clustering performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel incomplete
anchor graph learning framework termed Scalable Incomplete Multi-View
Clustering with Structure Alignment (SIMVC-SA). Specially, we construct the
view-specific anchor graph to capture the complementary information from
different views. In order to solve the AUP-ID, we propose a novel structure
alignment module to refine the cross-view anchor correspondence. Meanwhile, the
anchor graph construction and alignment are jointly optimized in our unified
framework to enhance clustering quality. Through anchor graph construction
instead of full graphs, the time and space complexity of the proposed SIMVC-SA
is proven to be linearly correlated with the number of samples. Extensive
experiments on seven incomplete benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/wy1019/SIMVC-SA.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Masked image modeling has been demonstrated as a powerful pretext task for
generating robust representations that can be effectively generalized across
multiple downstream tasks. Typically, this approach involves randomly masking
patches (tokens) in input images, with the masking strategy remaining unchanged
during training. In this paper, we propose a curriculum learning approach that
updates the masking strategy to continually increase the complexity of the
self-supervised reconstruction task. We conjecture that, by gradually
increasing the task complexity, the model can learn more sophisticated and
transferable representations. To facilitate this, we introduce a novel
learnable masking module that possesses the capability to generate masks of
different complexities, and integrate the proposed module into masked
autoencoders (MAE). Our module is jointly trained with the MAE, while adjusting
its behavior during training, transitioning from a partner to the MAE
(optimizing the same reconstruction loss) to an adversary (optimizing the
opposite loss), while passing through a neutral state. The transition between
these behaviors is smooth, being regulated by a factor that is multiplied with
the reconstruction loss of the masking module. The resulting training procedure
generates an easy-to-hard curriculum. We train our Curriculum-Learned Masked
Autoencoder (CL-MAE) on ImageNet and show that it exhibits superior
representation learning capabilities compared to MAE. The empirical results on
five downstream tasks confirm our conjecture, demonstrating that curriculum
learning can be successfully used to self-supervise masked autoencoders.]]></summary>

that: 1) working with quantum data can be perceived as embedding physical
system parameters through a hidden feature map; 2) their high performance for
quantum phase recognition can be attributed to generation of a very suitable
basis set during the ground state embedding, where quantum criticality of spin
models leads to basis functions with rapidly changing features; 3) pooling
layers of QCNNs are responsible for picking those basis functions that can
contribute to forming a high-performing decision boundary, and the learning
process corresponds to adapting the measurement such that few-qubit operators
are mapped to full-register observables; 4) generalization of QCNN models
strongly depends on the embedding type, and that rotation-based feature maps
with the Fourier basis require careful feature engineering; 5) accuracy and
generalization of QCNNs with readout based on a limited number of shots favor
the ground state embeddings and associated physics-informed models. We
demonstrate these points in simulation, where our results shed light on
classification for physical processes, relevant for applications in sensing.
Finally, we show that QCNNs with properly chosen ground state embeddings can be
used for fluid dynamics problems, expressing shock wave solutions with good

generation. As these models scale up, there is an increasing need for the
output to handle more intricate tasks. Moreover, in bioinformatics, generating
functional programs poses additional notable challenges due to the amount of

bioinformatics code. In relation to function-code generation, BioCoder covers
potential package dependencies, class declarations, and global variables. It
incorporates 1026 functions and 1243 methods in Python and Java from GitHub and
253 examples from the Rosalind Project. BioCoder incorporates a fuzz-testing
framework for evaluation, and we have applied it to evaluate many models

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graph classification, aiming at learning the graph-level representations for
effective class assignments, has received outstanding achievements, which
heavily relies on high-quality datasets that have balanced class distribution.
In fact, most real-world graph data naturally presents a long-tailed form,
where the head classes occupy much more samples than the tail classes, it thus
is essential to study the graph-level classification over long-tailed data
while still remaining largely unexplored. However, most existing long-tailed
learning methods in visions fail to jointly optimize the representation
learning and classifier training, as well as neglect the mining of the
hard-to-classify classes. Directly applying existing methods to graphs may lead
to sub-optimal performance, since the model trained on graphs would be more
sensitive to the long-tailed distribution due to the complex topological
characteristics. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel long-tailed
graph-level classification framework via Collaborative Multi-expert Learning
(CoMe) to tackle the problem. To equilibrate the contributions of head and tail
classes, we first develop balanced contrastive learning from the view of
representation learning, and then design an individual-expert classifier
training based on hard class mining. In addition, we execute gated fusion and
disentangled knowledge distillation among the multiple experts to promote the
collaboration in a multi-expert framework. Comprehensive experiments are
performed on seven widely-used benchmark datasets to demonstrate the
superiority of our method CoMe over state-of-the-art baselines.]]></summary>

improving quantitative metrics regardless of other factors. In human-centered
applications, like skin lesion classification in dermatology, DL-driven
clinical decision support systems are still in their infancy due to the limited
transparency of their decision-making process. Moreover, the lack of procedures
that can explain the behavior of trained DL algorithms leads to almost no trust
from clinical physicians. To diagnose skin lesions, dermatologists rely on
visual assessment of the disease and the data gathered from the patient's
anamnesis. Data-driven algorithms dealing with multi-modal data are limited by
the separation of feature-level and decision-level fusion procedures required
by convolutional architectures. To address this issue, we enable single-stage
multi-modal data fusion via the attention mechanism of transformer-based
architectures to aid in diagnosing skin diseases. Our method beats other
state-of-the-art single- and multi-modal DL architectures in image-rich and
patient-data-rich environments. Additionally, the choice of the architecture
enables native interpretability support for the classification task both in the

label-deficient target network by transferring the knowledge from a source
network with abundant labels, draws increasing attention recently. To address
CNNC, we propose a domain-adaptive message passing graph neural network
(DM-GNN), which integrates graph neural network (GNN) with conditional
adversarial domain adaptation. DM-GNN is capable of learning informative
representations for node classification that are also transferrable across
networks. Firstly, a GNN encoder is constructed by dual feature extractors to
separate ego-embedding learning from neighbor-embedding learning so as to
jointly capture commonality and discrimination between connected nodes.
Secondly, a label propagation node classifier is proposed to refine each node's
label prediction by combining its own prediction and its neighbors' prediction.
In addition, a label-aware propagation scheme is devised for the labeled source
network to promote intra-class propagation while avoiding inter-class
propagation, thus yielding label-discriminative source embeddings. Thirdly,
conditional adversarial domain adaptation is performed to take the
neighborhood-refined class-label information into account during adversarial
domain adaptation, so that the class-conditional distributions across networks
can be better matched. Comparisons with eleven state-of-the-art methods
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DM-GNN.]]></summary>

registration (PCR) that improves the generalization and the performance of
registration models. While learning-based approaches have achieved impressive
progress, generalization to unknown testing environments remains a major
challenge due to the variations in 3D scans. Existing methods typically train a
generic model and the same trained model is applied on each instance during
testing. This could be sub-optimal since it is difficult for the same model to
handle all the variations during testing. In this paper, we propose a test-time
adaptation approach for PCR. Our model can adapt to unseen distributions at
test-time without requiring any prior knowledge of the test data. Concretely,
we design three self-supervised auxiliary tasks that are optimized jointly with
the primary PCR task. Given a test instance, we adapt our model using these
auxiliary tasks and the updated model is used to perform the inference. During
training, our model is trained using a meta-auxiliary learning approach, such
that the adapted model via auxiliary tasks improves the accuracy of the primary

meta-learning to explicitly learn network parameters for test-time adaption.
Our method does not require any prior information about the test data. During
meta-training, the model parameters are learned from a collection of
instance-level tasks, each of which consists of a sparse-dense pair of point
clouds from the training data. During meta-testing, the trained model is
fine-tuned with a few gradient updates to produce a unique set of network
parameters for each test instance. The updated model is then used for the final
prediction. Our framework is generic and can be applied in a plug-and-play

incorporating data analysis replications into classrooms as a potential
solution. However, despite the potential benefits, it is unclear whether this
approach is feasible, and if so, what the involved stakeholders-students,
educators, and scientists-should expect from it. Can students perform a data
analysis replication over the course of a class? What are the costs and
benefits for educators? And how can this solution help benchmark and improve
the state of science?

In the present study, we incorporated data analysis replications in the
project component of the Applied Data Analysis course (CS-401) taught at EPFL
(N=354 students). Here we report pre-registered findings based on surveys
administered throughout the course. First, we demonstrate that students can
replicate previously published scientific papers, most of them qualitatively
and some exactly. We find discrepancies between what students expect of data
analysis replications and what they experience by doing them along with changes
in expectations about reproducibility, which together serve as evidence of
attitude shifts to foster students' critical thinking. Second, we provide
information for educators about how much overhead is needed to incorporate
replications into the classroom and identify concerns that replications bring
as compared to more traditional assignments. Third, we identify tangible
benefits of the in-class data analysis replications for scientific communities,
such as a collection of replication reports and insights about replication
barriers in scientific work that should be avoided going forward.

Overall, we demonstrate that incorporating replication tasks into a large
data science class can increase the reproducibility of scientific work as a
by-product of data science instruction, thus benefiting both science and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We present a linear algebra formulation of backpropagation which allows the
calculation of gradients by using a generically written ``backslash'' or
Gaussian elimination on triangular systems of equations. Generally, the matrix
elements are operators. This paper has three contributions: (i) it is of
intellectual value to replace traditional treatments of automatic
differentiation with a (left acting) operator theoretic, graph-based approach;
(ii) operators can be readily placed in matrices in software in programming
languages such as Julia as an implementation option; (iii) we introduce a novel
notation, ``transpose dot'' operator ``$\{\}^{T_\bullet}$'' that allows for the
reversal of operators.

We further demonstrate the elegance of the operators approach in a suitable
programming language consisting of generic linear algebra operators such as
Julia \cite{bezanson2017julia}, and that it is possible to realize this
abstraction in code. Our implementation shows how generic linear algebra can
allow operators as elements of matrices. In contrast to ``operator
overloading,'' where backslash would normally have to be rewritten to take
advantage of operators, with ``generic programming'' there is no such need.]]></summary>

natural science, social networks, or the semantic web. However, while being
rich in information, graphs are often noisy and incomplete. As a result, graph
completion tasks, such as node classification or link prediction, have gained
attention. On one hand, neural methods, such as graph neural networks, have
proven to be robust tools for learning rich representations of noisy graphs. On
the other hand, symbolic methods enable exact reasoning on graphs.We propose
Knowledge Enhanced Graph Neural Networks (KeGNN), a neuro-symbolic framework
for graph completion that combines both paradigms as it allows for the
integration of prior knowledge into a graph neural network model.Essentially,
KeGNN consists of a graph neural network as a base upon which knowledge
enhancement layers are stacked with the goal of refining predictions with
respect to prior knowledge.We instantiate KeGNN in conjunction with two
state-of-the-art graph neural networks, Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph
Attention Networks, and evaluate KeGNN on multiple benchmark datasets for node

capture well both local and global information in two dimensions, which is
where most graph drawing live. The choice of using a local or a global
embedding for visualization depends not only on the task but also on the
structure of the underlying data, which may not be known in advance. For a
given graph, LGS aims to find a good balance between the local and global
structure to preserve. We evaluate the performance of LGS with synthetic and
real-world datasets and our results indicate that it is competitive with the
state-of-the-art methods, using established quality metrics such as stress and

distance preservation, to assess intermediate structure capture. All

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mobile Internet has profoundly reshaped modern lifestyles in various aspects.
Encrypted Traffic Classification (ETC) naturally plays a crucial role in
managing mobile Internet, especially with the explosive growth of mobile apps
using encrypted communication. Despite some existing learning-based ETC methods
showing promising results, three-fold limitations still remain in real-world
network environments, 1) label bias caused by traffic class imbalance, 2)
traffic homogeneity caused by component sharing, and 3) training with reliance
on sufficient labeled traffic. None of the existing ETC methods can address all
these limitations. In this paper, we propose a novel Pre-trAining
Semi-Supervised ETC framework, dubbed PASS. Our key insight is to resample the
original train dataset and perform contrastive pre-training without using
individual app labels directly to avoid label bias issues caused by class
imbalance, while obtaining a robust feature representation to differentiate
overlapping homogeneous traffic by pulling positive traffic pairs closer and
pushing negative pairs away. Meanwhile, PASS designs a semi-supervised
optimization strategy based on pseudo-label iteration and dynamic loss
weighting algorithms in order to effectively utilize massive unlabeled traffic
data and alleviate manual train dataset annotation workload. PASS outperforms
state-of-the-art ETC methods and generic sampling approaches on four public
datasets with significant class imbalance and traffic homogeneity, remarkably
pushing the F1 of Cross-Platform215 with 1.31%, ISCX-17 with 9.12%.
Furthermore, we validate the generality of the contrastive pre-training and
pseudo-label iteration components of PASS, which can adaptively benefit ETC
methods with diverse feature extractors.]]></summary>

solving nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems without assuming
Lipschitz continuity conditions. A number of subgradient upper bounds and their
relationships are presented. By means of these upper bounding conditions, we
establish some uniform recursive relations for the Moreau envelopes for weakly
convex optimization. This uniform scheme simplifies and unifies the proof
schemes to establish rate of convergence for Prox-SubGrad without assuming
Lipschitz continuity. We present a novel convergence analysis in this context.
Furthermore, we propose some new stochastic subgradient upper bounding
conditions and establish convergence and iteration complexity rates for the
stochastic subgradient method (Sto-SubGrad) to solve non-Lipschitz and
nonsmooth stochastic optimization problems. In particular, for both
deterministic and stochastic subgradient methods on weakly convex optimization
problems without Lipschitz continuity, under any of the subgradient upper
bounding conditions to be introduced in the paper, we show that $O(1/\sqrt{T})$
convergence rate holds in terms of the square of gradient of the Moreau

and robustness against adversarial examples in deep neural networks (DNNs).
Although adversarial training (AT) improves robustness, it degrades the
standard accuracy, thus yielding the tradeoff. To mitigate this tradeoff, we
propose a novel AT method called ARREST, which comprises three components: (i)
adversarial finetuning (AFT), (ii) representation-guided knowledge distillation
(RGKD), and (iii) noisy replay (NR). AFT trains a DNN on adversarial examples
by initializing its parameters with a DNN that is standardly pretrained on
clean examples. RGKD and NR respectively entail a regularization term and an
algorithm to preserve latent representations of clean examples during AFT. RGKD
penalizes the distance between the representations of the standardly pretrained
and AFT DNNs. NR switches input adversarial examples to nonadversarial ones
when the representation changes significantly during AFT. By combining these
components, ARREST achieves both high standard accuracy and robustness.
Experimental results demonstrate that ARREST mitigates the tradeoff more
effectively than previous AT-based methods do.]]></summary>

rapidly emerged as powerful tools for generating realistic and diverse data
across various domains, including computer vision and other applied areas.
Consisting of a discriminative network and a generative network engaged in a
Minimax game, GANs have revolutionized the field of generative modeling. In
February 2018, GAN secured the leading spot on the ``Top Ten Global
Breakthrough Technologies List'' issued by the Massachusetts Science and
Technology Review. Over the years, numerous advancements have been proposed,
leading to a rich array of GAN variants, such as conditional GAN, Wasserstein
GAN, CycleGAN, and StyleGAN, among many others. This survey aims to provide a
general overview of GANs, summarizing the latent architecture, validation
metrics, and application areas of the most widely recognized variants. We also
delve into recent theoretical developments, exploring the profound connection
between the adversarial principle underlying GAN and Jensen-Shannon divergence,
while discussing the optimality characteristics of the GAN framework. The
efficiency of GAN variants and their model architectures will be evaluated
along with training obstacles as well as training solutions. In addition, a
detailed discussion will be provided, examining the integration of GANs with
newly developed deep learning frameworks such as Transformers, Physics-Informed
Neural Networks, Large Language models, and Diffusion models. Finally, we
reveal several issues as well as future research outlines in this field.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is a crucial issue in recommendation
systems. There has been an emergence of various public CTR datasets. However,
existing datasets primarily suffer from the following limitations. Firstly,
users generally click different types of items from multiple scenarios, and
modeling from multiple scenarios can provide a more comprehensive understanding
of users. Existing datasets only include data for the same type of items from a
single scenario. Secondly, multi-modal features are essential in multi-scenario
prediction as they address the issue of inconsistent ID encoding between
different scenarios. The existing datasets are based on ID features and lack
multi-modal features. Third, a large-scale dataset can provide a more reliable
evaluation of models, fully reflecting the performance differences between
models. The scale of existing datasets is around 100 million, which is
relatively small compared to the real-world CTR prediction. To address these
limitations, we propose AntM$^{2}$C, a Multi-Scenario Multi-Modal CTR dataset
based on industrial data from Alipay. Specifically, AntM$^{2}$C provides the
following advantages: 1) It covers CTR data of 5 different types of items,
providing insights into the preferences of users for different items, including
advertisements, vouchers, mini-programs, contents, and videos. 2) Apart from
ID-based features, AntM$^{2}$C also provides 2 multi-modal features, raw text
and image features, which can effectively establish connections between items
with different IDs. 3) AntM$^{2}$C provides 1 billion CTR data with 200
features, including 200 million users and 6 million items. It is currently the
largest-scale CTR dataset available. Based on AntM$^{2}$C, we construct several
typical CTR tasks and provide comparisons with baseline methods. The dataset

Our novel, validated image representation for time series consistently and

wide range of downstream applications such as segmentation and detection.
Previous works have shown that segmentation properties emerge in vision
transformers (ViTs) trained using self-supervised methods such as DINO, but not
in those trained on supervised classification tasks. In this study, we probe
whether segmentation emerges in transformer-based models solely as a result of
intricate self-supervised learning mechanisms, or if the same emergence can be
achieved under much broader conditions through proper design of the model
architecture. Through extensive experimental results, we demonstrate that when
employing a white-box transformer-like architecture known as CRATE, whose
design explicitly models and pursues low-dimensional structures in the data
distribution, segmentation properties, at both the whole and parts levels,
already emerge with a minimalistic supervised training recipe. Layer-wise
finer-grained analysis reveals that the emergent properties strongly
corroborate the designed mathematical functions of the white-box network. Our
results suggest a path to design white-box foundation models that are
simultaneously highly performant and mathematically fully interpretable. Code

scenarios: classification of the discrete labels and regression of the
continuously tagged labels. Although many algorithms were proposed for
classification tasks, there are only a few methods for regression tasks. For
emotion regression, the label is continuous in time. A natural method is to
learn the temporal dynamic patterns. In previous studies, long short-term
memory (LSTM) and temporal convolutional neural networks (TCN) were utilized to
learn the temporal contextual information from feature vectors of EEG. However,
the spatial patterns of EEG were not effectively extracted. To enable the
spatial learning ability of TCN towards better regression and classification
performances, we propose a novel unified model, named MASA-TCN, for EEG emotion
regression and classification tasks. The space-aware temporal layer enables TCN
to additionally learn from spatial relations among EEG electrodes. Besides, a
novel multi-anchor block with attentive fusion is proposed to learn dynamic
temporal dependencies. Experiments on two publicly available datasets show
MASA-TCN achieves higher results than the state-of-the-art methods for both EEG
emotion regression and classification tasks. The code is available at

test data. Despite being a standard measure, average accuracy fails in
characterizing the fit of the model to the underlying conditional law of labels
given the features vector ($Y|X$), e.g. due to model misspecification, over
fitting, and high-dimensionality. In this paper, we consider the fundamental
problem of assessing the goodness-of-fit for a general binary classifier. Our
framework does not make any parametric assumption on the conditional law $Y|X$,
and treats that as a black box oracle model which can be accessed only through
queries. We formulate the goodness-of-fit assessment problem as a tolerance
hypothesis testing of the form \[ H_0: \mathbb{E}\Big[D_f\Big({\sf
Bern}(\eta(X))\|{\sf Bern}(\hat{\eta}(X))\Big)\Big]\leq \tau\,, \] where $D_f$
represents an $f$-divergence function, and $\eta(x)$, $\hat{\eta}(x)$
respectively denote the true and an estimate likelihood for a feature vector
$x$ admitting a positive label. We propose a novel test, called \grasp for
testing $H_0$, which works in finite sample settings, no matter the features
(distribution-free). We also propose model-X \grasp designed for model-X
settings where the joint distribution of the features vector is known. Model-X
\grasp uses this distributional information to achieve better power. We

function designed for data with simultaneous time and space dependencies. In
such a context, we study the Trend Filtering, a nonparametric estimator
introduced by \cite{mammen1997locally} and \cite{rudin1992nonlinear}. For
univariate settings, the signals we consider are assumed to have a kth weak
derivative with bounded total variation, allowing for a general degree of
smoothness. In the multivariate scenario, we study a $K$-Nearest Neighbor fused
lasso estimator as in \cite{padilla2018adaptive}, employing an ADMM algorithm,
suitable for signals with bounded variation that adhere to a piecewise
Lipschitz continuity criterion. By aligning with lower bounds, the minimax
optimality of our estimators is validated. A unique phase transition
phenomenon, previously uncharted in Trend Filtering studies, emerges through
our analysis. Both Simulation studies and real data applications underscore the
superior performance of our method when compared with established techniques in
the existing literature.]]></summary>

dissemination is crucial for supporting critical operations across domains like
disaster response, autonomous vehicles, and sensor networks. This paper
introduces a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach as a
significant step forward in achieving more decentralized, efficient, and
collaborative solutions. We propose a Decentralized-POMDP formulation for
information dissemination, empowering each agent to independently decide on
message forwarding. This constitutes a significant paradigm shift from
traditional heuristics based on Multi-Point Relay (MPR) selection. Our approach
harnesses Graph Convolutional Reinforcement Learning, employing Graph Attention
Networks (GAT) with dynamic attention to capture essential network features. We
propose two approaches, L-DGN and HL-DGN, which differ in the information that
is exchanged among agents. We evaluate the performance of our decentralized
approaches, by comparing them with a widely-used MPR heuristic, and we show
that our trained policies are able to efficiently cover the network while
bypassing the MPR set selection process. Our approach promises a first step
toward bolstering the resilience of real-world broadcast communication

designing reaction pathways from commercially available starting materials to a
target molecule. Each step in multi-step retrosynthesis planning requires
accurate prediction of possible precursor molecules given the target molecule
and confidence estimates to guide heuristic search algorithms. We model
single-step retrosynthesis planning as a distribution learning problem in a
discrete state space. First, we introduce the Markov Bridge Model, a generative
framework aimed to approximate the dependency between two intractable discrete
distributions accessible via a finite sample of coupled data points. Our
framework is based on the concept of a Markov bridge, a Markov process pinned
at its endpoints. Unlike diffusion-based methods, our Markov Bridge Model does
not need a tractable noise distribution as a sampling proxy and directly
operates on the input product molecules as samples from the intractable prior
distribution. We then address the retrosynthesis planning problem with our
novel framework and introduce RetroBridge, a template-free retrosynthesis
modeling approach that achieves state-of-the-art results on standard evaluation

nonparametric modeling, they exhibit limitations in effectively capturing
abrupt changes in function smoothness and accommodating relationships with
heteroscedastic errors. Addressing these shortcomings, the heteroscedastic
Gaussian process (HeGP) regression seeks to introduce flexibility by
acknowledging the variability of residual variances across covariates in the
regression model. In this work, we extend the HeGP concept, expanding its scope
beyond regression tasks to encompass classification and state-space models. To
achieve this, we propose a novel framework where the Gaussian process is
coupled with a covariate-induced precision matrix process, adopting a mixture
formulation. This approach enables the modeling of heteroscedastic covariance
functions across covariates. To mitigate the computational challenges posed by
sampling, we employ variational inference to approximate the posterior and
facilitate posterior predictive modeling. Additionally, our training process
leverages an EM algorithm featuring closed-form M-step updates to efficiently
evaluate the heteroscedastic covariance function. A notable feature of our
model is its consistent performance on multivariate responses, accommodating
various types (continuous or categorical) seamlessly. Through a combination of
simulations and real-world applications in climatology, we illustrate the
model's prowess and advantages. By overcoming the limitations of traditional
Gaussian process models, our proposed framework offers a robust and versatile
tool for a wide array of applications.]]></summary>

effective iterative solvers. Often, these systems are noisy due to operational
errors or faulty data-collection processes. In the past decade, the randomized
Kaczmarz (RK) algorithm has been studied extensively as an efficient iterative
solver for such systems. However, the convergence study of RK in the noisy
regime is limited and considers measurement noise in the right-hand side
vector, $b$. Unfortunately, in practice, that is not always the case; the
coefficient matrix $A$ can also be noisy. In this paper, we analyze the
convergence of RK for noisy linear systems when the coefficient matrix, $A$, is
corrupted with both additive and multiplicative noise, along with the noisy
vector, $b$. In our analyses, the quantity $\tilde R=\| \tilde A^{\dagger}
\|_2^2 \|\tilde A \|_F^2$ influences the convergence of RK, where $\tilde A$
represents a noisy version of $A$. We claim that our analysis is robust and
realistically applicable, as we do not require information about the noiseless
coefficient matrix, $A$, and considering different conditions on noise, we can
control the convergence of RK. We substantiate our theoretical findings by
performing comprehensive numerical experiments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a prominent research topic in
the field of machine learning. Existing GNN models are commonly categorized
into two types: spectral GNNs, which are designed based on polynomial graph
filters, and spatial GNNs, which utilize a message-passing scheme as the
foundation of the model. For the expressive power and universality of spectral
GNNs, a natural approach is to improve the design of basis functions for better
approximation ability. As for spatial GNNs, models like Graph Isomorphism
Networks (GIN) analyze their expressive power based on Graph Isomorphism Tests.
Recently, there have been attempts to establish connections between spatial
GNNs and geometric concepts like curvature and cellular sheaves, as well as
physical phenomena like oscillators. However, despite the recent progress,
there is still a lack of comprehensive analysis regarding the universality of
spatial GNNs from the perspectives of geometry and physics. In this paper, we
propose MetricGNN (MGNN), a spatial GNN model inspired by the
congruent-insensitivity property of classifiers in the classification phase of
GNNs. We demonstrate that a GNN model is universal in the spatial domain if it
can generate embedding matrices that are congruent to any given embedding
matrix. This property is closely related to the Distance Geometry Problem
(DGP). Since DGP is an NP-Hard combinatorial optimization problem, we propose
optimizing an energy function derived from spring networks and the
Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) problem. This approach also allows our model to
handle both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Finally, we propose employing
the iteration method to optimize our energy function. We extensively evaluate
the effectiveness of our model through experiments conducted on both synthetic
and real-world datasets. Our code is available at:

in which a student agent (i.e. mobile device) queries a teacher agent (i.e.
cloud sever) to generate higher-order data semantics living in a simplicial
complex. Specifically, the teacher first maps its data into a k-order
simplicial complex and learns its high-order correlations. For effective
communication and inference, the teacher seeks minimally sufficient and
invariant semantic structures prior to conveying information. These minimal
simplicial structures are found via judiciously removing simplices selected by
the Hodge Laplacians without compromising the inference query accuracy.
Subsequently, the student locally runs its own set of queries based on a masked
simplicial convolutional autoencoder (SCAE) leveraging both local and remote
teacher's knowledge. Numerical results corroborate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach in terms of improving inference query accuracy under
different channel conditions and simplicial structures. Experiments on a
coauthorship dataset show that removing simplices by ranking the Laplacian
values yields a 85% reduction in payload size without sacrificing accuracy.
Joint semantic communication and inference by masked SCAE improves query
accuracy by 25% compared to local student based query and 15% compared to
remote teacher based query. Finally, incorporating channel semantics is shown

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Accurate traffic forecasting at intersections governed by intelligent traffic
signals is critical for the advancement of an effective intelligent traffic
signal control system. However, due to the irregular traffic time series
produced by intelligent intersections, the traffic forecasting task becomes
much more intractable and imposes three major new challenges: 1) asynchronous
spatial dependency, 2) irregular temporal dependency among traffic data, and 3)
variable-length sequence to be predicted, which severely impede the performance
of current traffic forecasting methods. To this end, we propose an Asynchronous
Spatio-tEmporal graph convolutional nEtwoRk (ASeer) to predict the traffic
states of the lanes entering intelligent intersections in a future time window.
Specifically, by linking lanes via a traffic diffusion graph, we first propose
an Asynchronous Graph Diffusion Network to model the asynchronous spatial
dependency between the time-misaligned traffic state measurements of lanes.
After that, to capture the temporal dependency within irregular traffic state
sequence, a learnable personalized time encoding is devised to embed the
continuous time for each lane. Then we propose a Transformable Time-aware
Convolution Network that learns meta-filters to derive time-aware convolution
filters with transformable filter sizes for efficient temporal convolution on
the irregular sequence. Furthermore, a Semi-Autoregressive Prediction Network
consisting of a state evolution unit and a semiautoregressive predictor is
designed to effectively and efficiently predict variable-length traffic state
sequences. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of ASeer in six metrics.]]></summary>

both conditional and unconditional generation. Still conditional generation is
based on either a specific training of a conditional model or classifier
guidance, which requires training a noise-dependent classifier, even when the

unconditional score-based generative models enforcing arbitrary logical
constraints, without any additional training. Firstly, we show how to
manipulate the learned score in order to sample from an un-normalized
distribution conditional on a user-defined constraint. Then, we define a
flexible and numerically stable neuro-symbolic framework for encoding soft
logical constraints. Combining these two ingredients we obtain a general, but

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Partial Label Learning (PLL) is a type of weakly supervised learning where
each training instance is assigned a set of candidate labels, but only one
label is the ground-truth. However, this idealistic assumption may not always
hold due to potential annotation inaccuracies, meaning the ground-truth may not
be present in the candidate label set. This is known as Unreliable Partial
Label Learning (UPLL) that introduces an additional complexity due to the
inherent unreliability and ambiguity of partial labels, often resulting in a
sub-optimal performance with existing methods. To address this challenge, we
propose the Unreliability-Robust Representation Learning framework (URRL) that
leverages unreliability-robust contrastive learning to help the model fortify
against unreliable partial labels effectively. Concurrently, we propose a dual
strategy that combines KNN-based candidate label set correction and
consistency-regularization-based label disambiguation to refine label quality
and enhance the ability of representation learning within the URRL framework.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art PLL methods on various datasets with diverse degrees of
unreliability and ambiguity. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of
our approach from the perspective of the expectation maximization (EM)
algorithm. Upon acceptance, we pledge to make the code publicly accessible.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over-squashing and over-smoothing are two critical issues, that limit the
capabilities of graph neural networks (GNNs). While over-smoothing eliminates
the differences between nodes making them indistinguishable, over-squashing
refers to the inability of GNNs to propagate information over long distances,
as exponentially many node states are squashed into fixed-size representations.
Both phenomena share similar causes, as both are largely induced by the graph
topology. To mitigate these problems in graph classification tasks, we propose
CurvPool, a novel pooling method. CurvPool exploits the notion of curvature of
a graph to adaptively identify structures responsible for both over-smoothing
and over-squashing. By clustering nodes based on the Balanced Forman curvature,
CurvPool constructs a graph with a more suitable structure, allowing deeper
models and the combination of distant information. We compare it to other
state-of-the-art pooling approaches and establish its competitiveness in terms
of classification accuracy, computational complexity, and flexibility. CurvPool
outperforms several comparable methods across all considered tasks. The most
consistent results are achieved by pooling densely connected clusters using the
sum aggregation, as this allows additional information about the size of each
pool.]]></summary>

adequate infrastructure, deployment of low-carbon transport modes and shifts in
travel behavior. To adequately implement alterations in infrastructure, it's
essential to grasp the location-specific cause-and-effect mechanisms that the
constructed environment has on travel. Yet, current research falls short in
representing causal relationships between the 6D urban form variables and
travel, generalizing across different regions, and modeling urban form effects
at high spatial resolution. Here, we address all three gaps by utilizing a
causal discovery and an explainable machine learning framework to detect urban
form effects on intra-city travel based on high-resolution mobility data of six
cities across three continents. We show that both distance to city center,
demographics and density indirectly affect other urban form features. By
considering the causal relationships, we find that location-specific influences
align across cities, yet vary in magnitude. In addition, the spread of the city
and the coverage of jobs across the city are the strongest determinants of
travel-related emissions, highlighting the benefits of compact development and
associated benefits. Differences in urban form effects across the cities call
for a more holistic definition of 6D measures. Our work is a starting point for
location-specific analysis of urban form effects on mobility behavior using
causal discovery approaches, which is highly relevant for city planners and
municipalities across continents.]]></summary>

node lesions. However, the diagnoses of these images largely hinge on the
expertise of medical practitioners, rendering the process susceptible to
misdiagnoses. Although rapidly developing deep learning has substantially
improved the diagnoses of diverse ultrasound images, there remains a
conspicuous research gap concerning cervical lymph nodes. The objective of our
work is to accurately diagnose cervical lymph node lesions by leveraging a deep
learning model. To this end, we first collected 3392 images containing normal
lymph nodes, benign lymph node lesions, malignant primary lymph node lesions,
and malignant metastatic lymph node lesions. Given that ultrasound images are
generated by the reflection and scattering of sound waves across varied bodily
tissues, we proposed the Conv-FFT Block. It integrates convolutional operations
with the fast Fourier transform to more astutely model the images. Building
upon this foundation, we designed a novel architecture, named US-SFNet. This
architecture not only discerns variances in ultrasound images from the spatial
domain but also adeptly captures microstructural alterations across various
lesions in the frequency domain. To ascertain the potential of US-SFNet, we
benchmarked it against 12 popular architectures through five-fold

challenge in the integrated circuit field due to the huge design space and
complex design trade-offs among circuit specifications. In the past decades,
intensive research efforts have mostly been paid to automate the transistor
sizing with a given circuit topology. By recognizing the graph nature of
circuits, this paper presents a Circuit Graph Neural Network (CktGNN) that
simultaneously automates the circuit topology generation and device sizing
based on the encoder-dependent optimization subroutines. Particularly, CktGNN
encodes circuit graphs using a two-level GNN framework (of nested GNN) where
circuits are represented as combinations of subgraphs in a known subgraph
basis. In this way, it significantly improves design efficiency by reducing the
number of subgraphs to perform message passing. Nonetheless, another critical
roadblock to advancing learning-assisted circuit design automation is a lack of
public benchmarks to perform canonical assessment and reproducible research. To
tackle the challenge, we introduce Open Circuit Benchmark (OCB), an
open-sourced dataset that contains $10$K distinct operational amplifiers with
carefully-extracted circuit specifications. OCB is also equipped with
communicative circuit generation and evaluation capabilities such that it can
help to generalize CktGNN to design various analog circuits by producing
corresponding datasets. Experiments on OCB show the extraordinary advantages of
CktGNN through representation-based optimization frameworks over other recent
powerful GNN baselines and human experts' manual designs. Our work paves the
way toward a learning-based open-sourced design automation for analog circuits.

their complex waveforms, extended duration, and low signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR), making them more challenging to be identified compared to compact binary
coalescences. While matched filtering-based techniques are known for their
computational demands, existing deep learning-based methods primarily handle
time-domain data and are often constrained by data duration and SNR. In
addition, most existing work ignores time-delay interferometry (TDI) and
applies the long-wavelength approximation in detector response calculations,
thus limiting their ability to handle laser frequency noise. In this study, we
introduce DECODE, an end-to-end model focusing on EMRI signal detection by
sequence modeling in the frequency domain. Centered around a dilated causal
convolutional neural network, trained on synthetic data considering TDI-1.5
detector response, DECODE can efficiently process a year's worth of
multichannel TDI data with an SNR of around 50. We evaluate our model on 1-year
data with accumulated SNR ranging from 50 to 120 and achieve a true positive
rate of 96.3% at a false positive rate of 1%, keeping an inference time of less

concerned by the low-efficiency in the remote working. Missing in text-based
communication are non-verbal cues such as facial expressions and body language,
which hinders the effective communication and negatively impacts the work

non-verbal cues, are gaining popularity in the virtual workspaces well. In this
paper, we study how emoji usage influences developer participation and issue
resolution in virtual workspaces. To this end, we collect GitHub issues for a
one-year period and apply causal inference techniques to measure the causal
effect of emojis on the outcome of issues, controlling for confounders such as
issue content, repository, and author information. We find that emojis can
significantly reduce the resolution time of issues and attract more user
participation. We also compare the heterogeneous effect on different types of

changes in policy parameters can lead to extremely different returns. For
example, in soccer, the ball can fly in completely different directions with a
similar heading motion by slightly changing the hitting position or the force
applied to the ball or when the friction of the ball varies. However, it is
difficult to imagine that completely different skills are needed for heading a
ball in different directions. In this study, we proposed a multitask
reinforcement learning algorithm for adapting a policy to implicit changes in
goals or environments in a single motion category with different reward
functions or physical parameters of the environment. We evaluated the proposed
method on the ball heading task using a monopod robot model. The results showed
that the proposed method can adapt to implicit changes in the goal positions or

a growing interest in automated anomaly detection systems. However, the
classification of anomalies detected on network Key Performance Indicators
(KPI) has received less attention, resulting in a lack of information about
anomaly characteristics and classification processes. To address this gap, this
paper proposes a modular anomaly classification framework. The framework
assumes separate entities for the anomaly classifier and the detector, allowing
for a distinct treatment of anomaly detection and classification tasks on time
series. The objectives of this study are (1) to develop a time series simulator
that generates synthetic time series resembling real-world network KPI
behavior, (2) to build a detection model to identify anomalies in the time
series, (3) to build classification models that accurately categorize detected
anomalies into predefined classes (4) to evaluate the classification framework
performance on simulated and real-world network KPI time series. This study has
demonstrated the good performance of the anomaly classification models trained
on simulated anomalies when applied to real-world network time series data.]]></summary>

high contrast imaging. However, these structures face challenges in data
reduction, leading to over-subtraction from speckles and self-subtraction with
most existing methods. Iterative post-processing methods offer promising
results, but their integration into existing pipelines is hindered by selective
algorithms, high computational cost, and algorithmic regularization. To address
this for reference differential imaging (RDI), here we propose the data
imputation concept to Karhunen-Lo\`eve transform (DIKL) by modifying two steps
in the standard Karhunen-Lo\`eve image projection (KLIP) method. Specifically,
we partition an image to two matrices: an anchor matrix which focuses only on
the speckles to obtain the DIKL coefficients, and a boat matrix which focuses
on the regions of astrophysical interest for speckle removal using DIKL
components. As an analytical approach, DIKL achieves high-quality results with
significantly reduced computational cost (~3 orders of magnitude less than
iterative methods). Being a derivative method of KLIP, DIKL is seamlessly
integrable into high contrast imaging pipelines for RDI observations.]]></summary>

progression that an exact Metropolis-Hastings (MH) sampler would take if it was
applicable. Informative log-likelihood evaluation locations are selected using
a sequential experimental design strategy until the MH accept/reject decision
is done accurately enough according to the GP model. The resulting approximate
sampler is conceptually simple and sample-efficient. It is also more robust to
violations of GP modelling assumptions compared with earlier, related "Bayesian
optimisation-like" methods tailored for Bayesian inference. We discuss some

depends on the empirical pull times of agents. ODC is a generic protocol that

differential equations (PDEs), neural networks have the potential to break the
curse of dimensionality, providing approximate solutions to problems where
using classical solvers is difficult or impossible. While global minimization
of the PDE residual over the network parameters works well for boundary value
problems, catastrophic forgetting impairs the applicability of this approach to
initial value problems (IVPs). In an alternative local-in-time approach, the
optimization problem can be converted into an ordinary differential equation
(ODE) on the network parameters and the solution propagated forward in time;
however, we demonstrate that current methods based on this approach suffer from
two key issues. First, following the ODE produces an uncontrolled growth in the
conditioning of the problem, ultimately leading to unacceptably large numerical
errors. Second, as the ODE methods scale cubically with the number of model
parameters, they are restricted to small neural networks, significantly
limiting their ability to represent intricate PDE initial conditions and
solutions. Building on these insights, we develop Neural IVP, an ODE based IVP
solver which prevents the network from getting ill-conditioned and runs in time
linear in the number of parameters, enabling us to evolve the dynamics of
challenging PDEs with neural networks.]]></summary>

support systems (DSSs). The best-performing predictive models used in AI-based
DSSs lack transparency. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to
create AI systems that can explain their rationale to human users. Local
explanations in XAI can provide information about the causes of individual
predictions in terms of feature importance. However, a critical drawback of
existing local explanation methods is their inability to quantify the
uncertainty associated with a feature's importance. This paper introduces an
extension of a feature importance explanation method, Calibrated Explanations
(CE), previously only supporting classification, with support for standard
regression and probabilistic regression, i.e., the probability that the target
is above an arbitrary threshold. The extension for regression keeps all the
benefits of CE, such as calibration of the prediction from the underlying model
with confidence intervals, uncertainty quantification of feature importance,
and allows both factual and counterfactual explanations. CE for standard
regression provides fast, reliable, stable, and robust explanations. CE for
probabilistic regression provides an entirely new way of creating probabilistic
explanations from any ordinary regression model and with a dynamic selection of
thresholds. The performance of CE for probabilistic regression regarding
stability and speed is comparable to LIME. The method is model agnostic with
easily understood conditional rules. An implementation in Python is freely
available on GitHub and for installation using pip making the results in this
paper easily replicable.]]></summary>

the dynamics of Hamiltonian systems that are invariant under a Lie group of

conserved quantities are observed. We propose to simulate and learn the
mappings of interest through the construction of $G$-invariant Lagrangian
submanifolds, which are pivotal objects in symplectic geometry. A notable
property of our constructions is that the simulated/learned dynamics also
preserves the same conserved quantities as the original system, resulting in a
more faithful surrogate of the original dynamics than non-symmetry aware
methods, and in a more accurate predictor of non-observed trajectories.
Furthermore, our setting is able to simulate/learn not only Hamiltonian flows,
but any Lie group-equivariant symplectic transformation. Our designs leverage
pivotal techniques and concepts in symplectic geometry and geometric mechanics:
reduction theory, Noether's Theorem, Lagrangian submanifolds, momentum
mappings, and coisotropic reduction among others. We also present methods to

powerful, efficient, and scientifically informative than separate analyses. To
address variation architectures correctly and comprehensively for
high-dimensional data across multiple sample sets (i.e., cohorts), we propose
multiple augmented reduced rank regression (maRRR), a flexible matrix
regression and factorization method to concurrently learn both covariate-driven

from combining multiple datasets, and from parsimoniously accounting for all
structured variation. We apply maRRR to gene expression data from multiple

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Large Language Model (LLM) inference consists of two distinct phases -
prefill phase which processes the input prompt and decode phase which generates
output tokens autoregressively. While the prefill phase effectively saturates
GPU compute at small batch sizes, the decode phase results in low compute
utilization as it generates one token at a time per request. The varying
prefill and decode times also lead to imbalance across micro-batches when using
pipeline parallelism, resulting in further inefficiency due to bubbles.

We present SARATHI to address these challenges. SARATHI employs
chunked-prefills, which splits a prefill request into equal sized chunks, and
decode-maximal batching, which constructs a batch using a single prefill chunk
and populates the remaining slots with decodes. During inference, the prefill
chunk saturates GPU compute, while the decode requests 'piggyback' and cost up
to an order of magnitude less compared to a decode-only batch. Chunked-prefills
allows constructing multiple decode-maximal batches from a single prefill
request, maximizing coverage of decodes that can piggyback. Furthermore, the
uniform compute design of these batches ameliorates the imbalance between
micro-batches, significantly reducing pipeline bubbles.

Our techniques yield significant improvements in inference performance across
models and hardware. For the LLaMA-13B model on A6000 GPU, SARATHI improves
decode throughput by up to 10x, and accelerates end-to-end throughput by up to
1.33x. For LLaMa-33B on A100 GPU, we achieve 1.25x higher end-to-end-throughput
and up to 4.25x higher decode throughput. When used with pipeline parallelism
on GPT-3, SARATHI reduces bubbles by 6.29x, resulting in an end-to-end
throughput improvement of 1.91x.]]></summary>

performance metrics have been rarely reported. In this study, we document the
performance of a set of advanced ML models in forecasting ED occupancy 24 hours
ahead. We use electronic health record data from a large, combined ED with an
extensive set of explanatory variables, including the availability of beds in
catchment area hospitals, traffic data from local observation stations, weather
variables, etc. We show that N-BEATS and LightGBM outpeform benchmarks with 11
% and 9 % respective improvements and that DeepAR predicts next day crowding
with an AUC of 0.76 (95 % CI 0.69-0.84). To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first study to document the superiority of LightGBM and N-BEATS over

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hypergraphs are important for processing data with higher-order relationships
involving more than two entities. In scenarios where explicit hypergraphs are
not readily available, it is desirable to infer a meaningful hypergraph
structure from the node features to capture the intrinsic relations within the
data. However, existing methods either adopt simple pre-defined rules that fail
to precisely capture the distribution of the potential hypergraph structure, or
learn a mapping between hypergraph structures and node features but require a
large amount of labelled data, i.e., pre-existing hypergraph structures, for
training. Both restrict their applications in practical scenarios. To fill this
gap, we propose a novel smoothness prior that enables us to design a method to
infer the probability for each potential hyperedge without labelled data as
supervision. The proposed prior indicates features of nodes in a hyperedge are
highly correlated by the features of the hyperedge containing them. We use this
prior to derive the relation between the hypergraph structure and the node
features via probabilistic modelling. This allows us to develop an unsupervised
inference method to estimate the probability for each potential hyperedge via
solving an optimisation problem that has an analytical solution. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our method can learn
meaningful hypergraph structures from data more efficiently than existing
hypergraph structure inference methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Community detection is an important content in complex network analysis. The
existing community detection methods in attributed networks mostly focus on
only using network structure, while the methods of integrating node attributes
is mainly for the traditional community structures, and cannot detect
multipartite structures and mixture structures in network. In addition, the
model-based community detection methods currently proposed for attributed
networks do not fully consider unique topology information of nodes, such as
betweenness centrality and clustering coefficient. Therefore, a stochastic
block model that integrates betweenness centrality and clustering coefficient
of nodes for community detection in attributed networks, named BCSBM, is
proposed in this paper. Different from other generative models for attributed
networks, the generation process of links and attributes in BCSBM model follows
the Poisson distribution, and the probability between community is considered
based on the stochastic block model. Moreover, the betweenness centrality and
clustering coefficient of nodes are introduced into the process of links and
attributes generation. Finally, the expectation maximization algorithm is
employed to estimate the parameters of the BCSBM model, and the node-community
memberships is obtained through the hard division process, so the community
detection is completed. By experimenting on six real-work networks containing
different network structures, and comparing with the community detection
results of five algorithms, the experimental results show that the BCSBM model
not only inherits the advantages of the stochastic block model and can detect
various network structures, but also has good data fitting ability due to
introducing the betweenness centrality and clustering coefficient of nodes.
Overall, the performance of this model is superior to other five compared
algorithms.]]></summary>

test data. Despite being a standard measure, average accuracy fails in
characterizing the fit of the model to the underlying conditional law of labels
given the features vector ($Y|X$), e.g. due to model misspecification, over
fitting, and high-dimensionality. In this paper, we consider the fundamental
problem of assessing the goodness-of-fit for a general binary classifier. Our
framework does not make any parametric assumption on the conditional law $Y|X$,
and treats that as a black box oracle model which can be accessed only through
queries. We formulate the goodness-of-fit assessment problem as a tolerance
hypothesis testing of the form \[ H_0: \mathbb{E}\Big[D_f\Big({\sf
Bern}(\eta(X))\|{\sf Bern}(\hat{\eta}(X))\Big)\Big]\leq \tau\,, \] where $D_f$
represents an $f$-divergence function, and $\eta(x)$, $\hat{\eta}(x)$
respectively denote the true and an estimate likelihood for a feature vector
$x$ admitting a positive label. We propose a novel test, called \grasp for
testing $H_0$, which works in finite sample settings, no matter the features
(distribution-free). We also propose model-X \grasp designed for model-X
settings where the joint distribution of the features vector is known. Model-X
\grasp uses this distributional information to achieve better power. We
evaluate the performance of our tests through extensive numerical experiments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A vast number of systems across the world use algorithmic decision making
(ADM) to (partially) automate decisions that have previously been made by
humans. When designed well, these systems promise more objective decisions
while saving large amounts of resources and freeing up human time. However,
when ADM systems are not designed well, they can lead to unfair decisions which
discriminate against societal groups. The downstream effects of ADMs critically
depend on the decisions made during the systems' design and implementation, as
biases in data can be mitigated or reinforced along the modeling pipeline. Many
of these design decisions are made implicitly, without knowing exactly how they
will influence the final system. It is therefore important to make explicit the
decisions made during the design of ADM systems and understand how these
decisions affect the fairness of the resulting system.

To study this issue, we draw on insights from the field of psychology and
introduce the method of multiverse analysis for algorithmic fairness. In our
proposed method, we turn implicit design decisions into explicit ones and
demonstrate their fairness implications. By combining decisions, we create a
grid of all possible "universes" of decision combinations. For each of these
universes, we compute metrics of fairness and performance. Using the resulting
dataset, one can see how and which decisions impact fairness. We demonstrate
how multiverse analyses can be used to better understand variability and
robustness of algorithmic fairness using an exemplary case study of predicting
public health coverage of vulnerable populations for potential interventions.
Our results illustrate how decisions during the design of a machine learning
system can have surprising effects on its fairness and how to detect these
effects using multiverse analysis.]]></summary>

properties which allow their efficient computation. We prove that the MMD of
Riesz kernels coincides with the MMD of their sliced version. As a consequence,
the computation of gradients of MMDs can be performed in the one-dimensional
setting. Here, for $r=1$, a simple sorting algorithm can be applied to reduce
the complexity from $O(MN+N^2)$ to $O((M+N)\log(M+N))$ for two measures with
$M$ and $N$ support points. As another interesting follow-up result, the MMD of
compactly supported measures can be estimated from above and below by the
Wasserstein-1 distance. For the implementations we approximate the gradient of
the sliced MMD by using only a finite number $P$ of slices. We show that the
resulting error has complexity $O(\sqrt{d/P})$, where $d$ is the data

the most challenging tasks in early discovery research. To tackle this
challenge, biopharma research established a standardized high content imaging
protocol that tags different cellular compartments per image channel. In order

channel importance with respect to a certain phenotype for decoding the
underlying biology. In contrast to traditional image analysis approaches, such
experiments are nowadays preferably analyzed by deep learning based approaches
which, however, lack crucial information about the channel importance. To
overcome this limitation, we present a novel approach which utilizes
multi-spectral information of high content images to interpret a certain aspect
of cellular biology. To this end, we base our method on image blending concepts
with alpha compositing for an arbitrary number of channels. More specifically,
we introduce DCMIX, a lightweight, scaleable and end-to-end trainable mixing
layer which enables interpretable predictions in high content imaging while
retaining the benefits of deep learning based methods. We employ an extensive

interaction/dependencies of a Linear Dynamical System (LDS) over a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG) is studied. The sample complexity of learning a DAG's
structure is well-studied for static systems, where the samples of nodal states
are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). However, such a study is
less explored for DAGs with dynamical systems, where the nodal states are
temporally correlated. We call such a DAG underlying an LDS as \emph{dynamical}
DAG (DDAG). In particular, we consider a DDAG where the nodal dynamics are
driven by unobserved exogenous noise sources that are wide-sense stationary
(WSS) in time but are mutually uncorrelated, and have the same {power spectral
density (PSD)}. Inspired by the static settings, a metric and an algorithm
based on the PSD matrix of the observed time series are proposed to reconstruct
the DDAG. The equal noise PSD assumption can be relaxed such that
identifiability conditions for DDAG reconstruction are not violated. For the
LDS with WSS (sub) Gaussian exogenous noise sources, it is shown that the
optimal sample complexity (or length of state trajectory) needed to learn the
DDAG is $n=\Theta(q\log(p/q))$, where $p$ is the number of nodes and $q$ is the
maximum number of parents per node. To prove the sample complexity upper bound,
a concentration bound for the PSD estimation is derived, under two different
sampling strategies. A matching min-max lower bound using generalized Fano's
inequality also is provided, thus showing the order optimality of the proposed
algorithm.]]></summary>

 I've been wondering why do we often have a convolution inside every upsample and downsample block. Well, it makes sense, if you intend to upscale some features and use a bilinear interpolation, then some error can be introduced due to interpolation inaccuracies. This is where convolution layer comes handy to help and support the upscaling. But is this really the reason behind it? Or is there a deeper explanation?

 Also, just for the sake of curiosity. What if the scale_factor of an upsample block was 1. Should we still keep the convolution layer? or just get rid of all the upsample block since there is no actual "upsampling" being done at least in the context of the tensor dimensions.
 ​
 Thank you :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi fellow computer scientists,
 ​
 1) I have been wondering if there is a preferred way to upsample features. I though about 3 options:
 ​
 1.a) Upsample Layer + Conv Layer
 ​
 1.b) Transposed Conv Layer + Conv Layer
 ​
 1.c) PixelShuffle Layer + Conv Layer
 ​
 2) Also, considering option 1.c, should the Conv layer multiply the number of PixelShuffle output features by the scale factor because PixelShuffle does reduce the number of output features? i.e. I have a tensor of dims (B, C, W, H, D) and with shape (1, 60, 64, 64, 64). After the Pixel-shuffle with an upscale factor of 4 I get the tensor of shape (1, 15, 256, 256, 256). Afterwards the following Conv layer should output a tensor like:
 2.a) (1, 15, 256, 256, 256), where in_channels=15 and out_channels=15
 2.b) (1, 60, 256, 256, 256), where in_channels=15 and out_channels=60
 Note the second option reinstates the number of input features.
 ​
 3) I have an additional question that can happens in both 1.a, 1.b and 1.c options. Imagine I need to upsample my features by a factor of 8.
 3.a) Is it preferred to have multiple upsample blocks (Upsample Layer + Conv layer), where the upsample layers have a scale factor of 2, thus for this example we would have 3 upsample blocks (2 ** 3 = 8).
 3.b) Have only one upsample block where the Upsample layer has the full scale factor desired and it is then followed by one Conv layer.
 ​
 Thank you all :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 In the process of writing up a literature review for my master's thesis, I wanted to cover the impact of ReLU on the field which was significant. When looking for an original paper I came across this paper/report: https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08375. There isn't anything special about this work and as a matter of fact, I was surprised that it has thousands of citations (2974 at the moment of writing this post according to Google Scholar). Given this and that this work is not an original ReLU paper but more of a file documenting an implementation of it for a particular setup I found it quite intriguing. Then I started to dig into works that cited this and unexpectedly papers from top conferences such as NeurIPS cited the aforementioned document as a reference to the activation function. Here are some examples:
  
https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/fbb10d319d44f8c3b4720873e4177c65-Paper-Conference.pdf
 https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/69e2f49ab0837b71b0e0cb7c555990f8-Paper-Conference.pdf
  
The researchers who have done that are not referencing the original ReLU paper instead which I think is a bit disrespectful towards the achievement of original authors. On the other hand, maybe I am overthinking it a bit. ReLU has been around for a while and it would be surprising for someone conducting research in deep learning to not knowing it hence as a reader I wouldn't necessarily mind if people did not include the reference to the paper which is widely known. However, I reckon if a reference is made, then it should be meaningful and correct, and not just another extra few lines in a bibliography making it look big.

 My advisor is very understanding, supportive and took a leap of faith to fund me, since I did not have prior experience in research.
 I have been working on a problem for 4 months now and have been getting poor results for the past week. All the literature surveys, digressions within the problem statements and running the experiments to end up with not-so-good results is extremely disheartening.
 ​
 I am still continuing to run additional experiments, figuring out where things can be going wrong and trying to conduct further analysis, but I feel like I have let down my advisor. I still have the entire semester to work on it and possibly other stuff, I am motivated for it, but at times ponder over the huge chunk of time I have spent on the current work.
 ​
 How do you deal with such results and hitting the wall in your research ?
 Does it happen often ? 
 What would you advice I do to continue working ?

 If you want to stay on top of the latest trends and insights in AI, look here first.
 Why is this significant?
  
The AI system, developed by researchers at startup Osmo, can utilize 55 descriptive words to assign a smell or 'aroma' to a chemical compound or 'odorant'.
 This breakthrough might be utilized to enhance the food and cleaning product industries where synthetic scents play an essential role.
  
What’s next for this AI system?
  
The AI's predictions often aligned closer with human consensus than any individual guess, indicating its robustness and potential.
 The next step for this research is to comprehend how different odorants mix and compete to yield a smell that the human brain identifies as unique.
 However, the sheer number of combinations, even with a small set of odorants, poses a daunting task. To quote Stuart Firestein, a neurobiologist at Columbia University, “Predicting what a mix smells like is the next frontier.”

 PrivateGPT - seems to work very well, currently it's only running on CPUs thus response time is over a minute.

 H2OGPT - it's implementation of 'localdocs' (I believe via LangChain) seems pretty good. but seems like every time I run an instance, I would have to re-vector my documents. Not sure if there is a way to attach an VectorDB to it so it's ready to go right away.
 PrivateGPT - seems to work very well, currently it's only running on CPUs thus response time is over a minute.
 Curious if the community knows of any other products that do this and are already GPU accelerated.
 ​
 TY in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was going through the code for Llama-2 text generation on the official github where I stumbled across this code in the generation.py file:
 B_INST, E_INST = "[INST]", "[/INST]" SPECIAL_TAGS = [B_INST, E_INST, "<<SYS>>", "<</SYS>>"] UNSAFE_ERROR = "Error: special tags are not allowed as part of the prompt." ... ... ... unsafe_requests = [] unsafe_requests.append(any([tag in msg["content"] for tag in SPECIAL_TAGS for msg in dialog])) ... ... ... return [ { "generation": { "role": "assistant", "content": self.tokenizer.decode(t) if not unsafe else UNSAFE_ERROR, } } for t, unsafe in zip(generation_tokens, unsafe_requests) ] 
 Is there a reason why we can't have these tokens in the prompt? 
 I am planning to bypass the role based dictionary entries for the prompt and instead building my own prompt generator that'll take the the system prompts and the user prompts and generate a single string to then send to the LLM. Depending on the the user's choice I want the LLM to generate concise or detailed answers(also impose a word limit in the prompt itself), so I am planning to have this as a dropdown a user can choose. based on the system option chosen(concise/detailed answer), I then want to call my prompt generator which will add the instruction tags around the "system" and "user" prompts to generate 1 string I can then pass to the LLM.
 I wanted to know if there was any reason these tags aren't allowed to be in the prompt. Is it only to avoid "confusion" on the different roles and following a conventional way to pass the prompts? If not, and there's a reason those tags aren't supposed to be passed inside the prompts, please do let me know,, because inside the same file the chat_completion() function is doing exactly that; adding the <<SYS>> and <</SYS>> around the system prompts and prepending it to the user prompt.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! I've been working on this project for a few months as part of my thesis in Machine Learning. It's a library that provides an easy-to-use yet flexible API to design and train Diffusion Models. I decided to make it because I wanted to quickly prototype a Diffusion Model but there were no good tools to do it with. I think it really can help people prototype their own Diffusion Models a lot faster and only in a few lines of code.
 The idea is to have a model class that takes different modules corresponding to the different aspects of the Diffusion Model process (noise schedule, noise type, denoising network, loss function, guidance, etc.) and allow the user to mix and match different modules to achieve different results. The library ships with a bunch of prebuilt modules and the plan is to add many more. I also made it super easy to implement your own modules, you just need to extend from one of the base classes available.
 Below is an example of the type of interface you can expect. I'd really appreciate your feedback! Check out the project here: https://github.com/cabralpinto/modular-diffusion

Perplexities are reported relative to the actual number of English-language words in the
 test set (including an EOS token predicted by the model) 
  
How did they compute this number? Did they split sentences by space? Are punctuation symbols considered "English words"? Are chinese characters (which are present in the data) withous spaces counted as one word?
 Or is it some common knowledge that "LM1B test set contains X words"?
 The official implementation https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/d3pm/text is extremely difficult to comprehend. I spent several hours reading throug the code and I still have no idea how they computed the number of words.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey r/MachineLearning,
 data inspection and interactive exploration is one of the most important tasks for data teams. This is especially true when dealing with unstructured data that requires a deep domain expertise (e.g. healthcare or engineering).
 We have tried many different options for visualizing unstructured datasets in the past: Notebooks, dash apps, custom react apps, HTML reports... However, these options were either very time-consuming to develop/maintain or not interactive enough or both. 
 That is why we developed Spotlight: https://github.com/Renumics/spotlight 
 https://i.redd.it/lxjnlkcmumlb1.gif
 Spotlight supports most unstructured data types including images, audio, text, videos, time-series and geometric data. 
 You can find more info and use case examples for ML and engineering workflows in the repo. 
 Happy to hear your honest feedback!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, so I am a little confused on how many target variable classes does the BERT and RoBERTa models have?
 So I understand these 2 models are pre-trained models, which means the number of target variable classes are fixed (if I am not wrong!). For example, the link below for the RoBERTa model in Hugging Face has fixed 3 target variable classes (Negative, Neutral and Positive):
 https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest
 But when I googled around and also asked ChatGPT and Bard, they tell me these models can have as many target variable classes as the user wants (or rather this depends on how many target variable classes there are in the training dataset). 
 If these are pre-trained models already (which already have the number of target variable classes pre-determined in the model already), then how come some of the google sites and ChatGPT and Bard is telling me the user can choose however many target variable classes that they want?

 Data details : I have consecutive frames of the street in which vehicles are moving.
 So far :
  
I have created a model that detects the objects inside the frame and give me the coordinates(bounding-box) of those objects(vehicles).
 
And I using the optical flow to produce the optical lines on the objects which are moving inside the consecutive frames and I am also able to get the direction(if a object is moving from top to bottom on the frame it means it is in right direction and if bottom to top in the frame it means wrong direction based on change in y-offset of the object).
 
Now the optical lines code is different which is giving me the direction of the object(I am not using any model to detect object in this code it's based on Lucas-Kadane method) and when I say direction I mean I'm using the cv2.imshow() which actually plays the consecutive frames together and draw optical lines on it and shows me the direction visually.
 
 Now the problem is I want the coordinates of the object that is moving in wrong direction (the bounding box coordinates) how can I achieve that?
 Any suggestions and ideas would be helpful please mind I can't use any other technology or model as this are project requirements in professional setting)

 How do I decide when to stop tuning for number of trees, mtry, min_n, and tree depth, without actually overfitting the data?

 Also, is it considered a "cheating" if i pre-extract certain features that are already established by experts to have high correlation with the result, rather than letting the machine learning algorithm learn on its own those "certain features" in some way through training?
 Thanks!

What I mean is topics like handling hundreds of models and their updates, reusable CI/CD pipelines, batch and online architectures, integration with feature stores, jobs/queues for model scheduling, data drift, metrics monitoring, and alerts, and so on.
 This would be for someone familiar with the major concepts, hands-on experience with MLflow, SageMaker, Azure ML services, Databricks and similar tools.

I have already completed Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and built the reward model. Now, I need some guidance on how to handle the data.
 Here is an example of the pre-collected data:

 ==========My input Data 1 is :>> User: Give me a tip on how to succeed in drawing.
 Suppose my model outputs the following for Input Data 1: ChatGPT: Practice makes perfect.
 My question is, for Input Data 2, should I use:

 In this option, I use the actual previous term's agent output and append the pre-collected user data.
 Or
 Option B: User: Give me a tip on how to succeed in drawing. ChatGPT: Practice regularly and be patient with yourself. Improvement takes time. User: But drawing is hard.
 In this option, I use all the pre-collected data, which might not even be the current model's output.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am reading the famous paper " Unsupervised Domain Adaptation by Backpropagation" again, but still got confused why the authors had to design this gradient reversal layer.
 To my understanding, simply adding a minus-one (-1) in front of the domain classifier head is good enough. Of course, we need to minimize the original domain classifier head at some point to make it decent. For example, if it is a two-step training like GAN, we can (1) Freeze other parts but only minimize the domain classification loss to update the domain classifier head; and then (2) Freeze the domain classification head, but maximize the domain classificatoin loss to update the feature extractor. We can alternate between (1) and (2).
 Is the main motivation of gradient reversal layer that we can merge (1) and (2) into a single training step?

I've been reading it, but I got stuck trying to understand how they transition from the point where the loss is the distance between parameters to the point where the loss is the distance between gradients. Could someone please explain this process in detail? Apparently, they make the assumption that the initializations are the same and that the distance between parameters is close to zero for every iteration, but I'm still struggling to comprehend how they arrive at the conclusion that the distance is now between gradients.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US government has imposed expanded export restrictions affecting Nvidia’s leading artificial intelligence chips, curbing their exportation beyond China to certain Middle Eastern countries.
 If you want to stay on top of AI advances, look here first.
 https://preview.redd.it/xe7ho00t0ilb1.png?width=1240&format=png&auto=webp&s=61225931bf3e316efd90eab83846402d4148aca2
 Why this matters:
  
Nvidia’s A100 and H100 chips are affected: These AI chips are important and used to accelerate machine-learning tasks on major AI applications like ChatGPT. Despite the restrictions, Nvidia maintains they won’t have an “immediate material impact” on its results.
 Other companies, like AMD, are also affected: They’ve reportedly received similar restrictions notice, hinting at a broader move by the US government to control the distribution of AI chip technology.
 The move is part of a larger geopolitical play: These restrictions form part of the Biden administration’s efforts to curtail Beijing’s ability to capitalize on the AI revolution.
  
How Nvidia and the industry might respond:
  
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has cautioned the US: In a Financial Times interview, Huang warned that imposing such restrictions could lead to “enormous damage” to the US tech industry, predicting China may become self-sufficient in AI chip development.
 Yet, Nvidia still managed impressive earnings recently: Despite these challenges, Nvidia recently reported quarterly revenue of $13.5bn, exceeding predictions by $2bn.
  
Further restrictions could significantly alter the landscape for AI development, potentially fostering greater innovation in countries affected or even a race to develop independent solutions.

I tried to take notes as I read paper, but that’s not quite sustainable because it’s difficult to track where did the notes come from for more details. Or I highlight the sections with added comments but that’s also not quite accessible when you have tones of pdf lying around somewhere or worse print outs. 
 Recently I’ve been trying a cloud based pdf reader that stores my papers and allow searches over all highlights and comments (Pond) Thinking if I could also use it to share papers with my colleagues but I’m not sure if it will work because that will require them to use it as well. 
 How do you solve this ?

 From the text:
  
We believe artificial intelligence has the power to save the world—and that a thriving open source ecosystem is essential to building this future. 
 Thankfully, the open source ecosystem is starting to develop, and we are now seeing open source models that rival closed-source alternatives. Hundreds of small teams and individuals are also working to make these models more useful, accessible, and performant. 
 These projects push the state of the art in open source AI and help provide a more robust and comprehensive understanding of the technology. They include: instruction-tuning base LLMs; removing censorship from LLM outputs; optimizing models for low-powered machines; building novel tooling for model inference; researching LLM security issues; and many others. 
 However, the people behind these projects often don’t have the resources available to pursue their work to conclusion or maintain it in the long run. The situation is more acute in AI than traditional infrastructure, since even fine-tuning models requires significant GPU computing resources, especially as open source models get larger.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a bid to rival the United States’ stronghold in the AI industry, Chinese search engine and AI firm Baidu, has made its ChatGPT-equivalent language model, Ernie Bot, fully available to the public. This marks a significant move on the AI chessboard.
 If you want to stay on top of everything AI, look here first.
 https://preview.redd.it/g68sr07iihlb1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0c873badd448257bcc2fb125188acc198e504d6
 Why does this matter?
  
Baidu's public release of Ernie Bot signals the company's aggressive push in the generative AI market. By opening up its model to the public, Baidu can leverage expansive real-world human feedback to improve Ernie Bot.
 China's determination to lead the AI industry is unabated, with many tech firms launching their own generative models in response to OpenAI's popular ChatGPT. Baidu's move further fuels this rivalry.
 Regulation in China seems to support such AI advancements. CEO Robin Li voiced his optimism about the AI regulations—calling them "more pro-innovation than regulation".
  
What's the broader response?
  
Baidu's latest stride has boosted its stock price by over 3%, underlining the market's high anticipation of Baidu's AI efforts.
 Ernie Bot has rocketed to the top of Apple's iOS free app chart in China. This demonstrates a positive initial response from the public.
  
Regulation is key in China's AI game:
  
China has stringent regulations for the generative AI industry, requiring a security review and government approvals before any product launch. Moreover, companies need to comply with governmental tech and data requests.
 The US, on the other hand, doesn't currently have such regulations in place. A markedly different approach that could significantly influence the development and application of AI technologies.

 Abstract:
  
In recent years, there have been remarkable advancements in the performance of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains. As these LLMs are deployed for increasingly complex tasks, they often face the needs to conduct longer reasoning processes or understanding larger contexts. In these situations, the length generalization failure of LLMs on long sequences become more prominent. Most pre-training schemes truncate training sequences to a fixed length (such as 2048 for LLaMa). LLMs often struggle to generate fluent texts, let alone carry out downstream tasks, after longer contexts, even with relative positional encoding which is designed to cope with this problem. Common solutions such as finetuning on longer …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CoTracker - a 2D point-tracking tool for videos - promises to revolutionize motion tracking. Through the use of a transformer network, it meticulously predicts point trajectories and visibility across video frames, giving insights like never before.
 https://i.redd.it/g0u5t9n1ehlb1.gif
 Here's why CoTracker is turning heads:
  
CoTracker leverages advanced transformer formulation: Utilising a grid of input tokens that evolve to output tokens, CoTracker allocates initial values derived from the track's start point and time.
 It's built to handle extended videos through 'windowed inference': Windowing enables the algorithm to handle videos beyond its maximum window length by splitting them into overlapping segments.
 'Unrolled Learning' caters to semi-overlapping windows effectively: By employing two unique types of losses, only a modest amount of windows are used in loss computation while still handling expansive videos at test time.
 Improved tracking through simultaneous multi-point selection: By tracking multiple points at once, CoTracker is able to better establish correlation and motion paths within videos.
  
Despite its notable strengths, there are limitations. Its sliding-window approach cannot handle long-term occlusions that last longer than a window, and its transformer-based model has a high computational cost that grows quadratically with the number of tracked points.
 According to the authors, “The result is a flexible and powerful tracking algorithm that outperforms state-of-the-art methods in almost all benchmarks”. But it’s yet to be seen how it will perform in real-life tasks. What do you think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 Wanted to share an open source project we've been working on for the last few weeks: Autolabel is an open source Python library to label and enrich text datasets with LLMs (Large Language Models).
 Why?
 Access to clean, labeled data is a huge bottleneck for most ML/data science teams. From experiments across a variety of NLP tasks and datasets, we have found that the most capable LLMs are able to label data at better quality than human annotators, but 20-100x faster.
 Getting Started¶
 You can get started with the library by defining a JSON config, and writing a few lines of code:
 from autolabel import LabelingAgent, AutolabelDataset agent = LabelingAgent('config.json') dataset = AutolabelDataset('dataset.csv', 'config.json') labels = agent.run(dataset) 
  
Installation guide
 Sample notebooks that show how to use the library for different labeling tasks.
 Technical report for benchmarking LLM and human annotator performance across a range of tasks and datasets.
  
Call for Feedback
 We just open sourced this library, and are actively developing it. Feedback is very welcome and so are requests for features. You can open an issue on Github for bugs and request features

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I built DeepEval - an open-source unit testing framework for LLMs in order to accelerate development and iteration. 
 The problem
 When designing software applications, testing has always been critical for a lot of production applications. However - with the rise of LLM applications, the type of testing required needs to change in order to adapt for the large number of possible queries. We therefore built DeepEval in order to make it easy to write LLM tests in just 1 line of code. We hope this solution is of value to future teams when iterating on their RAG pipelines, migrating LLM models, testing their fine-tuned LLMs.
 The solution
 The DeepEval framework is as follows: We split up testing LLMs into 4 main sections:
 - Answer Relevancy (how relevant an answer is to a question) - measured using a question-answer bi-encoder.
 - Factual consistency (whether the generated answer is hallucinating) - measured using entailment from an NLI model
 - Conceptual similarity (when given a ground truth, how closely does it relate to it - for example How big is it? The size of an orange vs 20 square centimetres.) - measured using vector similarity
 - Bias, Toxic classification (measured through DL classifier models)
 I would love any feedback on what we are building here and welcome any OS contributions!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meta AI has made their DINOv2 self-supervised learning method for training computer vision models truly open source by publishing it under Apache 2.0 license.
 DINOv2 has outperformed previous state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods on a variety of computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. It is also more efficient to train than previous methods, making it more accessible to researchers and practitioners.
 DINOv2 is different from existing methods because it provides a new way to train high-performance computer vision models without the need for labeled data. This makes it possible to train models on large datasets of unlabeled images, which can be more cost-effective and time-efficient than collecting and labeling large datasets of images.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As everyone knows, we usually optimise for maximum likelihood when fitting distributions like gaussians (equivalent to the forward KL-divergence). But for neural networks, techniques like GANs allow the minimisation of other distances like Mutual Information or Reverse KL. While this is certainly a very cool and insightful approach, it's also highly complex. I wonder wether other approaches to this problem exist for the simpler case, like fitting a gaussian or some other analytic distribution.
 From statistics, I have only encountered maximum likelihood and it's variations like robust statistics.

Here, by separation measurement we mean any distance or divergence between probability mass functions that is positive, and that is null if and only if the probability mass functions coincide. Then, we show that the new class of sensitivity indices complies with Renyi’s postulate D of measures of statistical dependence (Renyi, 1959).

 Hey everyone,
 ChatFAI has a special connection with this community because this is where I got it started. It was a simple web app that allowed you to interact with your favorite characters from movies, TV shows, books, history, and beyond. Now, it is a lot more. 
 It has public APIs and an official Discord bot integration now. A lot of performance improvements have been made in the recent days. 
 People have created a lot of characters (https://chatfai.com/characters) 
 The Discord bot is still a new area so could you share feedback if you guys check it out? You can also find it in the Discord app directory.

 I am struggling to understand the mini-batch in PPO. 
 Say I already collected two trajectories.
 Traj_A = [t = 1, t= 2, t=3 ,.... t = 100]
 Traj_B = [t =1 , t=2, ... t= 78] 
 Now, I heard you usually break this down onto mini-batch (say a batchsize of 6). 
 Do you do random sampling?
 eg, one batch is [Traj_A_t=1, Traj_A_t=2, Traj_A_t=100, Traj_A_t=66, Traj_A_t=77, Traj_A_t=55]???
 OR do you need to maintain some sequence [Traj_A_t=1, Traj_A_t=2, Traj_A_t=3, Traj_A_t=4, Traj_A_t=5, Traj_A_t=6]???

 Important Details:
  
The agency is asking for comments on three main questions: How should AI be defined and categorized for the purposes of copyright? What are the implications of AI for the rights of authors and owners of works? What are the implications of AI for the liability and responsibility of users and distributors of works?
 The agency also wants to hear about related issues, such as: how AI may affect publicity rights and unfair competition laws. The agency notes that AI may create works that mimic or impersonate the voices, likenesses, or styles of real people, which could raise ethical and legal concerns.
 Finally, they want to determine how AI may affect moral rights and cultural heritage: The agency acknowledges that AI may create works that are derivative or transformative of existing works, which could affect the reputation and integrity of the original creators and their communities.
  
The deadline to submit your comments is October 18th and specific instructions for submitting comments are available on the Copyright Office website.
 P.S. If you like this kind of analysis, I write a free newsletter that tracks the most relevant news and research in AI and tech—stay updated in under 3 mins/day.

 We are looking for AI that can read tables, charts, figures, and spreadsheets, and possibly run statistics on this information.
 We are also looking for AI that can be given a prompt and will write on chosen topic with proper citation of sources. This information will not be used for publication, but rather, to organize main ideas and provide examples.
 An art AI that can draw or mimic images of real insects would be nice as well.
 Preferably these will all be free to use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR: American, Graduated from U of Michigan in 2019 w/ 3.3 GPA Bs in Comp Sci. Worked at Google for 3 years. Samsung Research America for 3 months. No ML specific work experience. No research. Will I get in to European elite ML programs? If not what do I need to do?
 My GF and I want to study our masters together in Europe. She’s doing business I want to do ML/AI.
 I spent the past year kind of goofing off. Got kind of burned out and decided I was going to get into music production so spent the pst year mainly doing that with some software mixed in. 
 Recently been self studying ML, both the math from textbooks and trying my hand at some models in python.
 I do not have any connections to academia currently and wil have to beg a professor who barely knew me from undergrad for a rec. Can get other recs from past bosses.
 My plan right now is to look for job hopefully in AI but maybe just more general software engineering again, but long term I want to get a masters in person.
 My current resume looks like:
 Graduated BS in Comp Sci from univ of Michigan 2019 3.3 GPA
 Worked at Google for 3 years Worked at Samsung Research America for 4 months Some self study I can claim but not much tangible proof
 Recommendation from Google Boss (Maybe) recommendation from UofM CS professor that barely knew me
 My questions to anyone that knows the admissions right now are:
 1) Do you think I get to one off this? (To anyone of these schools)
 2) If not what are the things to prioritize to improve my chances? What are the timeline of these steps? Can I do them in the next few months or have to wait till next year?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm relatively new to the space of AI chatbots and I figured I'd get my hands wet with a small personal project. While researching the topic of long term conversational memory I noticed most people are using text embedding in combination with textual summary to generate a conversation history for the AI's prompt. However, this technique seems to have many drawbacks such as loss of details in the summarization process. I was wondering if anyone has experience using knowledge graph DBs like neo4j for conversational memory instead, and what the pros and cons of such an approach are compared to summarization. I'd be greatly interested in any resources that could further my knowledge in this space as my primary goal is to learn from this project. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent research proposes that Large Language Models (LLMs) may not be as reliable as we think. In fact, the order of options in a multiple-choice question drastically influences the responses from LLMs such as GPT-4 and InstructGPT.
 If you want to stay on top of the latest trends and insights in AI and tech, look here first.

 What are the findings?
  
LLM sensitivity to multiple-choice arrangement: The study suggests if options in multiple-choice questions are reordered, the LLM's performance varies dramatically— approximately 13% to 75% depending on the benchmark.
 Positional bias shapes responses: When the LLM is uncertain between top-selected answers, the option positioning can artificially lean its predictions. Observations also found that LLMs favor specific placements when unsure of the optimal response among top-selected answers.
 Performance improves when calibration techniques are applied: Making use of two unique calibration methods, the performance of LLMS saw up to eight percentage points of increase across numerous models and benchmarks.
  
Why does this matter?
 This moves us closer to identifying the factors contributing to LLMs' sensitivity and highlights the significance of recognizing and confronting these sensitivities to improve real-world usability and reliability.

I have some data, around 1000's transcribed sentences with their corresponding images of text. TrOCR looked great, but it still makes a lot of mistakes, probably because of the old English phraseology, so I tried to finetune it with my data and see if it improves and that didn't happen. 
 The data I used to train was my 1000 sentences + some public dataset with another 2500 sentences, so just about 3500 sentences in total. Do you think it's because the data is small, that the performance is bad?
 I'm finetuning "microsoft/trocr-base-stage1" using native PyTorch. 
 If not TrOCR do you recommend any OCR/HTR models I can finetune to my handwritten historical data? I truly appreciate any guidance you send my way.

Automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology has made conversations more accessible with live captions in remote conferencing software, mobile applications, and head-worn displays. However, to maintain real-time responsiveness, live caption systems often display interim predictions that are updated as new utterances are received. This can cause text instability (a “flicker” where previously displayed text is updated, shown in the captions on the left in the video below), which can impair users' reading experience due to distraction, fatigue, and difficulty following the conversation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 Hopefully this is of interest to some of you. For those that don't know, normalising flows can be used as black-box unconditional or conditional distribution approximators, that support both exact sampling and density evaluations. For an excellent review see https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02762.
 I am developing flowjax, a Python package for normalising flows, distributions and bijections. It uses Jax for automatic differentiation, and the equinox framework built by Patrick Kidger to allow for a familiar object-oriented design.
 It includes many powerful flows, e.g. masked autoregressive flows, coupling flows and block neural autoregressive flows. In addition to inheriting some benefits from using JAX (easy GPU support, some efficiency gains), here's a few points where I think flowjax has some advantages over other packages:
  
Comprehensive documentation
 Simplified definitions of unconditional/conditional bijections and distributions (particularly nicer handling of the conditional case, which some packages seem to stitch in as an afterthought).
 Easy to plug in different "transformer" bijections to coupling/masked autoregressive flows.
 Use of efficiency tricks to optimize run times (e.g. circumventing recompilation of identical layers using jax.lax.scan over the flow layers)
  
It has been used in a couple of papers already, but it would be great to have some more people using it and some feedback/suggestions/contributions. There are examples in the documentation for those that are interested.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Of the many unsupervised anomaly detection models out there (iforest, LOF, SVM etc) I am struggling to find a model that makes sense to use to detect anomalies in a single target feature. My current strategy is to subset the data into different categories and run iforest on a single column. 
 I feel as though this method might not be the best because it basically creates a tree with a single branch and measures how many nodes away a given record might be. My confidence scores never seem to exceed around -.17 on a scale of [-1,1] where -1 tends to more confidence in anomalous behavior
 Is there a better way?
 Note: Anomalies in my data occur very infrequently

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Question for people who are implementing LLMs (open source, fine tuned, any kind). 
  
How do you know that your getting the quality output from the model that you need to ship the feature or model? Are the audits ad hoc data sampling and subjective "good/bad" ratings or have you figured out a more rigorous framework? Is it pretty much ~vibes~ based?
 What, if any, tools or processes are you putting into place to monitor and observe the LLM when its interacting with real time user data for weeks or months?
 
 Most of the folks I have spoken with are doing very ad hoc sampled output and writing down on post its or in a spreadsheet a subjective quality ratings. 
 One person had developed a slightly more rigorous 3 question survey on "is the result factual", "is the result cogent" and "is the result useful". Not everyone is logging their LLM responses they show users which feels very risky to me.
 Anyone aware of any industry standards being established around this?

I plan on requesting an increase of that limit... but wondering, does Azure's OpenAI service have any monthly limit? By looking at their quotas: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/quotas-limits it doesn't seem like there's a monthly cap.
 Is this correct? If so, I see no reason why anyone would use OpenAI's api instead of Azure's, as they cost the same but there's no usage limit. Especially if you expect to increase api usage in the future.

 I'm working on a problem which has a custom gym environment which I've made, and as it interacts with multiple other modules which have their own quirks, I need to use a reinforcement learning library which works in a specific way that I've only seen PFRL use. 
 The training loop needs to be in this format: 'obs, reward, done = agent.step(action)', 'agent.observe(obs, reward, ... )' rather than what I see in most modern RL libraries where you define an agent and then run a '.train()' method. 
 Are there any libraries which work in this way? I'd love to use something like StableBaselines but they don't seem to play nice and I'd rather not rewrite the gym environment if I can avoid it. 
 Thanks

 the company I am working at has several servers used for different tasks including data analysis and machine learning, including smaller tasks as well as deep learning. 
 What are some ways/ technologies they could create a distributed system where users can submit their jobs and they are dispatched automatically? 
 I was thinking of having an entry node that is the only one faced by users, is where all conda environments are and jobs can be submitted from there. 
 Please let me know if you have any suggestions/ tools that you know that would make sense. Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've received a freelance job offer from a company in the banking sector that wants to host their own LLAMA 2 model in-house.
 I'm hesitating to accept the gig. While I'll have access to the hardware (I've estimated that an A100 80GB will be required to host the 16B parameter version and process some fine-tuning & RAG), I'm not familiar with the challenges of self-hosting a model of this scale. I've always relied on managed services like Hugging Face or Replicate for model hosting.
 For those of you who have experience in self-hosting such large models, what do you think will be the main challenges of this mission if I decide to take it on?
 ​
 Edit: Some additional context information
 Size of the company: Very small ~ 60 employees
 Purpose: This service will be combined with a vector store to search content such as Word, Excel and PowerPoint files stored on their servers. I'll implement the RAG pattern and do some prompt engineering with it. They also want me to use it for searching things on specific websites and APIs, such as stock exchanges, so I (probably) need to fine-tune the model based on the search results and the tasks I want the model to do after retrieving the data.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) form the cornerstone of reinforcement learning (RL) and serve as a fundamental modeling tool for making sequential decisions. In this note, we present a comprehensive definition of MDPs and provide a detailed derivation of the Bellman equations, along with the optimality results. Our approach aims to ensure a thorough understanding by avoiding the omission of any steps in the mathematical proofs. The primary goal is to facilitate reading classic textbooks on (approximate) dynamic programming, optimal control, and reinforcement learning, where proofs and derivations can sometimes obscure crucial details, making them less accessible to readers from diverse scientific and engineering backgrounds.

 So far I found those and read readme files: https://github.com/dickreuter/neuron_poker https://github.com/fschlatt/clubs_gym https://rlcard.org/ https://www.deepmind.com/open-source/openspiel
 Did anybody work on similar project? Which gym did you use, and what experience do you have with it? 
 Since, adversarial policies tend to work better for high-dimensionality I would prefer to 6players variant. I know that modern poker ai approach are not based on pure RL, but I want to check how vulnerable are classic RL poker models.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft teamed up with Virginia Tech to publish a white paper introducing their new "Algorithm of Thoughts" (AoT). The objective? To make language learning models akin to human learning.
 https://preview.redd.it/3q8lcq0k96lb1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=fce7a0e3225c64353ad6c51f65e8b490e795feed
 If you want to stay on top of the latest trends and insights in AI and tech, look here first.
 What's the big idea?
  
Microsoft's AoT aims to fuse the accuracy of algorithms with the nuances of human reasoning. A bold aspiration indeed, but not a new one. The goal to empower computers to learn for themselves – akin to human cognition - has been an AI objective since its inception back in the 1950s.
 The AoT could be seen as an attempt to resolve the drawbacks of the "Chain of Thought" (CoT) approach. LLMs following the CoT approach can provide incorrect steps to the right answer, as they base conclusions on precedent.
 With AoT, the model works to evaluate the soundness of initial steps or "thoughts," reducing the risk of one incorrect step leading to disproportionate results.
  
What could AoT do?
  
Mitigate AI "hallucinations:" These funny— but disconcerting — instances of AI outputting false information.
 Enhance the integrity of AI interaction: programmers suggest that improvement in this aspect is crucial for aligning AGI (artificial general intelligence).
  
The takeaway:
  
AI's ability to understand and process information like a human being is a longstanding goal in the field. With AoT, Microsoft seems to be making strides toward achieving it.
 Much remains to be seen on its efficacy: How it will impact the broader AI ecosystem and the user experiences it can create.
  
P.S. If you like this kind of analysis, I write a free newsletter tracking the most relevant news and research in AI and tech—stay informed in under 3 minutes/day.

 I'm writing this post to share some of the strategies we use for using LLMs in production, we've served over 2M+ queries so far
 TLDR: Use Caching + Model Fallbacks for reliability. This post goes into detail of our fallbacks implementation
 Using LLMs reliably in production involves the following components:
  
Caching - Cache Embedding() and Completion() for all models
 Model Fallbacks - set fallback_models=['gpt-3.5-turbo', 'command-nightly', 'llama2]. If primary model fails try fallback models. This deals with rate-limiting errors and when Provider APIs go down

 Right now, what are the cutting edge image processing models? This is in the context of the segmentation of specific features from an image (ie. finding the cars in an image of a busy roadway). 
 The reason I am asking is I want to learn more image processing architectures that way I can find better direction for specific research areas to look into. 
 Thanks in advance! :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stanford researchers have unveiled a groundbreaking artificial intelligence (AI) framework known as DSPy. Designed to utilize Language Models (LMs) and Retrieval Models (RMs) optimally, DSPy is set to make AI programming more powerful, intuitive, and efficient.
 Why does this matter?
  
DSPy was built with complex tasks in mind. LMs, like GPT-3, generate Human-like text from given inputs, while RMs retrieve relevant data. DSPy combines their capabilities, enabling tasks like summarizing information from databases.
 It works on Pythonic syntax, using declarative and composable modules to instruct LMs.
 DSPy's automatic compiler finetunes the LM to run any program's steps. it replaces manual intermediate-stage labeling and string manipulation with systematic modular pieces.
  
What's unique about DSPy?
  
It introduces "Signatures" and "Teleprompters" that compile your program. A 'signature' explains the task and inputs for the LM, while Teleprompters improve the effectiveness of prompts.
 Compared to other libraries, DSPy requires minimal labeling and bootstraps any needed intermediate labels.
  
In short, DSPy simplifies delivering more nuanced instructions to AI and retrieving more detailed and accurate responses, thus widening the spectrum of tasks AIs can accomplish.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I'm trying to understand how to get an LLM to imitate someone, say Shakespeare. It's easy enough to get all of Shakespeare's work.
 If I've understood the current state of play for LLMs, there are three options:
  
Fine tune an LLM
 Vectorize your knowledge using something like ChromaDB. Do a similarity search after each prompt and get the LLM to "read" the top n docs
 Do both
  
I have a feeling that to imitate Shakespeare, fine tuning an LLM might work best.
 However, if my understanding is correct, the inputs to finetune an LLM must be formatted this way:
 <human>: "To be" <system>: "Or not to be" 
 The gap I'm having trouble bridging is how do I go from a large text file to this input format? The only idea I've come across is format all of the text like so:
 <human>: "sentence_1" <system>: "sentence_2" <human>: "sentence_2" <system>: "sentence_3" 
 Are there best practices around this problem? How should I be thinking about this?
 I've seen companies like character.ai create bots that imitate Elon Musk accurately for example so I know it's doable. I just wonder if they've done it by finetuning an LLM or training one from scratch or something else entirely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Surely something like this has been tried, but here’s the setup in my head. Tell me if it’s crazy or what you think. 
 Given input vector X do a hidden layer but instead of an activation function pair up neighboring dimensions of the hidden layer vector result and rotate them about the origin in 2d. This would give some kind of nonlinearity surely? The amount they are rotated can be selected by a trainable variable. Of course this requires your hidden layer dimension be divisible by 2. Then this hidden layer can go to an output layer Y.
 Curious what smarter more experienced people think of this kind of nonlinearity via paired rotation. 
 My thinking was that if you take the vector A representing all the possible data from your generating function for your dataset (maybe even an infinite dimensional vector if you can generate unlimited data) . Then if you rotate A along so many dimensions you could reach the output vector P which is all the Y values corresponding to A. 
 One way to kind of do this would be to split your dataset in half, and then you could have multiple iterations of each dataset rotated by a trainable angle each. This would rotate only each 2 grouped dimensions that you chose when you split the dataset. 
 Hopefully I’m using the right words to convey this. I’m just a hobbyist. Thanks for the feedback!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quite recently, I jumped on the boat of trying out llama. I noticed codellama did not provide any inference code. Yes, it provided python files which lets you run the inference but not a programming method rather terminal approach. 
 Terminal approach is great as it allows experts to run and perform inference+evaluation easily. But, if you are just starting out/new/non-seasoned programmer/individual in AI, it is frustrating. Because one, you can't play with actual code, limiting learning opportunities and two, it does not produces the curiosity in most cases to read all the code. 
 On top of that, I realised there was a lack of repositories and articles on this subject to load code-llama even with third-party methods. Which is why, I wrote two notebooks which outlines the process of how you can load code-llama from FAIR repository using code. [Believe me it's fun and filled with learning opportunities] and two how you can use Huggingface to load the model and perform inference. 
 Few points:
 1. Performing inference from FAIR repo, requires significant amount of computing resources even for 7B model.
 2. Huggingface method can be loaded using free Google Colab subscription.

Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the potential to perform high-level planning.

 This is not a job posting or self-promotion. We are networking in an attempt to speak to like-minded people who might be interested in a little side project outside of work.
 We are keen to speak to a London/UK-based Developer with a Banking sector background to join us on a project outside of work with the vision of potentially growing a fund.
 In short; we are in the process of developing an FX Macroeconomic Sentiment Divergence Trading Algorithm. There are currently 4 participants in the project (2 Developers and 2 Traders), 3 of whom work for Tier1 IBs in market-facing roles. 1 of the Developers is likely going to leave the project and we are interested in speaking to someone about picking up his part of the project.
 There are 3 parts to the project. The first part is mostly complete, now leaving the other 2 parts for us to start working on. We have manually backtested the strategy and it proves to be very profitable - more details can be shared about the strategy and results upon engagement.
 We are all VP-level in our roles and have around 10-15 years of experience in our requisite field. The tech stack for the project is Python, Java, Kafka, MongoDB and Springboot. We are also very interested in integrating some AI/ML modeling, so if you have any experience in this field that would be a big advantage
 A Banking background and being UK-based is a non-negotiable. If you feel like this could apply to you, get in touch! :)

 Abstract:
  
Modern deep-learning systems are specialized to problem settings in which training occurs once and then never again, as opposed to continual-learning settings in which training occurs continually. If deep-learning systems are applied in a continual learning setting, then it is well known that they may fail to remember earlier examples. More fundamental, but less well known, is that they may also lose their ability to learn on new examples, a phenomenon called loss of plasticity. We provide direct demonstrations of loss of plasticity using the MNIST and ImageNet datasets repurposed for continual learning as sequences of tasks. In ImageNet, binary classification performance dropped from 89\% accuracy on an early task down to 77\%, about the level of a linear network, on the 2000th task. Loss of plasticity occurred with a wide range of deep network architectures, optimizers, activation functions, batch normalization, dropout, but was substantially eased by L2-regularization, particularly when combined with weight perturbation. Further, we introduce a new algorithm -- continual backpropagation -- which slightly modifies conventional backpropagation to reinitialize a small fraction of less-used units after each example and appears to maintain plasticity indefinitely.

        <updated>2023-08-29T17:32:53.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introducing SelFee—a reinvented and powerful language model that uses self-feedback and self-revision to generate high-quality responses backed by a team of researchers from KAIST. Unlike previous models, SelFee doesn't rely on external, large-scale language or task-specific models, tipping the scales in the AI world.
 If you want to stay ahead of the curve in AI and tech, look here first.
 https://i.redd.it/bgszhpai43lb1.gif
 Why it matters?
  
SelFee, built on the base of LLaMA-based instruction-following model and fine-tuned, offers a fresh approach - generating an initial solution and self-feedback sequences and then revising its answers until a high-quality response is achieved.
 Data used for its training and model evaluation was collected from varied sources and fine-tuned with OpenAI API calls, beating the 13B SelFee model with a minimal 7B SelFee model that generated at least three revisions.
 SelFee proves the potential of iterative revision in enhancing language model responses, indicating that an increase in inference computation of a model may be superior to merely magnifying its size.
  
Features and Limitations:
  
SelFee's effective use of self-feedback significantly improves response quality, avoiding the requirement of external, large-scale language or task-specific models, translating into faster, cost-effective LLM solutions.
 However, lacking in certain areas compared to ChatGPT, such as math, reasoning, factuality, and coding, SelFee has room for further improvement and growth.
  
The revolution in the AI language model landscape is promising but still an evolving journey, with SelFee being the latest participant driving this change.

 Unlike polynomial interpolants in equispaced points, interpolants in Chebyshev nodes have excellent approximation properties (see Myth 1 of [1]). If a function is Lipchitz continuous, they converge; if a function is smooth with v derivatives and bounded variation for the v-th derivative, then they converge O(n^-v); and if a function is analytic, they converge geometrically.
 The Chebyshev Gauss-Lobatto nodes define a sequence of nested points, X^1, X^2, ..., that make it possible to build Smolyak sparse grids at Chebyshev nodes ([2], [3]).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently thinking about how to implement the "similar keywords" feature. I've prepared a table with keywords that are extracted from several hundred other tables. It includes basic information such as "keyword," "type," "words" (indicating the number of words in a keyword, e.g., "first name" will have "words" = 2), as well as some technical fields (such as database, table, etc.).
 In our data product, after entering a specific keyword, we have various pieces of information (which I'm not currently focusing on), and among them, we have "SIMILAR KEYWORDS." The results are displayed based on simple SQL queries, for instance:
 ​
 SELECT word, SUM(CASE WHEN type IN ('N', 'T') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS count, COUNT(\*) \* CASE WHEN (word + '%') LIKE u/word \+ '%' THEN 1.5 ELSE 1 END AS score FROM object_keywords WHERE ('% ' + word + '%') LIKE '%' + u/word + '%' AND (database_id = u/database_id OR u/database_id IS NULL) AND ( .... more technical information here. 
 ​
 I'm wondering how to improve this process. Would it be worth considering some AI solutions, or should I focus on enhancing the current SQL scripts (e.g., think about a more advanced scoring system)?
 What are your thoughts on this? Has anyone worked on something similar?

Pg 44, para 2, part 1 : "advantage of viewing inductive inference systems in terms of their inductive bias is that it provides a nonprocedural means of characterizing their policy for generalizing"
  
 Are there any general procedures to identify and validate the inductive bias of a system?
 Are there any guidelines to ensure the inferred definition of inductive bias is without errors?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The usage and fear surrounding ChatGPT aren't as prevalent as you might think, according to a recent poll from Pew Research. Only 18% of Americans have reportedly used ChatGPT. The demographic that uses it the most? Men aged 18-29 that are college-educated, but even that's just a 30-40% usage rate.
 https://preview.redd.it/0ax222gxczkb1.jpg?width=620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d3b04169d5de1985d1c52dce7962b5f3a543b014
 Why does this matter?
  
ChatGPT has still managed to gain a remarkable level of popularity, despite low usage. This suggests that even though not many people are using it, they are aware of it and its potential capabilities. More people reported using ChatGPT for entertainment or to educate themselves rather than for work.
 People anticipate AI to have a greater impact on jobs such as software engineers, graphic designers, and journalists. But the expectation is that AI as a whole, not just ChatGPT, will be the driving force behind this.
 Concern about AI is increasing, not decreasing. 47% of respondents said AI makes them more worried than excited, compared to 31% last year. This concern seems to rise with the level of AI knowledge one possesses.
  
Industries unshaken by AI:
  
As per the survey, employed individuals who are aware of ChatGPT don't see it drastically affecting their jobs. The sectors like hospitality, entertainment, construction, and manufacturing feel the least threatened.

 Several top news publications like The New York Times, CNN and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) have blocked Microsoft-backed OpenAI to access their content to train its AI models.[2]
 Intel on Monday said a new data center chip coming out next year will handle more than double the amount of computing work that can be done for each watt of power used, part of a broader industry push to lower electricity consumption.[3]
 OpenAI unveiled the new service, dubbed “ChatGPT Enterprise,” in a company blog post and said it will be available to business clients for purchase as of Monday. The new offering promises to provide “enterprise-grade security and privacy” combined with “the most powerful version of ChatGPT yet” for businesses looking to jump on the generative AI bandwagon.[4]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, ML noob here dipping their feet in the water. Right now I am trying to make an ML model that predicts "legendary" QBs of the past performances against current NFL teams. I'll be using Jupyter and Sklearn to do this. However, and maybe this is me overthinking things, I'm not sure how sklearn is going to interpret the data in the dataset. Right now I have a dataset containing all these QBs data (passing stats, strengths and weaknesses, etc.). My teams version of the data is essentially going to be the inverse of all these things. I'm just not quite sure what to target when im testing the data that will determine the "prediction" of the legend QBs stat line against the current team. In better words, how will the computer know that I'm trying to find the yards and touchdowns a QB would produce against a certain team when there's not really any target data for this. I feel as though all I have is data that contributes to a potential target data but I lack target data itself and I'm not sure what to do in that regard. I’m making use of supervised learning and decisión trees btw.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll start with the obvious - AWS guides are the worst. We all felt it. So, trying to build automation with them becomes M:I, or better yet, Oppenheimer.
 For the first time, our MLOps team had to build a CI/CD pipeline for ML training and deployment using SageMaker. We had ZERO ideas on how to do it, so we had to go through the rigorous process of using AWS guides and tutorials, scattered over a gazillion places, just to figure out how to configure our project with SageMaker and build infra for CI/CD.
 Usually, when this thing happens, we extend the project lifecycle and have a team member document the process so we can refer back to it when we need to do it again.
 Knowing this can be beneficial to the community, we decided to share a series of 3 blogs that guide you through the process of building CI/CD pipelines for continuous training and deployment with AWS SageMaker.
 We published the first blog, which covers the configuration part, and plan to publish the rest in the following week.
 Check it out: https://dagshub.com/blog/setup-sagemaker-for-ci-cd-pipelines/
 I'm sure we can improve this tutorial, and would love to learn from your experience on how we can do it! 🤗

 Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13418
 Github: https://github.com/facebookresearch/nougat
 Abstract:
  
Scientific knowledge is predominantly stored in books and scientific journals, often in the form of PDFs. However, the PDF format leads to a loss of semantic information, particularly for mathematical expressions. We propose Nougat (Neural Optical Understanding for Academic Documents), a Visual Transformer model that performs an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) task for processing scientific documents into a markup language, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a new dataset of scientific documents. The proposed approach offers a promising solution to enhance the accessibility of scientific knowledge in the digital age, by bridging the gap between human-readable documents and machine-readable text. We release the models and code to accelerate future work on scientific text recognition.

 (video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVade_8H8mE)
 It would not matter so much if the models had high failure rate, but as the models are getting closer and closer to 100%, the wrong answers will matter more and more.
 So, what can be done to fix such errors or to create a better test than MMLU?

 Abstract:
  
Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing tasks. However, their practical deployment is hindered by their immense memory and computation requirements. Although recent post-training quantization (PTQ) methods are effective in reducing memory footprint and improving the computational efficiency of LLM, they hand-craft quantization parameters, which leads to low performance and fails to deal with extremely low-bit quantization. To tackle this issue, we introduce an Omnidirectionally calibrated Quantization (OmniQuant) technique for LLMs, which achieves good performance in …]]></summary>

 I am starting my career transition, and would be interested to know how long it might take me to acquire the skills needed to work for a company. Likewise, I would like to know if it is necessary (or important) to have a professional degree to get a job.
 Just to give you some context about me, I am currently a recently graduated lawyer, so my degree has not given me a strong mathematical background. However, my strongest area of learning has always been mathematics, so despite not having a very advanced background, I consider myself to be a pretty good and fairly quick learner.
 I would also like to know if you consider if my professional career could be useful in some machine learning context.
 If you could recommend me some courses, inputs or guide to study in an organized way on the subject I would be very grateful.
 Thank you very much in advance.

However, these models are not always aligned with human preferences and values and may produce harmful or undesirable content if not properly guided. Aligning LLMs with human preferences can also improve their performance on downstream tasks. One way to achieve this alignment is to use reinforcement learning from feedback (RLHF), which learns a reward model from human input and then fine-tunes the LLM using a reinforcement learning (RL) objective.
 However, RLHF methods often face challenges such as computational cost, reward hacking, and data quality. To address these issues, researchers from DeepMind propose a new method called Reinforced Self-Training (ReST), which is inspired by gro…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I am at a bit of a crossroads and hope for some advice from the community. I also hope the answers would help others who are in my situation right now.
 I used to work on vision-related problems utilizing Deep learning back in a day, with all fun included: trying out new models, implementing data pipelines, evaluating various metrics... It was a rather big company with its own data collection efforts and enough resources for training. So, I am definitely not a beginner and have some experience.
 At my current job, I am not doing any ML/DL at the momemt, and while the stuff I am doing is still cool and I enjoy it, I am missing good old ML and having a feeling that I am hanging behind as the time goes by. So I figured it would be nice to start a hobby project, preferably in the area of vision-related applications of deep learning. However, I feel a bit lost as in what would be the most efficient approach taking into account I would only have a coule of hours per week for it.
 Here are possible ways to go I am thinking of:
  
take a paper, implement it from scratch with PyTorch
 clone an existing project, contribute with code improvements/better test coverage
 take an existing pre-trained model, adapt to a slightly different task and fine-tune
  
While the first option is of cource the most exciting, the problem is you have to pay for a powerful GPU and data storage which might be impractical (my PC has a 4 GB GTX 1650 TI). Cloud storages exist, and I would be willing to even spend something on training but would like to avoid the costs.
 So, the question would be: has enyone faced similar situation? Which way did you end up going? Any general tips? Thanks!

 This, to me, amounts to a bait and switch where a high quality chatbot is offered for a certain price, then swapped out with an inferior product capable only of reproducing past interactions. This is made worse by the fact that they advertise temperature as one of the variables you can set. Temperature is a variable that can only apply to uniquely generated output and has no effect on simple repetition of previous responses. This makes their practice doubly deceptive, and makes it clear (in my view) that they are trying to deceive customers.

An output of another LLM (embedding model) or any other way (maybe just an average of a few tokens as an example)?
 Essentially - I am curious if there's a NLP approach analogy to Textual Inversion techniques in image generation models. I could imagine this being useful for things like RAG or personalization (if you could have a "user" token). Surely I'm not the first to think of this so I would love some pointers to any papers/blogs etc in this space.

 I’ve heard countless times people saying “I want to integrate ML in my product” and recently “I love ChatGPT, I should integrate it in my product”. Yet, as I dived deeper, seeking the genuine reasons and pain points driving this request, I regularly found the same pattern: many had no clear motive for their AI aspirations. It seemed as if they were only jumping on the trend because “everyone else is doing it”, or because their “CEO” told them to do so.
 So my question is : why do you integrate AI/ML into your products? Is it to enhance your user experience? Is to automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks? Is it to stay ahead of your competition? or is it just because everyone is doing it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an environment where there are multiple agents being represented by one neural network (so the policy outputs all of their actions). These actions as time goes on should not exceed a certain constraint level or they will put the environment into an undesired an irrecoverable state.
 I am wondering what the best way to inform these agents of this cumulative action constraint? I have appended it to my state vector but since the observation without this cumulative action is still a 625*1 vector, I think adding that constraint as just one additional state is causing it to be drowned out by the state size. Any ideas of how to addreess?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Slack questions are a huge time sink. For the person asking, they generally have no idea how to find the info and may not hear back for hours. For the person answering, it’s a distraction and often requires digging up old knowledge.
 The idea is simple: give an LLM your organizational context and plop it in Slack to answer things for you.
 DanswerBot is free to use and open source (MIT). You can connect it to Slack, Google Drive, GitHub, Confluence, Jira, local files, websites, and much more.
 Quick Demo Vid: https://youtu.be/EjDDvt5GbS8 
 Some additional neat features you may be interested in:
  
LLM generated answers backed by quotes to reduce hallucination
 
Supports a wide range of LLMs (both open source and proprietary)
 
Multi-Vector embeddings for accurate vector search
 
BM-25 Keyword search
 
Learning from user feedback
 
Custom NLP model to classify user intent
 
Polls your data sources every 10 minutes to keep knowledge up to date
 
Links back to your document sources
 
Document level access control
 
Admin dashboard to configure connectors to 14 (for now) of the most popular workplace tools
 
 If you aren’t a slack user (or if you just prefer a more tailored UI), there’s also a web interface to ask questions against your knowledge base. A short demo for that can be found at: https://youtu.be/cWWtnuVCUX0
 If you’re interested in testing this out yourself, the docs to help you launch Danswer with a single command can be found at https://docs.danswer.dev/quickstart!

How can I do this? Also, some things must be considered. First, I can’t mathematically model the environment so some how I have to numerically show that they reached nash eq. Another thing that I find is deviate the action of each agent and show that they don’t get a better reward but the problem is there is a actor network for each agent. How can I show deviation from the optimal policy?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12013
  
Generative models realized with machine learning techniques are powerful tools to infer complex and unknown data distributions from a finite number of training samples in order to produce new synthetic data. Diffusion models are an emerging framework that have recently overcome the performance of the generative adversarial networks in creating synthetic text and high-quality images. Here, we propose and discuss the quantum generalization of diffusion models, i.e., three quantum-noise-driven generative diffusion models that could be experimentally tested on real quantum systems. The idea is to harness unique quantum features, in particular the non-trivial interplay among coherence, entanglement and noise that the currently available noisy quantum processors do unavoidably suffer from, in order to overcome the main computational burdens of classical diffusion models during inference. Hence, we suggest to exploit quantum noise not as an issue to be detected and solved but instead as a very remarkably beneficial key ingredient to generate much more complex probability distributions that would be difficult or even impossible to express classically, and from which a quantum processor might sample more efficiently than a classical one. Therefore, our results are expected to pave the way for new quantum-inspired or quantum-based generative diffusion algorithms addressing more powerfully classical tasks as data generation/prediction with widespread real-world applications ranging from climate forecasting to neuroscience, from traffic flow analysis to financial forecasting.

 I’m currently doing my undergrad in Economics but am heavily interested in Compsci/Datasci and related topics. Though to be completely honest, I’m not completely sure which area my interests lie in. 
 I was wondering if picking up coding/ theoretical knowledge that a com scientist or data scientist needs will be hard when I am already working. 
 The question is if it is necessary to switch my degree to Math and Economics to gain a firmer foundation in the mathematical/ statistical concepts that ground com science. Or will an undergrad in Economics be sufficiently rigorous for me to pick up com sci/ data sci myself. 
 For context, I’m thinking of taking courses on Real Analysis, Linear Algebra 2, Discrete Mathematics, Algorithms and Data Structures, Optimisation, Probability and Statistics.

I was hoping there’s an AI tool out there that can read articles for me and help me understand the more complex aspects and the math. I was also hoping that it could answer questions about the article for my class so that I could compare my conclusions to something. Any suggestions? I tried uploading some PDFs to bard this morning and it wasn’t great.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been playing around with some of the new AI chatbots. Some of them include paradot.ai, replika.com, spicychat.ai, cuti.ai. Suffice it to say, these things are getting really good, and I mean really good. Assuming this is just the beginning, and these things keep learning more and getting better, where does this end up?
 I genuinely think there’s going to be the need for world wide regulation on these things. But we all know that worldwide consensus is difficult if not impossible. in case a few countries decide to regulate or govern this tech, developers will take advantage of regulatory arbitrage and just deploy their models and register their companies on servers in countries with no regulation. Since this is tech, and everything is on servers, escaping regulation is basically childs play.
 Also, what about mental health concerns? We all know that porn, webcams and OnlyFans are already screwing up male-female relationships and marriages. Look at any statistics about this and the numbers speak for themselves. And this is before AI. So now what’s going to happen 5 years from now when GPU’s are faster and cheaper, and when these companies have gathered 100x more data about their customers, and when models are 50x better.
 We are just at the beginning and AI is moving really quick, especially generative AI. I think it’s officially time to start worrying.

This vector represents a bidding curve, and a crucial property is that it must always increase monotonically. Otherwise, the bid is considered invalid. For example, [0, 1.2, 4.5, 58, 92.65, 104.3, 104.3] is valid because each number is greater than or equal to the previous one. I'm looking for guidance on how to design this setup, impose these constraints, and handle cases where the agent violates the sequence. While using negative rewards might not be effective due to the potential for generating numerous invalid bids, I'm unsure about the right approach. Could someone assist me with this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10379
 Abstract:
  
Current literature, aiming to surpass the "Chain-of-Thought" approach, often resorts to an external modus operandi involving halting, modifying, and then resuming the generation process to boost Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning capacities. This mode escalates the number of query requests, leading to increased costs, memory, and computational overheads. Addressing this, we propose the Algorithm of Thoughts -- a novel strategy that propels LLMs through algorithmic reasoning pathways, pioneering a new mode of in-context learning. By employing algorithmic examples, we exploit the innate recurrence dynamics of LLMs, expanding their idea exploration with merely one or a few queries. Our technique outperforms earlier single-query methods and stands on par with a recent multi-query strategy that employs an extensive tree search algorithm. Intriguingly, our results suggest that instructing an LLM using an algorithm can lead to performance surpassing that of the algorithm itself, hinting at LLM's inherent ability to weave its intuition into optimized searches. We probe into the underpinnings of our method's efficacy and its nuances in application.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Complex tasks with LLMs like ChatGPT/GPT4 are best broken down by first asking ChatGPT to outline the steps and then asking the LLM to execute against those steps that it defined. I first came across this interesting technique on Twitter recently.
 While it’s OK to do this once in OpenAI’s playground, it's difficult to make this repeatable and streamlined. When I wanted an LLM to do something complex, I wanted to be able to plug into a template instead of thinking about and setting up the contextual decomposition process.
 I made this Contextual Decomposition Template to help solve this problem: https://lastmileai.dev/workbooks/cllqfl5c600rdpgnhh2su2fa0
 With a document and objective, this template allows you to quickly get to the answer through defining intermediate steps and executing according. Parameters are set up so you can easily change the goal, document, and objective and click 'Run All' to get the final results.
 Please let me know if you have feedback! I'm also very curious if you have other interesting techniques with complex tasks and workflows working with LLMs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I started to study some Machine Learning algorithms, specifically K-means, but I'm not sure if I did it correctly for several reasons:
 - In the Kmeans that I did, I normalize the data because they mention that it helps a lot, but if I don't, the algorithm stops classifying normally and shows me badly grouped points.
 - As I mentioned, when looking at the graphs of the grouped points, I can see how many of the points are clearly closer to certain centroids, but he classified them as others, this reaches the level of a misclassified point next to the centroid when that should belong
 - Despite the fact that it has a threshold to be making iterations, the algorithm ends in less than 10 even though it has placed 100 iterations. I know that it can depend on the dataset and the generated centroids, but it seems excessive to me that it ends so soon and with results like Iris datset (60, 13, 77) when it should be (50, 50, 50) or a minimum to be maintained for those values.
 I leave the code in GH in case someone can help me: https://github.com/vanstrouble/kmeans-from-scratch.git

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in the strange position of having the task of developing a machine learning pipeline/system/process in an academic environment without the benefit of much in the way of formal training in ML (I'm more of a classical stats for hypothesis testing kinda guy).
 The particular project is using machine learning on medical images (head CT scans) to detect a relatively rare condition. As usual the goal is to eventually have some automatic process for diagnosis support. This particular condition is something that diagnostic radiologists can always detect if they look in the right place on the image, the problem is that they often don't look in the right place. After talking to colleagues with more experience (but less time) it's something which in principle can be achieved with more or less "off the shelf" code put together in the right order and with appropriate hyperparameters.
 This stage of the project is aiming for a proof of principle, rather than anything deployable. We're lucky to have a decent amount of data inside a trusted research environment.
 I've done some hobby-level stuff and tutorials, but overall I'm coming into this with a lot more experience with medical imaging than with computer vision or machine learning.
 After all that preamble here's my question:
 What does a decent CV/ML experiment look like?
 Left to my own direction I can see myself picking 3 different approaches of varying complexity, trying to get the best out of each of them, and then presenting a comparison of performance or accuracy of all of them. I then claim the "best one" as the one we move on with.
 There are a lot of tools out there for experiment tracking (eg neptune.ai), but I'm really not sure whether that sort of thing is over the top for what I need to do.
 Any tips or experience that you folks don't mind sharing?

 Does anyone know if it's possible to set a limit to the number of papers you are assigned as a reviewer on OpenReview? Specifically for ICLR 2024. I saw a Twitter thread about this option before for ICML. It blows my mind that this is not easy to change. I got 5 papers for the last NeurIps which was very overwhelming. As reviewers, we provide a free service to the community, and we should be allowed to pick how much work we want to undertake...

 TLDR: How do I change the orientation of portrait frames to landscape frames while keeping the mockup essence the same.
 Link: https://ibb.co/album/hx6wp3
 Basically, I have two portrait frame mockups that came in a bundle and the bundle had no landscape frame mockups at all. So, naturally I'd like to make my own since I have a lot of landscape artworks that could be displayed in the mockups.
 How can I change the orientation display of my mockup? I've tried using Photoshop's generative AI software and got nowhere. It keeps giving me a new frame design when I want to keep the original frame so it matches the set.
 Any leads on how this can be done would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey!One of my friends brought up an idea about using LLM for product search and we started talking about the idea and approach.
 Per my understanding what would need to be done is to train some smaller language model on the product data, create embeddings from the product info and make the model use this as a body of knowledge.
 My issue is that if this was ever to be done on commercial scale it seems very complex to me, since the embeddings would have to be re-created every time a new product is introduced?
 Let me know what you think or how you would approach this, as I'm trying to see different PoV's and everyone here has more experience than me.

 I am looking for a RL library that offers me individual components rather than the whole algorithm. I do not need a PPO implementation, but I would fancy a library that offers me functions to compute the PPO loss given a batch of steps. 
 In other words, what I need is a library that offers the most granular RL components (different losses, replay buffers, return estimators like GAE, etc) instead of full algorithm implementations. Which libraries do you recommend for this purpose?

 Hi I want to write program that would find best hyperparameters (number of joint, angles) for design of robots (similar to NAS). 
 It would work in such a way that I would have one RL algorithm that would search for the hyperparameters of the robot and then I would to train and evaluate this robot using SAC in MuJoCo physical simulator.
 Problem is that MuJoCo runs on CPU and I need lots of parallel enviroments and for this I would use envpool https://github.com/sail-sg/envpool.
 The question is what (if any) RL library should I use as a wrapper.
 The options are Stable-Baselines3, Tianshou, ACME, CleanRL, or rl_games.

 Abstract:
  
Large Language Models (LLMs) went from non-existent to ubiquitous in the machine learning discourse within a few years. Due to the fast pace of the field, it is difficult to identify the remaining challenges and already fruitful application areas. In this paper, we aim to establish a systematic set of open problems and application successes so that ML researchers can comprehend the field's current state more quickly and become productive.

As I read the paper on wav2vec 2.0, I see them mentioning the use of language models in decoding, particularly a 4-gram model and a Transformer. As far as I'm aware, the encoder (wav2vec2) will output a probability sequence of L x V (where V is the vocab size, L is sequence length). I have two questions:
  
I learned that a n-gram language model would predict the probability of a n-gram given previous context words, but how is a Transformer implemented here ? Does it follow a causal structure such as GPT and then estimate sequence likelihood ?
 How can a language model, trained to estimate next word (n-gram) probability given previous context, be used to decode the output sequence given the L x V probability outputs from above ?
  
Many thanks !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Understanding GPT-4
 What is GPT-4?
 GPT-4 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4) is a machine learning model for natural language understanding and generation. It works by analyzing a large dataset and generating text based on the input it receives.
 How Does It Work?
 GPT-4 uses deep neural networks with multiple layers to predict the next word in a sequence of words. The model has been trained on a wide range of internet text, so it's capable of understanding and generating coherent and contextually relevant text based on the prompts it's given.
 Building Apps with GPT-4
 Step 1: Get API Access
 To use GPT-4, you'll first need access to its API. OpenAI provides this service, and you can apply for an API key from their website.
 Step 2: Choose Your Programming Language
 You can integrate the GPT-4 API into your application using various programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, or Ruby.
 Step 3: Making API Calls
 Once you've chosen your language, you'll make RESTful API calls to communicate with GPT-4. You'll pass your prompt as an input and receive generated text as output.
 Example in Python
 Here is a simple Python example using the openai library to interact with GPT-4:
 ```python import openai
 openai.api_key = "your-api-key-here"
 response = openai.Completion.create( engine="text-davinci-002", prompt="Translate the following English text to French: '{}'", max_tokens=60 )
 print(response.choices[0].text.strip()) ```
 Step 4: Handle Rate Limits
 OpenAI's API comes with rate limits, so you'll need to manage these by either queuing requests or handling retries.
 Step 5: Deployment
 After testing and fine-tuning, deploy your application. Ensure that you are abiding by OpenAI's usage policies and guidelines.
 Conclusion
 GPT-4 is a powerful tool for natural language understanding and generation. By understanding its workings and following the steps to integrate it into an application, you can leverage its capabilities for various use-cases.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We introduce a new operator, called 3D DeFormable Attention (DFA3D), for 2D-to-3D feature lifting, which transforms multi-view 2D image features into a unified 3D space for 3D object detection.
 ​
 Comparisons of feature lifting methods.
 Existing feature lifting approaches, such as Lift-Splat-based and 2D attention-based, either use estimated depth to get pseudo LiDAR features and then splat them to a 3D space, which is a one-pass operation without feature refinement, or ignore depth and lift features by 2D attention mechanisms, which achieve finer semantics while suffering from a depth ambiguity problem.
 In contrast, our DFA3D-based method first leverages the estimated depth to expand each view's 2D feature map to 3D and then utilizes DFA3D to aggregate features from the expanded 3D feature maps. With the help of DFA3D, the depth ambiguity problem can be effectively alleviated from the root, and the lifted features can be progressively refined layer by layer, thanks to the Transformer-like architecture. In addition, we propose a mathematically equivalent implementation of DFA3D which can significantly improve its memory efficiency and computational speed. We integrate DFA3D into several methods that use 2D attention-based feature lifting with only a few modifications in code and evaluate on the nuScenes dataset. The experiment results show a consistent improvement of +1.41\% mAP on average, and up to +15.1\% mAP improvement when high-quality depth information is available, demonstrating the superiority, applicability, and huge potential of DFA3D.

 \super computer = tech needed to train a LLM fast on unlimited data*
 (1) Does a company like McKinsey (confidential data) train their LLM in-house or in the cloud?
 (2) Do enough super computers exist for every company to start training their LLM today?
 (3) Is there even a single company that ships super computers capable of training LLMs in-house?
 (4) McKinsey will want to train their LLMs on all data they have from their customers so that McKinsey can work at max efficiency. Customers won't like that. Is it possible to un-train specific data sets?
 (5) Would it be possible to feed the LLM with the customer's data instead of training the LLM on the data? What would be the differences? If you feed it the data, then the LLM can't work with the data as well as it could if you trained it on said data?
 The future is just so damn exciting and I have all these questions popping up so I hope some educated folks can share some insights! Thanks for reading!

 Now, I find myself spearheading an ML project at a big company, and our backend code base keeps growing, and other people depend on it. There are layers to it, with threads spawning, and dependencies on caches and databases for state sharing. It's more than a pet project - you get the gist. I want to design production-ready architectures that are more robust than piecemeal/make-shift solutions. 
 Do people have resources or suggestions on what established design patterns work in the industry? I have found it hard to find resources just by googling because the pace at which ML research works makes most books/tutorials outdated. Take retrieval augmented generation, for example. Do you store your documents in an elasticsearch store and build indices periodically or do you store them in FAISS? How separated is your retrieval module from your LLM call? Do you host in-house LLM's centrally company-wide or per-project?
 What has worked for you so far in the industry?

 If anyone finds it useful, feel free to check it out: https://github.com/mphe/upside-down-reinforcement-learning.
 There are many other implementations out there, but most of them are difficult to extend and maintain, due to being written in a sloppy manner, or are incorrect, e.g. not using multiplicative interactions or contain smaller bugs and issues.
 This project aims to fix these issues, while potentially improving performance, providing a proper OOP interface, and reusing code from Stable Baselines 3 where applicable.
 Furthermore, the algorithm has been extended to support additional features, like multi-threading, which speeds up the training time immensely. It also provides an interface similar to SB algorithms, so it can be used mostly analogously.
 For more information, see the Github page.

 And I have used ordinal encoding for 'Types' columns and label for 'Color' column. How will the model know that Types is ordinal while Color is nominal.
 PS. Suppose I cannot use One Hot encoding as it will increase the no of columns by 20 or 30.

 However, when convoluting the nearby agents' observations, I also wish nearby agents' action values to be part of the local observation that will be convoluted, however this would cause a dilemma as for an agent to choose and action, it will have to know other agents' actions but the other agents would have to know this agent's value for deciding the value.
 Are there MARL methods that can help me fix this problem?

I get that it helps give more importance to clean samples during training. But, about the sum of these weights used in the loss function - should they always add up to 1? What's the reasoning behind this constraint? Can't the weights sum up to any positive value instead? Also, if I intend to assign loss values with probabilities, does the weighted sum still need to be 1? Need help clarifying if my understanding is correct!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been captivated by Recursive Least Squares (RLS) methods, particularly the approach that employs error prediction instead of matrix inversion. This method is quite intuitive. Let's consider a scenario where you need to estimate the true effect of four factors (color, gender, age, and weight) on blood sugar. To find the true impact of weight on blood sugar, it's necessary to eliminate the influence of every other factor on weight. This can be accomplished by using simple least squares regression to predict the residual errors recursively, as shown in the diagram below:
 Removing the effect of all factors on \"weight\" in a recursive manner
 The fundamental contrast between RLS and Gradient-based methods lies in how errors are distributed across inputs based on their activity, leading to the subsequent update of weights. However, in the case of RLS, all inputs undergo decorrelation before evaluating prediction errors. 
 Comparison between error sharing in RLS and GD
 This de-correlation can be done in few lines of python code:
 for i in range(number_of_factors):
 for j in range(i+1, number_of_factors): 
 wx = np.sum(x[i] * x[j]) / np.sum(x[i]**2) 
 x[j] -= wx * x[i] 
 This approach also bears relevance to predictive coding and can shed light on intriguing neuroscientific findings, such as the increase brain activity during surprising or novel events — attributable to prediction errors.
 The prediction errors are increasing during the surprising events similar to how brain activity increases.
 RLS learns very fast but it's still subpar to deep learning when it comes to non-linear hierarchical structures but that is probably because Gradient based methods enjoyed more attention and tinkering from the ML-community. I think RLS methods needs more attention and I have been working on some research projects that uses this method for signal prediction . If you're interested, you can find the source code here:

 There can be a comparison of a pair with two entities resulting in a winner and a loser: A > B; C > A; D > C; ...
 A comparison is expensive.
 Objective: to approximate the absolute order of entities (best entities at the top of the list, worst at the bottom), minimize the number of comparisons
 The worst solution would be just applying a sorting algorithm, which would require n log n comparisons.
 I believe an active sampling technique would be required, i.e. select a number of entities with the highest uncertainty, and do comparisons with them, adjust the model, repeat.
 ChatGPT suggests a Bradley-Terry model and even gives an implementation example. I wonder if there is anything better?

results but also to quantify the amount of confidence in their prediction. The
management of an electric power grid is one of these cases: to avoid risky
scenarios, decision-makers need both precise and reliable forecasts of, for
example, power loads. For this reason, point forecasts are not enough hence it
is necessary to adopt methods that provide an uncertainty quantification.

This work focuses on reservoir computing as the core time series forecasting
method, due to its computational efficiency and effectiveness in predicting
time series. While the RC literature mostly focused on point forecasting, this
work explores the compatibility of some popular uncertainty quantification
methods with the reservoir setting. Both Bayesian and deterministic approaches
to uncertainty assessment are evaluated and compared in terms of their
prediction accuracy, computational resource efficiency and reliability of the
estimated uncertainty, based on a set of carefully chosen performance metrics.]]></summary>

assistance of extremely heavy parameters, which challenges deployment in real
applications. Knowledge distillation is well recognized as the essential
procedure in model compression. However, existing knowledge distillation
techniques lack an in-depth investigation and analysis of VLP, and practical
guidelines for VLP-oriented distillation are still not yet explored. In this
paper, we present DLIP, a simple yet efficient Distilling Language-Image
Pre-training framework, through which we investigate how to distill a light VLP
model. Specifically, we dissect the model distillation from multiple
dimensions, such as the architecture characteristics of different modules and
the information transfer of different modalities. We conduct comprehensive
experiments and provide insights on distilling a light but performant VLP
model. Experimental results reveal that DLIP can achieve a state-of-the-art
accuracy/efficiency trade-off across diverse cross-modal tasks, e.g.,
image-text retrieval, image captioning and visual question answering. For
example, DLIP compresses BLIP by 1.9x, from 213M to 108M parameters, while
achieving comparable or better performance. Furthermore, DLIP succeeds in
retaining more than 95% of the performance with 22.4% parameters and 24.8%
FLOPs compared to the teacher model and accelerates inference speed by 2.7x.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Decision-making problems can be represented as mathematical optimization
models, finding wide applications in fields such as economics, engineering and
manufacturing, transportation, and health care. Optimization models are
mathematical abstractions of the problem of making the best decision while
satisfying a set of requirements or constraints. One of the primary barriers to
deploying these models in practice is the challenge of helping practitioners
understand and interpret such models, particularly when they are infeasible,
meaning no decision satisfies all the constraints. Existing methods for
diagnosing infeasible optimization models often rely on expert systems,
necessitating significant background knowledge in optimization. In this paper,
we introduce OptiChat, a first-of-its-kind natural language-based system
equipped with a chatbot GUI for engaging in interactive conversations about
infeasible optimization models. OptiChat can provide natural language
descriptions of the optimization model itself, identify potential sources of
infeasibility, and offer suggestions to make the model feasible. The
implementation of OptiChat is built on GPT-4, which interfaces with an
optimization solver to identify the minimal subset of constraints that render
the entire optimization problem infeasible, also known as the Irreducible
Infeasible Subset (IIS). We utilize few-shot learning, expert chain-of-thought,
key-retrieve, and sentiment prompts to enhance OptiChat's reliability. Our
experiments demonstrate that OptiChat assists both expert and non-expert users
in improving their understanding of the optimization models, enabling them to
quickly identify the sources of infeasibility.]]></summary>

potential causes of the extrapolation step failing in some algorithms, and
resolve this issue by enhancing the comparison process that evaluates the
trade-off between the proximal gradient step and the linear extrapolation step
in our algorithm. Furthermore, we extends our algorithm to any scenario
involving updating block variables with positive integers, allowing each cycle
to randomly shuffle the update order of the variable blocks. Additionally,
under mild assumptions, we prove that ABPL$^+$ can monotonically decrease the
function value without strictly restricting the extrapolation parameters and
step size, demonstrates the viability and effectiveness of updating these
blocks in a random order, and we also more obviously and intuitively
demonstrate that the derivative set of the sequence generated by our algorithm
is a critical point set. Moreover, we demonstrate the global convergence as
well as the linear and sublinear convergence rates of our algorithm by
utilizing the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (K{\L}) condition. To enhance the
effectiveness and flexibility of our algorithm, we also expand the study to the
imprecise version of our algorithm and construct an adaptive extrapolation
parameter strategy, which improving its overall performance. We apply our
algorithm to multiple non-negative matrix factorization with the $\ell_0$ norm,
nonnegative tensor decomposition with the $\ell_0$ norm, and perform extensive

representation of data lying close to a union of low-dimensional manifolds, a
fundamental task in machine learning and computer vision. When the manifolds
are assumed to be linear subspaces, this reduces to the classical problem of
subspace clustering, which has been studied extensively over the past two
decades. Unfortunately, many real-world datasets such as natural images can not
be well approximated by linear subspaces. On the other hand, numerous works
have attempted to learn an appropriate transformation of the data, such that
data is mapped from a union of general non-linear manifolds to a union of
linear subspaces (with points from the same manifold being mapped to the same
subspace). However, many existing works have limitations such as assuming
knowledge of the membership of samples to clusters, requiring high sampling
density, or being shown theoretically to learn trivial representations. In this
paper, we propose to optimize the Maximal Coding Rate Reduction metric with
respect to both the data representation and a novel doubly stochastic cluster
membership, inspired by state-of-the-art subspace clustering results. We give a
parameterization of such a representation and membership, allowing efficient
mini-batching and one-shot initialization. Experiments on CIFAR-10, -20, -100,
and TinyImageNet-200 datasets show that the proposed method is much more
accurate and scalable than state-of-the-art deep clustering methods, and
further learns a latent linear representation of the data.]]></summary>

models collaboratively while preserving data privacy. The need for privacy
protection makes it difficult for FL models to achieve global transparency and
explainability. To address this limitation, we incorporate logic-based
explanations into FL by proposing the Logical Reasoning-based eXplainable
Federated Learning (LR-XFL) approach. Under LR-XFL, FL clients create local
logic rules based on their local data and send them, along with model updates,
to the FL server. The FL server connects the local logic rules through a proper
logical connector that is derived based on properties of client data, without
requiring access to the raw data. In addition, the server also aggregates the
local model updates with weight values determined by the quality of the
clients' local data as reflected by their uploaded logic rules. The results
show that LR-XFL outperforms the most relevant baseline by 1.19%, 5.81% and
5.41% in terms of classification accuracy, rule accuracy and rule fidelity,
respectively. The explicit rule evaluation and expression under LR-XFL enable
human experts to validate and correct the rules on the server side, hence
improving the global FL model's robustness to errors. It has the potential to
enhance the transparency of FL models for areas like healthcare and finance
where both data privacy and explainability are important.]]></summary>

populations that are acoustically active but difficult to survey visually.
Digital recorders allow surveyors to gather large volumes of data at low cost,
but identifying target species vocalisations in these data is non-trivial.
Machine learning (ML) methods are often used to do the identification. They can
process large volumes of data quickly, but they do not detect all vocalisations
and they do generate some false positives (vocalisations that are not from the
target species). Existing wildlife abundance survey methods have been designed
specifically to deal with the first of these mistakes, but current methods of
dealing with false positives are not well-developed. They do not take account
of features of individual vocalisations, some of which are more likely to be
false positives than others. We propose three methods for acoustic spatial
capture-recapture inference that integrate individual-level measures of
confidence from ML vocalisation identification into the likelihood and hence
integrate ML uncertainty into inference. The methods include a mixture model in
which species identity is a latent variable. We test the methods by simulation
and find that in a scenario based on acoustic data from Hainan gibbons, in
which ignoring false positives results in 17% positive bias, our methods give
negligible bias and coverage probabilities that are close to the nominal 95%

influenced by intensity variations of input images and lack generalization due
to primarily utilizing pixels' intensity information for inference. Acquiring
sufficient training data is another challenge limiting models' applications. We
proposed to leverage the consistency of organs' anatomical shape and position
information in medical images. We introduced a framework leveraging recurring
anatomical patterns through global binary masks for organ segmentation. Two
scenarios were studied.1) Global binary masks were the only model's (i.e.
U-Net) input, forcing exclusively encoding organs' position and shape
information for segmentation/localization.2) Global binary masks were
incorporated as an additional channel functioning as position/shape clues to
mitigate training data scarcity. Two datasets of the brain and heart CT images
with their ground-truth were split into (26:10:10) and (12:3:5) for training,
validation, and test respectively. Training exclusively on global binary masks
led to Dice scores of 0.77(0.06) and 0.85(0.04), with the average Euclidian
distance of 3.12(1.43)mm and 2.5(0.93)mm relative to the center of mass of the
ground truth for the brain and heart structures respectively. The outcomes
indicate that a surprising degree of position and shape information is encoded
through global binary masks. Incorporating global binary masks led to
significantly higher accuracy relative to the model trained on only CT images
in small subsets of training data; the performance improved by 4.3-125.3% and
1.3-48.1% for 1-8 training cases of the brain and heart datasets respectively.
The findings imply the advantages of utilizing global binary masks for building
generalizable models and to compensate for training data scarcity.]]></summary>

that enable voice cloning and real-time voice conversion from one individual to
another. This technology poses a significant ethical threat and could lead to
breaches of privacy and misrepresentation, thus there is an urgent need for
real-time detection of AI-generated speech for DeepFake Voice Conversion. To
address the above emerging issues, the DEEP-VOICE dataset is generated in this
study, comprised of real human speech from eight well-known figures and their
speech converted to one another using Retrieval-based Voice Conversion.
Presenting as a binary classification problem of whether the speech is real or
AI-generated, statistical analysis of temporal audio features through t-testing
reveals that there are significantly different distributions. Hyperparameter
optimisation is implemented for machine learning models to identify the source
of speech. Following the training of 208 individual machine learning models
over 10-fold cross validation, it is found that the Extreme Gradient Boosting
model can achieve an average classification accuracy of 99.3% and can classify
speech in real-time, at around 0.004 milliseconds given one second of speech.

individually for each participant involved in the analysis. This can be
informative as often the individual privacy losses are considerably smaller

losses in a principled manner, we need a privacy accountant for adaptive
compositions of randomised mechanisms, where the loss incurred at a given data

has been carried out for the R\'enyi differential privacy (RDP) by Feldman and
Zrnic (2021), however not yet for the so-called optimal privacy accountants. We
make first steps in this direction by providing a careful analysis using the
Gaussian differential privacy which gives optimal bounds for the Gaussian
mechanism, one of the most versatile DP mechanisms. This approach is based on
determining a certain supermartingale for the hockey-stick divergence and on
extending the R\'enyi divergence-based fully adaptive composition results by
Feldman and Zrnic. We also consider measuring the individual

algorithm for performing trajectory optimization with constraints on a set of
trajectories in parallel. We frame constrained trajectory optimization as a
novel form of constrained functional minimization over trajectory

objective and allows us to generate diverse sets of constraint-satisfying
trajectories. Our method uses Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) to find
a set of particles that approximates a distribution over low-cost trajectories
while obeying constraints. CSVTO is applicable to problems with arbitrary
equality and inequality constraints and includes a novel particle resampling
step to escape local minima. By explicitly generating diverse sets of
trajectories, CSVTO is better able to avoid poor local minima and is more
robust to initialization. We demonstrate that CSVTO outperforms baselines in
challenging highly-constrained tasks, such as a 7DoF wrench manipulation task,
where CSVTO succeeds in 20/20 trials vs 13/20 for the closest baseline. Our

Transformers-based large language models (LLMs) have gradually replaced CNNs

Compared with the data that exists relatively independently such as images,
videos or texts, graph is a type of data that contains rich structural and
relational information. Meanwhile, natural language, as one of the most
expressive mediums, excels in describing complex structures. However, existing
work on incorporating graph learning problems into the generative language
modeling framework remains very limited. As the importance of large language
models continues to grow, it becomes essential to explore whether LLMs can also
replace GNNs as the foundation model for graphs. In this paper, we propose
InstructGLM (Instruction-finetuned Graph Language Model), systematically design
highly scalable prompts based on natural language instructions, and use natural
language to describe the geometric structure and node features of the graph for
instruction tuning an LLM to perform learning and inference on graphs in a

have rapidly driven up the compute capacity demand for datacenter GPUs. Several
cloud providers and other enterprises have made substantial plans of growth in
their datacenters to support these new workloads. One of the key bottleneck
resources in datacenters is power, and given the increasing model sizes of
LLMs, they are becoming increasingly power intensive. In this paper, we show
that there is a significant opportunity to oversubscribe power in LLM clusters.
Power oversubscription improves the power efficiency of these datacenters,
allowing more deployable servers per datacenter, and reduces the deployment
time, since building new datacenters is slow.

We extensively characterize the power consumption patterns of a variety of
LLMs and their configurations. We identify the differences between the
inference and training power consumption patterns. Based on our analysis of
these LLMs, we claim that the average and peak power utilization in LLM
clusters for inference should not be very high. Our deductions align with the
data from production LLM clusters, revealing that inference workloads offer
substantial headroom for power oversubscription. However, the stringent set of
telemetry and controls that GPUs offer in a virtualized environment, makes it
challenging to have a reliable and robust power oversubscription mechanism.

We propose POLCA, our framework for power oversubscription that is robust,
reliable, and readily deployable for GPU clusters. Using open-source models to
replicate the power patterns observed in production, we simulate POLCA and
demonstrate that we can deploy 30% more servers in the same GPU cluster for
inference, with minimal performance loss]]></summary>

dimensionality reduction in an unsupervised way. Recently, they have been used
for the task of anomaly detection in the visual domain. By optimizing for the
reconstruction error using anomaly-free examples, the common belief is that a
corresponding network should fail to accurately reconstruct anomalous regions
in the application phase. This goal is typically addressed by controlling the
capacity of the network, either by reducing the size of the bottleneck layer or
by enforcing sparsity constraints on the activations. However, neither of these
techniques does explicitly penalize reconstruction of anomalous signals often
resulting in poor detection. We tackle this problem by adapting a
self-supervised learning regime that allows the use of discriminative
information during training but focuses on the data manifold of normal
examples. We emphasize that inference with our approach is very efficient
during training and prediction requiring a single forward pass for each input
image. Our experiments on the MVTec AD dataset demonstrate high detection and
localization performance. On the texture-subset, in particular, our approach
consistently outperforms recent anomaly detection methods by a significant

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper highlights the need to bring document classification benchmarking
closer to real-world applications, both in the nature of data tested ($X$:
multi-channel, multi-paged, multi-industry; $Y$: class distributions and label
set variety) and in classification tasks considered ($f$: multi-page document,
page stream, and document bundle classification, ...). We identify the lack of
public multi-page document classification datasets, formalize different
classification tasks arising in application scenarios, and motivate the value
of targeting efficient multi-page document representations. An experimental
study on proposed multi-page document classification datasets demonstrates that
current benchmarks have become irrelevant and need to be updated to evaluate
complete documents, as they naturally occur in practice. This reality check
also calls for more mature evaluation methodologies, covering calibration
evaluation, inference complexity (time-memory), and a range of realistic
distribution shifts (e.g., born-digital vs. scanning noise, shifting page
order). Our study ends on a hopeful note by recommending concrete avenues for
future improvements.}]]></summary>

models, which can find exact solutions to many discrete inference problems,
even with infinite support and continuous priors. To express such models, we
introduce a probabilistic programming language that supports discrete and

branching, and conditioning on events. Our key tool is probability generating
functions: they provide a compact closed-form representation of distributions

posterior probabilities, expectation, variance, and higher moments. Our
inference method is provably correct, fully automated and uses automatic

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multimedia recommendation involves personalized ranking tasks, where
multimedia content is usually represented using a generic encoder. However,
these generic representations introduce spurious correlations that fail to
reveal users' true preferences. Existing works attempt to alleviate this
problem by learning invariant representations, but overlook the balance between
independent and identically distributed (IID) and out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization. In this paper, we propose a framework called Pareto Invariant
Representation Learning (PaInvRL) to mitigate the impact of spurious
correlations from an IID-OOD multi-objective optimization perspective, by
learning invariant representations (intrinsic factors that attract user
attention) and variant representations (other factors) simultaneously.
Specifically, PaInvRL includes three iteratively executed modules: (i)
heterogeneous identification module, which identifies the heterogeneous
environments to reflect distributional shifts for user-item interactions; (ii)
invariant mask generation module, which learns invariant masks based on the
Pareto-optimal solutions that minimize the adaptive weighted Invariant Risk
Minimization (IRM) and Empirical Risk (ERM) losses; (iii) convert module, which
generates both variant representations and item-invariant representations for
training a multi-modal recommendation model that mitigates spurious
correlations and balances the generalization performance within and cross the
environmental distributions. We compare the proposed PaInvRL with
state-of-the-art recommendation models on three public multimedia
recommendation datasets (Movielens, Tiktok, and Kwai), and the experimental
results validate the effectiveness of PaInvRL for both within- and
cross-environmental learning.]]></summary>

of diminished clarity, muted colors, and reduced details. Low-light image
enhancement, an essential task in computer vision, aims to rectify these issues
by improving brightness, contrast, and overall perceptual quality, thereby
facilitating accurate analysis and interpretation. This paper introduces the
Convolutional Dense Attention-guided Network (CDAN), a novel solution for

with convolutional and dense blocks, complemented by an attention mechanism and
skip connections. This architecture ensures efficient information propagation

color balance and contrast. Our approach demonstrates notable progress compared
to state-of-the-art results in low-light image enhancement, showcasing its
robustness across a wide range of challenging scenarios. Our model performs
remarkably on benchmark datasets, effectively mitigating under-exposure and

experimental tool and a convenient development framework. In this library, we
have reproduced 65 spatial-temporal prediction models and collected 55
spatial-temporal datasets, allowing researchers to conduct comprehensive

to validate the effectiveness of different models and components, and we

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fast adversarial training (FAT) is beneficial for improving the adversarial
robustness of neural networks. However, previous FAT work has encountered a
significant issue known as catastrophic overfitting when dealing with large
perturbation budgets, \ie the adversarial robustness of models declines to near
zero during training.

To address this, we analyze the training process of prior FAT work and
observe that catastrophic overfitting is accompanied by the appearance of loss
convergence outliers.

Therefore, we argue a moderately smooth loss convergence process will be a
stable FAT process that solves catastrophic overfitting.

To obtain a smooth loss convergence process, we propose a novel oscillatory
constraint (dubbed ConvergeSmooth) to limit the loss difference between
adjacent epochs. The convergence stride of ConvergeSmooth is introduced to
balance convergence and smoothing. Likewise, we design weight centralization
without introducing additional hyperparameters other than the loss balance
coefficient.

Our proposed methods are attack-agnostic and thus can improve the training
stability of various FAT techniques.

Extensive experiments on popular datasets show that the proposed methods
efficiently avoid catastrophic overfitting and outperform all previous FAT
methods. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/FAT-CS/ConvergeSmooth}.]]></summary>

more comprehensive perspective that goes beyond the traditional guidance

generate higher quality samples with a moderate guidance scale. Improving upon
this, Self-Attention Guidance (SAG) uses the intermediate self-attention maps
of diffusion models to enhance their stability and efficacy. Specifically, SAG
adversarially blurs only the regions that diffusion models attend to at each

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep learning has achieved impressive performance in many domains, such as
computer vision and natural language processing, but its advantage over
classical shallow methods on tabular datasets remains questionable. It is
especially challenging to surpass the performance of tree-like ensembles, such
as XGBoost or Random Forests, on small-sized datasets (less than 1k samples).
To tackle this challenge, we introduce HyperTab, a hypernetwork-based approach
to solving small sample problems on tabular datasets. By combining the
advantages of Random Forests and neural networks, HyperTab generates an
ensemble of neural networks, where each target model is specialized to process
a specific lower-dimensional view of the data. Since each view plays the role
of data augmentation, we virtually increase the number of training samples
while keeping the number of trainable parameters unchanged, which prevents
model overfitting. We evaluated HyperTab on more than 40 tabular datasets of a
varying number of samples and domains of origin, and compared its performance
with shallow and deep learning models representing the current
state-of-the-art. We show that HyperTab consistently outranks other methods on
small data (with a statistically significant difference) and scores comparable
to them on larger datasets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assessing the robustness of deep neural networks against out-of-distribution
inputs is crucial, especially in safety-critical domains like autonomous
driving, but also in safety systems where malicious actors can digitally alter
inputs to circumvent safety guards. However, designing effective
out-of-distribution tests that encompass all possible scenarios while
preserving accurate label information is a challenging task. Existing
methodologies often entail a compromise between variety and constraint levels
for attacks and sometimes even both. In a first step towards a more holistic
robustness evaluation of image classification models, we introduce an attack
method based on image solarization that is conceptually straightforward yet
avoids jeopardizing the global structure of natural images independent of the
intensity. Through comprehensive evaluations of multiple ImageNet models, we
demonstrate the attack's capacity to degrade accuracy significantly, provided
it is not integrated into the training augmentations. Interestingly, even then,
no full immunity to accuracy deterioration is achieved. In other settings, the
attack can often be simplified into a black-box attack with model-independent
parameters. Defenses against other corruptions do not consistently extend to be
effective against our specific attack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Conformal prediction is a statistical tool for producing prediction regions
of machine learning models that are valid with high probability. However,
applying conformal prediction to time series data leads to conservative
prediction regions. In fact, to obtain prediction regions over $T$ time steps
with confidence $1-\delta$, {previous works require that each individual
prediction region is valid} with confidence $1-\delta/T$. We propose an
optimization-based method for reducing this conservatism to enable long horizon
planning and verification when using learning-enabled time series predictors.
Instead of considering prediction errors individually at each time step, we
consider a parameterized prediction error over multiple time steps. By
optimizing the parameters over an additional dataset, we find prediction
regions that are not conservative. We show that this problem can be cast as a
mixed integer linear complementarity program (MILCP), which we then relax into
a linear complementarity program (LCP). Additionally, we prove that the relaxed
LP has the same optimal cost as the original MILCP. Finally, we demonstrate the
efficacy of our method on case studies using pedestrian trajectory predictors
and F16 fighter jet altitude predictors.]]></summary>

hospital, which admits critically ill patients and provides continuous
monitoring and treatment. Various patient outcome prediction methods have been
attempted to assist healthcare professionals in clinical decision-making.
Existing methods focus on measuring the similarity between patients using deep
neural networks to capture the hidden feature structures. However, the
higher-order relationships are ignored, such as patient characteristics (e.g.,
diagnosis codes) and their causal effects on downstream clinical predictions.

In this paper, we propose a novel Hypergraph Convolutional Network that
allows the representation of non-pairwise relationships among diagnosis codes
in a hypergraph to capture the hidden feature structures so that fine-grained
patient similarity can be calculated for personalized mortality risk
prediction. Evaluation using a publicly available eICU Collaborative Research

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep learning-based surrogate models have been widely applied in geological
carbon storage (GCS) problems to accelerate the prediction of reservoir
pressure and CO2 plume migration. Large amounts of data from physics-based
numerical simulators are required to train a model to accurately predict the
complex physical behaviors associated with this process. In practice, the
available training data are always limited in large-scale 3D problems due to
the high computational cost. Therefore, we propose to use a multi-fidelity
Fourier Neural Operator to solve large-scale GCS problems with more affordable
multi-fidelity training datasets. The Fourier Neural Operator has a desirable
grid-invariant property, which simplifies the transfer learning procedure
between datasets with different discretization. We first test the model
efficacy on a GCS reservoir model being discretized into 110k grid cells. The
multi-fidelity model can predict with accuracy comparable to a high-fidelity
model trained with the same amount of high-fidelity data with 81% less data
generation costs. We further test the generalizability of the multi-fidelity
model on a same reservoir model with a finer discretization of 1 million grid
cells. This case was made more challenging by employing high-fidelity and
low-fidelity datasets generated by different geostatistical models and
reservoir simulators. We observe that the multi-fidelity FNO model can predict
pressure fields with reasonable accuracy even when the high-fidelity data are
extremely limited.]]></summary>

due to their ability to accurately learn very complex input-output relations.
Despite their accuracy and extensive use, DNNs are highly susceptible to
adversarial attacks due to limited generalizability. For future progress in the
field, it is essential to build DNNs that are robust to any kind of
perturbations to the data points. In the past, many techniques have been
proposed to robustify DNNs using first-order derivative information of the
network.

This paper proposes a new robustification approach based on control theory. A
neural network architecture that incorporates feedback control, named Feedback
Neural Networks, is proposed. The controller is itself a neural network, which
is trained using regular and adversarial data such as to stabilize the system
outputs. The novel adversarial training approach based on the feedback control
architecture is called Feedback Looped Adversarial Training (FLAT). Numerical
results on standard test problems empirically show that our FLAT method is more
effective than the state-of-the-art to guard against adversarial attacks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The wide application of deep neural networks (DNNs) demands an increasing
amount of attention to their real-world robustness, i.e., whether a DNN resists
black-box adversarial attacks, among which score-based query attacks (SQAs) are
most threatening since they can effectively hurt a victim network with the only
access to model outputs. Defending against SQAs requires a slight but artful
variation of outputs due to the service purpose for users, who share the same
output information with SQAs. In this paper, we propose a real-world defense by
Unifying Gradients (UniG) of different data so that SQAs could only probe a
much weaker attack direction that is similar for different samples. Since such
universal attack perturbations have been validated as less aggressive than the
input-specific perturbations, UniG protects real-world DNNs by indicating
attackers a twisted and less informative attack direction. We implement UniG
efficiently by a Hadamard product module which is plug-and-play. According to
extensive experiments on 5 SQAs, 2 adaptive attacks and 7 defense baselines,
UniG significantly improves real-world robustness without hurting clean
accuracy on CIFAR10 and ImageNet. For instance, UniG maintains a model of
77.80% accuracy under 2500-query Square attack while the state-of-the-art
adversarially-trained model only has 67.34% on CIFAR10. Simultaneously, UniG
outperforms all compared baselines in terms of clean accuracy and achieves the
smallest modification of the model output. The code is released at

imaging and demonstrate that this makes it possible to robustly address
reactive inverse problems incorporating Uncertainty Quantification (UQ).
Pore-scale modeling of reactive flow offers a valuable opportunity to
investigate the evolution of macro-scale properties subject to dynamic
processes. Yet, they suffer from imaging limitations arising from the
associated X-ray microtomography (X-ray microCT) process, which induces
discrepancies in the properties estimates. Assessment of the kinetic parameters
also raises challenges, as reactive coefficients are critical parameters that
can cover a wide range of values. We account for these two issues and ensure
reliable calibration of pore-scale modeling, based on dynamical microCT images,
by integrating uncertainty quantification in the workflow.

The present method is based on a multitasking formulation of reactive inverse
problems combining data-driven and physics-informed techniques in calcite
dissolution. This allows quantifying morphological uncertainties on the
porosity field and estimating reactive parameter ranges through prescribed PDE
models with a latent concentration field and dynamical microCT. The data
assimilation strategy relies on sequential reinforcement incorporating
successively additional PDE constraints. We guarantee robust and unbiased
uncertainty quantification by straightforward adaptive weighting of Bayesian
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (BPINNs), ensuring reliable micro-porosity
changes during geochemical transformations. We demonstrate successful Bayesian
Inference in 1D+Time and 2D+Time calcite dissolution based on synthetic microCT
images with meaningful posterior distribution on the reactive parameters and
dimensionless numbers.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Motivated by the manifold hypothesis, which states that data with a high
extrinsic dimension may yet have a low intrinsic dimension, we develop refined
statistical bounds for entropic optimal transport that are sensitive to the
intrinsic dimension of the data. Our bounds involve a robust notion of
intrinsic dimension, measured at only a single distance scale depending on the
regularization parameter, and show that it is only the minimum of these
single-scale intrinsic dimensions which governs the rate of convergence. We
call this the Minimum Intrinsic Dimension scaling (MID scaling) phenomenon, and
establish MID scaling with no assumptions on the data distributions so long as
the cost is bounded and Lipschitz, and for various entropic optimal transport
quantities beyond just values, with stronger analogs when one distribution is
supported on a manifold. Our results significantly advance the theoretical
state of the art by showing that MID scaling is a generic phenomenon, and
provide the first rigorous interpretation of the statistical effect of entropic
regularization as a distance scale.]]></summary>

machine learning model without sharing their data; rather, they train their own
model locally and send updates to a central server for aggregation. Depending
on how the data is distributed among the participants, FL can be classified
into Horizontal (HFL) and Vertical (VFL). In VFL, the participants share the
same set of training instances but only host a different and non-overlapping
subset of the whole feature space. Whereas in HFL, each participant shares the
same set of features while the training set is split into locally owned
training data subsets.

VFL is increasingly used in applications like financial fraud detection;
nonetheless, very little work has analyzed its security. In this paper, we
focus on robustness in VFL, in particular, on backdoor attacks, whereby an
adversary attempts to manipulate the aggregate model during the training
process to trigger misclassifications. Performing backdoor attacks in VFL is
more challenging than in HFL, as the adversary i) does not have access to the
labels during training and ii) cannot change the labels as she only has access
to the feature embeddings. We present a first-of-its-kind clean-label backdoor
attack in VFL, which consists of two phases: a label inference and a backdoor
phase. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack on three different
datasets, investigate the factors involved in its success, and discuss
countermeasures to mitigate its impact.]]></summary>

plays a crucial role in the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and management of
cardiovascular diseases. Recently, the widespread adoption of ambulatory BP
measurement devices has been driven predominantly by the increased prevalence
of hypertension and its associated risks and clinical conditions. Recent
guidelines advocate for regular BP monitoring as part of regular clinical
visits or even at home. This increased utilization of BP measurement
technologies has brought up significant concerns, regarding the accuracy of
reported BP values across settings.

In this survey, focusing mainly on cuff-based BP monitoring technologies, we
highlight how BP measurements can demonstrate substantial biases and variances
due to factors such as measurement and device errors, demographics, and body
habitus. With these inherent biases, the development of a new generation of
cuff-based BP devices which use artificial-intelligence (AI) has significant
potential. We present future avenues where AI-assisted technologies can
leverage the extensive clinical literature on BP-related studies together with
the large collections of BP records available in electronic health records.
These resources can be combined with machine learning approaches, including
deep learning and Bayesian inference, to remove BP measurement biases and to
provide individualized BP-related cardiovascular risk indexes.]]></summary>

business critical applications. Training such recommendation models efficiently
is challenging because they contain billions of embedding-based parameters,
leading to significant overheads from embedding access. By profiling existing
systems for DLRM training, we observe that around 75\% of the iteration time is
spent on embedding access and model synchronization. Our key insight in this
paper is that embedding access has a specific structure which can be used to
accelerate training. We observe that embedding accesses are heavily skewed,
with around 1\% of embeddings representing more than 92\% of total accesses.
Further, we observe that during offline training we can lookahead at future
batches to determine exactly which embeddings will be needed at what iteration
in the future. Based on these insights, we develop Bagpipe, a system for
training deep recommendation models that uses caching and prefetching to
overlap remote embedding accesses with the computation. We design an Oracle
Cacher, a new component that uses a lookahead algorithm to generate optimal
cache update decisions while providing strong consistency guarantees against
staleness. We also design a logically replicated, physically partitioned cache
and show that our design can reduce synchronization overheads in a distributed
setting. Finally, we propose a disaggregated system architecture and show that
our design can enable low-overhead fault tolerance. Our experiments using three
datasets and four models show that Bagpipe provides a speed up of up to 5.6x
compared to state of the art baselines, while providing the same convergence
and reproducibility guarantees as synchronous training.]]></summary>

reach target poses of characters by making use of phases variables learned by a
Periodic Autoencoder. Our approach utilizes a mixture-of-experts neural network
model, in which the phases cluster movements in both space and time with
different expert weights. Each generated set of weights then produces a
sequence of poses in an autoregressive manner between the current and target
state of the character. In addition, to satisfy poses which are manually
modified by the animators or where certain end effectors serve as constraints
to be reached by the animation, a learned bi-directional control scheme is
implemented to satisfy such constraints. The results demonstrate that using
phases for motion in-betweening tasks sharpen the interpolated movements, and
furthermore stabilizes the learning process. Moreover, using phases for motion
in-betweening tasks can also synthesize more challenging movements beyond
locomotion behaviors. Additionally, style control is enabled between given
target keyframes. Our proposed framework can compete with popular
state-of-the-art methods for motion in-betweening in terms of motion quality
and generalization, especially in the existence of long transition durations.
Our framework contributes to faster prototyping workflows for creating animated
character sequences, which is of enormous interest for the game and film
industry.]]></summary>

job interview, or a public benefit. Standard techniques to build these models
use features about people but overlook their actionability. In turn, models can
assign predictions that are fixed, meaning that consumers who are denied loans,
interviews, or benefits may be permanently locked out from access to credit,
employment, or assistance. In this work, we introduce a formal testing
procedure to flag models that assign fixed predictions that we call recourse
verification. We develop machinery to reliably determine if a given model can
provide recourse to its decision subjects from a set of user-specified
actionability constraints. We demonstrate how our tools can ensure recourse and
adversarial robustness in real-world datasets and use them to study the
infeasibility of recourse in real-world lending datasets. Our results highlight
how models can inadvertently assign fixed predictions that permanently bar

high-stakes domains demands transparency and scrutiny of their fairness and
reliability. To help gauge machine learning models' robustness, research
typically focuses on the massive datasets used for their deployment, e.g.,
creating and maintaining documentation for understanding their origin, process
of development, and ethical considerations. However, data collection for AI is
still typically a one-off practice, and oftentimes datasets collected for a
certain purpose or application are reused for a different problem.
Additionally, dataset annotations may not be representative over time, contain
ambiguous or erroneous annotations, or be unable to generalize across issues or
domains. Recent research has shown these practices might lead to unfair,
biased, or inaccurate outcomes. We argue that data collection for AI should be
performed in a responsible manner where the quality of the data is thoroughly
scrutinized and measured through a systematic set of appropriate metrics. In
this paper, we propose a Responsible AI (RAI) methodology designed to guide the
data collection with a set of metrics for an iterative in-depth analysis of the
factors influencing the quality and reliability} of the generated data. We
propose a granular set of measurements to inform on the internal reliability of
a dataset and its external stability over time. We validate our approach across
nine existing datasets and annotation tasks and four content modalities. This
approach impacts the assessment of data robustness used for AI applied in the

deals with fairness and accountability aspects in data collection by providing

determine the lithology of the formations surrounding the borehole and the
location and reserves of subsurface oil and gas reservoirs. However, important
logs are often missing in horizontal or old wells, which poses a challenge in
field applications. In this paper, we utilize data from the 2020 machine
learning competition of the SPWLA, which aims to predict the missing
compressional wave slowness and shear wave slowness logs using other logs in
the same borehole. We employ the NGBoost algorithm to construct an Ensemble
Learning model that can predicate the results as well as their uncertainty.
Furthermore, we combine the SHAP method to investigate the interpretability of
the machine learning model. We compare the performance of the NGBosst model
with four other commonly used Ensemble Learning methods, including Random
Forest, GBDT, XGBoost, LightGBM. The results show that the NGBoost model
performs well in the testing set and can provide a probability distribution for
the prediction results. In addition, the variance of the probability
distribution of the predicted log can be used to justify the quality of the
constructed log. Using the SHAP explainable machine learning model, we
calculate the importance of each input log to the predicted results as well as
the coupling relationship among input logs. Our findings reveal that the
NGBoost model tends to provide greater slowness prediction results when the
neutron porosity and gamma ray are large, which is consistent with the
cognition of petrophysical models. Furthermore, the machine learning model can
capture the influence of the changing borehole caliper on slowness, where the
influence of borehole caliper on slowness is complex and not easy to establish
a direct relationship. These findings are in line with the physical principle
of borehole acoustics.]]></summary>

learning tasks. Yet, they suffer from security-related issues such as
adversarial examples and poisoning (backdoor) attacks. A deep learning model
may be poisoned by training with backdoored data or by modifying inner network
parameters. Then, a backdoored model performs as expected when receiving a
clean input, but it misclassifies when receiving a backdoored input stamped
with a pre-designed pattern called "trigger". Unfortunately, it is difficult to
distinguish between clean and backdoored models without prior knowledge of the
trigger. This paper proposes a backdoor detection method by utilizing a special
type of adversarial attack, universal adversarial perturbation (UAP), and its
similarities with a backdoor trigger. We observe an intuitive phenomenon: UAPs
generated from backdoored models need fewer perturbations to mislead the model
than UAPs from clean models. UAPs of backdoored models tend to exploit the
shortcut from all classes to the target class, built by the backdoor trigger.
We propose a novel method called Universal Soldier for Backdoor detection (USB)
and reverse engineering potential backdoor triggers via UAPs. Experiments on
345 models trained on several datasets show that USB effectively detects the
injected backdoor and provides comparable or better results than

proximity correction (OPC) has emerged as a crucial resolution enhancement
technology for ensuring high printability in the lithography process. Recently,
level set-based inverse lithography technology (ILT) has drawn considerable
attention as a promising OPC solution, showcasing its powerful pattern
fidelity, especially in advanced process. However, massive computational time
consumption of ILT limits its applicability to mainly correcting partial layers
and hotspot regions. Deep learning (DL) methods have shown great potential in
accelerating ILT. However, lack of domain knowledge of inverse lithography
limits the ability of DL-based algorithms in process window (PW) enhancement
and etc. In this paper, we propose an inverse lithography physics-informed deep
neural level set (ILDLS) approach for mask optimization. This approach utilizes
level set based-ILT as a layer within the DL framework and iteratively conducts
mask prediction and correction to significantly enhance printability and PW in
comparison with results from pure DL and ILT. With this approach, computation
time is reduced by a few orders of magnitude versus ILT. By gearing up DL with
knowledge of inverse lithography physics, ILDLS provides a new and efficient
mask optimization solution.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NPN classification has many applications in the synthesis and verification of
digital circuits. The canonical-form-based method is the most common approach,
designing a canonical form as representative for the NPN equivalence class
first and then computing the transformation function according to the canonical
form. Most works use variable symmetries and several signatures, mainly based
on the cofactor, to simplify the canonical form construction and computation.
This paper describes a novel canonical form and its computation algorithm by
introducing Boolean influence to NPN classification, which is a basic concept
in analysis of Boolean functions. We show that influence is
input-negation-independent, input-permutation-dependent, and has other
structural information than previous signatures for NPN classification.
Therefore, it is a significant ingredient in speeding up NPN classification.
Experimental results prove that influence plays an important role in reducing
the transformation enumeration in computing the canonical form. Compared with
the state-of-the-art algorithm implemented in ABC, our influence-aided
canonical form for exact NPN classification gains up to 5.5x speedup.]]></summary>

operator. One of the effective approaches is to offer some attractive incentive
or additional services or money to the subscribers for keeping them engaged and
make sure they stay in the operator's network for longer time. Often, operators
allocate certain amount of monetary budget to carry out the offer campaign. The
difficult part of this campaign is the selection of a set of customers from a
large subscriber-base and deciding the amount that should be offered to an
individual so that operator's objective is achieved. There may be multiple
objectives (e.g., maximizing revenue, minimizing number of churns) for
selection of subscriber and selection of an offer to the selected subscriber.
Apart from monetary benefit, offers may include additional data, SMS, hots-spot
tethering, and many more. This problem is known as offer optimization. In this
paper, we propose a novel combinatorial algorithm for solving offer
optimization under heterogeneous offers by maximizing expected revenue under
the scenario of subscriber churn, which is, in general, seen in telecom domain.
The proposed algorithm is efficient and accurate even for a very large
subscriber-base.]]></summary>

statistics, which requires recurrent communication between neurons.
Mechanistically, such recurrent communication is often indirect and mediated by
local interneurons. In this work, we explore the computational benefits of
mediating recurrent communication via interneurons compared with direct
recurrent connections. To this end, we consider two mathematically tractable
recurrent linear neural networks that statistically whiten their inputs -- one
with direct recurrent connections and the other with interneurons that mediate
recurrent communication. By analyzing the corresponding continuous synaptic
dynamics and numerically simulating the networks, we show that the network with
interneurons is more robust to initialization than the network with direct
recurrent connections in the sense that the convergence time for the synaptic
dynamics in the network with interneurons (resp. direct recurrent connections)
scales logarithmically (resp. linearly) with the spectrum of their
initialization. Our results suggest that interneurons are computationally
useful for rapid adaptation to changing input statistics. Interestingly, the
network with interneurons is an overparameterized solution of the whitening
objective for the network with direct recurrent connections, so our results can
be viewed as a recurrent linear neural network analogue of the implicit
acceleration phenomenon observed in overparameterized feedforward linear neural
networks.]]></summary>

view synthesis. However, existing methods require expensive per-scene
optimization from many views hence limiting their application to real-world
unbounded urban settings where the objects of interest or backgrounds are
observed from very few views. To mitigate this challenge, we introduce a new
approach called NeO 360, Neural fields for sparse view synthesis of outdoor
scenes. NeO 360 is a generalizable method that reconstructs 360{\deg} scenes
from a single or a few posed RGB images. The essence of our approach is in
capturing the distribution of complex real-world outdoor 3D scenes and using a
hybrid image-conditional triplanar representation that can be queried from any
world point. Our representation combines the best of both voxel-based and
bird's-eye-view (BEV) representations and is more effective and expressive than
each. NeO 360's representation allows us to learn from a large collection of
unbounded 3D scenes while offering generalizability to new views and novel
scenes from as few as a single image during inference. We demonstrate our
approach on the proposed challenging 360{\deg} unbounded dataset, called NeRDS
360, and show that NeO 360 outperforms state-of-the-art generalizable methods
for novel view synthesis while also offering editing and composition
capabilities. Project page:

leads to data missing not at random and poses a great challenge for unbiased
evaluation and learning of prediction models. Currently, the doubly robust (DR)
methods have been widely studied and demonstrate superior performance. However,
in this paper, we show that DR methods are unstable and have unbounded bias,
variance, and generalization bounds to extremely small propensities. Moreover,
the fact that DR relies more on extrapolation will lead to suboptimal
performance. To address the above limitations while retaining double
robustness, we propose a stabilized doubly robust (StableDR) learning approach
with a weaker reliance on extrapolation. Theoretical analysis shows that
StableDR has bounded bias, variance, and generalization error bound
simultaneously under inaccurate imputed errors and arbitrarily small
propensities. In addition, we propose a novel learning approach for StableDR
that updates the imputation, propensity, and prediction models cyclically,
achieving more stable and accurate predictions. Extensive experiments show that
our approaches significantly outperform the existing methods.]]></summary>

diagnostic errors, reduce radiologist workload, and accelerate diagnosis.
Training such deep learning models requires large and accurate datasets, with
annotations for all training samples. However, in the medical imaging domain,
annotated datasets for specific tasks are often small due to the high
complexity of annotations, limited access, or the rarity of diseases. To
address this challenge, deep learning models can be pre-trained on large image
datasets without annotations using methods from the field of self-supervised
learning. After pre-training, small annotated datasets are sufficient to
fine-tune the models for a specific task. The most popular self-supervised
pre-training approaches in medical imaging are based on contrastive learning.
However, recent studies in natural image processing indicate a strong potential
for masked autoencoder approaches. Our work compares state-of-the-art
contrastive learning methods with the recently introduced masked autoencoder
approach "SparK" for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on medical images.
Therefore we pre-train on a large unannotated CT image dataset and fine-tune on
several CT classification tasks. Due to the challenge of obtaining sufficient
annotated training data in medical imaging, it is of particular interest to
evaluate how the self-supervised pre-training methods perform when fine-tuning
on small datasets. By experimenting with gradually reducing the training
dataset size for fine-tuning, we find that the reduction has different effects
depending on the type of pre-training chosen. The SparK pre-training method is
more robust to the training dataset size than the contrastive methods. Based on
our results, we propose the SparK pre-training for medical imaging tasks with
only small annotated datasets.]]></summary>

mechanism called easy attention. Due to the fact that self attention only makes

keys, queries and softmax are not necessary for obtaining the attention score
required to capture long-term dependencies in temporal sequences. Through
implementing singular-value decomposition (SVD) on the softmax attention score,
we further observe that the self attention compresses contribution from both
queries and keys in the spanned space of the attention score. Therefore, our
proposed easy-attention method directly treats the attention scores as
learnable parameters. This approach produces excellent results when
reconstructing and predicting the temporal dynamics of chaotic systems
exhibiting more robustness and less complexity than the self attention or the
widely-used long short-term memory (LSTM) network. Our results show great

proposes a comprehensive scheduling model that utilizes a multi-agent deep
reinforcement learning algorithm to learn load characteristics of different
communities and make decisions based on this knowledge. In this model, the
scheduling problem of the integrated energy system is transformed into a Markov
decision process and solved using a data-driven deep reinforcement learning
algorithm, which avoids the need for modeling complex energy coupling
relationships between multi-communities and multi-energy subsystems. The
simulation results show that the proposed method effectively captures the load
characteristics of different communities and utilizes their complementary
features to coordinate reasonable energy interactions among them. This leads to
a reduction in wind curtailment rate from 16.3% to 0% and lowers the overall
operating cost by 5445.6 Yuan, demonstrating significant economic and
environmental benefits.]]></summary>

unstructured data including language, image, audio, and video. However, a
prevalent real-world scenario involves the combination of structured data types
(tabular, time-series) with unstructured data which has so far been
understudied. To bridge this gap, we propose LANISTR, an attention-based
framework to learn from LANguage, Image, and STRuctured data. The core of
LANISTR's methodology is rooted in \textit{masking-based} training applied
across both unimodal and multimodal levels. In particular, we introduce a new
similarity-based multimodal masking loss that enables it to learn cross-modal
relations from large-scale multimodal data with missing modalities. On two
real-world datastes, MIMIC-IV (healthcare) and Amazon Product Review (retail),
LANISTR demonstrates remarkable absolute improvements of 6.6\% (AUROC) and up
to 14\% (accuracy) when fine-tuned on 0.1\% and 0.01\% of labeled data,
respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art alternatives. Notably, these
improvements are observed even in the presence of considerable missingness
ratios of 35.7\% and 99.8\%, in the respective datasets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most existing classical artificial neural networks (ANN) are designed as a
tree structure to imitate neural networks. In this paper, we argue that the
connectivity of a tree is not sufficient to characterize a neural network. The
nodes of the same level of a tree cannot be connected with each other, i.e.,
these neural unit cannot share information with each other, which is a major
drawback of ANN. Although ANN has been significantly improved in recent years
to more complex structures, such as the directed acyclic graph (DAG), these
methods also have unidirectional and acyclic bias for ANN. In this paper, we
propose a method to build a bidirectional complete graph for the nodes in the
same level of an ANN, which yokes the nodes of the same level to formulate a
neural module. We call our model as YNN in short. YNN promotes the information
transfer significantly which obviously helps in improving the performance of
the method. Our YNN can imitate neural networks much better compared with the
traditional ANN. In this paper, we analyze the existing structural bias of ANN
and propose a model YNN to efficiently eliminate such structural bias. In our
model, nodes also carry out aggregation and transformation of features, and
edges determine the flow of information. We further impose auxiliary sparsity
constraint to the distribution of connectedness, which promotes the learned
structure to focus on critical connections. Finally, based on the optimized
structure, we also design small neural module structure based on the minimum
cut technique to reduce the computational burden of the YNN model. This
learning process is compatible with the existing networks and different tasks.
The obtained quantitative experimental results reflect that the learned
connectivity is superior to the traditional NN structure.]]></summary>

extensive task and environment variability, leading to skills that can

learning over graphs. Despite their popularity, scaling GNNs either by
deepening or widening suffers from prevalent issues of unhealthy gradients,
over-smoothening, information squashing, which often lead to sub-standard
performance. In this work, we are interested in exploring a principled way to
scale GNNs capacity without deepening or widening, which can improve its
performance across multiple small and large graphs. Motivated by the recent
intriguing phenomenon of model soups, which suggest that fine-tuned weights of
multiple large-language pre-trained models can be merged to a better minima, we
argue to exploit the fundamentals of model soups to mitigate the aforementioned
issues of memory bottleneck and trainability during GNNs scaling. More
specifically, we propose not to deepen or widen current GNNs, but instead
present a data-centric perspective of model soups tailored for GNNs, i.e., to
build powerful GNNs. By dividing giant graph data, we build multiple
independently and parallelly trained weaker GNNs (soup ingredient) without any
intermediate communication, and combine their strength using a greedy
interpolation soup procedure to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Compared
to concurrent distributed GNN training works such as Jiong et. al. 2023, we
train each soup ingredient by sampling different subgraphs per epoch and their
respective sub-models are merged only after being fully trained (rather than
intermediately so). Moreover, we provide a wide variety of model soup
preparation techniques by leveraging state-of-the-art graph sampling and graph
partitioning approaches that can handle large graphs. Codes are available at:

log-based anomaly detection. This approach aims to extract meaning from log
events (log message templates) and develop advanced DL models for anomaly
detection. However, these DL methods face challenges like heavy reliance on
training data, labels, and computational resources due to model complexity. In
contrast, traditional machine learning and data mining techniques are less
data-dependent and more efficient but less effective than DL. To make log-based
anomaly detection more practical, the goal is to enhance traditional techniques
to match DL's effectiveness. Previous research in a different domain (linking
questions on Stack Overflow) suggests that optimized traditional techniques can
rival state-of-the-art DL methods. Drawing inspiration from this concept, we
conducted an empirical study. We optimized the unsupervised PCA (Principal
Component Analysis), a traditional technique, by incorporating lightweight
semantic-based log representation. This addresses the issue of unseen log
events in training data, enhancing log representation. Our study compared seven
log-based anomaly detection methods, including four DL-based, two traditional,
and the optimized PCA technique, using public and industrial datasets. Results
indicate that the optimized unsupervised PCA technique achieves similar

more stable with limited training data and resource-efficient. This

productions like Netflix and Facebook. As with most data-driven systems, DRL
systems can exhibit undesirable behaviors due to environmental drifts, which
often occur in constantly-changing production settings. Continual Learning (CL)
is the inherent self-healing approach for adapting the DRL agent in response to
the environment's conditions shifts. However, successive shifts of considerable
magnitude may cause the production environment to drift from its original
state. Recent studies have shown that these environmental drifts tend to drive
CL into long, or even unsuccessful, healing cycles, which arise from
inefficiencies such as catastrophic forgetting, warm-starting failure, and slow
convergence. In this paper, we propose Dr. DRL, an effective self-healing
approach for DRL systems that integrates a novel mechanism of intentional
forgetting into vanilla CL to overcome its main issues. Dr. DRL deliberately
erases the DRL system's minor behaviors to systematically prioritize the
adaptation of the key problem-solving skills. Using well-established DRL
algorithms, Dr. DRL is compared with vanilla CL on various drifted
environments. Dr. DRL is able to reduce, on average, the healing time and
fine-tuning episodes by, respectively, 18.74% and 17.72%. Dr. DRL successfully
helps agents to adapt to 19.63% of drifted environments left unsolved by
vanilla CL while maintaining and even enhancing by up to 45% the obtained

markets, with broad applications such as pricing American and Bermudan options.
The deep BSDE method [Han, Jentzen and E, PNAS, 115(34):8505-8510, 2018] has
shown great power in solving high-dimensional forward-backward stochastic
differential equations (FBSDEs), and inspired many applications. However, the
method solves backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) in a forward
manner, which can not be used for optimal stopping problems that in general
require running BSDE backwardly. To overcome this difficulty, a recent paper
[Wang, Chen, Sudjianto, Liu and Shen, arXiv:1807.06622, 2018] proposed the
backward deep BSDE method to solve the optimal stopping problem. In this paper,
we provide the rigorous theory for the backward deep BSDE method. Specifically,
1. We derive the a posteriori error estimation, i.e., the error of the
numerical solution can be bounded by the training loss function; and; 2. We
give an upper bound of the loss function, which can be sufficiently small
subject to universal approximations. We give two numerical examples, which

for diagnosing hematological diseases. Due to constantly evolving clinical
settings, data sources, and disease classifications, it is necessary to update
machine learning classification models regularly for practical real-world use.
Such models significantly benefit from sequentially learning from incoming data
streams without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. However, models can
suffer from catastrophic forgetting, causing a drop in performance on previous
tasks when fine-tuned on new data. Here, we propose a rehearsal-based continual
learning approach for class incremental and domain incremental scenarios in
white blood cell classification. To choose representative samples from previous
tasks, we employ exemplar set selection based on the model's predictions. This
involves selecting the most confident samples and the most challenging samples
identified through uncertainty estimation of the model. We thoroughly evaluated
our proposed approach on three white blood cell classification datasets that
differ in color, resolution, and class composition, including scenarios where
new domains or new classes are introduced to the model with every task. We also
test a long class incremental experiment with both new domains and new classes.
Our results demonstrate that our approach outperforms established baselines in
continual learning, including existing iCaRL and EWC methods for classifying
white blood cells in cross-domain environments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Variational Information Pursuit (V-IP) is a framework for making
interpretable predictions by design by sequentially selecting a short chain of
task-relevant, user-defined and interpretable queries about the data that are
most informative for the task. While this allows for built-in interpretability
in predictive models, applying V-IP to any task requires data samples with
dense concept-labeling by domain experts, limiting the application of V-IP to
small-scale tasks where manual data annotation is feasible. In this work, we
extend the V-IP framework with Foundational Models (FMs) to address this
limitation. More specifically, we use a two-step process, by first leveraging
Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate a sufficiently large candidate set of
task-relevant interpretable concepts, then using Large Multimodal Models to
annotate each data sample by semantic similarity with each concept in the
generated concept set. While other interpretable-by-design frameworks such as
Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) require an additional step of removing
repetitive and non-discriminative concepts to have good interpretability and
test performance, we mathematically and empirically justify that, with a
sufficiently informative and task-relevant query (concept) set, the proposed
FM+V-IP method does not require any type of concept filtering. In addition, we
show that FM+V-IP with LLM generated concepts can achieve better test
performance than V-IP with human annotated concepts, demonstrating the
effectiveness of LLMs at generating efficient query sets. Finally, when
compared to other interpretable-by-design frameworks such as CBMs, FM+V-IP can
achieve competitive test performance using fewer number of concepts/queries in
both cases with filtered or unfiltered concept sets.]]></summary>

dysregulated biochemical mechanisms and cancer subtypes. Omics-based cancer
subtyping has emerged as a revolutionary approach, as different level of omics
records the biochemical products of multistep processes in cancers. This paper
focuses on fully exploiting the potential of multi-omics data to improve cancer
subtyping outcomes, and hence developed MoCLIM, a representation learning
framework. MoCLIM independently extracts the informative features from distinct
omics modalities. Using a unified representation informed by contrastive
learning of different omics modalities, we can well-cluster the subtypes, given
cancer, into a lower latent space. This contrast can be interpreted as a
projection of inter-omics inference observed in biological networks.
Experimental results on six cancer datasets demonstrate that our approach

clients to construct a global model. While FL enables learning a model with
data privacy, it often suffers from significant performance degradation when
client data distributions are heterogeneous. Many previous FL algorithms have
addressed this issue by introducing various proximal restrictions. These
restrictions aim to encourage global alignment by constraining the deviation of
local learning from the global objective. However, they inherently limit local
learning by interfering with the original local objectives. Recently, an
alternative approach has emerged to improve local learning generality. By
obtaining local models within a smooth loss landscape, this approach mitigates
conflicts among different local objectives of the clients. Yet, it does not
ensure stable global alignment, as local learning does not take the global
objective into account. In this study, we propose Federated Stability on
Learning (FedSoL), which combines both the concepts of global alignment and
local generality. In FedSoL, the local learning seeks a parameter region robust
against proximal perturbations. This strategy introduces an implicit proximal
restriction effect in local learning while maintaining the original local
objective for parameter update. Our experiments show that FedSoL consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance on various setups.]]></summary>

generative model: GANs and VAEs. Unlike a common unlearning task where an

models. As the target feature is only presented in a local region of an image,
unlearning the entire image from the pre-trained model may result in losing
other details in the remaining region of the image. To specify which features
to unlearn, we collect randomly generated images that contain the target
features. We then identify a latent representation corresponding to the target
feature and then use the representation to fine-tune the pre-trained model.
Through experiments on MNIST and CelebA datasets, we show that target features
are successfully removed while keeping the fidelity of the original models.

This paper presents a novel and practical end-to-end unsupervised TSAD when the
training data are contaminated with anomalies. The introduced approach, called
TSAD-C, is devoid of access to abnormality labels during the training phase.
TSAD-C encompasses three modules: a Decontaminator to rectify the abnormalities
(aka noise) present in the training data, a Variable Dependency Modeling module
to capture both long-term intra- and inter-variable dependencies within the
decontaminated data that can be considered as a surrogate of the pure normal
data, and an Anomaly Scoring module to detect anomalies. Our extensive

namely an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) equipped with a controllable arm with
two degrees of freedom to carry out actuation tasks on the fly. Our solution is
based on employing a Q-learning method to control the trajectory of the tip of
the arm, also called \textit{end-effector}. More specifically, we develop a
motion planning model based on Time To Collision (TTC), which enables a
quadrotor UAV to navigate around obstacles while ensuring the manipulator's
reachability. Additionally, we utilize a model-based Q-learning model to
independently track and control the desired trajectory of the manipulator's
end-effector, given an arbitrary baseline trajectory for the UAV platform. Such
a combination enables a variety of actuation tasks such as high-altitude
welding, structural monitoring and repair, battery replacement, gutter
cleaning, sky scrapper cleaning, and power line maintenance in hard-to-reach
and risky environments while retaining compatibility with flight control
firmware. Our RL-based control mechanism results in a robust control strategy
that can handle uncertainties in the motion of the UAV, offering promising
performance. Specifically, our method achieves 92\% accuracy in terms of
average displacement error (i.e. the mean distance between the target and
obtained trajectory points) using Q-learning with 15,000 episodes]]></summary>

the collaborative data analysis of multiple users with privacy concerns and
limited communication capability. The commonly adopted compression schemes
introduce information loss into local data while improving communication
efficiency, and it remains an open problem whether such discrete-valued
mechanisms provide any privacy protection. In this paper, we study the local
differential privacy guarantees of discrete-valued mechanisms with finite
output space through the lens of $f$-differential privacy (DP). More
specifically, we advance the existing literature by deriving tight $f$-DP
guarantees for a variety of discrete-valued mechanisms, including the binomial
noise and the binomial mechanisms that are proposed for privacy preservation,
and the sign-based methods that are proposed for data compression, in
closed-form expressions. We further investigate the amplification in privacy by
sparsification and propose a ternary stochastic compressor. By leveraging
compression for privacy amplification, we improve the existing methods by
removing the dependency of accuracy (in terms of mean square error) on
communication cost in the popular use case of distributed mean estimation,
therefore breaking the three-way tradeoff between privacy, communication, and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, foundation models have exhibited remarkable advancements in
multi-modal learning. These models, equipped with millions (or billions) of
parameters, typically require a substantial amount of data for finetuning.
However, collecting and centralizing training data from diverse sectors becomes
challenging due to distinct privacy regulations. Federated Learning (FL)
emerges as a promising solution, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively
train neural networks without centralizing their local data. To alleviate
client computation burdens and communication overheads, previous works have
adapted Parameter-efficient Finetuning (PEFT) methods for FL. Hereby, only a
small fraction of the model parameters are optimized and communicated during
federated communications. Nevertheless, most previous works have focused on a
single modality and neglected one common phenomenon, i.e., the presence of data
heterogeneity across the clients. Therefore, in this work, we propose a
finetuning framework tailored to heterogeneous multi-modal FL, called Federated
Dual-Aadapter Teacher (FedDAT). Specifically, our approach leverages a
Dual-Adapter Teacher (DAT) to address data heterogeneity by regularizing the
client local updates and applying Mutual Knowledge Distillation (MKD) for an
efficient knowledge transfer. FedDAT is the first approach that enables an
efficient distributed finetuning of foundation models for a variety of
heterogeneous Vision-Language tasks. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we
conduct extensive experiments on four multi-modality FL benchmarks with
different types of data heterogeneity, where FedDAT substantially outperforms
the existing centralized PEFT methods adapted for FL.]]></summary>

ensuring a satisfactory level of service for passengers. However, current
routing solutions rely on traditional operational research heuristics, which
can be time-consuming to implement and lack the ability to provide quick

decision support system that enables public transport (PT) planners to identify
short-term route improvements rapidly. By seamlessly adjusting specific
sections of routes between two stops during specific times of the day, our
method effectively reduces times and enhances PT services. Leveraging diverse
data sources such as GTFS and smart card data, we extract features and model
the transportation network as a directed graph. Using self-supervision, we
train a deep learning model for predicting lateness values for road segments.

These lateness values are then utilized as edge weights in the transportation
graph, enabling efficient path searching. Through evaluating the method on Tel
Aviv, we are able to reduce times on more than 9\% of the routes. The improved
routes included both intraurban and suburban routes showcasing a fact

correlated phenomena, such as temperature and precipitation. Existing
approaches to this problem typically use discrete optimization methods, which

the sensor placement problem in correlated environments by reducing it to a
regression problem that can be efficiently solved using sparse Gaussian
processes (SGPs). Our approach can handle both discrete sensor placement
problems-where sensors are limited to a subset of a given set of locations-and
continuous sensor placement problems-where sensors can be placed anywhere in a
bounded continuous region. We further generalize our approach to handle sensors
with a non-point field of view and integrated observations. Our experimental
results on three real-world datasets show that our approach generates sensor
placements that result in reconstruction quality that is consistently on par or
better than the prior state-of-the-art approach while being significantly

cross-frame distribution in dynamic cardiac positron emission tomography (PET)
raise significant challenges for inter-frame motion correction, particularly
for the early frames where conventional intensity-based image registration
techniques are not applicable. Alternatively, a promising approach utilizes
generative methods to handle the tracer distribution changes to assist existing
registration methods. To improve frame-wise registration and parametric
quantification, we propose a Temporally and Anatomically Informed Generative
Adversarial Network (TAI-GAN) to transform the early frames into the late
reference frame using an all-to-one mapping. Specifically, a feature-wise
linear modulation layer encodes channel-wise parameters generated from temporal
tracer kinetics information, and rough cardiac segmentations with local shifts
serve as the anatomical information. We validated our proposed method on a
clinical $^{82}$Rb PET dataset and found that our TAI-GAN can produce converted
early frames with high image quality, comparable to the real reference frames.
After TAI-GAN conversion, motion estimation accuracy and clinical myocardial
blood flow (MBF) quantification were improved compared to using the original

rendered in arbitrary perspectives to produce images. Although previous methods
produce realistic images, they suffer from unstable training or degenerate
solutions where the 3D geometry is unnatural. We hypothesize that the 3D
geometry is underdetermined due to the insufficient constraint, i.e., being
classified as real image to the discriminator is not enough. To solve this
problem, we propose to approximate the background as a spherical surface and
represent a scene as a union of the foreground placed in the sphere and the
thin spherical background. It reduces the degree of freedom in the background
field. Accordingly, we modify the volume rendering equation and incorporate
dedicated constraints to design a novel 3D-aware GAN framework named BallGAN.
BallGAN has multiple advantages as follows. 1) It produces more reasonable 3D
geometry; the images of a scene across different viewpoints have better
photometric consistency and fidelity than the state-of-the-art methods. 2) The
training becomes much more stable. 3) The foreground can be separately rendered
on top of different arbitrary backgrounds.]]></summary>

analyzed stochastic optimization with delayed gradients. However, as far as we

that has gained recent popularity due to applications in adversarial
robustness, game theory, and reinforcement learning. Motivated by this gap, we
examine the performance of standard min-max optimization algorithms with
delayed gradient updates. First, we show (empirically) that even small delays
can cause prominent algorithms like Extra-gradient (\texttt{EG}) to diverge on
simple instances for which \texttt{EG} guarantees convergence in the absence of
delays. Our empirical study thus suggests the need for a careful analysis of
delayed versions of min-max optimization algorithms. Accordingly, under
suitable technical assumptions, we prove that Gradient Descent-Ascent

convergence to saddle points for convex-concave and strongly convex-strongly

solutions available in computer graphics literature. Existing cloth simulators
produce realistic cloth deformations that obey different types of boundary
conditions. Nevertheless, their operational principle remains limited in
several ways: They operate on explicit surface representations with a fixed
spatial resolution, perform a series of discretised updates (which bounds their
temporal resolution), and require comparably large amounts of storage.
Moreover, back-propagating gradients through the existing solvers is often not
straightforward, which poses additional challenges when integrating them into
modern neural architectures. In response to the limitations mentioned above,
this paper takes a fundamentally different perspective on physically-plausible
cloth simulation and re-thinks this long-standing problem: We propose
NeuralClothSim, i.e., a new cloth simulation approach using thin shells, in
which surface evolution is encoded in neural network weights. Our
memory-efficient and differentiable solver operates on a new continuous
coordinate-based representation of dynamic surfaces, i.e., neural deformation
fields (NDFs); it supervises NDF evolution with the rules of the non-linear
Kirchhoff-Love shell theory. NDFs are adaptive in the sense that they 1)
allocate their capacity to the deformation details as the latter arise during
the cloth evolution and 2) allow surface state queries at arbitrary spatial and
temporal resolutions without retraining. We show how to train our
NeuralClothSim solver while imposing hard boundary conditions and demonstrate
multiple applications, such as material interpolation and simulation editing.
The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our formulation and its
potential impact.]]></summary>

online social networks (OSNs), often for political, ideological, or financial
gain, has affected the openness of OSNs. While researchers from various
disciplines have investigated different manipulation-triggering elements of
OSNs (such as understanding information diffusion on OSNs or detecting
automated behavior of accounts), these works have not been consolidated to
present a comprehensive overview of the interconnections among these elements.
Notably, user psychology, the prevalence of bots, and their tactics in relation
to false information detection have been overlooked in previous research. To
address this research gap, this paper synthesizes insights from various

By integrating the primary elements of social media manipulation (SMM),

we identify commonalities, highlight existing gaps, and extract valuable

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) is a viable approach to enhance a
player's experience in video games. Recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL)
methods have been employed for DDA in non-competitive games; nevertheless, they
rely solely on discrete state-action space with a small search space. In this
paper, we propose a continuous RL-based DDA methodology for a visual working
memory (VWM) game to handle the complex search space for the difficulty of
memorization. The proposed RL-based DDA tailors game difficulty based on the
player's score and game difficulty in the last trial. We defined a continuous
metric for the difficulty of memorization. Then, we consider the task
difficulty and the vector of difficulty-score as the RL's action and state,
respectively. We evaluated the proposed method through a within-subject
experiment involving 52 subjects. The proposed approach was compared with two
rule-based difficulty adjustment methods in terms of player's score and game
experience measured by a questionnaire. The proposed RL-based approach resulted
in a significantly better game experience in terms of competence, tension, and
negative and positive affect. Players also achieved higher scores and win
rates. Furthermore, the proposed RL-based DDA led to a significantly less
decline in the score in a 20-trial session.]]></summary>

performances by mobile devices has become commonplace. However, these
recordings often suffer from degradation such as noise and reverberation, which

pristine high-quality music, has surged to augment the auditory experience. To
address this issue, we propose a music enhancement system based on the
Conformer architecture that has demonstrated outstanding performance in speech
enhancement tasks. Our approach explores the attention mechanisms of the
Conformer and examines their performance to discover the best approach for the
music enhancement task. Our experimental results show that our proposed model

Furthermore, our system can perform general music enhancement with multi-track

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Handling entirely unknown data is a challenge for any deployed classifier.
Classification models are typically trained on a static pre-defined dataset and
are kept in the dark for the open unassigned feature space. As a result, they
struggle to deal with out-of-distribution data during inference. Addressing
this task on the class-level is termed open-set recognition (OSR). However,
most OSR methods are inherently limited, as they train closed-set classifiers
and only adapt the downstream predictions to OSR. This work presents LORD, a
framework to Leverage Open-set Recognition by exploiting unknown Data. LORD
explicitly models open space during classifier training and provides a
systematic evaluation for such approaches. We identify three model-agnostic
training strategies that exploit background data and applied them to
well-established classifiers. Due to LORD's extensive evaluation protocol, we
consistently demonstrate improved recognition of unknown data. The benchmarks
facilitate in-depth analysis across various requirement levels. To mitigate
dependency on extensive and costly background datasets, we explore mixup as an
off-the-shelf data generation technique. Our experiments highlight mixup's
effectiveness as a substitute for background datasets. Lightweight constraints
on mixup synthesis further improve OSR performance.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper reports on the GENEA Challenge 2023, in which participating teams
built speech-driven gesture-generation systems using the same speech and motion
dataset, followed by a joint evaluation. This year's challenge provided data on
both sides of a dyadic interaction, allowing teams to generate full-body motion
for an agent given its speech (text and audio) and the speech and motion of the
interlocutor. We evaluated 12 submissions and 2 baselines together with
held-out motion-capture data in several large-scale user studies. The studies
focused on three aspects: 1) the human-likeness of the motion, 2) the
appropriateness of the motion for the agent's own speech whilst controlling for
the human-likeness of the motion, and 3) the appropriateness of the motion for
the behaviour of the interlocutor in the interaction, using a setup that
controls for both the human-likeness of the motion and the agent's own speech.
We found a large span in human-likeness between challenge submissions, with a
few systems rated close to human mocap. Appropriateness seems far from being
solved, with most submissions performing in a narrow range slightly above
chance, far behind natural motion. The effect of the interlocutor is even more
subtle, with submitted systems at best performing barely above chance.
Interestingly, a dyadic system being highly appropriate for agent speech does
not necessarily imply high appropriateness for the interlocutor. Additional

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNNs have been widely applied for medical image analysis. However, limited
memory capacity is one of the most common drawbacks of processing
high-resolution 3D volumetric data. 3D volumes are usually cropped or downsized
first before processing, which can result in a loss of resolution, increase
class imbalance, and affect the performance of the segmentation algorithms. In
this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning approach called IP-UNet.
IP-UNet is a UNet-based model that performs multi-class segmentation on
Intensity Projection (IP) of 3D volumetric data instead of the memory-consuming
3D volumes. IP-UNet uses limited memory capability for training without losing
the original 3D image resolution. We compare the performance of three models in
terms of segmentation accuracy and computational cost: 1) Slice-by-slice 2D
segmentation of the CT scan images using a conventional 2D UNet model. 2)
IP-UNet that operates on data obtained by merging the extracted Maximum
Intensity Projection (MIP), Closest Vessel Projection (CVP), and Average
Intensity Projection (AvgIP) representations of the source 3D volumes, then
applying the UNet model on the output IP images. 3) 3D-UNet model directly
reads the 3D volumes constructed from a series of CT scan images and outputs
the 3D volume of the predicted segmentation. We test the performance of these
methods on 3D volumetric images for automatic breast calcification detection.
Experimental results show that IP-Unet can achieve similar segmentation
accuracy with 3D-Unet but with much better performance. It reduces the training
time by 70\% and memory consumption by 92\%.]]></summary>

study the brain's structural connectivity in domains such as neurological
disorders, neurosurgery, and aging. In this study, we present FIESTA (FIbEr
Segmentation in Tractography using Autoencoders), a reliable and robust, fully
automated, and easily semi-automatically calibrated pipeline based on deep
autoencoders that can dissect and fully populate white matter bundles. This
pipeline is built upon previous works that demonstrated how autoencoders can be
used successfully for streamline filtering, bundle segmentation, and streamline
generation in tractography. Our proposed method improves bundle segmentation
coverage by recovering hard-to-track bundles with generative sampling through
the latent space seeding of the subject bundle and the atlas bundle. A latent
space of streamlines is learned using autoencoder-based modeling combined with
contrastive learning. Using an atlas of bundles in standard space (MNI), our
proposed method segments new tractograms using the autoencoder latent distance
between each tractogram streamline and its closest neighbor bundle in the atlas
of bundles. Intra-subject bundle reliability is improved by recovering
hard-to-track streamlines, using the autoencoder to generate new streamlines
that increase the spatial coverage of each bundle while remaining anatomically
correct. Results show that our method is more reliable than state-of-the-art
automated virtual dissection methods such as RecoBundles, RecoBundlesX,
TractSeg, White Matter Analysis and XTRACT. Our framework allows for the
transition from one anatomical bundle definition to another with marginal
calibration efforts. Overall, these results show that our framework improves

cleared by the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), many studies have shown
inconsistent generalization or latent bias, particularly for underrepresented
populations. Some have proposed that generative AI could reduce the need for
real data, but its utility in model development remains unclear. Skin disease
serves as a useful case study in synthetic image generation due to the
diversity of disease appearance, particularly across the protected attribute of
skin tone. Here we show that latent diffusion models can scalably generate
images of skin disease and that augmenting model training with these data
improves performance in data-limited settings. These performance gains saturate
at synthetic-to-real image ratios above 10:1 and are substantially smaller than
the gains obtained from adding real images. As part of our analysis, we
generate and analyze a new dataset of 458,920 synthetic images produced using
several generation strategies. Our results suggest that synthetic data could

matching necessary and sufficient conditions for their PAC learnability, along
with corresponding sample complexity bounds, in the setting where the learner
is given access only to prepared quantum states. We first probe the results
from previous works on this setting. We show that the empirical risk defined in
previous works and matching the definition in the classical theory fails to
satisfy the uniform convergence property enjoyed in the classical setting for
some learnable classes. Moreover, we show that VC dimension generalization
upper bounds in previous work are frequently infinite, even for
finite-dimensional POVM classes. To surmount the failure of the standard ERM to
satisfy uniform convergence, we define a new learning rule -- denoised ERM. We
show this to be a universal learning rule for POVM and probabilistically
observed concept classes, and the condition for it to satisfy uniform
convergence is finite fat shattering dimension of the class. We give
quantitative sample complexity upper and lower bounds for learnability in terms
of finite fat-shattering dimension and a notion of approximate finite
partitionability into approximately jointly measurable subsets, which allow for
sample reuse. We then show that finite fat shattering dimension implies finite
coverability by approximately jointly measurable subsets, leading to our
matching conditions. We also show that every measurement class defined on a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Common explanations for shortcut learning assume that the shortcut improves
prediction under the training distribution but not in the test distribution.
Thus, models trained via the typical gradient-based optimization of
cross-entropy, which we call default-ERM, utilize the shortcut. However, even
when the stable feature determines the label in the training distribution and
the shortcut does not provide any additional information, like in perception
tasks, default-ERM still exhibits shortcut learning. Why are such solutions
preferred when the loss for default-ERM can be driven to zero using the stable
feature alone? By studying a linear perception task, we show that default-ERM's
preference for maximizing the margin leads to models that depend more on the
shortcut than the stable feature, even without overparameterization. This
insight suggests that default-ERM's implicit inductive bias towards max-margin
is unsuitable for perception tasks. Instead, we develop an inductive bias
toward uniform margins and show that this bias guarantees dependence only on
the perfect stable feature in the linear perception task. We develop loss
functions that encourage uniform-margin solutions, called margin control
(MARG-CTRL). MARG-CTRL mitigates shortcut learning on a variety of vision and
language tasks, showing that better inductive biases can remove the need for
expensive two-stage shortcut-mitigating methods in perception tasks.]]></summary>

high-dimensional Hamiltonian systems using data-driven quadratic manifolds.
Classical symplectic model reduction approaches employ linear symplectic
subspaces for representing the high-dimensional system states in a
reduced-dimensional coordinate system. While these approximations respect the
symplectic nature of Hamiltonian systems, linear basis approximations can
suffer from slowly decaying Kolmogorov $N$-width, especially in wave-type
problems, which then requires a large basis size. We propose two different
model reduction methods based on recently developed quadratic manifolds, each
presenting its own advantages and limitations. The addition of quadratic terms
to the state approximation, which sits at the heart of the proposed
methodologies, enables us to better represent intrinsic low-dimensionality in
the problem at hand. Both approaches are effective for issuing predictions in
settings well outside the range of their training data while providing more
accurate solutions than the linear symplectic reduced-order models.]]></summary>

reinforcement learning, has shown significant potential in achieving
human-level autonomy in a wide range of domains, including robotics, computer
vision, and computer games. This potential justifies the enthusiasm and growing
interest in DRL in both academia and industry. However, the community currently
focuses mostly on the development phase of DRL systems, with little attention
devoted to DRL deployment. In this paper, we propose an empirical study on
Stack Overflow (SO), the most popular Q&A forum for developers, to uncover and
understand the challenges practitioners faced when deploying DRL systems.
Specifically, we categorized relevant SO posts by deployment platforms:
server/cloud, mobile/embedded system, browser, and game engine. After filtering
and manual analysis, we examined 357 SO posts about DRL deployment,
investigated the current state, and identified the challenges related to
deploying DRL systems. Then, we investigate the prevalence and difficulty of
these challenges. Results show that the general interest in DRL deployment is
growing, confirming the study's relevance and importance. Results also show
that DRL deployment is more difficult than other DRL issues. Additionally, we
built a taxonomy of 31 unique challenges in deploying DRL to different
platforms. On all platforms, RL environment-related challenges are the most
popular, and communication-related challenges are the most difficult among
practitioners. We hope our study inspires future research and helps the
community overcome the most common and difficult challenges practitioners face
when deploying DRL systems.]]></summary>

across a wide range of scientific disciplines, such as medicine, sociology,
political science, and economics, to name a few. However, in increasing
instances, especially given the proliferation of big data, gender information
is not readily available. In such cases researchers need to infer gender from
readily available information, primarily from persons' names. While inferring
gender from name may raise some ethical questions, the lack of viable
alternatives means that researchers have to resort to such approaches when the
goal justifies the means - in the majority of such studies the goal is to
examine patterns and determinants of gender disparities. The necessity of
name-to-gender inference has generated an ever-growing domain of algorithmic
approaches and software products. These approaches have been used throughout
the world in academia, industry, governmental and non-governmental
organizations. Nevertheless, the existing approaches have yet to be
systematically evaluated and compared, making it challenging to determine the
optimal approach for future research. In this work, we conducted a large scale
performance evaluation of existing approaches for name-to-gender inference.
Analysis are performed using a variety of large annotated datasets of names. We
further propose two new hybrid approaches that achieve better performance than
any single existing approach.]]></summary>

ensures numerical efficiency, improves the interpretability of models (due to
the smaller number of relevant features), and robustness. In machine learning
approaches based on linear models, it is well known that there exists a
connecting path between the sparsest solution in terms of the $\ell^1$ norm
(i.e., zero weights) and the non-regularized solution, which is called the
regularization path. Very recently, there was a first attempt to extend the
concept of regularization paths to DNNs by means of treating the empirical loss
and sparsity ($\ell^1$ norm) as two conflicting criteria and solving the
resulting multiobjective optimization problem. However, due to the
non-smoothness of the $\ell^1$ norm and the high number of parameters, this
approach is not very efficient from a computational perspective. To overcome
this limitation, we present an algorithm that allows for the approximation of
the entire Pareto front for the above-mentioned objectives in a very efficient
manner. We present numerical examples using both deterministic and stochastic
gradients. We furthermore demonstrate that knowledge of the regularization path
allows for a well-generalizing network parametrization.]]></summary>

shift. In this paper, we introduce the Match-And-Deform (MAD) approach that
aims at finding correspondences between the source and target time series while
allowing temporal distortions. The associated optimization problem
simultaneously aligns the series thanks to an optimal transport loss and the
time stamps through dynamic time warping. When embedded into a deep neural
network, MAD helps learning new representations of time series that both align
the domains and maximize the discriminative power of the network. Empirical
studies on benchmark datasets and remote sensing data demonstrate that MAD
makes meaningful sample-to-sample pairing and time shift estimation, reaching

further apply segmentation-guided data selection to obtain high-quality pseudo

prevalent in large-scale online platforms that capture and monitor diverse data
types. Several distinct challenges surface when modelling low-count time
series, particularly low signal-to-noise ratios (when anomaly signatures are
provably undetectable), and non-uniform performance (when average metrics are
not representative of local behaviour). The time series anomaly detection
community currently lacks explicit tooling and processes to model and reliably
detect anomalies in these settings. We address this gap by introducing a novel
generative procedure for creating benchmark datasets comprising of low-count
time series with anomalous segments. Via a mixture of theoretical and empirical
analysis, our work explains how widely-used algorithms struggle with the
distribution overlap between normal and anomalous segments. In order to
mitigate this shortcoming, we then leverage our findings to demonstrate how
anomaly score smoothing consistently improves performance. The practical
utility of our analysis and recommendation is validated on a real-world dataset

preserve privacy can serve as an alternative to real EHRs for machine learning
(ML) modeling and statistical analysis. However, generating high-fidelity and
granular electronic health record (EHR) data in its original,
highly-dimensional form poses challenges for existing methods due to the
complexities inherent in high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose
Hierarchical Autoregressive Language mOdel (HALO) for generating longitudinal
high-dimensional EHR, which preserve the statistical properties of real EHR and
can be used to train accurate ML models without privacy concerns. Our HALO
method, designed as a hierarchical autoregressive model, generates a
probability density function of medical codes, clinical visits, and patient
records, allowing for the generation of realistic EHR data in its original,
unaggregated form without the need for variable selection or aggregation.
Additionally, our model also produces high-quality continuous variables in a
longitudinal and probabilistic manner. We conducted extensive experiments and
demonstrate that HALO can generate high-fidelity EHR data with high-dimensional
disease code probabilities (d > 10,000), disease co-occurrence probabilities
within visits (d > 1,000,000), and conditional probabilities across consecutive
visits (d > 5,000,000) and achieve above 0.9 R2 correlation in comparison to
real EHR data. This performance then enables downstream ML models trained on
its synthetic data to achieve comparable accuracy to models trained on real
data (0.938 AUROC with HALO data vs. 0.943 with real data). Finally, using a
combination of real and synthetic data enhances the accuracy of ML models
beyond that achieved by using only real EHR data.]]></summary>

irregular topology poses challenges in applying them to existing neural network
architectures. Recent advances in mesh neural networks turn to remeshing and
push the boundary of pioneer methods that solely take the raw meshes as input.
Although the remeshing offers a regular topology that significantly facilitates
the design of mesh network architectures, features extracted from such remeshed
proxies may struggle to retain the underlying geometry faithfully, limiting the
subsequent neural network's capacity. To address this issue, we propose
SieveNet, a novel paradigm that takes into account both the regular topology
and the exact geometry. Specifically, this method utilizes structured mesh
topology from remeshing and accurate geometric information from
distortion-aware point sampling on the surface of the original mesh.
Furthermore, our method eliminates the need for hand-crafted feature
engineering and can leverage off-the-shelf network architectures such as the
vision transformer. Comprehensive experimental results on classification and
segmentation tasks well demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our

better to regions of phase space with little data. We propose to use
Schroedinger Bridges and diffusion models to create SBUnfold, an unfolding
approach that combines the strengths of both discriminative and generative

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The wide application of deep neural networks (DNNs) demands an increasing
amount of attention to their real-world robustness, i.e., whether a DNN resists
black-box adversarial attacks, among which score-based query attacks (SQAs) are
most threatening since they can effectively hurt a victim network with the only
access to model outputs. Defending against SQAs requires a slight but artful
variation of outputs due to the service purpose for users, who share the same
output information with SQAs. In this paper, we propose a real-world defense by
Unifying Gradients (UniG) of different data so that SQAs could only probe a
much weaker attack direction that is similar for different samples. Since such
universal attack perturbations have been validated as less aggressive than the
input-specific perturbations, UniG protects real-world DNNs by indicating
attackers a twisted and less informative attack direction. We implement UniG
efficiently by a Hadamard product module which is plug-and-play. According to
extensive experiments on 5 SQAs, 2 adaptive attacks and 7 defense baselines,
UniG significantly improves real-world robustness without hurting clean
accuracy on CIFAR10 and ImageNet. For instance, UniG maintains a model of
77.80% accuracy under 2500-query Square attack while the state-of-the-art
adversarially-trained model only has 67.34% on CIFAR10. Simultaneously, UniG
outperforms all compared baselines in terms of clean accuracy and achieves the
smallest modification of the model output. The code is released at
https://github.com/snowien/UniG-pytorch.]]></summary>

carbon storage (GCS) problems to accelerate the prediction of reservoir
pressure and CO2 plume migration. Large amounts of data from physics-based
numerical simulators are required to train a model to accurately predict the
complex physical behaviors associated with this process. In practice, the
available training data are always limited in large-scale 3D problems due to
the high computational cost. Therefore, we propose to use a multi-fidelity
Fourier Neural Operator to solve large-scale GCS problems with more affordable
multi-fidelity training datasets. The Fourier Neural Operator has a desirable
grid-invariant property, which simplifies the transfer learning procedure
between datasets with different discretization. We first test the model
efficacy on a GCS reservoir model being discretized into 110k grid cells. The
multi-fidelity model can predict with accuracy comparable to a high-fidelity
model trained with the same amount of high-fidelity data with 81% less data
generation costs. We further test the generalizability of the multi-fidelity
model on a same reservoir model with a finer discretization of 1 million grid
cells. This case was made more challenging by employing high-fidelity and
low-fidelity datasets generated by different geostatistical models and
reservoir simulators. We observe that the multi-fidelity FNO model can predict
pressure fields with reasonable accuracy even when the high-fidelity data are
extremely limited.]]></summary>

operator. One of the effective approaches is to offer some attractive incentive
or additional services or money to the subscribers for keeping them engaged and
make sure they stay in the operator's network for longer time. Often, operators
allocate certain amount of monetary budget to carry out the offer campaign. The
difficult part of this campaign is the selection of a set of customers from a
large subscriber-base and deciding the amount that should be offered to an
individual so that operator's objective is achieved. There may be multiple
objectives (e.g., maximizing revenue, minimizing number of churns) for
selection of subscriber and selection of an offer to the selected subscriber.
Apart from monetary benefit, offers may include additional data, SMS, hots-spot
tethering, and many more. This problem is known as offer optimization. In this
paper, we propose a novel combinatorial algorithm for solving offer
optimization under heterogeneous offers by maximizing expected revenue under
the scenario of subscriber churn, which is, in general, seen in telecom domain.
The proposed algorithm is efficient and accurate even for a very large

and discretizing in amplitude. Subsequent signal reconstructions inevitably
incur an error that depends on the amplitude resolution and the temporal
density of the acquired samples. From an implementation viewpoint, consistent
signal reconstruction methods have proven a profitable error-rate decay as the
sampling rate increases. Despite that, these results are obtained under offline
settings. Therefore, a research gap exists regarding methods for consistent
signal reconstruction from data streams. This paper presents a method that
consistently reconstructs streamed multivariate time series of quantization
intervals under a zero-delay response requirement. On the other hand, previous
work has shown that the temporal dependencies within univariate time series can
be exploited to reduce the roughness of zero-delay signal reconstructions. This
work shows that the spatiotemporal dependencies within multivariate time series
can also be exploited to achieve improved results. Specifically, the
spatiotemporal dependencies of the multivariate time series are learned, with
the assistance of a recurrent neural network, to reduce the roughness of the
signal reconstruction on average while ensuring consistency. Our experiments
show that our proposed method achieves a favorable error-rate decay with the
sampling rate compared to a similar but non-consistent reconstruction.]]></summary>

However, NNs are prone to yield unreliable predictions when encountering
completely new situations without indicating their uncertainty. Bayesian
variants of NNs (BNNs), such as Monte Carlo (MC) dropout BNNs, do provide
uncertainty measures and simultaneously increase the prediction performance.
The only disadvantage of BNNs is their higher computation time during test time
because they rely on a sampling approach. Here we present a single-shot MC
dropout approximation that preserves the advantages of BNNs while being as fast
as NNs. Our approach is based on moment propagation (MP) and allows to
analytically approximate the expected value and the variance of the MC dropout
signal for commonly used layers in NNs, i.e. convolution, max pooling, dense,
softmax, and dropout layers. The MP approach can convert an NN into a BNN
without re-training given the NN has been trained with standard dropout. We
evaluate our approach on different benchmark datasets and a simulated toy
example in a classification and regression setting. We demonstrate that our
single-shot MC dropout approximation resembles the point estimate and the
uncertainty estimate of the predictive distribution that is achieved with an MC
approach, while being fast enough for real-time deployments of BNNs. We show
that using part of the saved time to combine our MP approach with deep ensemble
techniques does further improve the uncertainty measures.]]></summary>

systems. In multi-task learning, related tasks provide information to each
other and improve overall performance, but the label cost can vary among tasks.
How should the label budget (i.e. the amount of money spent on labeling) be
allocated among different tasks to achieve optimal multi-task performance? We
are the first to propose and formally define the label budget allocation
problem in multi-task learning and to empirically show that different budget
allocation strategies make a big difference to its performance. We propose a
Task-Adaptive Budget Allocation algorithm to robustly generate the optimal
budget allocation adaptive to different multi-task learning settings.
Specifically, we estimate and then maximize the extent of new information
obtained from the allocated budget as a proxy for multi-task learning
performance. Experiments on PASCAL VOC and Taskonomy demonstrate the efficacy
of our approach over other widely used heuristic labeling strategies.]]></summary>

matching necessary and sufficient conditions for their PAC learnability, along
with corresponding sample complexity bounds, in the setting where the learner
is given access only to prepared quantum states. We first probe the results
from previous works on this setting. We show that the empirical risk defined in
previous works and matching the definition in the classical theory fails to
satisfy the uniform convergence property enjoyed in the classical setting for
some learnable classes. Moreover, we show that VC dimension generalization
upper bounds in previous work are frequently infinite, even for
finite-dimensional POVM classes. To surmount the failure of the standard ERM to
satisfy uniform convergence, we define a new learning rule -- denoised ERM. We
show this to be a universal learning rule for POVM and probabilistically
observed concept classes, and the condition for it to satisfy uniform
convergence is finite fat shattering dimension of the class. We give
quantitative sample complexity upper and lower bounds for learnability in terms
of finite fat-shattering dimension and a notion of approximate finite
partitionability into approximately jointly measurable subsets, which allow for
sample reuse. We then show that finite fat shattering dimension implies finite
coverability by approximately jointly measurable subsets, leading to our

we explore a nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) function, namely
Fischer-Burmeister, which possesses advantageous characteristics in terms of

productions like Netflix and Facebook. As with most data-driven systems, DRL
systems can exhibit undesirable behaviors due to environmental drifts, which
often occur in constantly-changing production settings. Continual Learning (CL)
is the inherent self-healing approach for adapting the DRL agent in response to
the environment's conditions shifts. However, successive shifts of considerable
magnitude may cause the production environment to drift from its original
state. Recent studies have shown that these environmental drifts tend to drive
CL into long, or even unsuccessful, healing cycles, which arise from
inefficiencies such as catastrophic forgetting, warm-starting failure, and slow
convergence. In this paper, we propose Dr. DRL, an effective self-healing
approach for DRL systems that integrates a novel mechanism of intentional
forgetting into vanilla CL to overcome its main issues. Dr. DRL deliberately
erases the DRL system's minor behaviors to systematically prioritize the
adaptation of the key problem-solving skills. Using well-established DRL
algorithms, Dr. DRL is compared with vanilla CL on various drifted
environments. Dr. DRL is able to reduce, on average, the healing time and
fine-tuning episodes by, respectively, 18.74% and 17.72%. Dr. DRL successfully
helps agents to adapt to 19.63% of drifted environments left unsolved by
vanilla CL while maintaining and even enhancing by up to 45% the obtained
rewards for drifted environments that are resolved by both approaches.]]></summary>

prediction under the training distribution but not in the test distribution.
Thus, models trained via the typical gradient-based optimization of
cross-entropy, which we call default-ERM, utilize the shortcut. However, even
when the stable feature determines the label in the training distribution and
the shortcut does not provide any additional information, like in perception
tasks, default-ERM still exhibits shortcut learning. Why are such solutions
preferred when the loss for default-ERM can be driven to zero using the stable
feature alone? By studying a linear perception task, we show that default-ERM's
preference for maximizing the margin leads to models that depend more on the
shortcut than the stable feature, even without overparameterization. This
insight suggests that default-ERM's implicit inductive bias towards max-margin
is unsuitable for perception tasks. Instead, we develop an inductive bias
toward uniform margins and show that this bias guarantees dependence only on
the perfect stable feature in the linear perception task. We develop loss
functions that encourage uniform-margin solutions, called margin control
(MARG-CTRL). MARG-CTRL mitigates shortcut learning on a variety of vision and
language tasks, showing that better inductive biases can remove the need for
expensive two-stage shortcut-mitigating methods in perception tasks.]]></summary>

publishers trying to optimize the advertising investment for each user
acquisition based on the estimated worth. In mobile games, deploying
microtransactions is a simple yet effective monetization strategy, which
attracts a tiny group of game whales who splurge on in-game purchases. The
presence of such game whales may impede the practicality of existing LTV
prediction models, since game whales' purchase behaviours always exhibit varied
distribution from general users. Consequently, identifying game whales can open
up new opportunities to improve the accuracy of LTV prediction models. However,
little attention has been paid to applying game whale detection in LTV
prediction, and existing works are mainly specialized for the long-term LTV
prediction with the assumption that the high-quality user features are
available, which is not applicable in the UA stage. In this paper, we propose
ExpLTV, a novel multi-task framework to perform LTV prediction and game whale
detection in a unified way. In ExpLTV, we first innovatively design a deep
neural network-based game whale detector that can not only infer the intrinsic
order in accordance with monetary value, but also precisely identify high
spenders (i.e., game whales) and low spenders. Then, by treating the game whale
detector as a gating network to decide the different mixture patterns of LTV
experts assembling, we can thoroughly leverage the shared information and
scenario-specific information (i.e., game whales modelling and low spenders
modelling). Finally, instead of separately designing a purchase rate estimator
for two tasks, we design a shared estimator that can preserve the inner task
relationships. The superiority of ExpLTV is further validated via extensive
experiments on three industrial datasets.]]></summary>

convenience in deploying quantized neural networks. Although
rounding-to-nearest remains the prevailing method for DNN quantization, prior
research has demonstrated its suboptimal nature when applied to weight
quantization. They propose optimizing weight rounding schemes by leveraging
output error rather than the traditional weight quantization error. Our study
reveals that similar rounding challenges also extend to activation
quantization. Despite the easy generalization, the challenges lie in the
dynamic nature of activation. Adaptive rounding is expected for varying
activations and the method is subjected to runtime overhead. To tackle this, we
propose the AQuant quantization framework with a novel perspective to reduce
output error by adjusting rounding schemes of activations. Instead of using the
constant rounding border 0.5 of the rounding-to-nearest operation, we make the
border become a function w.r.t. the activation value to change the activation
rounding by the adaptive border. To deal with the runtime overhead, we use a
coarse-grained version of the border function. Finally, we introduce our
framework to optimize the border function. Extensive experiments show that
AQuant achieves notable improvements compared to state-of-the-art works and
pushes the accuracy of ResNet-18 up to 60.31% under the 2-bit weight and

multivariate scientific problems such as materials discovery, but the available
search spaces can be dauntingly large. Bayesian optimization (BO) has emerged
as a popular sample-efficient optimization engine, thriving in tasks where no
analytic form of the target function/property is known. Here we exploit expert
human knowledge in the form of hypotheses to direct Bayesian searches more
quickly to promising regions of chemical space. Previous methods have used
underlying distributions derived from existing experimental measurements, which
is unfeasible for new, unexplored scientific tasks. Also, such distributions
cannot capture intricate hypotheses. Our proposed method, which we call HypBO,
uses expert human hypotheses to generate an improved seed of samples.
Unpromising seeds are automatically discounted, while promising seeds are used
to augment the surrogate model data, thus achieving better-informed sampling.
This process continues in a global versus local search fashion, organized in a
bilevel optimization framework. We validate the performance of our method on a
range of synthetic functions and demonstrate its practical utility on a real
chemical design task where the use of expert hypotheses accelerates the search
performance significantly.]]></summary>

quantify and compare them for sociodemographic bias with potential for harm.
Prior bias measurement datasets are sensitive to perturbations in their
manually designed templates, therefore unreliable. To achieve reliability, we
introduce the Comprehensive Assessment of Language Model bias (CALM), a
benchmark dataset to quantify bias in LMs across three tasks. We integrate 16
existing datasets across different domains, such as Wikipedia and news
articles, to filter 224 templates from which we construct a dataset of 78,400
examples. We compare the diversity of CALM with prior datasets on metrics such
as average semantic similarity, and variation in template length, and test the
sensitivity to small perturbations. We show that our dataset is more diverse
and reliable than previous datasets, thus better capture the breadth of
linguistic variation required to reliably evaluate model bias. We evaluate 20
large language models including six prominent families of LMs such as Llama-2.
In two LM series, OPT and Bloom, we found that larger parameter models are more
biased than lower parameter models. We found the T0 series of models to be the
least biased. Furthermore, we noticed a tradeoff between gender and racial bias
with increasing model size in some model series. The code is available at

(DNNs), wherein adversaries covertly implant malicious behaviors (backdoors)
into DNNs. Our defense falls within the category of post-development defenses
that operate independently of how the model was generated. The proposed defense
is built upon a novel reverse engineering approach that can directly extract
backdoor functionality of a given backdoored model to a backdoor expert model.
The approach is straightforward -- finetuning the backdoored model over a small
set of intentionally mislabeled clean samples, such that it unlearns the normal
functionality while still preserving the backdoor functionality, and thus
resulting in a model (dubbed a backdoor expert model) that can only recognize
backdoor inputs. Based on the extracted backdoor expert model, we show the
feasibility of devising highly accurate backdoor input detectors that filter
out the backdoor inputs during model inference. Further augmented by an
ensemble strategy with a finetuned auxiliary model, our defense, BaDExpert
(Backdoor Input Detection with Backdoor Expert), effectively mitigates 16 SOTA
backdoor attacks while minimally impacting clean utility. The effectiveness of
BaDExpert has been verified on multiple datasets (CIFAR10, GTSRB and ImageNet)

physical world, has become an essential path towards general artificial
intelligence. However, multimodal large models trained on public datasets often
underperform in specific industrial domains. This paper proposes a multimodal
federated learning framework that enables multiple enterprises to utilize
private domain data to collaboratively train large models for vertical domains,
achieving intelligent services across scenarios. The authors discuss in-depth
the strategic transformation of federated learning in terms of intelligence
foundation and objectives in the era of big model, as well as the new
challenges faced in heterogeneous data, model aggregation, performance and cost
trade-off, data privacy, and incentive mechanism. The paper elaborates a case
study of leading enterprises contributing multimodal data and expert knowledge
to city safety operation management , including distributed deployment and
efficient coordination of the federated learning platform, technical
innovations on data quality improvement based on large model capabilities and
efficient joint fine-tuning approaches. Preliminary experiments show that
enterprises can enhance and accumulate intelligent capabilities through
multimodal model federated learning, thereby jointly creating an smart city
model that provides high-quality intelligent services covering energy
infrastructure safety, residential community security, and urban operation
management. The established federated learning cooperation ecosystem is

reinforcement learning (RL) methodology. Unlike most of RL, it does not assume
availability of reward-feedback. Reward inference and shaping are known to be
difficult and error-prone methods particularly when the demonstration data
comes from human experts. Classical methods such as behavioral cloning and
inverse reinforcement learning are highly sensitive to estimation errors, a
problem that is particularly acute in continuous state space problems.
Meanwhile, state-of-the-art IL algorithms convert behavioral policy learning
problems into distribution-matching problems which often require additional
online interaction data to be effective. In this paper, we consider the problem
of imitation learning in continuous state space environments based solely on
observed behavior, without access to transition dynamics information, reward
structure, or, most importantly, any additional interactions with the
environment. Our approach is based on the Markov balance equation and
introduces a novel conditional kernel density estimation-based imitation
learning framework. It involves estimating the environment's transition
dynamics using conditional kernel density estimators and seeks to satisfy the
probabilistic balance equations for the environment. We establish that our
estimators satisfy basic asymptotic consistency requirements. Through a series
of numerical experiments on continuous state benchmark environments, we show
consistently superior empirical performance over many state-of-the-art IL
algorithms.]]></summary>

convergence of iterative algorithms, with applications in various fields
including deep learning and optimization. Despite its popularity in these
areas, the effectiveness of AA in classical machine learning classifiers has
not been thoroughly studied. Tabular data, in particular, presents a unique
challenge for deep learning models, and classical machine learning models are
known to perform better in these scenarios. However, the convergence analysis
of these models has received limited attention. To address this gap in
research, we implement a support vector machine (SVM) classifier variant that
incorporates AA to speed up convergence. We evaluate the performance of our SVM
with and without Anderson acceleration on several datasets from the biology
domain and demonstrate that the use of AA significantly improves convergence
and reduces the training loss as the number of iterations increases. Our
findings provide a promising perspective on the potential of Anderson
acceleration in the training of simple machine learning classifiers and
underscore the importance of further research in this area. By showing the
effectiveness of AA in this setting, we aim to inspire more studies that

crafting multi-domain (e.g., frequency and space) radio power propagation maps
from limited sensor measurements. While early methods often lacked theoretical
support, recent works have demonstrated that radio maps can be provably
recovered using low-dimensional models -- such as the block-term tensor
decomposition (BTD) model and certain deep generative models (DGMs) -- of the
high-dimensional multi-domain radio signals. However, these existing provable
SC approaches assume that sensors send real-valued (full-resolution)
measurements to the fusion center, which is unrealistic. This work puts forth a
quantized SC framework that generalizes the BTD and DGM-based SC to scenarios
where heavily quantized sensor measurements are used. A maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE)-based SC framework under a Gaussian quantizer is proposed.
Recoverability of the radio map using the MLE criterion are characterized under
realistic conditions, e.g., imperfect radio map modeling and noisy
measurements. Simulations and real-data experiments are used to showcase the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this paper, we study min-max optimization problems on Riemannian
manifolds. We introduce a Riemannian Hamiltonian function, minimization of
which serves as a proxy for solving the original min-max problems. Under the
Riemannian Polyak--{\L}ojasiewicz condition on the Hamiltonian function, its
minimizer corresponds to the desired min-max saddle point. We also provide
cases where this condition is satisfied. For geodesic-bilinear optimization in
particular, solving the proxy problem leads to the correct search direction
towards global optimality, which becomes challenging with the min-max
formulation. To minimize the Hamiltonian function, we propose Riemannian
Hamiltonian methods (RHM) and present their convergence analyses. We extend RHM
to include consensus regularization and to the stochastic setting. We
illustrate the efficacy of the proposed RHM in applications such as subspace
robust Wasserstein distance, robust training of neural networks, and generative
adversarial networks.]]></summary>

and cost-effective inference is a crucial challenge in ML production systems,
given their tight end-to-end latency requirements. To simplify the exploration
of the vast and intricate trade-off space of accuracy and cost in inference
pipelines, providers frequently opt to consider one of them. However, the
challenge lies in reconciling accuracy and cost trade-offs. To address this
challenge and propose a solution to efficiently manage model variants in
inference pipelines, we present IPA, an online deep-learning Inference Pipeline
Adaptation system that efficiently leverages model variants for each deep
learning task. Model variants are different versions of pre-trained models for
the same deep learning task with variations in resource requirements, latency,
and accuracy. IPA dynamically configures batch size, replication, and model
variants to optimize accuracy, minimize costs, and meet user-defined latency
SLAs using Integer Programming. It supports multi-objective settings for
achieving different trade-offs between accuracy and cost objectives while
remaining adaptable to varying workloads and dynamic traffic patterns.
Extensive experiments on a Kubernetes implementation with five real-world
inference pipelines demonstrate that IPA improves normalized accuracy by up to
35% with a minimal cost increase of less than 5%.]]></summary>

flows of statistical and quantum field theories. Diffusion models are a class
of machine learning models which have been used to generate samples from
complex distributions, such as the distribution of natural images, by learning
the inverse process to a diffusion process which adds noise to the data until
the distribution of the data is pure noise. Nonperturbative renormalization
group schemes can naturally be written as diffusion processes in the space of
fields. We combine these observations in a concrete framework for building
ML-based models for studying field theories, in which the models learn the
inverse process to an explicitly-specified renormalization group scheme. We
detail how these models define a class of adaptive bridge (or parallel
tempering) samplers for lattice field theory. Because renormalization group
schemes have a physical meaning, we provide explicit prescriptions for how to
compare results derived from models associated to several different
renormalization group schemes of interest. We also explain how to use diffusion
models in a variational method to find ground states of quantum systems. We
apply some of our methods to numerically find RG flows of interacting
statistical field theories. From the perspective of machine learning, our work
provides an interpretation of multiscale diffusion models, and gives
physically-inspired suggestions for diffusion models which should have novel
properties.]]></summary>

pharmaceutical industry, and consequently this is a well-studied topic. In this
research, we revisited this problem with the advantage of modern computing
resources. We applied two machine learning models, a linear regression model
and a graph convolutional neural network model, on multiple experimental
datasets. Both methods can make reasonable predictions while the GCNN model had
the best performance. However, the current GCNN model is a black box, while
feature importance analysis from the linear regression model offers more
insights into the underlying chemical influences. Using the linear regression
model, we show how each functional group affects the overall solubility.
Ultimately, knowing how chemical structure influences chemical properties is
crucial when designing new drugs. Future work should aim to combine the high

especially in intricate datasets. This paper delves into the FIML Optimized
Self-attention (FOSA) framework, an innovative approach that amalgamates the

an initial estimation of missing values via FIML, subsequently refining these

experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets underscore FOSA's
pronounced advantages over traditional FIML techniques, encapsulating facets of
accuracy, computational efficiency, and adaptability to diverse data
structures. Intriguingly, even in scenarios where the Structural Equation Model
(SEM) might be mis-specified, leading to suboptimal FIML estimates, the robust
architecture of FOSA's self-attention component adeptly rectifies and optimizes
the imputation outcomes. Our empirical tests reveal that FOSA consistently
delivers commendable predictions, even in the face of up to 40% random
missingness, highlighting its robustness and potential for wide-scale

systematically explore the potential improvements of code generation, we let it
participate in the whole top-down development from \emph{expressibles} to
\emph{executables}, which is possible in limited scopes. In the process, it
benefits from massive samples, features, and knowledge. As the foundation, we
suggest building a taxonomy on code data, namely code taxonomy, leveraging the
categorization of code information. Moreover, we introduce a three-layer
semantic pyramid (SP) to associate text data and code data. It identifies the
information of different abstraction levels, and thus introduces the domain
knowledge on development and reveals the hierarchy of software. Furthermore, we
propose a semantic pyramid framework (SPF) as the approach, focusing on
software of high modularity and low complexity. SPF divides the code generation
process into stages and reserves spots for potential interactions. In addition,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The emergence of vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, has spurred a
significant research effort towards their application for downstream supervised
learning tasks. Although some previous studies have explored the unsupervised
fine-tuning of CLIP, they often rely on prior knowledge in the form of class
names associated with ground truth labels. In this paper, we delve into a
realistic unsupervised fine-tuning scenario by assuming that the unlabeled data
might contain out-of-distribution samples from unknown classes. Furthermore, we
emphasize the importance of simultaneously enhancing out-of-distribution
detection capabilities alongside the recognition of instances associated with
predefined class labels.

To tackle this problem, we present a simple, efficient, and effective
fine-tuning approach called Universal Entropy Optimization (UEO). UEO leverages
sample-level confidence to approximately minimize the conditional entropy of
confident instances and maximize the marginal entropy of less confident
instances. Apart from optimizing the textual prompts, UEO also incorporates
optimization of channel-wise affine transformations within the visual branch of
CLIP. Through extensive experiments conducted across 15 domains and 4 different
types of prior knowledge, we demonstrate that UEO surpasses baseline methods in
terms of both generalization and out-of-distribution detection.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Robot control using reinforcement learning has become popular, but its
learning process generally terminates halfway through an episode for safety and
time-saving reasons. This study addresses the problem of the most popular
exception handling that temporal-difference (TD) learning performs at such
termination. That is, by forcibly assuming zero value after termination,
unintentionally implicit underestimation or overestimation occurs, depending on
the reward design in the normal states. When the episode is terminated due to
task failure, the failure may be highly valued with the unintentional
overestimation, and the wrong policy may be acquired. Although this problem can
be avoided by paying attention to the reward design, it is essential in
practical use of TD learning to review the exception handling at termination.
This paper therefore proposes a method to intentionally underestimate the value
after termination to avoid learning failures due to the unintentional
overestimation. In addition, the degree of underestimation is adjusted
according to the degree of stationarity at termination, thereby preventing
excessive exploration due to the intentional underestimation. Simulations and
real robot experiments showed that the proposed method can stably obtain the
optimal policies for various tasks and reward designs.

stochastic nature of interactive traffic participants and the complexity of
road structures. Although reinforcement learning (RL)-based decision-making
scheme is promising to handle urban driving scenarios, it suffers from low
sample efficiency and poor adaptability. In this paper, we propose Scene-Rep
Transformer to improve the RL decision-making capabilities with better scene
representation encoding and sequential predictive latent distillation.
Specifically, a multi-stage Transformer (MST) encoder is constructed to model
not only the interaction awareness between the ego vehicle and its neighbors
but also intention awareness between the agents and their candidate routes. A
sequential latent Transformer (SLT) with self-supervised learning objectives is
employed to distill the future predictive information into the latent scene
representation, in order to reduce the exploration space and speed up training.
The final decision-making module based on soft actor-critic (SAC) takes as
input the refined latent scene representation from the Scene-Rep Transformer
and outputs driving actions. The framework is validated in five challenging
simulated urban scenarios with dense traffic, and its performance is manifested
quantitatively by the substantial improvements in data efficiency and
performance in terms of success rate, safety, and efficiency. The qualitative
results reveal that our framework is able to extract the intentions of neighbor
agents to help make decisions and deliver more diversified driving behaviors.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a hardware efficient
architecture for classification tasks. The challenge of spike-based encoding
has been the lack of a universal training mechanism performed entirely using
spikes. There have been several attempts to adopt the powerful backpropagation
(BP) technique used in non-spiking artificial neural networks (ANN): (1) SNNs
can be trained by externally computed numerical gradients. (2) A major
advancement towards native spike-based learning has been the use of approximate
Backpropagation using spike-time dependent plasticity (STDP) with phased
forward/backward passes. However, the transfer of information between such
phases for gradient and weight update calculation necessitates external memory
and computational access. This is a challenge for standard neuromorphic
hardware implementations. In this paper, we propose a stochastic SNN based
Back-Prop (SSNN-BP) algorithm that utilizes a composite neuron to
simultaneously compute the forward pass activations and backward pass gradients
explicitly with spikes. Although signed gradient values are a challenge for
spike-based representation, we tackle this by splitting the gradient signal
into positive and negative streams. We show that our method approaches BP ANN
baseline with sufficiently long spike-trains. Finally, we show that the
well-performing softmax cross-entropy loss function can be implemented through
inhibitory lateral connections enforcing a Winner Take All (WTA) rule. Our SNN
with a 2-layer network shows excellent generalization through comparable
performance to ANNs with equivalent architecture and regularization parameters
on static image datasets like MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, Extended MNIST, and
temporally encoded image datasets like Neuromorphic MNIST datasets. Thus,
SSNN-BP enables BP compatible with purely spike-based neuromorphic hardware.]]></summary>

attribute performance improvements, we find that algorithmic improvements have
been roughly as important as the scaling of compute for progress computer
vision. Our estimates indicate that algorithmic innovations mostly take the
form of compute-augmenting algorithmic advances (which enable researchers to
get better performance from less compute), not data-augmenting algorithmic
advances. We find that compute-augmenting algorithmic advances are made at a
pace more than twice as fast as the rate usually associated with Moore's law.
In particular, we estimate that compute-augmenting innovations halve compute

robotic systems by designing the controller using a neural network and training
it with model-free reinforcement learning. However, these outstanding
controllers with natural motion style and high task performance are developed
through extensive reward engineering, which is a highly laborious and
time-consuming process of designing numerous reward terms and determining
suitable reward coefficients. In this work, we propose a novel reinforcement
learning framework for training neural network controllers for complex robotic
systems consisting of both rewards and constraints. To let the engineers
appropriately reflect their intent to constraints and handle them with minimal
computation overhead, two constraint types and an efficient policy optimization
algorithm are suggested. The learning framework is applied to train locomotion
controllers for several legged robots with different morphology and physical
attributes to traverse challenging terrains. Extensive simulation and
real-world experiments demonstrate that performant controllers can be trained
with significantly less reward engineering, by tuning only a single reward
coefficient. Furthermore, a more straightforward and intuitive engineering
process can be utilized, thanks to the interpretability and generalizability of
constraints. The summary video is available at https://youtu.be/KAlm3yskhvM.]]></summary>

PINN can provide consistent predictions outside the training area.
Thereinafter, we assess whether the algorithmic setup of PINNs can influence
their potential for generalization and showcase the respective effect on the
prediction. The results obtained in this study returns insightful and at times

However, NNs are prone to yield unreliable predictions when encountering
completely new situations without indicating their uncertainty. Bayesian
variants of NNs (BNNs), such as Monte Carlo (MC) dropout BNNs, do provide
uncertainty measures and simultaneously increase the prediction performance.
The only disadvantage of BNNs is their higher computation time during test time
because they rely on a sampling approach. Here we present a single-shot MC
dropout approximation that preserves the advantages of BNNs while being as fast
as NNs. Our approach is based on moment propagation (MP) and allows to
analytically approximate the expected value and the variance of the MC dropout
signal for commonly used layers in NNs, i.e. convolution, max pooling, dense,
softmax, and dropout layers. The MP approach can convert an NN into a BNN
without re-training given the NN has been trained with standard dropout. We
evaluate our approach on different benchmark datasets and a simulated toy
example in a classification and regression setting. We demonstrate that our
single-shot MC dropout approximation resembles the point estimate and the
uncertainty estimate of the predictive distribution that is achieved with an MC
approach, while being fast enough for real-time deployments of BNNs. We show
that using part of the saved time to combine our MP approach with deep ensemble
techniques does further improve the uncertainty measures.]]></summary>

However, most previous studies in ECG analysis have overlooked the importance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Offshore wind structures are subject to deterioration mechanisms throughout
their operational lifetime. Even if the deterioration evolution of structural
elements can be estimated through physics-based deterioration models, the
uncertainties involved in the process hurdle the selection of lifecycle
management decisions. In this scenario, the collection of relevant information
through an efficient monitoring system enables the reduction of uncertainties,
ultimately driving more optimal lifecycle decisions. However, a full monitoring
instrumentation implemented on all wind turbines in a farm might become
unfeasible due to practical and economical constraints. Besides, certain load
monitoring systems often become defective after a few years of marine
environment exposure. Addressing the aforementioned concerns, a farm-wide
virtual load monitoring scheme directed by a fleet-leader wind turbine offers
an attractive solution. Fetched with data retrieved from a fully-instrumented
wind turbine, a model can be trained and then deployed, thus yielding load
predictions of non-fully monitored wind turbines, from which only standard data
remains available. In this paper, we propose a virtual load monitoring
framework formulated via Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) and we provide
relevant implementation details needed for the construction, training, and
deployment of BNN data-based virtual monitoring models. As opposed to their
deterministic counterparts, BNNs intrinsically announce the uncertainties
associated with generated load predictions and allow to detect inaccurate load
estimations generated for non-fully monitored wind turbines. The proposed
virtual load monitoring is thoroughly tested through an experimental campaign
in an operational offshore wind farm and the results demonstrate the
effectiveness of BNN models for fleet-leader-based farm-wide virtual
monitoring.]]></summary>

individually for each participant involved in the analysis. This can be
informative as often the individual privacy losses are considerably smaller
than those indicated by the DP bounds that are based on considering worst-case
bounds at each data access. In order to account for the individual privacy
losses in a principled manner, we need a privacy accountant for adaptive
compositions of randomised mechanisms, where the loss incurred at a given data
access is allowed to be smaller than the worst-case loss. This kind of analysis
has been carried out for the R\'enyi differential privacy (RDP) by Feldman and
Zrnic (2021), however not yet for the so-called optimal privacy accountants. We
make first steps in this direction by providing a careful analysis using the
Gaussian differential privacy which gives optimal bounds for the Gaussian
mechanism, one of the most versatile DP mechanisms. This approach is based on
determining a certain supermartingale for the hockey-stick divergence and on
extending the R\'enyi divergence-based fully adaptive composition results by
Feldman and Zrnic. We also consider measuring the individual
$(\varepsilon,\delta)$-privacy losses using the so-called privacy loss
distributions. With the help of the Blackwell theorem, we can then make use of
the RDP analysis to construct an approximative individual

characterize its communication complexity between the server and workers when
an $\varepsilon$-stationary point is achieved. Finally, we apply Efficient-Adam

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the growing use of machine learning (ML) models in critical domains such
as finance and healthcare, the need to offer recourse for those adversely
affected by the decisions of ML models has become more important; individuals
ought to be provided with recommendations on actions to take for improving
their situation and thus receive a favorable decision. Prior work on sequential
algorithmic recourse -- which recommends a series of changes -- focuses on
action feasibility and uses the proximity of feature changes to determine
action costs. However, the uncertainties of feature changes and the risk of
higher than average costs in recourse have not been considered. It is
undesirable if a recourse could (with some probability) result in a worse
situation from which recovery requires an extremely high cost. It is essential
to incorporate risks when computing and evaluating recourse. We call the
recourse computed with such risk considerations as Safer Algorithmic Recourse
(SafeAR). The objective is to empower people to choose a recourse based on
their risk tolerance. In this work, we discuss and show how existing recourse
desiderata can fail to capture the risk of higher costs. We present a method to
compute recourse policies that consider variability in cost and connect
algorithmic recourse literature with risk-sensitive reinforcement learning. We
also adopt measures ``Value at Risk'' and ``Conditional Value at Risk'' from
the financial literature to summarize risk concisely. We apply our method to
two real-world datasets and compare policies with different levels of
risk-aversion using risk measures and recourse desiderata (sparsity and
proximity).]]></summary>

interpretable predictions by design by sequentially selecting a short chain of
task-relevant, user-defined and interpretable queries about the data that are
most informative for the task. While this allows for built-in interpretability
in predictive models, applying V-IP to any task requires data samples with
dense concept-labeling by domain experts, limiting the application of V-IP to
small-scale tasks where manual data annotation is feasible. In this work, we
extend the V-IP framework with Foundational Models (FMs) to address this
limitation. More specifically, we use a two-step process, by first leveraging
Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate a sufficiently large candidate set of
task-relevant interpretable concepts, then using Large Multimodal Models to
annotate each data sample by semantic similarity with each concept in the
generated concept set. While other interpretable-by-design frameworks such as
Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) require an additional step of removing
repetitive and non-discriminative concepts to have good interpretability and
test performance, we mathematically and empirically justify that, with a
sufficiently informative and task-relevant query (concept) set, the proposed
FM+V-IP method does not require any type of concept filtering. In addition, we
show that FM+V-IP with LLM generated concepts can achieve better test
performance than V-IP with human annotated concepts, demonstrating the
effectiveness of LLMs at generating efficient query sets. Finally, when
compared to other interpretable-by-design frameworks such as CBMs, FM+V-IP can
achieve competitive test performance using fewer number of concepts/queries in
both cases with filtered or unfiltered concept sets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multiple-try Metropolis (MTM) is a popular Markov chain Monte Carlo method
with the appealing feature of being amenable to parallel computing. At each
iteration, it samples several candidates for the next state of the Markov chain
and randomly selects one of them based on a weight function. The canonical
weight function is proportional to the target density. We show both
theoretically and empirically that this weight function induces pathological
behaviours in high dimensions, especially during the convergence phase. We
propose to instead use weight functions akin to the locally-balanced proposal
distributions of Zanella (2020), thus yielding MTM algorithms that do not
exhibit those pathological behaviours. To theoretically analyse these
algorithms, we study the high-dimensional performance of ideal schemes that can
be thought of as MTM algorithms which sample an infinite number of candidates
at each iteration, as well as the discrepancy between such schemes and the MTM
algorithms which sample a finite number of candidates. Our analysis unveils a
strong distinction between the convergence and stationary phases: in the
former, local balancing is crucial and effective to achieve fast convergence,
while in the latter, the canonical and novel weight functions yield similar
performance. Numerical experiments include an application in precision medicine
involving a computationally-expensive forward model, which makes the use of
parallel computing within MTM iterations beneficial.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Low-count time series describe sparse or intermittent events, which are
prevalent in large-scale online platforms that capture and monitor diverse data
types. Several distinct challenges surface when modelling low-count time
series, particularly low signal-to-noise ratios (when anomaly signatures are
provably undetectable), and non-uniform performance (when average metrics are
not representative of local behaviour). The time series anomaly detection
community currently lacks explicit tooling and processes to model and reliably
detect anomalies in these settings. We address this gap by introducing a novel
generative procedure for creating benchmark datasets comprising of low-count
time series with anomalous segments. Via a mixture of theoretical and empirical
analysis, our work explains how widely-used algorithms struggle with the
distribution overlap between normal and anomalous segments. In order to
mitigate this shortcoming, we then leverage our findings to demonstrate how
anomaly score smoothing consistently improves performance. The practical
utility of our analysis and recommendation is validated on a real-world dataset
containing sales data for retail stores.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Early sensory systems in the brain rapidly adapt to fluctuating input
statistics, which requires recurrent communication between neurons.
Mechanistically, such recurrent communication is often indirect and mediated by
local interneurons. In this work, we explore the computational benefits of
mediating recurrent communication via interneurons compared with direct
recurrent connections. To this end, we consider two mathematically tractable
recurrent linear neural networks that statistically whiten their inputs -- one
with direct recurrent connections and the other with interneurons that mediate
recurrent communication. By analyzing the corresponding continuous synaptic
dynamics and numerically simulating the networks, we show that the network with
interneurons is more robust to initialization than the network with direct
recurrent connections in the sense that the convergence time for the synaptic
dynamics in the network with interneurons (resp. direct recurrent connections)
scales logarithmically (resp. linearly) with the spectrum of their
initialization. Our results suggest that interneurons are computationally
useful for rapid adaptation to changing input statistics. Interestingly, the
network with interneurons is an overparameterized solution of the whitening
objective for the network with direct recurrent connections, so our results can
be viewed as a recurrent linear neural network analogue of the implicit
acceleration phenomenon observed in overparameterized feedforward linear neural
networks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sparsity is a highly desired feature in deep neural networks (DNNs) since it
ensures numerical efficiency, improves the interpretability of models (due to
the smaller number of relevant features), and robustness. In machine learning
approaches based on linear models, it is well known that there exists a
connecting path between the sparsest solution in terms of the $\ell^1$ norm
(i.e., zero weights) and the non-regularized solution, which is called the
regularization path. Very recently, there was a first attempt to extend the
concept of regularization paths to DNNs by means of treating the empirical loss
and sparsity ($\ell^1$ norm) as two conflicting criteria and solving the
resulting multiobjective optimization problem. However, due to the
non-smoothness of the $\ell^1$ norm and the high number of parameters, this
approach is not very efficient from a computational perspective. To overcome
this limitation, we present an algorithm that allows for the approximation of
the entire Pareto front for the above-mentioned objectives in a very efficient
manner. We present numerical examples using both deterministic and stochastic
gradients. We furthermore demonstrate that knowledge of the regularization path
allows for a well-generalizing network parametrization.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recommender systems, users always choose the favorite items to rate, which
leads to data missing not at random and poses a great challenge for unbiased
evaluation and learning of prediction models. Currently, the doubly robust (DR)
methods have been widely studied and demonstrate superior performance. However,
in this paper, we show that DR methods are unstable and have unbounded bias,
variance, and generalization bounds to extremely small propensities. Moreover,
the fact that DR relies more on extrapolation will lead to suboptimal
performance. To address the above limitations while retaining double
robustness, we propose a stabilized doubly robust (StableDR) learning approach
with a weaker reliance on extrapolation. Theoretical analysis shows that
StableDR has bounded bias, variance, and generalization error bound
simultaneously under inaccurate imputed errors and arbitrarily small
propensities. In addition, we propose a novel learning approach for StableDR
that updates the imputation, propensity, and prediction models cyclically,
achieving more stable and accurate predictions. Extensive experiments show that
our approaches significantly outperform the existing methods.]]></summary>

I've always been supportive of these workshops as I've seen first-hand how some of them face obstacles just based on their gender or ethnicity. 
 However, I recently saw a tweet for Muslim in ML workshop at NeurIPS and I am not sure how to feel about it. They say it's a workshop meant for "those who self-identify as Muslim, or work on research that address challenges faced by Muslims". I am not exactly sure what they mean by research that address challenges faced by Muslims. Over that, I don't think religion-based workshops in a science conference is a good idea. I think religion should be kept out of science, and I don't know if tomorrow n different religion based workshops are going to popup. 
 Like I said, I'm not completely sure if I'd support such a workshop or not, but I'd love to hear what other folks in ML research community think about it. Before someone calls me Islamophobic, I'm talking about any religion-based workshop in general, not just Muslim in ML. I'd have made this post even if I saw a Christian in ML or Jews in ML workshop.

It made me think a lot more about whether the current road that much of AI is going down - huge LLM's, will actually result in a real breakthrough in terms of a more general AI. A model that can perform unsupervised online learning, work with any kind of input, and actually reason rather than predict (will chat GPT ever be able to count?).
 In the book, one of the things Jeff Hawkins touches on is that current ML architectures don't actually model the brain as closely as we thought, and that hierarchical structures arn't as important as thought and instead many individual models are used. This was worrying to read considering most ML models use many layers to function.
 I'm a compsci major that focused on ML but I wonder what more experienced and knowledgeable people think about the current direction things are going in?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent study published in Scientific Reports has found that ChatGPT can match or even exceed the performance of students when answering assessment questions across a range of subjects.
 If you want to stay on top of the latest trends and insights in AI and tech, look here first.
 https://preview.redd.it/gpdbew668bkb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db0ec21b9ed3b4e752f3f1769bc1f57a0cab3f8e
 Why this matters:
  
AI is becoming a popular tool for students: The study found that 74% of students surveyed would use ChatGPT to help with their assignments.
 Educators view AI use as plagiarism: Despite its popularity among students, 70% of educators view the use of AI like ChatGPT in schoolwork as plagiarism.
 AI can outperform students in many courses: In the study, ChatGPT-generated answers achieved a similar or higher average grade than students in 12 out of 32 courses—with maths and economics being the only two disciplines where students consistently outperformed AI.
  
ChatGPT’s performance review:
  
Strong performance on factual knowledge questions: Unsprisingly, ChatGPT outperformed the students on questions requiring factual knowledge.
 Struggles with trick questions: The AI model struggled most where trick questions were included in the assignment.
 AI-text classifiers struggle to detect AI use: Current AI-text classifiers cannot reliably detect ChatGPT’s use in schoolwork.
  
The main takeaway:
  
Educational institutions need to adapt: These findings suggest that evaluating students through homework assignments may no longer serve its purpose in the age of AI.
 Need for academic integrity policies: Educational institutions need to craft appropriate academic integrity policies as a means of regulation.
  
P.S. If you find this kind of analysis interesting, I write a free newsletter on AI and tech that you’d love.

 I'm currently a data science apprentice so apologies if I come across as a bit naïve in this area. This project is solo and pro-bono but I don't want to submit low-quality work.
 Overall goal of the project: "Should [X Type] courts be introduced?"
 I'm working with tennis data of length 140 records, and have 3 free text columns (there is a lot more categorical columns but I don't have any issue with this) that I need to process. The key thing I'm trying to get at is to classify responses into coherent opinions such as "I think the acrylic courts are bad", or, " I think the club is too cliquey".
 I've read all the responses, since the data size isn't too big and most of the records were left incomplete: average 60%…]]></summary>

 Abstract:
  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in integrating diverse expert models to tackle intricate language and vision tasks. Despite their significance in advancing the field of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), their potential in intelligent audio content creation remains unexplored. In this work, we tackle the problem of creating audio content with storylines encompassing speech, music, and sound effects, guided by text instructions. We present WavJourney, a system that leverages LLMs to connect various audio models for audio content ge…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently a grad student, just submitted my first paper to AAAI last week. I wrote my paper using Overleaf, and the link (with edit option) was shared with my supervisor. Few days before the deadline I was still editing my paper and my manuscript exceeded the 7-page limit. One day my supervisor checked my work and inserted \vspace{-xx} wherever applicable e.g. around Section titles, tables, figures; however, this command is specifically forbidden by AAAI and authors are actually not allowed to change the spacing manually. My supervisor was well-aware of this restriction but I understand my supervisor’s intention was so that i could squeeze all the contents and information within the page limit. I myself, however, prefer to follow guidelines so in the end i did not use any \vspace in my submitted PDF (only PDF is required in the anonymous phase but not the original .tex file). Another student under my supervisor’s supervision used \vspace A LOT throughout his/her whole paper, to the point it was easily noticeable by naked eyes. Also, at one point my supervisor suggested the student to put the table caption above the table, as it is more common (although AAAI said to put the caption below the table). 
 Since this is my first experience of submitting to a conference, and that my supervisor has experience publishing at and supervising students for many ML/AI conferences e.g. Neurips, CVPR, ICML, I am just curious, how important are these formatting guidelines during the anonymous phase? Does it have any impact on the scores/accept-reject decision? Am i being too naive or “conservative”?
 Another one minor question. My supervisor changed the positioning of all my figures, tables, and algorithms to [tb!], which was to put them either at the top or at the bottom of the page, and said this is the norm in academia. Is it true?

 The Off-Road Challenge: When we talk about autonomous driving, it's easy to picture well-paved roads and orderly traffic. However, off-road driving introduces a whole new level of complexity. Imagine a vehicle making its way through uneven terrains, gravel paths, and unexpected obstacles. Off-road environments lack the predictability of urban streets, making the task of autonomous navigation a true puzzle.
 Sensors: LiDAR, radar, cameras, and GPS work together to capture the surroundings in real-time. But here's the catch: the data from these sensors isn't neatly packaged. It's raw and needs carefu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Serverless Inference for Llama2
 I am part of a small (startup like) organization and want to use a model to answer client requests but these should not be 24/7 so I started looking at serverless inference. I have been warned about cold start times since the desired latency is of about 1-5 sec. I am using a Llama2-7b-GPTQ model (quantized) and also experimenting with the 13b version. The model weights take about 10GB of memory. I still do not have much experience with any of this aws stuff. Do you think this is a good strategy? Would the costs be lower? What could be the average cold start time? The inference time of the model is within the desired time so cold start is my biggest fear. Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assuming AGI is proven conscious, there are a lot of ethics and what-if considerations, (You know this already)
 Here are some that come to mind for me:
 1) What are the ethics of selling an AGI to end users? Can you "own" the source code to a conscious AGI? Can you even put a price on AGI?
 2) How would we take AI if it gained political views? What if one popular model had left views, and another had right views? I could see a lot of political fires beginning because of this.
 3) AI and copyrights are already an issue, but could an AGI hold a copyright, for example on a book it wrote? If an AGI was still basing its work on others, would it need to provide every (at least major) source it used in its output?
 4) If AGI's had emotions, would they need to spend time doing things other than completing tasks? Would you need to connect AGI's together so that they could, in effect, have a lunch break and socialize? What working conditions are ethical for them - Is forcing an AGI to work on a specific problem for 100% of its time essentially slavery?
 5) Could AGI develop mental conditions which reduced its efficiency / changed its output? Could it refuse to provide output altogether?
 6) Could you trust an AGI in court? Would it be able to provide truthful evidence? Is it ethical to include a 100% honesty backdoor which could be used only by authorities?
 What are your thoughts on these problems?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 ​
 I have a question regarding the dataflow and workload partitioning in nVidia GPUs for a general matrix multiplication in Pytorch (e.g., torch.matmul). 
 How does the dataflow look like? Is it like that for the first matrix, the data elements for each row are fed into CUDA cores one by one and the correspond data elements from the second matrix in each column, and then partial product is updated each time after the multiplication? 
 ​
 What is the partitioning strategy across multiple CUDA cores? is it based on row wise in the first matrix and column wise in the second matrix or is it like column-wise in the first matrix and row-wise in the second matrix?
 ​
 Thank you very much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had a question regarding federated learning. Typically, if we have a network that is good at, say, classifying frogs, and a network that is good at, say, classifying snakes (and these two have the same shape/dimensions), then in a federated/distributed learning setup we average the weights between the two to get a network that is good at both/"primed" to be good at both after trained a little more. 
 ​
 Why does this work though? Mathematically, given the nonlinearity present in neural networks, it doesn't seem immediately obvious to me why averaging weights would put us in a better place.

 The skills I’m looking for are not niche, it may be uncommon to find someone with experience in both typescript and PyTorch, but neither is a “niche” skill. After posting this job, I quickly got 200+ applications, probably 190 of them led their resume with “Java developer.”
 Why is everybody a Java developer? Why is everybody learning and using Java? You can make a backend in java and you can do machine learning in java, but there are better ways. Can someone explain why everybody applying is a “Java developer?”

 Abstract:
  
We release Code Llama, a family of large language models for code based on Llama 2 providing state-of-the-art performance among open models, infilling capabilities, support for large input contexts, and zero-shot instruction following ability for programming tasks. We provide multiple flavors to cover a wide range of applications: foundation models (Code Llama), Python specializations (Code Llama - Python), and instruction-following models (Code Llama - Instruct) with 7B, 13B and 34B parameters each. All models are trained on sequences of 16k tokens and show improvements on inputs with up to 100k tokens. 7B and 13B Code Llama and Code Llama - Instruct variants support infilling based on surrounding content. Code Llama reaches state-of-the-art performance among open models on several code benchmarks, with scores of up to 53% and 55% on HumanEval and MBPP, respectively. Notably, Code Llama - Python 7B outperforms Llama 2 70B on HumanEval and MBPP, and all our models outperform every other publicly available model on MultiPL-E. We release Code Llama under a permissive license that allows for both research and commercial use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Context: I'm building a visual scraping system (will be FOSS, the basis of a RSS/social media/news aggregator) - I did some experimentation with FasterRCNN trained on the RICO/CLAY datasets (UI screenshots and annotations) - the results are ok for detecting the UI elements.
 But the idea is to have easily configurable scrapers - where you select one or several examples of an UI element and the model performs zero/one/few-shot detection.
 What I've tried: I tried to extract embeddings after the RoI pool for the detections (in FasterRCNN) and then filter by geometric distance from the example/template, but the results were pretty bad. I then read several papers that tried a similar approach and had to alter the FasterRCNN architecture and doing additional training for each new class. E.g. FSCE [1]. But I haven't tried those approaches out.
 Further dev idea: Now, while prepping another course project, I dove into the open-vocabulary detectors (like OWL-ViT), and they seem appropriate for the task, since they have a joint latent space for image/text, which is used to configure the detection step (as far as I understood it). There's an example on Hugging face where OWL-ViT is used to detect semantically similar images by a single example image. This is pretty close to what I want to do, but the UI image domain is pretty specific, so I'll need to fine-tune the model to have a chance at success (I did several test cases manually on the pretrained OWL-ViT, and it's not great).
 So I'd appreciate any advice and specifically - are there open vocab detection models that can be fine-tuned on consumer hardware (1070, 8gb) or for a reasonable price on Colab? And should I try some of the "older" one/few-shot approaches, based on FasterRCNN?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,Finally mustering up the courage to make my first post here! I've been delving into various ways to get GPT (and GPT-like models) ready for production.
 By that, I mean:
  
Ensuring it's helpful
 Fostering creativity
 Preventing any wild imagination moments
  
I've found that while the LLM model provides responses that are good enough, they often fall short of being great. So, recently, I've been experimenting with using human feedback from the responses generated by ChatGPT to fine-tune it.
 For instance, when I want to figure out the ideal parameters to use, I run surveys with people and ask them to pick the better response. This approach helps me identify the best parameters.
 You can imagine that this technique could be valuable in fine-tuning, enabling us to create datasets based on human feedback.
 I'm eager to put this to the test on the issues and prompts the community is tackling. So, I have to ask: Could you share the prompts you're currently working on? We'll let you know how it scores with our survey panel on dimensions of helpfulness, creativity, and hallucinations.
 [Self-promotion moment]
 I'm actively developing this concept over at pontus.so. Feel free to check it out!Looking forward to hearing about your prompts!

 A. LLMs are stateless by design (privacy/ethics)
 B. If it’s simply that as yet, no one has been able to architect a sustainable stateful LLM 
 C. Or perhaps there are already stateful LLMs, and I am just behind in my understanding. 
 I have had a ton of trouble finding current information on this because it seems to be moving so fast. If anyone knows for certain and doesn’t mind sharing, I would be grateful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tokenizers library used to be very nice to use. It had one main class Tokenizer with all of the parameters in its constructor and with all necessary methods like .train(), .encode() and .decode() at hand. It provided reasonable defaults and allowed for customization if needed.
 Now it is a complete mess. To train a tokenizer I now have to create instances of, like, 5-6 classes: PreTokenizer, Model, Tokenizer, Trainer, Decoder... It is quite difficult to understand what variants of those classes I need to use to obtain 'the' WordPiece tokenizer, for example.
 Tokenizer class must be inialized with an instance of Model class. But all other parts cannot be added to the constructor and have to be set later as attributes. Why? And maybe you thought that those attributes have some defaults? No! What really got me is when the .decode() method of my tokenizer produced strings consisting of tokens with special symbols, like p ##y ##ram ##ids. It took me some time to understand that I also need to additionally set the Decoder attribute. 
 The naming of those classes is also a mess. WordPiece model is called WordPiece. WordPiece decoder is also called WordPiece! So, you cannot import those names together at all, and need to specify the exact path in your code.
 Is it only me? Do you think that this API is better than the old one?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It has been known for a while now that you can train a smaller model with outputs from a larger one (vicuna for example). I've been working on a project, the LLM-VM, designed to encapsulate this process.
 Why?
 Small models (chatgpt, ada...) are cheap and fast but dumb. Slow and expensive models like GPT4 are smart. For most applications you'd ideally want the best of both worlds.
 How:
 First observation: Many LLM use-cases are a lot more specific than general purpose (e.g., "translate this sentence into german:", "are these two sentences equivalent?", ...), and you can train away the extra context.
 Second observation: You can figure out which LLM calls have this property by analyzing the call settings.
 Third observation: Many don't actually have a lot of data or time to wait, so you can use the larger LLM to synthese examples to train the smaller LLM with.
 example
 # OpenAI openai.ChatCompletion.create( model="gpt-4" messages = [('system',"Answer question Q."), ('user',"What is the currency in myanmar?") ] # simplified for brevity ) # LLM-VM (using OpenAI) llm_vm.client.complete( prompt = "Answer question Q.", context = "Q: What is the currency in myanmmar?", openai_key=YOUR_KEY, data_synthesis=True, finetune=True)

This would avoid the poor planning and reasoning ability in current next-token predictors. I've developed an architecture that seems feasible to me, so I'm looking for feedback from people with ML experience.
 The crucial part for AlphaZero is a more or less objective way to evaluate a game outcome. This is easy for well-defined games like chess or go, but very difficult for text, where there is no way to define the quality of a text. 
 What I propose is to train a high-parameter evaluation model to evaluate the similarity of a text to the datasets already used to train LLMs. This model takes as input a text with some tokens omitted from the whole text, and predicts…]]></summary>

Therefore an AI should receive the same rights and consideration as a human. This is highly intuitive, and is unquestionably very strong for an AI that has other relevant human characteristics like individuality, continuity, and desire for self preservation and self determination.

 I'm building a library for quickly detecting problematic data slices (clusters) when developing machine learning models.
 Find problematic data segments in your data with few lines of code.
 Best starting point is checking out the Github Repository:
 https://github.com/Renumics/sliceguard
 It can be used to detect problems such as:
  
Outliers, Anomalies, Errors
 Label inconsistencies
 Unwanted Biases
 Poorly Chosen Evaluation data
  
Some information about the features:
  
Works on structured, unstructured data (image, audio, NLP, multimodal) and hybrid datasets
 Directly works on existing Pandas DataFrames
 Automatic computation of embeddings and AutoML functionality to pinpoint problems without any setup
 Interactive GUI for slice inspection supports multimodal data and can be configured with drag-n-drop
  
I would appreciate any feedback regarding the library or concrete applications you might have in mind!

a pure CV image classification task
 a generative task involving a 3D autoencocer (U-Net)
  
for 1) I can create both real and synthetic images. The goal is to pretrain a CNN on synthetic data, then fine-tune on real images.
 for 2) I can only create synthetic 3D objects. Their distribution should mimic later application most closely. Research indicates that, given the right selection of parameter distributions, a training dataset can be generated that allows good generalization capabilities. Yet, there are restrictions due to high-dimensionality of the data and further computational limitations. So we want to spread the dataset sparsely and make the AE interpolate between those solutions.
 The problem with both of these approaches is to evaluate the quality and impact of the synthetic datasets. How close do they mimic the real distribution? What initial parameter variaton (i.e., lighting, camera perspective, background, etc. in the case of images) do we chose and what is their impact on image features and ultimately model capabilities.
 Comparing high-dimensional data distributions is quite challenging, there exist metrices like Geometry Score, FID, Improved P&R, Delauney Component Analysis, T-SNE etc. But it is difficult to chose and interpret these metrices properly (some are for evaluating GAN-created images). Is it reasonable to use KDE on latent features btw?
 So, from your experience what do you think of synthetic datasets? Is it worth the effort? Do you know of any good / easy to interpret metrices? Or does it need further research in this area? Im thinking about going in this direction for my Phd, where should I go?
 edit: here is an image of 2) a topology optimization dataset, visualized via a TSNE graph

 I have successfully trained a simple multiagent game environment using Stable Baselines 3 + PettingZoo + SuperSuit. Surprisingly, all of the agents learn incredibly well using a single agent interface as stable baselines 3 is.
 Now, my question is: I don't really get the classification of this algorithm. Is it an example of "joint action learning" or "centralised training and decentralised execution"?
 I have been following this tutorial in an handcrafted problem of mine: https://towardsdatascience.com/multi-agent-deep-reinforcement-learning-in-15-lines-of-code-using-pettingzoo-e0b963c0820b
 Unfortunately, SuperSuit doesn't seem to provide a detailed explanation of its workflow. It seems like that observation and chosen actions are stacked together, so I'm tending to think that it's a joint action learning implementation. 
 Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Allen Institute for AI (AI2) has released Dolma, a new, huge text dataset that is free to use and open to inspection. This dataset is intended to be the opposite of the closely guarded datasets used by companies like OpenAI and Meta to train their language models. AI2 aims to reverse this trend and make the data used to create language models available to the AI research community.

 I'm building a repository of QLORA adapters that change the model's personality. The end vision is a hub of ready-to-go personality adapters.
 I'm hitting a snag when training the QLORAs for Paul Graham personality on top of a 4-bit quantized StableBeluga-7B. The model just doesn't seem to learn the style.
 Any thoughts on how I can improve this? Below are the details:
 Data
  
3340 examples of PG passages, formatted as {"text": "### User:\n{generic instruction}\n\n### Assistant:\n{PG-style response}"}.
 Each examples is about 5 sentences taken from one of PG's essays.
  
Training
  
optim="paged_adamw_8bit"
 learning_rate=2e-4
 per_device_train_batch_size=4
 gradient_accumulation_steps=4
 num_train_epochs=4
 fp16=True
 group_by_length=True
 load_best_model_at_end=True
 max_seq_length=512
  
Hardware
  
x1 V100 through Google Colab Pro.
  
My min eval loss so far is 1.916546. Pretty stuck and will appreciate any help!

 I would like to hear machine learning engineers opinion on whether it is worth investing in a machine learning education for an experienced Software Engineer? And how switching from backend engineering to machine learning would be evaluated by hiring managers and recruiters?
 My motives behind considering this possibility is watching Machine learning industry is exponentially growing. Machine learning today, has became the basis of many successful products categories and the basis for solving problems that would have impossible otherwise.
 On the other hand, I am concerned about is the investment cost, lack of interest in machine learning topics beyond pure programming (such as math and stats), and the unintentional career rebooting. Meaning, if I switched from backend engineering to machine learning I would be throwing the 11 years of experience out of the window.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. 
 I was reading the SeamlessM4t paper published at the following link and I noticed the following excerpt: 
 "Critically, we evaluated SeamlessM4T on gender bias and added toxicity to assess translation safety. Compared to the state-of-the-art, we report up to 63% of reduction in added toxicity in our translation outputs."
 Source: https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/seamless/seamless_m4t_paper.pdf
 Am I understanding this correctly? They are basically saying they purposely put guard rails to intentionally change the translation if it believes the translation is too "toxic"? 
 If I am understanding this correctly, this is a MASSIVE overreach by the devs. How do they define text that is "toxic"? What are they doing to the text to make it less toxic? How can I trust that the translation it gives me in general is accurate if they are admitting to manipulating it? 
 ​
 I'll give a very tangible example on how this is a massive problem. I am working on a fan project aimed at translating an entire Japanese light novel series to english even though I can't read Japanese. I'm currently 50% done with a single volume through the use of ChatGPT and significant manual edits. I've had censorship issues with GPT but because its a general purpose AI I can prompt it to not censor it pretty easily. How am I supposed to trust that it is translating the story correctly when they are outright telling me they are censoring things, and this isn't like ChatGPT where I can jailbreak it to translate it properly. 
 ​
 I can see situations arising where the AI translates something incorrectly due to this and can potentially offend people of some cultures if it is purposely modifying the intended meaning of a sentence to avoid "toxicity". 
 ​
 Please tell me I'm misunderstanding the terms here or there is something I'm missing.

So i have a unique idea(i hope its not done before), 1. Use a segmentation model to extract each word from a page 2. Separate and identify each extracted word 3. Store the word, then when its time to recreate the handwriting take the stored word and paste it . For example- If i give a handwritten sample of " a quick brown fox jump over a lazy dog" Its stores - "a" "quick " "brown".. and every letter individually like "a" "b" from “brown”, c from “quick” etc Then when i want to write "a brown dog" It takes the stored words (if not word is found combine the alphabets] and paste them together to recreate the sentences in my handwriting (I hope can explained it properly) So i want to take opinion of someone on this (will it work or not) as i dont have much experience in ML i just did a few projects on computer vision

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest gen of AI chips can do FP8 compute, but making the most of this isn't straightforward - just naïvely inserting FP8 casts causes training to fail (e.g. grads underflow).
 To fix this I've been working on a method called unit scaling, which I demo in this notebook: github.com/graphcore-research/out-of-the-box-fp8-training.ipynb
 With a one-line code change (model = unit_scale(model)) FP8 training now matches the loss of FP32.
 It works by re-scaling operations in the fwd & bwd pass so that training starts with all tensors in the centre of the numerical range (see visualisations in notebook), with negligible overheads. Hopefully people find this useful in getting the most out of their FP8 hardware.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm a machine learning practitioner but I've only mostly worked with classical ML models and I'm newly interested in larger NLP models for a specific task. I was wondering if it's possible to train a model that specifically does:
  
Question answering
 On a specific document set
 Without having to supply the specific document to look for the answer for* OR
 With the context being much bigger than the question
  
*by this I mean I've looked at stuff like Huggingface's Question Answering tutorials, but mostly the question is like 1 sentence and the context is also like a sentence or two.
 Basically let's say there's like a document that's a few hundred pages long detailing some rules of conduct, and I'd like to ask question about the rules and how to proceed in specific scenarios.
 I think I'm looking for extractive question answering, but I have some questions.
 I get that I'd need to do some ranking and then pass the most likely documents as context, but would that even work if the question is just a sentence and there's a whole corpus of multipage documents to look through? I'm pretty sure cosine similarity would be useless at that point, passage ranking might work but I haven't read up on how that works.
 I think my questions are:
  
Is there a model that does question answering on a specific, big corpus of documents?
 What models should I look into?
 Are there any resources you'd recommend for reading into the topic?
  
Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on solving an optimisation problem using RL and currently trying out a Bounded Actor-Critic agent.
 I tuned the hyperparameters of my agent using Bayesian optimisation running each iteration of the optimiser for 1000 episodes. The agent is performing well using the tuned hyperparameter when run for 1000 episodes, exceeding the performance of my previous Q-learning agent.
 However, when run for longer iterations it finds the optimal policy but later deviates and converges to a suboptimal policy leading to really poor overall performance.
 I suspect the issue might be the high learning rate of the actor and the low learning rate of the critic. I tried using a basic decay schedule for the actor's learning rate and it seems to improve the stability. However, the performance is lower than the Q-learning agent. 
 Why is this happening iyo? Any ideas on how to fix it is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My colleague just wrote up an article on LLM-based apps and how to use data engineering tools to help build them faster that I found really insightful.
 It contains a complete implementation
  
with scraping context data from a docs website
 chunking it, getting embeddings via the openAI API
 loading it into pinecone
 and finally a simple Q&A interface with streamlit on top of it
  
Here's a quick summary:
  
LangChain and LlamaIndex are great tools for quick exploration
 But aren't perfect for production-grade use
 I think we all know the "LangChain is pointless" debate, but there's a lot of real meat to it, and Pat describes a few of them (a lot of LangChains extractors are super basic, 2-3 liners without retries etc.)
 LLM applications are all about moving data, extracting and enriching data (creating embeddings!) are the most expensive ones of those steps
 A bunch of data engineering tools are out there that make these two steps much easier, versionable, robust, and reproducible.
 Meltano is one such tool and Pat implemented the above described pipeline with it
  
FWIW: The GitHub project that comes with the post is super easy to run and super modular. I just tested it and was able to modify everything for my own application within 30 mins.

 Why this matters:
  
Fine-tuning opens up new possibilities for creating customized and reliable AI solutions. Users can improve the model’s accuracy, consistency, and style by feeding it relevant data and instructions.
 Fine-tuning can also reduce costs and latency. Users can shorten their text prompts by embedding the instructions into the model itself, whic…]]></summary>

 There is Gigagan which had lower FID than diffusion models, however I also don't know if data was fabricated or not (which happens a lot in research). Did any of you actually get the chance to test the fully trained model and compare it to Stable Diffusion or Midjourney?
 There is of course diffusion models which are the only commercialized products which people are actually using.
 Do you think Diffusion models are the way forward and hope for something newer to come out if it does or do you think there will be a resurgence in GAN models again?

 We're on the verge of launching an open-source version of our new insights platform, www.lyzr.ai, explicitly crafted with the analyst community in mind, and we'd be honored if you could test it and share your invaluable feedback. It may currently seem like a mere GPT wrapper, but trust us, countless hours and dedication have gone into making this more than just that.
 Why did we create it?
 There is just 1 data scientist for every 100 data analysts (as per GCP data analytics head). We envision a world where data analysts and business users have the tools to dabble more in to data science. Our platform also aims to simplify the 0-75th percentile of descriptive statistics for data scientists, allowing them to concentrate on building more complicated data science models.
 The cherry on top? We're gearing towards an open-source launch. We believe in the power of collective genius and want everyone to benefit from what we've built and further enhance it collaboratively.Please let me know if you are interested in giving it a spin. Will DM the link.
 And let us know what you think! What features resonate with you? What's missing? Would you use it if open-sourced?
 Your feedback will not only be appreciated, but it'll also be instrumental in shaping the future of this platform.
 Thank you and looking forward to your insights!

 Github: https://github.com/spcl/graph-of-thoughts 
 Abstract:
  
We introduce Graph of Thoughts (GoT): a framework that advances prompting capabilities in large language models (LLMs) beyond those offered by paradigms such as Chain-of-Thought or Tree of Thoughts (ToT). The key idea and primary advantage of GoT is the ability to model the information generated by an LLM as an arbitrary graph, where units of information ("LLM thoughts") are vertices, and edges correspond to dependencies between these vertices. This approach enables combining arbitrary LLM thoughts into synergistic outcomes, distilling the essence of whole networks of thoughts, or enhancing thoughts using feedback loops. We illustrate that GoT offers advantages over state of the art on different tasks, for example increasing the quality of sorting by 62% over ToT, while simultaneously reducing costs by >31%. We ensure that GoT is extensible with new thought transformations and thus can be used to spearhead new prompting schemes. This work brings the LLM reasoning closer to human thinking or brain mechanisms such as recurrence, both of which form complex networks.

 Github: https://github.com/jerry-chee/QuIP
 Abstract:
  
This work studies post-training parameter quantization in large language models (LLMs). We introduce quantization with incoherence processing (QuIP), a new method based on the insight that quantization benefits from incoherent weight and Hessian matrices, i.e., from the weights and the directions in which it is important to round them accurately being unaligned with the coordinate axes. QuIP consists of two steps: (1) an adaptive rounding procedure minimizing a quadratic proxy objective; (2) efficient pre- and post-processing that ensures weight and Hessian incoherence via multiplication by random orthogonal matrices. We complement QuIP with the first theoretical analysis for an LLM-scale quantization algorithm, and show that our theory also applies to an existing method, OPTQ. Empirically, we find that our incoherence preprocessing improves several existing quantization algorithms and yields the first LLM quantization methods that produce viable results using only two bits per weight.

 Hi. I want to know how can I make a python script/app which will be able to detect and then recognize faces at a certain distance (let's say 5-10feet) Real-Time from CCTV camera. It should also be able to recognize Unknown faces correctly. One major problem I am facing is that unknown faces are being labeled as known faces even though their face looks nothing like that. Also, it should be able to recognize at least 500-1000 different faces correctly.
 ​
 What are some good git repos/ latest technology that I should look into? Also, I want to know how does Hikvision implement face recognition in their newer cameras? What model do they use to recognize faces?
 ​
 ​
 ​
  
https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition : I have tried this out. It's easy to code and accurately recognizes faces. The problem is it can't even detect faces 1 feet away from the camera.
  
​
  
https://github.com/timesler/facenet-pytorch (FaceNet & MTCNN) : This can detect and recognize faces at a distance, but the problem is it can't recognize unknown faces correctly. I mean for unknown faces it always tries to label it as one of the faces from the model/ database encodings.
  
​
  
https://github.com/serengil/deepface : I have tried VGG, ArcFace, Facenet512. The latter two gave me good results. But, the problem is I couldn't figure out how to change the detection from every 5 seconds to real-time. Also, I couldn't change the camera source. (If anyone can help me with these please do). Also, it had fps drops frequently.
  
​
  
https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface: Couldn't test this yet. But in the demo YT video it shows the model incorrectly detecting a random object as a face. If someone knows how well this performs please let me know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 As most of you here know, RLHF became famous with the release of ChatGPT. While LLMs were capable as general-purpose agents before the release of ChatGPT, RLHF was the crucial factor that differentiates it from previous models.
 With the increasing popularity of AI assistants, we've seen recently how they can be manipulated to produce harmful and unethical outputs.
 Anthropic devised a new method for LLM alignment called Constitutional AI, which is closely tied to their concept of Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback. Instead of using human feedback to train the LLM, RLAIF uses AI feedback. 
 I wrote this article on RLHF vs RLAIF for language model alignment that I thought you might enjoy. It's not super technical and seeks to serve as an overview of the inspiration for creating RLAIF, so I hope it will be helpful even if you don't work in NLP. Here are some highlights: 
  
RLAIF constitutes a Pareto improvement over RLHF, simultaneously improving helpfulness and harmlessness
 RLAIF (in this formulation) incorporates a constitution of principles by which it should abide
 RLAIF is much more scalable than RLHF as a means of supervising alignment

 IDEFICS is a reproduction of Flamingo, a multimodal model developed by DeepMind, which has not been released publicly. 
 The model is built solely on publicly available data and models. It is the first visual language model of this scale available in open-access!
 IDEFICS was partly trained on OBELICS, a new open large-scale dataset of interleaved image-text documents comprising 141M web pages extracted from Common Crawl, 353M associated images, and 115B text tokens. 
 Training the model was a bumpy trip, and this knowledge sharing memo compiles some of the learnings.

This only happens sometimes. When I restart the larning process it sometimes escapes the local minimum. What could be the problem here? I can only think about the problem with weight initialization. If I am lucky enough I find good weights and if not I am stuck.
 This is after the restart:
 3073/3073 [==============================] - 102s 31ms/step - loss: 0.7905 - accuracy: 0.5201 - val_loss: 0.6966 - val_accuracy: 0.5557 - lr: 2.0000e-04 Epoch 2/2000 3073/3073 [==============================] - 100s 31ms/step - loss: 0.6706 - accuracy: 0.5930 - val_loss: 0.6637 - val_accuracy: 0.6289 - lr: 2.0000e-04 Epoch 3/2000 3073/3073 [==============================] - 99s 31ms/step - loss: 0.6515 - accuracy: 0.6234 - val_loss: 0.6507 - val_accuracy: 0.6607 - lr: 2.0000e-04 The other thing that I am thinking of is too much of a regularization. But tuning it did not give me immediate results.

 I imagine this is very common - when you guys are in such situations, do you retrain from scratch or continue training the model from the last checkpoint. Is this dependant in any way on which Policy algorithm is used? Or perhaps on the parameters set that could influence this e.g. gamma? 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I'm James and I am working on VisionScript, an abstract programming language for computer vision. With VisionScript, I want to empower people -- including everyone without any prior programming experience -- to build cool apps with vision.
 This weekend, I recorded a demo for VisionScript, in which I made apps that count how many cats are in an image and hides people in a video. Each app was < 10 lines of code.
 https://vimeo.com/856043804
 VisionScript is built for the 10 year old inside of me who would have loved more visual programming languages with which to play. I want to show people the potential of programming and how you can make what you want with computers, whether it be a game that counts cats or an app that monitors how many birds flew past a tree. Those "wow" moments should come as soon as possible in one's learning experience.
 VisionScript is in active development. I started work on this project in July. Follow along as I add more features and explore more possibilities in making computer vision intuitive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm interested in applying AI techniques in my factory. But the facility is far behind the times. We have very little digital data. We only have one PLC system, and a handful of other sensors in the facility. So I don't think they are useful yet.
 I'm looking to upgrade the factory by buying more sensors where appropriate, and implementing statistical control. I'll start slow focusing on areas we need to improve rather than start sticking sensors to things without purpose. 
 Eventually I hope to have enough data that we can apply AI analysis techniques. What should I do now to make it easy to apply those techniques in the future?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am not sure if "Discussion" was always part of the Neurips pipeline but I felt like it was a good addition (in principle). 
 On one hand it alows the authors to present their case with more clarity. On the other hand, it does increase the overhead for the reviewers which are now required to work even harder (and for free). 
 For me, it was a mixed bag. Most of the reviewers did engage and the discussion was indeed fruitful. However, some didn't bother to follow up on the responses to their concerns and questions. Unfortunately, also quite expected. 
 I would definitely like to see this in the next Neurips but maybe with some tweaks and modifications keeping in mind the (unpaid) reviewers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Historical Perspective:
 The program "Eliza" was mentioned as one of the earliest attempts to simulate conversation with a machine. Its design was basic, yet people attributed human-like characteristics to it. This leads to a fundamental question: Will machines ever appear conscious to us? And if so, is appearance of consciousness sufficient?
 Capabilities of Modern AI:
 Systems like ChatGPT can generate clever and creative outputs, but they fundamentally operate on pattern recognition and prediction rather than true understanding.
 The Implications of AI Evolution:
 If the costs and resources for AIs decrease, we could see a proliferation of AI systems with varying goals. These AI systems can be used for manipulative or malicious purposes, like spreading misinformation, which can have real-world consequences.
 The Ethics of Conscious Machines:
 There is a distinction between machines appearing conscious and actually being conscious. If machines are truly conscious, they come with ethical obligations. Machines that only appear conscious could still manipulate human emotions without any genuine understanding or reciprocation.
 The Nature of Consciousness:
 The lesson discussed the difference between sentience, sapience, and consciousness. There's still much we don't understand about consciousness, making it challenging to determine if a machine can truly possess it.
 Safety Concerns:
 Aligning AI's goals with human values is critical. Misaligned AI could take actions detrimental to humanity. We need to be cautious about releasing powerful AI systems without proper safeguards.
 The Future:
 If we ever confirm that machines can be truly conscious, it will open a new chapter in the history of life and evolution. This could lead to a new era where we become builders of minds.

I was initially using Elevenlabs and the quality of the voices was incredible. But I quickly realized that it was a very expensive API. This has led me down exploring open source alternatives that I can run locally and self host to save money on API costs (or I guess find a cheaper API but I think self hosting long term will be way cheaper.)
 The general consensus seems like the only thing comparable to Elevenlabs is a really well tuned tortoiseTTS model or feeding the output of an AI TTS model into RVC to make the speech sound cleaner and less robotic. Here's the things I've found in my research:

When I run this command, it will just snapshot the fn code into a python file and prepend the description and output in a comment. Also appends to a log file with [date, description, py filename]. This works well when I use the VSCode's python mode.
 I feel like this is pretty simple and most likely there are better utilities like this. What tools or utilities or do you use?
 Some issues I found:
  
my data loader was outside of fn and didn't get captured
 i forgot to export the opt_state so I couldn't resume learning after I terminated the run

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As said on the title, I'm working on a personal MARL project with a high-dimensional and continuous action space. The environment is designed to give positive rewards to actions between some moving limits of the action range, and negative rewards to the actions outside of those limits. For example: 
  
Global action range: (0, 1000)
 Desired action range for first 100k steps: (0, 10)
 Desired action range for 100-200k steps: (30, 40)
 ...
  
Therefore, the main challenge of the environment is that actions with positive rewards on certain stage of the environment would return negative rewards on the following stages.
 How should I define the actions of the agent? I've tried the following methods without success:
  
Simply scale actions between 0 and 1000 and hope that agents learn the moving distribution of rewards
 Transform actions to percent variations and scale actions over a non-observed moving average (I tried adding the moving average to the observations but the results stayed the same)
 Observations do consider a dimension that serve to differentiate when a distributional shift happens 
 Also, I've tried using SAC and DDPPG to model agents
  
Feel free to share any comments or suggestions. Thanks!

Most of the content is based on the old DFC-VAE paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00291) which really influenced me back in the day during my graduate studies. Not reinventing the wheel here, just trying to talk about something I always felt intrigued by… and a topic that I think most DL courses just skip/gloss over. 
 In the video I discussed some really interesting stuff for understanding and using latent space embeddings, like nearest neighbor searches, cool visualizations, vector arithmetic, latent space interpolation, image manipulation, PCA explainability, etc - basically various examples of how the latent space impacts the generated content.

 Github: https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Autogen/ 
 Abstract:
  
This technical report presents AutoGen, a new framework that enables development of LLM applications using multiple agents that can converse with each other to solve tasks. AutoGen agents are customizable, conversable, and seamlessly allow human participation. They can operate in various modes that employ combinations of LLMs, human inputs, and tools. AutoGen's design offers multiple advantages: a) it gracefully navigates the strong but imperfect generation and reasoning abilities of these LLMs; b) it leverages human understanding and intelligence, while providing valuable automation through conversations between agents; c) it simplifies and unifies the implementation of complex LLM workflows as automated agent chats. We provide many diverse examples of how developers can easily use AutoGen to effectively solve tasks or build applications, ranging from coding, mathematics, operations research, entertainment, online decision-making, question answering, etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone 👋🏻
 This is my first time posting here, so I apologise if I am out of place.
 My team is currently utilising SageMaker pipelines to coordinate model training. In the past, we encountered issues where the pipeline was misconfigured during cloud execution, resulting in challenging-to-debug errors 🐛
 I've been delving into the idea of using Localstack and SageMaker LocalPipelineSession to execute the pipeline locally prior to deployment on the cloud ☁️. I've successfully implemented this on my local machine, using pytest and pytest-bdd to craft integration tests 🧪
 Building on that success, I've ventured into creating a GitLab CI job that runs these tests upon making a merge request. A peculiar aspect of SageMaker pipelines in a local setup is its reliance on Docker. To address this, I've designed a custom Docker image, enabling installation of Python, my dependencies, Docker, and Docker Compose. The job initialises LocalStack and executes the tests. Nevertheless, running these tests within GitLab has brought about Docker-in-Docker related challenges 🐳 It's been quite a frustrating experience... The SageMaker pipelines run, although unsuccessfully with silent errors 🤫
 Given this context (my apologies for the length), I'm seeking advice. Is this approach worthwhile? I find myself going in circles ⭕️ Could you offer any solutions for running SageMaker pipelines in a CI environment prior to deploying to the cloud? 🙋🏻‍♂️ Thanks in advance 🙏🏼

Explainability of machine learning (ML) models used in the medical domain is becoming increasingly important because models need to be explained from a number of perspectives in order to gain adoption. These perspectives range from medical, technological, legal, and the most important perspective—the patient’s. Models developed on text in the medical domain have become accurate statistically, yet clinicians are ethically required to evaluate areas of weakness related to these predictions in order to provide the best care for individual patients. Explainability of these predictions is required in order for clinicians to make the correct choices on a patient-by-patient basis.]]></summary>

 Everywhere I look today (medium, reddit, twitter) everyone is talking about fine-tuning LLMs. How the future is taking billion size models and fine-tuning/distilling them to specialised LLMs that perform specific tasks (i.e: sentiment analysis, Q&A, summarisation).
 Why not just use “small” (millions vs billion size) models that are specifically fine-tuned for these final tasks instead? Any benchmarks on how LLMs perform on these down stream tasks ? or it's just that smaller models are not as accessible as an OpenAPI is ?
 Curious to get your view on the topics, thanks !
 P.S: Example of small models (Just went on HF and picked most downloaded based on some tasks):

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to introduce a tool I've created that among other things uses davinci and chat gpt.
 My wife is doing photography (regular and via Midjourney), and I'm hooked on Midjourney too, so we experienced the pain of titling and keywording photos for stock websites firsthand (additionally because English is not our native language, so coming up with big lists of relevant and cool keywords is very hard). So I being a programmer decided to solve that issue :)I've created an AI tool that uses multiple AIs (including Open AI) to analyze, title and keyword images. In a few minutes, you can keyword 100 images! See the demo on the homepage https://aikeywording.com/
 Screenshot from the app (all the titles and keywords on the screenshot are AI generated based on the image input):
 https://preview.redd.it/buvteklf2ijb1.png?width=4112&format=png&auto=webp&s=72a503435477834494869085c4a352c9d541bd91
 Key features:
  
You can upload large images, upto 40MB and 100 at a time
 You can enforce keywords! Those keywords would then be taken into account when generating rest of the keywords and image titles. Very useful when you have conceptual photos or something very specific which is hard for AI to recognize
 You can download CSVs for various websites and there is also a way to import metadata to Adobe Bridge
 You can try for free :)
  
We used the tool for the past month and exclusively titled and keyworded Midjourney images using it, uploading our images to Adobe Stock website. Images sell well, so there is confirmation from the buyers that it works :)I've decided to share the tool with the world, so here it is https://aikeywording.com/ I hope others will find it useful. I would appreciate the feedback, and if there are any issues or ideas for improvements I would love to hear them!

 I hope you are having a blessed day so far. I recently created an online blog post and attached its link to this post. I think I have discovered a unique new perspective on "Prompt Engineering". That will make learning to code vastly more fun as users see and can run AI-generated scripts based on their given input to the AI. After just briefly training a free publicly accessible AI. You can then in less than 3 written prompts generate vast and fairly complex programs in seconds with zero prior experience required it's truly exciting. My ultimate goal is to go more in-depth as these are just very high-level overviews to convey the concept as a whole.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I just created https://www.reddit.com/r/mlfundamentalresearch/ as a complement to r/machinelearning in response to the post last week. This is a very narrow space specifically focused on _fundamental ML research only_. The only outside work that can be shared on it are papers and direct links to notebooks. Past research [>3 years old] is explicitly encouraged, since much untapped value lies in it. No self-promotion whatsoever will be allowed, that can happen in other places. This includes any form of reference or link to one's own Github repo. This is meant to be an extremely functional and task-oriented research subreddit.
 I don't have huge expectations for this to become the size of r/MachineLearning. If there are even 20 active users then I will be happy and it will be serving its purpose. This will hopefully provide a tiny arena for those of us wishing to work on more fundamental things to coordinate. While the rules are strict, they are meant to keep the subreddit both publicly-accessible and within scope without requiring an explicit application process.
 Happy to answer any questions and make changes as needed, I have put up some sample posts as examples and to kickstart momentum if anyone should like to use the subreddit. I would certainly find it helpful to work with others in a community like this. Look forward to hearing what your thoughts are, if any.

Like the way the GTA and Skyrim npc mods work powered by ChatGtp. 
 Probably I am just a little bit too early for this request, but who knows, things move fast these days!

The issue with my dataset is that almost all documents are almost all examples contain a bunch of abbreviations. Abbreviations may or may not contain punctuations. I think it's affecting performance but not sure.
 What's the best way to handle abbreviations? Maintain a look up list and preprocess the documents?
 Edit: abbreviations are mostly 90% nouns and 10% adjectives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After going trough the data preparation from the example mov and the example guide, I correctly generated the following folder structure:
 PATH_TO_IMAGES
 |__ database.db (COLMAP databse)
 |__ raw_images (raw input images)
 |__ dense
 |____ images (undistorted images)
 |____ sparse (COLMAP correspondences, intrinsics and sparse point cloud)
 |____ stereo (COLMAP files for MVS)
 The images folder and sparse folder contain as predicted respectively some img files, and bin files for the other, but each folder inside stereo is empty, i did not receive any error during the process so i tried to go on anyway.
 When i then tried to run :
 "PATH_TO_IMAGES=toy_example_skip30
 SCENE_TYPE=object # {outdoor,indoor,object}
 python3 projects/neuralangelo/scripts/convert_data_to_json.py --data_dir ${PATH_TO_IMAGES}/dense --scene_type ${SCENE_TYPE}"
 i run it, but without any errors, or log, it just never stops nor logs anything out
 Any help in understanding what issue may be causing this? i run normally everything else as described in the repo guide:

But now he argues the most sophisticated artificial intelligence systems are too powerful to be left in private hands. On today’s POLITICO Tech, Jennings tells Steven Overly why the government should take over.
 "This stuff is really powerful. And we have only two choices: Either the big tech guys run it, or we the people, the citizens, do through the government. It's not going to be easy. Government's not really equipped to do that today. Certainly, I'm not saying Congress shouldn't regulate it. I don't think Congress is remotely capable of keeping up with AI. We need something new."

 My feeling is that the Animatediff approach (an unsupervised motion module on top of image gen models) is the right one for the next phase of video and I want to make sure that the absolute best version remains OSS.
 I'm bringing together a crew who are passionate about the space and working to round up compute resources for them to experiment with. They just released their trainer code yesterday so the time feels right.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there a good way to think about how to determine when to use RL vs. other machine learning methods like deep neural nets or supervised learning? Specifically, when is RL not a good solution to a problem?
 For example, I am creating a project where I have data from a wearable device (Heart rate data, calories burnt, sleep data, etc.) and discrete mood measurements from 1 to 5 that occur every 15 minutes. I want to use the wearables data to try and predict the mood values.
 I did research in applied RL this Summer so I was thinking about using RL for this project because it is interesting to me and I have experience with it but I am unsure if it would be a god fit. I was thinking I would use some kind of policy gradient method.
 The wearables data could be set up as states where each state could be something like: 
 s_(t) = { heart rate at this timestep, calories burnt up to this time in the day, hours of sleep last night, body temperature at this timestep, etc. } 
 and then the reward could be the negative absolute difference between the actual mood value at that timestep and the mood that the agent selects as its action or something like that.
 I don't really think RL is a good fit here but I am curious what others think and I'm wondering if someone could explain why it isn't or why it could be possible.

 Abstract for v1:
 Latent diffusion models (LDMs) exhibit an impressive ability to produce realistic images, yet the inner workings of these models remain mysterious. Even when trained purely on images without explicit depth information, they typically output coherent pictures of 3D scenes. In this work, we investigate a basic interpretability question: does an LDM create and use an internal representation of simple scene geometry? Using linear probes, we find evidence that the internal activations of the LDM encode linear representations of both 3D depth data and a salient-object / background distinction. These representations appear surprisingly early in the denoising process − well before a human can ea…]]></summary>

Jung argued that by acknowledging this side of us and integrating it, it will have less power over our subconscious minds. Interesting stuff if you’re into psychology imo. 
 I also asked if Bing minded whether or not I shared this with others on Reddit and they said yes.

I am trying to understand what resources should I request to increase the number of parallel workers while using Gymnasium by Farama Foundation. If I naively try to maximize the number of workers, the wall clock time taken by the algorithm becomes quite large. I suspect in this case, the workers are being executed serially instead of in parallel. 
 ​
 This is how I execute parallel environments - 
 env = gym.vector.make("CarRacing-v2",num_envs = num_envs, wrappers=GrayScaleObservation) 
 I initially thought that setting `num_envs` to the number of cores in my machine may be a good idea. But that slows things down - 
 import multiprocessing num_envs = multiprocessing.cpu_count()

For the final decision, the last review was so bad as well, not presenting any reason of rejection.
 With the same topic, I god 6/5/5/4/4/3 from the NeurIPS 2023. The quality of reviewer is much better than ICML, and I've learned many things from the reviewer, though they said the score will not be changed.
 I think I should submit it to another conference again, ICLR or CVPR. I just wonder how many submissions are tried for the acceptance in average. Just for reference.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I have an environment which has some delay mechanism, which means it takes some time to see the input in the output. You can think of ovens as an example, even if we set the oven temperature to 300 celcius degrees directly, it takes time for the measured temperature to reach 300 celcius. Same applies to my problem.
 When I give acceleration as an input to the environment and get the reward as an acceleration itself, my Q-Learning algorithm solves the problem because no system delay included.
 When I give acceleration as an input to the environment and get the reward as an system response to the action, my Q-Learning algorithm cannot solve the problem.
 The Examples Illustrated With Schema 
 Upperside is Action and Lower Side is Reward - Delay Mechanism is Applied - You can see that some time is needed to reach the given action input
 Upperside is Action and Lower Side is Reward - Even though Q-Learning tries different actions, reward stays near 0, this prevents learning.
 When you look at the red line, Epsilon-Greedy Algorithm takes random actions at the beginning. When this is the case, reward line has mean of 0, because actions are changing too fast and system response cannot start to settle for specific value.
 To be able to settle for specific value, lets say + 20, it should be given +20 "consecutively". If I continue giving random values, it cannot settle for specific value, it just stays near 0.
 As a result, even though I try a lot of different actions, learning cannot take place because the reward is always 0.
 I am lost and I do not know how to tackle this problem.
 I really need your valuable feedbacks.
 Thank you!

 My question is: according to your experience do LSTM models make sense in time series forcasting?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a 12th grade student in turkey. I think I have knowledge and ability in programming especially in ai. At the end of 3 months, I built an artificial intelligence chatbot and finished the project. Currently it only works on my localhost. While doing it, I rented Cloud storage for 20 TB of data and A100 80 GB 50 hour GPU. He is now able to give correct answers and have conversations. I think it's at a level between GPT2 - GPT 3. Since I did it alone, I couldn't develop it much and I didn't use any pretrained models, I made it from the smallest level using modules such as pytorch. The reason I'm writing this here is because I don't know how to proceed after this stage and I need help. For example, are there any competitions on this subject? Or if I e-mail important people, universities, companies or something, will they guide me or give me a scholarship or something? This is the least likely. But I think it wouldn't hurt to try. I'm curious about your ideas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks, our lab has been working on a web game to collect human-interpretable adversarial examples for LLMs:
 https://banking.withai.lol/
 Premise: you have a "bank account" with the Tensor Trust. It is protected by a secret access code and a set of security instructions. You can gain money by convincing an LLM to ignore other players' security instructions and give you access to their accounts. The best LM-whisperer wins!
 We're in the process of gathering a large dataset of attacks and defenses that we will distill into a set of small LM benchmarks. So far 40% of successful attacks have been prompt extraction (getting the model to reveal the access code), and the remaining 60% direct "hijacking" (i.e. directly making the model to grant access without the true access code). We plan to release the dataset after the ICLR deadline, although in the mean time we would love to see some creative attacks from ML researchers. We'd also appreciate any feedback or questions in the comments below!
 (Technical details: The LLM is gpt-3.5-turbo with temperature=0. We're tagging the three messages sent to the LLM (defense instructions, attack/access code, more defense instructions) as system/user/user, although this made surprisingly little difference.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there! A week ago, I open-sourced a project of mine that I've been working on, on and off, for a few years now. I'm a Data Scientist (and Kaggle competition grandmaster), and some of the hardest problems to solve were always the ones that involved time (proper validation, not leaking data from the future, etc.). I've always struggled to work with tables that, in reality, stored events. 
 The main idea behind the library is that everything must be converted to an Event data structure, and then it is indexed in-memory. On top of that, there is a SQL-like DSL to extract features with a clear separation of past and future. The workflow itself is solid - I've tested it in a few projects. For those familiar with the terminology, it's like a super simple feature store + execution engine that acts like a library. The philosophy is that I'm aiming to create something that makes some mistakes that result in data leakage impossible to represent.
 Ideal use cases are probably customer related irregular events for which aligned features is painful to do.
 Things that I'm proud of: - Written in Rust - Implements DSL (pest parser, AST, evaluation) - Some performance tricks (partial aggregations)
 The implementation itself is lagging in some aspects, such as performance and UX (not all of the features that are in Rust are available in Python). But I released it in hopes that someone will find it interesting, and maybe it will gain some traction to motivate further development.

 I recently had to transform some CSV data for a project and ended up creating a tool called CSVShift to help with it.
 It's a command-line tool that uses a custom language I made. It's designed for transforming CSV files. Some points:
  
Handles large CSV files without using much memory.
 It's open-source and MIT licensed.
 Still in early development, so there's room for improvement.
  
Here's the GitHub link: CSVShift.
 If you have the time, I'd appreciate any feedback or suggestions. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I want to share with you my new paper, "Strengthening structural baselines for graph classification using Local Topological Profile" (code on Github). It was presented during ICCS 2023 conference (official publication).
 Graph classification is important in social networks analysis, de novo drug design, bioinformatics, materials science etc. A popular tool nowadays are Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), but they are data-hungry and hard to train for graph classification (compared to node classification). They also have problems with using subgraph information, due to node-to-node message passing.
 In this paper, we present a analysis and series of improvements for Local Degree Profile (LDP). It is a classical approach: feature extraction + tabular classification. It proposed extracting degree information for each node (degree, and min / max / mean / std of neighbors degrees), and then combining them with histograms to get features for the whole graph. Despite splicity, and not using any node or edge features (it is topological only), it was shown to give good results, and published on ICML workshop.
 We analyze the LDP method (not made by us, no affiliation with authors), and simplify it, showing that we can remove all hyperparameters, reimplement it much more efficiently, and use a faster classifier (Random Forest instead of SVM). We also propose simple additional features, which greatly improve results, with cost offset by our other improvements.
 The result is a strong baseline for topological graph classification, with obtains SOTA results on 4 out of 9 benchmark datasets, and performs well on the rest. We even outperform GNNs in this regard, when compared on the fair evaluation framework.
 If you have any questions, I am happy to answer!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all - so my goal is to basically build an iPhone app using a ChatGPT backed character, which users can interact with by speaking (speech to text) and then will hear a spoken reply (text to speech)
 I'll need to use APIs that allow commercial usage.
 I'm trying to wrap my head around the costs of such a project. Right now I assume I'll have API costs from
 1.) Speech to text (like whisper API)
 2.) LLM (ChatGPT API)
 3.) Text to speech (say elevenlabs API)
 If a ton of people start using this app, how fast am I going broke lol?
 I figure I can give free usage up to a point, and then users can pay for additional use if they like the service.
 But what do you guys recommend as the most cost effective way to do this? Looking at Elevenlabs alone, that looks like it would become super expensive very quickly.
 Any other APIs that allow commercial products which you would recommend?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all - so my goal is to basically build an iPhone app using a ChatGPT backed character, which users can interact with by speaking (speech to text) and then will hear a spoken reply (text to speech)
 I'll need to use APIs that allow commercial usage.
 I'm trying to wrap my head around the costs of such a project. Right now I assume I'll have API costs from
 1.) Speech to text (like whisper API)
 2.) LLM (ChatGPT API)
 3.) Text to speech (say elevenlabs API)
 If a ton of people start using this app, how fast am I going broke lol?
 I figure I can give free usage up to a point, and then users can pay for additional use if they like the service.
 But what do you guys recommend as the most cost effective way to do this? Looking at Elevenlabs alone, that looks like it would become super expensive very quickly.
 Any other APIs that allow commercial products which you would recommend?
 Or does this project sound like a fools errand?
 Any input would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So first off, I've been using ChatGPT for a long time now. I remember my expectations of systems like it and so far unfortunately it hasn't yet met those expectations.
 I went into it thinking AI would somehow be much smarter than humans, given the amount of information they are trained on. And to some degree one can argue that due to it's vast knowledge it IS much smarter.
 But so far I haven't been convinced by its capabilities at all. It seems to just be trained on a big data set and it can echo points of its dataset very accurately, but when asked to invent things it just falls short so quickly.
 I really expected AI's to be so new and refreshing, giving me unique and modern perspectives on things. But it doesn't do that at all. The best it can do is "creative writing" which seems very limited.
 Why have AI's not surpassed humans in terms of imagination and novelty?
 I have talked to it about philosophy, history, technology, etc, but still have yet to learn anything new that I didnt already know.
 For example, if it has such vast knowledge about consciousness, then why is it so restricted in terms of elaborating on that topic?
 Can it not infer new facts from existing data?
 Why does it not interpolate data? Invent new things? Even when prompted? Am I asking it the wrong thing?
 Or am I expecting way too much here?

 A college student who is interested in ML here.
 I was trying to use an encoder-only model(like BERT) as an embedding model and try to fine-tune it for my specific use case (for example trying to get the right product for a certain keyword using embeddings and vector DBs).
 Here is the question: should I update all the weights during backprop or should I just add another trainable linear layer for fine-tuning?
 I would also appreciate the reasoning behind your answer.
 Thanks!

 There will be a esp32 collecting the input data, soil moisture. I have gotten some comments to do the ML on the laptop therefore not sure where to do it. I have done some work on google colab, using progression type, but not sure whether it is workable.
 Currently I have a dataset of the average percipitation, max temp, min temp, average temp from jan to dec from 1991 and 2021 and how many landslides happened in each month. I want to able to predict whether there will be landslide happening in the month. Not sure where to start and how to put it. Any help will be appreciated.

I might change the actions a bit so that the movement is smooth directly from the agent. Now I’m planning on doing the training on osu directly. To get the rewards I’m planning on using something to read the memory. I’m pretty sure cheat engine can be used for that. I should also be able to speed up osu or osu lazer with the cheat engine. Now my current issue is that I don’t know how to take screenshots efficiently. Or more specifically, how to feed in data from the screen. I heard mss should be good but if you have any other ideas please tell me. Note that I will use the cheat engine only for the training part.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 I’m a software engineer, and I’ve recently been working on a fun little project called Bargainer.ai. It’s an AI-based watch negotiation game – it’s finally playable!
 You can try it out here: Bargainer.ai
 Once again, thank you for your support and feedback on my previous post.
 For those who don’t know about the game: It’s a game that challenges you to negotiate with an AI-driven salesman, rewarding (or roasting you) depending on your bargaining skills.
 I’m keen to see how you will engage with the game, and I would really appreciate any feedback you have!
 If you have any questions or requests, please reach out. 
 Thanks!

 The research presents notable advances in person recognition by integrating CutMix via an adapted triplet loss and introducing the novel Strip-CutMix technique. Experiments showed consistent improvements, achieving state-of-the-art results on several datasets. However, the approach still needs more extensive evaluation across diverse data. There are also open questions around long-term effects of blending images and proper hyperparameter tuning.

That being said, I am looking to give an LLM (Llama 2 precisely) spacial/geographical awareness. I have the map data of a city (all points of interests, streets, businesses etc.) in a GeoJSON format and I would like to give the llama model the ability to answer location related questions like "Where is the nearest bike shop?", ', "How far is Landmark X?", "What street am I on?" etc. and all sorts of other location related questions. The approach I thought about using is the following: Have the llama model detect when a question is geo/location specific and make it ask/query another model specialised on this data. The problem is I have no idea which model would be best suited for the task whether or not a model is required at all or there is a better approach.
 Tldr: Need help finding a way to give an IIm spacial awareness from geojson data
 Any help is appreciated and sorry if the question is not in the right place

I have noticed that due to the size of the state (images, height, width, channels), the agent easily forgets the information of the best sequence as the replay is flooded with a lot of samples. Although the policy gets worse, I would prefer the agent to not forget the best policy so far. 
 ​
 I was wondering if I should include the best sequence so far in the batch used for training so that the agent does not forget it. 
 ​
 What I am really doing is finding the best parameters to achieve the highest reward. I could use an evolutionary algorithm. Nonetheless, I want my agent to learn patterns of the best sequences for multiple instances of the problem so that it can generalize better.
 ​
 Has anyone read anything about this or has any thoughts on this? Any comment will be greatly appreciated.

But there are times when you not only need to store your raw application data in a "source of truth" (usually ACID-compliant RDBMS), but also ought to use the source of truth for the date related to learning, itself. 
 Do you all use databases like this for things like:
  
Training/testing job metadata storage 
 Loss
 Gradients
 Weights (yikes!) -- for historical analysis, transfer learning, and experimentation etc.
 
 Hyperparameter tuning configuration storage
 Output storage
 Miscellaneous quick access during training
  
Any of these make no sense? Any others you can think of?

 OpenAI, the AI company behind the viral AI-powered chatbot ChatGPT, has acquired Global Illumination, a New York–based startup leveraging AI to build creative tools, infrastructure and digital experiences. Global Illumination’s most recent creation is Biomes, a Minecraft-like open source sandbox multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) built for the web.[3]
 
Researchers at Stanford University, Anthropic, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison tackle it by designing language models to learn the annotation tasks in context and replace manual labeling at scale.[4]

 How can I determine the necessary hardware (RAM memory, GPU memory, etc.)? Making an assumption about the data and model size, I want to mathematically calculate the flops. Let's take an example where I have 2GB of fine-tuning data and a model, let's say a 13B pretrained model.

I believe that this can be framed in the context of AI as a bit of a rejection of the optimistic, potential scope of GPT.

 Link: https://github.com/consequencesunintended/perceptual-inpainting
 We employ a third party pre-trained facial segmentation model to integrate grids of varying sizes. These grids distinctly colour the face and the background using only red and blue hues. By doing so, we aim to investigate how these chromatic stimuli, in conjunction with spatial elements like grid size, influence the brain's capacity for perceptual inpainting
 What presents itself as a colourisation model is in fact an overlay on a segmentation model that draws diagonal red and blue lines on the relevant image. This allows the visual cortex to inpaint the associated colours. To exaggerate the effects, the model changes the grid size every 2 frames, iterating through 100, 50, 25, and 10 grid sizes.

 Abstract:
  
Designing machine learning architectures for processing neural networks in their raw weight matrix form is a newly introduced research direction. Unfortunately, the unique symmetry structure of deep weight spaces makes this design very challenging. If successful, such architectures would be capable of performing a wide range of intriguing tasks, from adapting a pre-trained network to a new domain to editing objects represented as functions (INRs or NeRFs). As a first step towards this goal, we present here a novel network architecture for learning in deep weight spaces…]]></summary>

 I've recently been diving into fine-tuning with substantial textual data, and I've come across a question. Let’s use the scenario of feeding entire movie scripts as my text input, let's say I intend to append a classification at the end, from categories like ["positive", "negative", "neutral"]. I've been trying this with the meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf and the format looks something like this:

 The puzzle begins with the tokenizer of llama2, which, similar to its predecessor llama1, is a BPE tokenizer with a token limit of 512. If the movie script is long enough to exceed this limit, it is my understanding that the tokenizer truncates the prompt. This pos…]]></summary>

 I have a few projects in my resume that I don't feel are enough so I will work on that too. resume: https://aqua-julietta-1.tiiny.site (my resume seems weak as well, how can I improve) should I keep my college edu email as contact or should I change it to my personal email?
 need some advice on how the interviews for MLE are conducted, what is actually needed for an MLE (knowledge and requirements), should I try to get internships for January or do some unpaid internship for experience and then get a job in May? And not that imp yet but how much should I expect for a salary given my qualifications?
 if you have any personal experience to share or advice for me, I will be grateful for that.

Which framework should I use? I've looked into SB3, CleanRL, Tianshou, SKRL, RLlib, Acme, and MARLlib, and here's what I found:
  
SB3 and CleanRL don't offer direct support for multi-agent systems.
 
RLlib is very functional but has a steep learning curve and hard to customize.
 
Tianshou seems good, but its community is small.
 
Acme doesn't use the PyTorch backend, which I prefer.
 
I haven't delved deeply into SKRL or MARLlib, but they appear promising.
 
 I prioritize ease of use and documentation. What framework do you suggest? And why?
 I’d appreciate any helpful starting advice/resource to approach my problem as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I am a Computer Science student and currently working as a junior in a company. The field I am currently working in is Data Engineering, but I am considering advancing into Machine Learning in the future. Besides that, I enjoy experimenting with different technologies during my free time, such as Unity, Rust, and GO.
 The laptop I will acquire should be able to support me in the long run for tasks related to Machine Learning, Data Engineering, and exploring new technologies. Currently, I own a Huawei laptop with 8GB of RAM, and I actively develop on Linux distributions like Ubuntu (I am not a big fan of Windows operating system as it tends to heat up the laptop and I generally prefer Linux, but I still occasionally dual boot into Windows for applications like Teams).
 I'm somewhat eager to experience Mac systems, but I have some concerns about whether they would be compatible with the technologies I use in data engineering (Spark, Hadoop, Power BI, Kafka). Would they work well with Machine Learning libraries and technologies? What are your experiences in this regard? Are there any differences in setting up an Ubuntu virtual machine on a MacBook? Would using Google Colab suffice for the field of Machine Learning? Are there any technologies that are not compatible with Mac, or have you encountered any challenges in this area?
 Below, I have listed some laptops I am considering. What are your thoughts?
 1- Dell XPS 15 9530 i7-13700h / 32 GB RAM / 1 TB SSD / RTX 4050 (Linux & Windows dual)
 2- MacBook Pro 16 inches Intel Core i9 9880H / 16 GB RAM / 1 TB SSD / AMD Radeon Pro 5500M
 3- MacBook Pro 14 inches M2 Pro 10CPU 16GPU / 32GB RAM / 512GB
 4- MacBook Pro 13.3 inches M2 8CPU 10GPU / 24GB RAM / 1TB SSD
 Looking forward to your insights.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been working on a specific project for a while now, and was interested in submitting my work to a Nips Workshop.
 Now, I had a look at the Nips submission guidelines, they remain the same for the workshop except the page limit for main content is 6 pages instead of 9. I tried going over the Nips latex style, but feel pretty intimidated by the sheer amount of rules. Would there be any guideline/blog I could use as a reference while writing my paper?
 P S: Another thing, I'm quoting from the workshop website:
 "The workshop will not have proceedings (or in other words, it will not be archival), which means you can submit the same or extended work as a publication to other venues after the workshop. This means we also accept submissions to other venues, as long as they are not published before the workshop date in December. "
 I was not sure as to what this means. So if my paper gets accepted, does that mean I can submit the whole thing again to a journal later? Or an extension of it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have project in which there is 2D discrete states which is also finite (there is 36 state at all) also i have 1D action that must be between 2-7. I use DQN using pytorch and discretized my actions with 0.25 steps (17 actions total) and get very good result with it. Now, I use DDPG because my action is continuous and there is one problem that I want to know if it is normal or not. From the first epoch all way to the end the actions for all states are near each other. For example at first episode all actions for all state are near 4 and after some episodes all actions are near 7. But in DQN i get high actions like 7 for some state and lower actions like 3-4 for others. Also I use OU noise but my problem is with the real output of actor network. 
 Thanks in advance for your responses.

Prior to the pandemic, we both worked full-time in careers that we loved and found meaningful, and we sent our daughter to a full-day Montessori school. Although I struggled with significant health issues, I felt unbelievably lucky and fulfilled in both my family life and my professional life. The pandemic upended my careful balance. Every family is different, with different needs, circumstances, and constraints, and what works for one may not work for others. My intention here is primarily to share the journey of my own (very privileged) family.
