        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I’m an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer. I want to be a practitioner. Building, deploying, and evaluating models to solve problems.
 Ideally I want to land a job in Tech as an MLE. I struggle at times to stay committed to building side projects, studying ML algos, etc.
 I have a background in hardware specific C++ SWE stuff for 3.5 yrs, but not much in the way of ML and web backend. I do have a decent amount of python coding from other experiences and it’s my preferred language.
 Would anyone be interested in forming a discord to talk about what we are doing to prepare, practice interview each other, stay accountable to each other, etc?
 Had a few people show interest in r/ArtificialInteligence already
 If so comment below! Let’s do this!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Insilico Medicine, an AI-driven biotech company, has announced its AI-designed COVID-19 drug is entering Phase I clinical trials. Promising to deliver lasting results against all variants, this could become the first viable alternative to Paxlovid.
 To stay on top of such cutting-edge advancements in AI, look here first.
 Insilico's breakthrough medicine, ISM3312
  
Generated using Artificial Intelligence, ISM3312 may offer the superior solution to the constraints of current oral medication, Paxlovid.
 Insilico’s new drug could address the limitations of Paxlovid, including unpleasant side effects and drug resistance due to constant COVID mutation.
 Preclinical studies reveal the drug’s potential in reducing the viral load in lung tissue and mitigating lung inflammation.
  
Development powered by AI
  
Identified via AI-driven platform PandaOmics, the drug effectively targets crucial proteins in the coronavirus.
 Using Chemistry42, a generative chemistry platform, Insilico generated new molecules built to suppress this protein, creating ISM3312.
 Given the success, the company patented ISM3312, which is currently undergoing Phase I Clinical trials, with results expected by end 2023.
  
The Implications
  
Dr. Harvey Castro, an emergency medicine physician, encourages doctors to remain cautious but also recognizes the promise of AI-generated drugs like ISM3312.
 With the trials in progress, the medical community is closely monitoring it as it could redefine the treatment course for COVID and other similar viruses.
 Insilico's venture exhibits AI's potential in accelerating effective drug discovery, prompting the need for consistent tracking of AI's transformation of healthcare and other fields.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! Last year we launched a tool to make it easier to deploy ML models into production behind REST APIs.
 Our first prototype was focused on small models built with Scikit-Learn and XGBoost, but pretty quickly we got a lot of requests to support bigger, more complex models built on Tensorflow, Pytorch and Transformers.
 From detecting model dependencies to building out auto-scaling compute, it's been a lot of fun working through the challenges to make this product scale.
 We've built a few tutorials to showcase deploying some interesting and complex models to REST Endpoints. The latest one we released is a tutorial showing how to deploy a Grounding DINO model to a Rest API Endpoint for open-set object detection with prompts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I know that embeddings work by finding words that are used in similar contexts or found around some input word. This allows us to find similar words based on proximity to other words and in a way, map a relationship between an input word and other words.
 But I assume children learn what words mean and the intuition behind them, by hearing the word and associating it with visuals or a specific scenario in front of them which helps them to add context to that word and how it is used.
 If we were to emulate how children learn words, could we or is there an architecture that allows us to take an input word, find images with the input word in there (Object detection) and then extract the context from the images (other objects and their position and relation to the input word) then convert that context to phrases and query those phrases the next time that a word is inputted to see other phrases or words that are similar to the input word based on whether or not they appear in the images of the input word.
 Not sure if it makes sense or if it is even useful compared to embeddings but I was thinking about how we could emulate how children learn words to see if we could draw influence from that. Just wondering if there’s a similar approach to this where we use context from images to find similar words and phrases to some input.

Usually my first thought when I try to augment my ML models is input data preprocessing. In case of NER stop word removal and removal of punctuation, numbers and one-character words came to mind - they are hardly ever named entities so I woulndt loose many training examples. However, NER does in fact require context to work, so removing stuff could prove harmfull in the end? I am kind of torn. Should I do it? Are there better data augmentation approaches? I would be really thankfull for any kind of hint

With multi-modal pre-training, we can directly query the image content based on a set of questions of interest and the model will be able to answer these questions. This enables users to chat with the image to confirm if it contains any inappropriate content that violates the organization’s policies. We use the powerful generating capability of LLMs to generate the final decision including safe/unsafe labels and category type. In addition, by designing a prompt, we can make an LLM generate the defined output format, such as JSON format. The designed prompt template allows the LLM to determine if the image violates the moderation policy, identify the category of violation, explain why, and provide the output in a structured JSON format.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Out-of-distribution examples are images that are cearly irrelevant to the task at hand. Unfortunately, deep neural networks frequently assign random labels with high confidence to such examples. In this article, I want to discuss an adversarial way of computing high-confidence out-of-distribution examples, so-called distal adversarial examples,  and how confidence-calibrated adversarial training handles them.

This can help cut costs of the architecture, allowing the endpoint to run only when requests are in the queue and for a short time-to-live, while scaling down to zero when no requests are waiting to be serviced. This sounds great for a lot of use cases; however, an endpoint that has scaled down to zero will introduce a cold start time before being able to serve inferences.]]></summary>

 I am currently creating computer vision models for segmentation and classification, and I am looking for a tool that is very user friendly. We have been using CVAT so far, and apparently, its UI is too cluttered. So, we need something easier to use.
 Segment Anything and other auto-segmentation tools simply do not work on our dataset. So, I do not want a tool that is user friendly because it uses AI.
 Any thoughts?

 My initial idea was to only maintain the header of the packets and to discard the data payload. But even in this case the dataset remains huge and the number of entries is crazy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 I am training an agent via PPO. The environment is a node removal ('n' number of actions which are nodes on the graph) with evaluation after each node removed. the state is represented by a trained graph attention network in the environment with the average of the node embeddings on the graph representing the state of dimension size 'n'. The embedding of the a node that has been removed is subtracted from overall graph embedding representation to represent the 'removal' of that node. 
 However, I want to absolutely be certain, that given a state representation, in a new unseen graph, the agent will not select a node that is absent from that graph. In the event that the state representation may not be granular enough and might cause the agent to think that a node on the graph is present when it is not, are there ways to mitigate this? Two ideas I have are:
  
mask actions for nodes that are not present (this is already done after node removal to prevent the agent from selecting the same node again), but is this valid to do in an unseen graph if I a priori mask nodes that are not present in the action space
 Inject a second input to the policy network such as a one-hot encoding of nodes that have already been selected as an input in addition to the state representation of the graph, so that it models finer dependencies between the state and action taken. However is this valid? 
  
Any thoughts are appreciated! thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been running hyperparameter optimization for an LGBM multi-classifier model with randomized search with 10fold stratified cv as well as oversampling on each fold using SMOTE as follows:
 # Create a pipeline with SMOTE oversampling smote_pipeline = make_pipeline(SMOTE(random_state=42), lgbm_clf) # Initialize 10-fold stratified cross-validation cv = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=10, shuffle=True, random_state=42) # Initialize RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning using the pipeline random_search = RandomizedSearchCV( estimator=smote_pipeline, param_distributions=param_dist_with_prefix, n_iter=n_iter, scoring=f1_macro_scorer, n_jobs=n_cores, pre_dispatch=n_cores, cv=cv, random_state=42 
 I wanted do incorporate early stopping based on the validation set from the nth iteration of cv. However this does not seem possible using the current API if I am correct.
 If I wanted to use a predefined validation set the code would be sth like this but I want to perform validation using 10 fold-cv validation set only:.
 mode l= lgb.LGBMClassifier() clf = RandomizedSearchCV( model, parameters, fit_params={ 'early_stopping_rounds':20, 'eval_set':[(X,y)] }, cv=cv ) 
 My questions are:
 1- Does it make sense to use early stopping during randomized search?
 2- Do you know a way I could do it?
 3- If not, is it a good idea to use randomized search without early stopping and train a new model with early stopping using the best parameters resulting from randomized search?
 Bonus Question: Does it make sense to run randomized search with f1_macro scoring from sklearn instead of multilogloss in case of imbalanced classes?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am currently working on predicting 2D deformations of objects. These objects are available as 2D contours in my code. I am splitting these contours into 1000 points with an equal distance in the direction of the x axis. I have about 70 data entries. 
 The following picture shows one of these objects:
 Comparison before and after
 The red data series contains the points before and the blue series contains the points after the deformation.
 My model should take in a series of coordinates before the deformation. Using this information the model should predict the coordinates after the deformation. 
 I have tried using the LSTM Model from keras. Unfortunately I wasn't able to produce useful results. The way I structured my data is the following:
 [
 [
 [x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], ... 1000 coordinate pairs
 ], [
 [x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...
 ],
 .... 70 entries
 ] 
 The structure for the input and the output series is the same. 
 When trying to train the model I have a very low loss and low validation loss as well:
 Overview during training of model
 The test loss is also quite similar:
 Overview test loss
 However when looking into the predictions I get results like these:
 Visualized prediction after training
 The prediction is not close to what it should be like. Also the prediction seems to not change even when changing the input. 
 ​
 Do you have an idea about why my ML model does not work? Are there examples on this topic available? Should I change my approach in any way?
 Thank you in advance! Any help is appreciated!
 ​
 If you need my jupyter-notebook, it would be great if somebody could tell me, how to link files on Reddit :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks! I wanted to advertise Equinox -- my now-surprisingly-popular ( :D ) JAX library for numerical models. These days that often means "neural networks", but I like to emphasise that this also includes ODEs/SDEs/linear solves, etc.
 Here's the GitHub link: https://github.com/patrick-kidger/equinox
 For those already using JAX, then Equinox is interesting because (a) it ships with a NN library, and (b) this is built around the idea that "everything is a pytree", which makes things easy to reason about and easy to compose. Furthermore (c) Equinox offers advanced tools like true runtime errors, out-of-place pytree surgery, and checkpointed while loops, and AFAIK in the JAX ecosystem these are unique to Equinox.
 For those most familiar with PyTorch: for many use cases (sciML in particular), JAX has a much stronger compiler, more advanced autodiff, etc. And whilst JAX itself is akin to the torch.* namespace, libraries like Equinox are then akin to the torch.nn.* namespace.
 Because of its speed and features, right now JAX+Equinox is my favourite approach to numerical computing. So I'd love for some more people to try it. What do you think?

 -Does Kubeflow offer a suitable solution for running tasks across multiple machines? (Either data parallel or model parallel tasks).
 -How does resource provisioning work with it? Is it able to automatically select the machines that best suits the resource requirements or does it require the user to select where to run the job? Is it able to scale vertically/horizontally?
 Thanks in advance.

 I think we all agree that having a flexible configuration is crucial to successful ML experimentation. There are a million python config libraries out there, some dedicated to configs like hydra and others that support configs as a convenience feature like transformers.HfArgumentParser. So why did I decide to write yet another library?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learning a skill, for me, was never about securing knowledge that privileged me over everyone else who did not put the work in. While often, it did feel like drinking Kool-Aid, buying in to these groups like yoga and climbing, I knew I was not there to rub elbows, but to discover the how behind it. Some leaders of some groups did create a barrier of entry, a necessary proving point, but I have always seen these loops to jump through as a challenge - once completed - a spy. Every skill you have learned has prepared you not to be better at that skill, but to learn a new skill with more ease. It is uncomfortable to learn something new, like drinking from a fire hydrant, but the more sips you take from that blasting surge of water, the more you realize it is all part of the process. We get blasted, we sip, we get overwhelmed, we come back. Just because there is a tool that regulates the blasting, that holds our hand through the overwhelm, does not mean all our hard work has been for nothing. In fact, it means we are more prepared, more primed, to receive all of the beauty and knowledge coming our way. Now, friends, we become CURATORS. :) xo

Technically, is this a way for a computer to input language of a person and then convert it into machine code (0s and 1s)? Or, is this a way to turn human language into some computer language like Python, and then turn into machine code as a second step?
 I am assuming that NLP has only just recently become widely used (like in Chat GPT). Was it a huge jump to go from a machine understanding a computer programming language like Python to a machine understanding ordinary human language? Why was it so much more difficult to train computers to understand the later?
 Thanks!

 Abstract:
  
Neuromodulators in the brain act globally at many forms of synaptic plasticity, represented as metaplasticity, which is rarely considered by existing spiking (SNNs) and nonspiking artificial neural networks (ANNs). Here, we report an efficient brain-inspired computing algorithm for SNNs and ANNs, referred to here as neuromodulation-assisted credit assignment (NACA), which uses expectation signals to induce defined levels of neuromodulators to selective synapses, whereby the long-term synaptic potentiation and depression are modified in a nonlinear manner depending on the neuromodulator level. The NACA algorithm achieved high recognition accuracy with substantially reduced computational cost in learning spatial and temporal classification tasks. Notably, NACA was also verified as efficient for learning five different class continuous learning tasks with varying degrees of complexity, exhibiting a markedly mitigated catastrophic forgetting at low computational cost. Mapping synaptic weight changes showed that these benefits could be explained by the sparse and targeted synaptic modifications attributed to expectation-based global neuromodulation.

However, not all tokens are equally important, especially for longer documents. 
 CoLT5, a long-input Transformer model that builds on this intuition by employing conditional computation, devoting more resources to important tokens in both feedforward and attention layers. CoLT5 can effectively and tractably make use of extremely long inputs, showing strong gains up to 64k input length.
 In this video, we walk through the ColT5 paper and explain what is T5, longT5, UL2 and PEGASUS, then discuss how ColT5 has advantage over previous methods for few-shot and 1-shot tasks.

 Abstract:
  
Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) have been shown to effectively encode positional information in transformer-based language models. However, these models fail to generalize past the sequence length they were trained on. We present YaRN (Yet another RoPE extensioN method), a compute-efficient method to extend the context window of such models, requiring 10x less tokens and 2.5x less training steps than previous methods. Using YaRN, we show that LLaMA models can effectively utilize and extrapolate to context lengths much longer than their original pre-training would allow, while also surpassing previous the state-of-the-art at context window extension. In addition, we demonstrate that YaRN exhibits the capability to extrapolate beyond the limited context of a fine-tuning dataset. We publish the checkpoints of Llama 2 7B/13B fine-tuned using YaRN with 64k and 128k context windows at https://github.com/jquesnelle/yarn .

 I have just completed my MSc and am looking for open PhD positions (preferably funded) in RL to join. My masters thesis was on Hierarchical RL and skill discovery, so that’s the domain am mostly interested in since I have spent quite some time researching it but also open to other interesting avenues. If there are any such positions available at your workplace/lab please let me know. Thanks…..

 What is your experience regarding image sequences from videos in the training datasets? 
 My intuition is, that the added information to the dataset from one video isn't proportional to the number of frames. The network probably can't learn much more from 30 frames with little variation in comparison to a single image (at least if you use augmentations). What do you think about this? Or do you even know any research in the direction of this question?

This is often the most important reason for using a policy-based learning method. ". Is he referring to some kind of Bayesian technique? I'd highly appreciate some examples here.

Are there any products like that? Forgive me if this is too basic; I've only dabbled in ChatGPT and MidJourney to see what the fuss is about. Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My question is more focused on the pre-processing side, rather than the training side of things.
 I have a local RAG Q&A pipeline set up for personal documents (local regulations, technical manuals, stuff like that), and I'm looking for ways to improve it. 
 All the documents I'm working with are consistently structured, with nested bullets of varying depth making up most of the structure. So far I've been manually writing/tweaking a python script I wrote to recursively extract the nested bullets and duplicate their hierarchy parents' content for each of the inner-most bullets, that way each bullet has all the contextual content it needs to be valuable in a vacuum. 
 So something like: (a) 1. A. B.
 Would turn into: (a) + 1. + A. (a) + 1. + B.
 This works well in the sense that my LLM does a wonderful job answering my questions and citing the right sources, but the lion's share of my work goes into the tweaking of my parser scripts, or creating new ones entirely. I've played around with semantic segmentation via embedding models, but it doesn't really work here since I'm trying to retain the nested structure of the document for citation accuracy.
 Does anyone have any ideas for ots solutions that address this kind of thing? I can't be the only person who has run into this type of problem, but I've been having a really hard time finding relevant libraries/software that can even get me 80% of the way there.
 Also, I'm totally happy to hear what you guys have done and how's it's worked out/what walls you've hit!
 Edit: I suppose I should have included my current attempt as well, so it's doesn't look like I'm treating this subreddit like Google lol

 I have questions about data contracts!
 Schema evolution, where the schema of the destination evolves based on incoming data is nice for ingesting transactional data.
 However, there are scenarios where we might not want this automatic evolution. For example, when other parts of our infrastructure require a fixed schema or when we want to store only data that conforms to the current schema. This is where a data contract comes into play.
 Our plan is to implement a straightforward version of this concept initially. We're considering introducing settings on the pipeline to control schema evolution, and here are some modes we're thinking about:

 The short of the paper is they show that an AI algorithm that can only learn via sampling from human action is unable to tractably simulate human behavior.

 ​
 1 - It only seems to apply for AIs trained to mimic humans via sampling human behavior: 
 The paper assumes the AI is trained via an arbitrary machine learning algo M that samples from possible human behaviors in given situations. This matches pretty well to how a lot of LLMs are pretrained (guess the next token), but doesn't seem to apply to any sort of reinforcement learning, since in those situations you are not training the …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This was a small project I was working upon which adds a recurrent prior to attention-based models. 
 This allows integrating an adaptive-computation mechanism, leading to much better length-extrapolation capabilities (compared to vanilla transformers). On some tasks, I'm able to OOD extrapolate to quite an appreciable extent!
 Its also (relatively) quite parallelizable with slightly different training regimes - thus, hopefully being scalable as well. Being lightweight, it might be useful for inferencing as it saves on memory (trading off compute instead).
 It's interesting to think that MHSA might contain an implicit inductive bias that prevents extrapolation. Replacing that with other variants helps a lot - I go in detail in the writeup!

But I recall a series of follow up works (notably https://openreview.net/forum?id=ry_WPG-A-) that called a lot of the results into question, and (I think?) people drifted away from it.
 I saw this recent paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09355) on the IB and self-supervised learning, and it got me wondering what the current views are as to how useful/accurate the IB view of deep learning is?

 I could not find an associated codebase with that paper. If I wanted to create a similar UI like theirs anything you would recommend?
 More specifically, if I want to replicate the paper in 3 months full time (as a student with some experience in ML), what would be the best approach to the UI part of the paper. What if deployment is a concern? I was intially thinking of simple python frameworks like PySimpleGui, or maybe something more comprehensive like PyQt. I am rather unfamiliar with more common web frontend frameworks, but if there are suggestions that make such a Graph/Diagram based User interface easy to implement, I am open to them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How MoEs (sparsely gated ones) are trained appear to be rather opaque from looking at literature (e.g. GLAM and similar papers). 
 From my intuition it would make sense that it works either by:
 Each expert being trained on a subset of data (the data they are supposed to have expertise in) to predict a token given a previous token, or to predict a token given a contextual embedding. This would mean the expert MLPs are frozen, and the only thing concerning the experts that we train with the transformer is the gating mechanism. 
 or
 The experts are trained in the same training loop as the transformer (e.g. backprop over the whole network), but that each of the experts are only trained on a subset of the data corresponding to their expertise (e.g. as we perform the training loop and we run upon data from our math dataset, then we backprop through the math expert mlp)

 Could anyone help me resolve my confusion and point me in the right direction for how these are trained? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scammers are now using AI to create realistic voice deepfakes, aiming to trick people into transferring money. By mimicking real customer voices, this new type of voice fraud attempts to exploit bank security systems and deceive call center agents.
 To make sure you're updated about the latest AI trends, look here first.
 Increasing prevalence and sophistication of voice frauds
  
A rise in AI-generated voice frauds has been noted this year, with one major case featuring an investor in Florida whose voice was synthetically duplicated to deceive his bank.
 Voice authentication vendor Nuance detected its first successful deepfake attack on a financial services client late last year.
 These scams are facilitated by the wide availability of voice samples online, coupled with the growth of AI capabilities and hackers' access to stolen bank account details.
  
Defending against evolving AI threats
  
Currently, only a small percentage of fraud calls to large financial companies are AI-generated. Most attacks have targeted credit card service call centers.
 Fraudsters are advancing their techniques, now able to convert speech to a specific target's voice in real-time using advanced AI systems like Microsoft's VALL-E.
 With most of these security measures focusing on call centers and automated systems, individual calls to high-ranking officials remain a vulnerability.

 In my university, there are not a lot of companies visiting for campus placement this year so I decided to go on the offcampus job hunt. I'm a final year student (in masters but bachelors was unrelated to CS) and no work experience. 
 I have further personal goals for which I'd need a steady and good income. I decided if I could get a remote job it would be really beneficial for me as my living costs would be saved and I'll be paid much more than what India offers freshers(since I'll be paid in dollars or euros). 
 However, I need advice in various domains: 1. Should I focus on one of ML/DL/ Data science or multiple ? 2. Any resources that could help me learn ? 3. Projects that help me stand out from the crowd? 4. Where can I start looking for remote work(websites, etc)? 5. Any other personal advice is appreciated!

 abstract.
 This paper investigates the rational thinking capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-round argumentative debates by exploring the impact of fallacious arguments on their logical reasoning performance. More specifically, we present Logic Competence Measurement Benchmark (LOGICOM), a diagnostic benchmark to assess the robustness of LLMs against logical fallacies. LOGICOM involves two agents: a persuader and a debater engaging in a multi-round debate on a controversial topic, where the persuader tries to convince the debater of the correctness of its claim. First, LOGICOM assesses the potential of LLMs to change their opinions through reasoning. Then, it evaluates the debater’s performance in logical reasoning by contrasting the scenario where the persuader employs logical fallacies against one where logical reasoning is used. We use this benchmark to evaluate the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 using a dataset containing controversial topics, claims, and reasons supporting them. Our findings indicate that both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can adjust their opinion through reasoning. However, when presented with logical fallacies, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are erroneously convinced 41% and 69% more often, respectively, compared to when logical reasoning is used. Finally, we introduce a new dataset containing over 5k pairs of logical vs. fallacious arguments. The source code and dataset of this work are made publicly available.
 GPT3.5 vulnerable to false information generated by itself!

 DINOv2 for advanced visual tasks
  
Meta has made the powerful DINOv2 model available under the Apache 2.0 license, employing self-supervised learning to enhance image segmentation and depth estimation.
 This broader use model encourages further innovation and practical application in the computer vision community, driving progress in the AI industry.
  
FACET for enhanced AI fairness
  
Given the inherent difficulty and risks in ensuring fairness in computer vision, Meta introduced FACET.
 FACET has been developed to benchmark fairness across computer vision models performing tasks such as detection or classification, considering a wide array of demographic attributes.
 This revolutionary tool enables a better understanding of potential biases in AI models, helping to address fairness and robustness concerns.
  
Wider implications
  
Preliminary studies indicate performance disparities across some demographic groups within computer vision models. FACET allows researchers to track these divergences and monitor the implementation of corrective measures.
 Meta actively encourages researchers to use FACET for fairness benchmarking in other visual/multimodal tasks. For instance, the DINOv2 model's performance was analyzed with FACET — facilitating insights into potential biases.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction to the problem
 I will provide you with link to github code so you can see both input dataset, how my onehot encoding and decoding works and implementation of VAE, with current reconstruction_loss and kl_loss fuctions that make my loss function.
 dataset - amp.csv
 onehotencoding -- tools.py
 main code -- VAE-onehot-testing.ipynb
 https://github.com/aronta/Master-thesis-Generating-de-novo-peptides-using-variational-autoencoder-model/blob/main/VAE-onehot-testing.ipynb
 Firstly, just to explain dataset. I have sequences of peptides represented with onehot encoded sequences which I am using as input for my model. Current VAE model, both encoder and deocder are based on LSTM layer as a main way for this VAE to learn connections between inputed sequences and to make sense of it all.
 Main Issue
 Issue is that the latent space im getting doesn't look good no matter what i do. (pictures of plots are on link). So i have tried scalling kl loss (and also warming it up -- because many papers say its a good way) but it doesn't change the end result. Maybe there is problem in the implementation of the VAE, i am realy not sure.
 The main goal would be (like in all VAE implementations) generating new sequences from latent spaces that make sense, opposed to the current outputs that im getting.
 My guess
 There is a problem with optimizing loss function, but i could be completely wrong (maybe the model is wrong for the input I have, or onehotencoding isn't even a good way to represent data entering LSTM layer).

My current use cases including two known languages and a set of documents which have the two languages mixed in (code switching, due to translation error). I'm training an ML model to make the output monolingual (leaned towards a designated language), so I need a reliable measure to estimate whether the ML model is making progress or not. Currently, I use lingua with the `compute_language_confidence_values()` function but the prediction is quite poor.
 For example, given a piece of text in Japanese and English:
 from lingua import Language, LanguageDetectorBuilder languages = [Language.ENGLISH, Language.JAPANESE] detector = LanguageDetectorBuilder.from_languages(*languages).build() detector.compute_language_confidence_values("わかりません hey do you understand me hey oh really") >>> [ConfidenceValue(language=Language.ENGLISH, value=1.0), ConfidenceValue(language=Language.JAPANESE, value=0.0)] 
 So it's not quite correct (should be 0.8-0.2 or something similar), does anyone have any advice ? Or are there better softwares out there ?

 Comgra (computation graph analysis) is a library you can use with pytorch to extract all the tensor data you care about and visualize it graphically in a browser.
 This allows for a much more detailed analysis of what is happening than the usual approach of using tensorboard. You can go investigate tensors as training proceeds, drill down into individual neurons, inspect single data sets that are of special interest to you, track gradients, compare statistics between different training runs, and more.
 This tool has saved me a ton of time in my research by letting me check my hypotheses much more quickly than normal and by helping me understand how the different parts of my network really interact.
 I hope this tool can save other people just as much time as it did me. I'm also open for suggestions on how to improve it further: Since I'm already gathering and visualizing a lot of network information, adding more automated analysis would not be much extra work.

 ReST uses a bootsrap-like method to produce its own extended dataset and trains on ever higher-quality subsets of it to improve its own reward. The method allows for re-using the same generated data multiple times and thus has an efficiency advantage with respect to Online RL techniques like PPO.
 ​
 Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08998
 ​
 Abstract:
 Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) can improve the quality of large language model's (LLM) outputs by aligning them with human preferences. We propose a simple algorithm for aligning LLMs with human preferences inspired by growing batch reinforcement learning (RL), which we call Reinforced Self-Training (ReST). Given an initial LLM policy, ReST produces a dataset by generating samples from the policy, which are then used to improve the LLM policy using offline RL algorithms. ReST is more efficient than typical online RLHF methods because the training dataset is produced offline, which allows data reuse. While ReST is a general approach applicable to all generative learning settings, we focus on its application to machine translation. Our results show that ReST can substantially improve translation quality, as measured by automated metrics and human evaluation on machine translation benchmarks in a compute and sample-efficient manner.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had been exploring convergence properties of MAML and there are some recent works establishing convergence under certain conditions. I am trying to understand how this would play out with GAN's, I know that in general training is generally unstable and there are a lot of issues such as memorization and mode collapse under this regime, but I am looking for a theoretical result, for instance we know that GAN's converge under ideal conditions and we also know that MAML converges, can we make any comments on the convergence properties of GAN's when trained using MAML, ideally a neat trick to know if they will converge based on what we already know? The proof for MAML convergence is fairly complicated and I expect that a proof that has additional second order gradient terms and feedback loops will probably involve a lot of work and I am wondering if anyone could provide some sort of insight or intuition as to what such a result would look like? Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Problem: Given time series data of the last few years, one data point per day (eg price of a product or sales made this day). My job is to predict the next 7 days, ie. 7 scalars. 
 Approach: Train one model for each time lag. The first model predicts tomorrow, the second model the day after tomorrow and so on (7 models in total). The features are the last prices of the last 7 days and some saisonal features (calendar week, price on this day last year and so on). 
 Question: is there anything wrong with this approach? It doesn’t feel like the most elegant method to train 7 separate models. The problem with using a single model is, that this model must be able to predict 7 values of different points in time (and i don’t want to give the model input data of 7 days and let it predict all 7 scalars at once. The model should only use the features of a single day to predict this day). The 2 other to options I have considered are to train an autoregressive model (model just learns to predict the next day. To predict the day after tomorrow you give it its own prediction as input). Or to build a „time-lag“ feature, which tells the model how far in the future this datapoint lies. But this doesn’t make sense, because there is nothing like a weekly trend or so. 
 What do you think? The autoregressive approach is elegant, but its implementation and maintenance is complex.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In training MFRL, which is mostly simulation, why don't we use MBRL instead as the environment is accessible?
 **Correct me if I misunderstand in any.
 From my understanding, Model-Free RL (MFRL) is generally used for control tasks where environment is not accessible. It takes a sample of an experience from the environment and uses it to adjust its policy, either policy-based, value-based, and actor-critic. Model-Based RL (MBRL) uses a transition model to optimize the optimal policy like in model predictive control (MPC).
 I am interested in using RL for control multiple and continuous actions in continuous stochastic environment. For now, I am moving around DDPG. Do you have any suggested algorithm that match to my task?

I have been struggling to tune my hyperparameters as well as figure out how many hidden neurons and hidden layers I need. I have found that right now 256 hidden neurons and 2 hidden layers works best. Please tell me if this topic has flown completely over my head and I am missing something. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey All,
 I have to read in multiple JSON files with each one containing objects in an array.
 For each file I want to create a data frame (A matrix might also work) where the rows and columns are just integers pointing to a string. Like this
 ​
  
 - 0 1 2 
  
 0 dsad asd ad 
  1 asd asd grth 
  2 ter xc wer 
 
 ​
 Using the same JSON file I also want to process the objects inside the arrays using the dataframe (matrix) above. So the process (pipeline) would be something like:
  |==> Create Matrix =======>| JSON file =>| | ===> Use matrix to process object. |==> Individual objects ==>| 
 ​
 I have been looking through the docs but still unsure how to do this.
  
Should I use a dataframe or a spark matrix?
 How do I split the objects into parts and also generate the matrix?
 How do I combine dataframes which isn't joining?
  
Just a point in the right direction would be great. Thanks in advance for this relatively simple question.

 Can someone here please help me with this algorithm? 
 What is the “Boosting” part of the algorithm?
 To my (limited) understanding XGBoost is an ensemble learning algorithm that uses many decision trees (efficiently), where each tree tries to correct the loss of the previous one. 
 But I’m not sure how this is connected to “Boosting” and then it’s cousin “Bagging”
 Any intuition that may help me here?

 For expert insights into AI developments, look here first.
 https://preview.redd.it/mj64uof9rvlb1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=a856ce3e4b6063ebf7a585df3338142defba6323
 X's approach to AI training
  
Under the most recent privacy policy, X will harness the personal data it collects and publicly accessible information for its machine learning algorithms.
 Musk assures only publicly accessible data will be used, safeguarding private user information like DMs.
 However, with X having disbanded its press operation, more specific details about the data collected and its intended use still need to be provided.
  
Unfolding plans of Musk
  
Despite X's quiet stance on AI, Musk recently launched xAI, aspiring "to understand the true nature of the universe."
 xAI's homepage discloses plans to sync with X closely, possibly using collected user data to progress the mission.
 A competitive stance against LinkedIn suggests a possible additional motive for data collection, speculating an enhanced job and education section on X.
 Despite concerns about selling user data for revenue, concrete evidence is needed to support this argument, reflecting Twitter's previous strategy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am struggling to understand one part of the FAQ of the transformer reinforcement learning library from HuggingFace:
  
What Is the Concern with Negative KL Divergence?
 If you generate text by purely sampling from the model distribution things work fine in general. But when you use the generate method there are a few caveats because it does not always purely sample depending on the settings which can cause KL-divergence to go negative. Essentially when the active model achieves log_p_token_active < log_p_token_ref we get negative KL-div. This can happen in a several cases:
 top-k sampling: the model can smooth out the probability distribution causing the top-k tokens having a smaller probability than those of the reference model but they still are selected
 min_length: this ignores the EOS token until min_length is reached. thus the model can assign a very high log prob to the EOS token and very low prob to all others until min_length is reached
 batched generation: finished sequences in a batch are padded until all generations are finished. The model can learn to assign very low probabilities to the padding tokens unless they are properly masked or removed.These are just a few examples. Why is negative KL an issue? The total reward R is computed R = r - beta * KL so if the model can learn how to drive KL-divergence negative it effectively gets a positive reward. In many cases it can be much easier to exploit such a bug in the generation than actually learning the reward function. In addition the KL can become arbitrarily small thus the actual reward can be very small compared to it.
  
I understand why the KL-divergence that is computed here is an approximation that can be negative as opposed to the real one. However, I cannot wrap my head around the details of why these specific sampling parameters would lead to negative KL-divergence. Could someone elaborate on these points?

The edited review comment now discusses entirely different point.
 We would like to raise this concern to AC but the thing is that we didn’t save the original review comment, and the “revision history” for some reason doesn’t show the previous content, other than the entry that there was previous version. But this revision history overall isn’t inconsistent (showing the last two history after the discussion period, but the ones before the period is not shown) 
 Can reviewers delete their own revision history in OpenReview tool? I don’t know if this is a bug or they deleted them with an intention.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! I've noticed that most beginner-level tutorials on recommender systems primarily focus on model training, with limited information about deploying them in a production environment. Additionally, the different usage of models in the recall (retrieval) and ranking modules can indeed be confusing for beginners.
 Recently, I've been working on a recommender system project that encompasses both offline development and online deployment, covering both recall and ranking modules. The entire project is developed using Python and executed on a single laptop. All components are contained within Docker, ensuring no impact on the local environment. 
 The GitHub repo: https://github.com/akiragy/recsys_pipeline
 You can follow the commands provided in the README to run it. 
 This project primarily utilizes PyTorch, Redis, Elasticsearch, Feast Feature Store, Triton Inference Server, and Flask. 
 PyTorch is used for training the FM model for recall and the DeepFM model for ranking. 
 Redis serves as the store for user terms and vectors, while Elasticsearch is used to create an item term index and a vector index. Redis and Elasticsearch form the recall module. 
 Feast is utilized to store user and item features, while Triton serves as a real-time prediction engine. Feast and Triton form the ranking module. 
 Flask is deployed as the web server, receiving recommendation requests and returning responses. 
 Thanks for checking it out!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We released another preprint on a neuro-symbolic approach called "metacognitive error correction and detection rules" (EDCR). The idea is that if you have a trained neural model, you can symbolically fine tune the results with rules. In this initial study, we apply it to the classification of GPS movement traces.
 Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_OV4lap_rk
 Preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14250
 Code: https://github.com/lab-v2/Error-Detection-and-Correction
 Further information: https://neurosymbolic.asu.edu/metacognition/ 
 In the example below, we show the results for a single class. The rules detect errors by identifying classifications that may be incorrect and then re-assign to a new class. While recall can drop for a given class, we can bound the drop in recall with a hyperparameter - but this is guaranteed to improve precision. This is illustrated in the below figure. We show this approach leads to an overall improvement in accuracy over the base model, including the state-of-the-art. We also examine the effects when encountering classes not seen in the model's training data.
 We provide theoretical as well as empirical results and believe this approach can be used in other use-cases in the future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 I'm the founder of a generative AI consultancy and we build gen AI powered products for other companies. We've been doing this for 18 months now and I thought I share our learnings - it might help others.
 ​
  
It's a never ending battle to keep up with the latest tools and developments. 
 
By the time you ship your product it's already using an outdated tech-stack. 
 
There are no best-practices yet. You need to make a bet on tools/processes and hope that things won't change much by the time you ship (they will, see point 2). 
 
If your generative AI product doesn't have a VC-backed competitor, there will be one soon. 
 
In order to win you need one of the two things: either (1) the best distribution or (2) the generative AI component is hidden in your product so others don't/can't copy you. 
 
AI researchers / data scientists are suboptimal choice for AI engineering. They're expensive, won't be able to solve most of your problems and likely want to focus on more fundamental problems rather than building products. 
 
Software engineers make the best AI engineers. They are able to solve 80% of your problems right away and they are motivated because they can "work in AI". 
 
Product designers need to get more technical, AI engineers need to get more product-oriented. The gap currently is too big and this leads to all sorts of problems during product development. 
 
Demo bias is real and it makes it 10x harder to deliver something that's in alignment with your client's expectation. Communicating this effectively is a real and underrated skill. 
 
There's no such thing as off-the-shelf AI generated content yet. Current tools are not reliable enough, they hallucinate, make up stuff and produce inconsistent results (applies to text, voice, image and video).

One of the main problems in road segmentation by using depth was that if a region is flat, such as walls, it may be detected as road. This was already a known phenomenon and to overcome this, surface normal estimation was used. But, SNE requires dense depth images. Instead, we used a multi-task architecture, and used surface normals as an auxiliary loss, which reduced computation time significantly and also we don't need a dense depth image. Only LiDAR (which is sparse in nature) is sufficient.

 If you want to stay on top of the latest trends and insights in AI, look here first.

 AI’s evolving role in tackling the opioid crisis
  
With a legacy of over 1 million overdose deaths since 1999, the opioid crisis has stubbornly resisted traditional preventive and regulatory measures. The latest AI-fueled developments offer newfound hope.
 Groundbreaking AI innovations are focusing on identifying individuals at potential risk, monitoring treatment progress, and predicting relapse probabilities. Decoding social media behavior offers an effective outlet for early intervention.
 More radically, AI-enabled wearable devices are being developed to detect overdose symptoms and automatically deliver lifesaving treatment.
  
AI: A double-edged sword?
  
Despite its promising potential, AI application in this sphere also raises concerns around privacy rights and misinformation. Facial recognition technology could lead to discrimination, while the risk of false data being fed into chatbots causing harm cannot be undermined.
 Trust in AI and its appropriate deployment will be crucial to ensuring its positive contribution rather than being a dystopian threat.

based on the HITS@10 score over previous work on the same biomedical knowledge

method. We demonstrate that knowledge graph embedding models are applicable in
practice by evaluating the best-performing model on four tasks that represent
real-life polypharmacy situations. Results suggest that knowledge learnt from
large biomedical knowledge graphs can be transferred to such downstream use

distributed learning refers to the process of training learning models on
distributed data sources. In our setting a set of agents need to cooperatively
train a learning model from streaming data. Differently from federated
learning, the proposed approach does not rely on a central server but only on
peer-to-peer communications among the agents. This approach is often used in
scenarios where data cannot be moved to a centralized location due to privacy,
security, or cost reasons. In order to overcome the absence of a central
server, we propose a distributed algorithm that relies on a quantized,
finite-time coordination protocol to aggregate the locally trained models.
Furthermore, our algorithm allows for the use of stochastic gradients during
local training. Stochastic gradients are computed using a randomly sampled
subset of the local training data, which makes the proposed algorithm more
efficient and scalable than traditional gradient descent. In our paper, we
analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of the mean distance
from the online solution. Finally, we present numerical results for a logistic

applications require decomposing such structures for further processing in
computer graphics. In the last decade, several methods were proposed to tackle
this problem, at the cost of intensive computational times. Recently, machine
learning has proven to be effective for the segmentation task on 3D structures.
Nevertheless, these state-of-the-art methods are often hardly generalizable and
require dividing the learned model into several specific classes of objects to
avoid overfitting. We present a data-driven approach leveraging deep learning
to encode a mapping function prior to mesh segmentation for multiple
applications. Our network reproduces a neighborhood map using our knowledge of
the \textsl{Shape Diameter Function} (SDF) method using similarities among
vertex neighborhoods. Our approach is resolution-agnostic as we downsample the
input meshes and query the full-resolution structure solely for neighborhood
contributions. Using our predicted SDF values, we can inject the resulting
structure into a graph-cut algorithm to generate an efficient and robust mesh
segmentation while considerably reducing the required computation times.]]></summary>

learn better policies than the behavior policy used for data collection. In
contrast to behavior cloning, which assumes the data is collected from expert
demonstrations, offline RL can work with non-expert data and multimodal
behavior policies. However, offline RL algorithms face challenges in handling
distribution shifts and effectively representing policies due to the lack of
online interaction during training. Prior work on offline RL uses conditional
diffusion models to represent multimodal behavior in the dataset. Nevertheless,
these methods are not tailored toward alleviating the out-of-distribution state
generalization. We introduce a novel method, named State Reconstruction for
Diffusion Policies (SRDP), incorporating state reconstruction feature learning
in the recent class of diffusion policies to address the out-of-distribution
generalization problem. State reconstruction loss promotes more descriptive
representation learning of states to alleviate the distribution shift incurred
by the out-of-distribution (OOD) states. We design a novel 2D Multimodal
Contextual Bandit environment to illustrate the OOD generalization of SRDP
compared to prior algorithms. In addition, we assess the performance of our
model on D4RL continuous control benchmarks, namely the navigation of an 8-DoF
ant and forward locomotion of half-cheetah, hopper, and walker2d, achieving

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In classification and forecasting with tabular data, one often utilizes
tree-based models. Those can be competitive with deep neural networks on
tabular data [cf. Grinsztajn et al., NeurIPS 2022, arXiv:2207.08815] and, under
some conditions, explainable. The explainability depends on the depth of the
tree and the accuracy in each leaf of the tree. Decision trees containing
leaves with unbalanced accuracy can provide misleading explanations.
Low-accuracy leaves give less valid explanations, which could be interpreted as
unfairness among explanations. Here, we train a shallow tree with the objective
of minimizing the maximum misclassification error across each leaf node. Then,
we extend each leaf with a separate tree-based model. The shallow tree provides
a global explanation, while the overall statistical performance of the shallow
tree with extended leaves improves upon decision trees of unlimited depth
trained using classical methods (e.g., CART) and is comparable to
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., well-tuned XGBoost).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Medical image data are often limited due to the expensive acquisition and
annotation process. Hence, training a deep-learning model with only raw data
can easily lead to overfitting. One solution to this problem is to augment the
raw data with various transformations, improving the model's ability to
generalize to new data. However, manually configuring a generic augmentation
combination and parameters for different datasets is non-trivial due to
inconsistent acquisition approaches and data distributions. Therefore,
automatic data augmentation is proposed to learn favorable augmentation
strategies for different datasets while incurring large GPU overhead. To this
end, we present a novel method, called Dynamic Data Augmentation (DDAug), which
is efficient and has negligible computation cost. Our DDAug develops a
hierarchical tree structure to represent various augmentations and utilizes an
efficient Monte-Carlo tree searching algorithm to update, prune, and sample the
tree. As a result, the augmentation pipeline can be optimized for each dataset
automatically. Experiments on multiple Prostate MRI datasets show that our
method outperforms the current state-of-the-art data augmentation strategies.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising research direction for
building power-efficient information processing systems, especially for
temporal tasks such as speech recognition. In SNNs, delays refer to the time
needed for one spike to travel from one neuron to another. These delays matter
because they influence the spike arrival times, and it is well-known that
spiking neurons respond more strongly to coincident input spikes. More
formally, it has been shown theoretically that plastic delays greatly increase
the expressivity in SNNs. Yet, efficient algorithms to learn these delays have
been lacking. Here, we propose a new discrete-time algorithm that addresses
this issue in deep feedforward SNNs using backpropagation, in an offline
manner. To simulate delays between consecutive layers, we use 1D convolutions
across time. The kernels contain only a few non-zero weights - one per synapse
- whose positions correspond to the delays. These positions are learned
together with the weights using the recently proposed Dilated Convolution with
Learnable Spacings (DCLS). We evaluated our method on three datasets: the
Spiking Heidelberg Dataset (SHD), the Spiking Speech Commands (SSC) and its
non-spiking version Google Speech Commands v0.02 (GSC) benchmarks, which
require detecting temporal patterns. We used feedforward SNNs with two or three
hidden fully connected layers, and vanilla leaky integrate-and fire neurons. We
showed that fixed random delays help and that learning them helps even more.
Furthermore, our method outperformed the state-of-the-art in the three datasets
without using recurrent connections and with substantially fewer parameters.
Our work demonstrates the potential of delay learning in developing accurate
and precise models for temporal data processing. Our code is based on PyTorch /
SpikingJelly and available at: https://github.com/Thvnvtos/SNN-delays]]></summary>

popularity in recent years. The intensive care unit (ICU) is a natural habitat
for ML given the abundance of available data from electronic health records.
Models have been proposed to address numerous ICU prediction tasks like the
early detection of complications. While authors frequently report
state-of-the-art performance, it is challenging to verify claims of
superiority. Datasets and code are not always published, and cohort
definitions, preprocessing pipelines, and training setups are difficult to
reproduce. This work introduces Yet Another ICU Benchmark (YAIB), a modular
framework that allows researchers to define reproducible and comparable
clinical ML experiments; we offer an end-to-end solution from cohort definition
to model evaluation. The framework natively supports most open-access ICU
datasets (MIMIC III/IV, eICU, HiRID, AUMCdb) and is easily adaptable to future
ICU datasets. Combined with a transparent preprocessing pipeline and extensible
training code for multiple ML and deep learning models, YAIB enables unified
model development. Our benchmark comes with five predefined established
prediction tasks (mortality, acute kidney injury, sepsis, kidney function, and
length of stay) developed in collaboration with clinicians. Adding further
tasks is straightforward by design. Using YAIB, we demonstrate that the choice
of dataset, cohort definition, and preprocessing have a major impact on the
prediction performance - often more so than model class - indicating an urgent
need for YAIB as a holistic benchmarking tool. We provide our work to the
clinical ML community to accelerate method development and enable real-world
clinical implementations. Software Repository:

organs, vessels) and 3D surgical instrument models. Prior to the deep learning
era, the broad application of statistical shape models (SSMs) in medical image
analysis is evidence that shapes have been commonly used to describe medical
data. Nowadays, however, state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning algorithms in
medical imaging are predominantly voxel-based. In computer vision, on the
contrary, shapes (including, voxel occupancy grids, meshes, point clouds and
implicit surface models) are preferred data representations in 3D, as seen from
the numerous shape-related publications in premier vision conferences, such as
the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), as
well as the increasing popularity of ShapeNet (about 51,300 models) and
Princeton ModelNet (127,915 models) in computer vision research. MedShapeNet is
created as an alternative to these commonly used shape benchmarks to facilitate
the translation of data-driven vision algorithms to medical applications, and
it extends the opportunities to adapt SOTA vision algorithms to solve critical
medical problems. Besides, the majority of the medical shapes in MedShapeNet
are modeled directly on the imaging data of real patients, and therefore it
complements well existing shape benchmarks comprising of computer-aided design
(CAD) models. MedShapeNet currently includes more than 100,000 medical shapes,
and provides annotations in the form of paired data. It is therefore also a
freely available repository of 3D models for extended reality (virtual reality
- VR, augmented reality - AR, mixed reality - MR) and medical 3D printing. This
white paper describes in detail the motivations behind MedShapeNet, the shape
acquisition procedures, the use cases, as well as the usage of the online shape

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adversarial examples (AEs) for DNNs have been shown to be transferable: AEs
that successfully fool white-box surrogate models can also deceive other
black-box models with different architectures. Although a bunch of empirical
studies have provided guidance on generating highly transferable AEs, many of
these findings lack explanations and even lead to inconsistent advice. In this
paper, we take a further step towards understanding adversarial
transferability, with a particular focus on surrogate aspects. Starting from
the intriguing little robustness phenomenon, where models adversarially trained
with mildly perturbed adversarial samples can serve as better surrogates, we
attribute it to a trade-off between two predominant factors: model smoothness
and gradient similarity. Our investigations focus on their joint effects,
rather than their separate correlations with transferability. Through a series
of theoretical and empirical analyses, we conjecture that the data distribution
shift in adversarial training explains the degradation of gradient similarity.
Building on these insights, we explore the impacts of data augmentation and
gradient regularization on transferability and identify that the trade-off
generally exists in the various training mechanisms, thus building a
comprehensive blueprint for the regulation mechanism behind transferability.
Finally, we provide a general route for constructing better surrogates to boost
transferability which optimizes both model smoothness and gradient similarity
simultaneously, e.g., the combination of input gradient regularization and
sharpness-aware minimization (SAM), validated by extensive experiments. In
summary, we call for attention to the united impacts of these two factors for
launching effective transfer attacks, rather than optimizing one while ignoring
the other, and emphasize the crucial role of manipulating surrogate models.]]></summary>

transformer (CNN-Transformer) for medical image segmentation. The proposed
Hybrid Decoder, based on MaxViT-block, is designed to harness the power of both
the convolution and self-attention mechanisms at each decoding stage with a
nominal memory and computational burden. The inclusion of multi-axis
self-attention, within each decoder stage, significantly enhances the
discriminating capacity between the object and background regions, thereby
helping in improving the segmentation efficiency. In the Hybrid Decoder block,
the fusion process commences by integrating the upsampled lower-level decoder
features, obtained through transpose convolution, with the skip-connection
features derived from the hybrid encoder. Subsequently, the fused features
undergo refinement through the utilization of a multi-axis attention mechanism.
The proposed decoder block is repeated multiple times to progressively segment
the nuclei regions. Experimental results on MoNuSeg18 and MoNuSAC20 dataset
demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed technique. Our MaxViT-UNet
outperformed the previous CNN-based (UNet) and Transformer-based (Swin-UNet)
techniques by a considerable margin on both of the standard datasets. The

models, synthesizing a sequence of animated frames that are both photorealistic
and temporally coherent is still in its infancy. While off-the-shelf
billion-scale datasets for image generation are available, collecting similar
video data of the same scale is still challenging. Also, training a video
diffusion model is computationally much more expensive than its image
counterpart. In this work, we explore finetuning a pretrained image diffusion
model with video data as a practical solution for the video synthesis task. We
find that naively extending the image noise prior to video noise prior in video
diffusion leads to sub-optimal performance. Our carefully designed video noise
prior leads to substantially better performance. Extensive experimental
validation shows that our model, Preserve Your Own Correlation (PYoCo), attains
SOTA zero-shot text-to-video results on the UCF-101 and MSR-VTT benchmarks. It
also achieves SOTA video generation quality on the small-scale UCF-101
benchmark with a $10\times$ smaller model using significantly less computation
than the prior art.]]></summary>

person's future observations based on their past labeled observations and is
typically used for sequential tasks, e.g., to predict daily mood ratings. When
making personalized predictions, a model can combine two types of trends: (a)
trends shared across people, i.e., person-generic trends, such as being happier
on weekends, and (b) unique trends for each person, i.e., person-specific
trends, such as a stressful weekly meeting. Mixed effect models are popular
statistical models to study both trends by combining person-generic and
person-specific parameters. Though linear mixed effect models are gaining
popularity in machine learning by integrating them with neural networks, these
integrations are currently limited to linear person-specific parameters: ruling
out nonlinear person-specific trends. In this paper, we propose Neural Mixed
Effect (NME) models to optimize nonlinear person-specific parameters anywhere
in a neural network in a scalable manner. NME combines the efficiency of neural
network optimization with nonlinear mixed effects modeling. Empirically, we
observe that NME improves performance across six unimodal and multimodal
datasets, including a smartphone dataset to predict daily mood and a
mother-adolescent dataset to predict affective state sequences where half the
mothers experience at least moderate symptoms of depression. Furthermore, we
evaluate NME for two model architectures, including for neural conditional
random fields (CRF) to predict affective state sequences where the CRF learns
nonlinear person-specific temporal transitions between affective states.
Analysis of these person-specific transitions on the mother-adolescent dataset
shows interpretable trends related to the mother's depression symptoms.]]></summary>

fields to group mixed numeric and categorical data. In many algorithms, a
predefined distance measurement is used to cluster data points based on their
dissimilarity. While there exist numerous distance-based measures for data with
pure numerical attributes and several ordered and unordered categorical
metrics, an efficient and accurate distance for mixed-type data that utilizes
the continuous and discrete properties simulatenously is an open problem. Many
metrics convert numerical attributes to categorical ones or vice versa. They
handle the data points as a single attribute type or calculate a distance
between each attribute separately and add them up. We propose a metric called
KDSUM that uses mixed kernels to measure dissimilarity, with cross-validated
optimal bandwidth selection. We demonstrate that KDSUM is a shrinkage method
from existing mixed-type metrics to a uniform dissimilarity metric, and

nonparametric modeling, they exhibit limitations in effectively capturing
abrupt changes in function smoothness and accommodating relationships with
heteroscedastic errors. Addressing these shortcomings, the heteroscedastic
Gaussian process (HeGP) regression seeks to introduce flexibility by
acknowledging the variability of residual variances across covariates in the
regression model. In this work, we extend the HeGP concept, expanding its scope
beyond regression tasks to encompass classification and state-space models. To
achieve this, we propose a novel framework where the Gaussian process is
coupled with a covariate-induced precision matrix process, adopting a mixture
formulation. This approach enables the modeling of heteroscedastic covariance
functions across covariates. To mitigate the computational challenges posed by
sampling, we employ variational inference to approximate the posterior and
facilitate posterior predictive modeling. Additionally, our training process
leverages an EM algorithm featuring closed-form M-step updates to efficiently
evaluate the heteroscedastic covariance function. A notable feature of our
model is its consistent performance on multivariate responses, accommodating
various types (continuous or categorical) seamlessly. Through a combination of
simulations and real-world applications in climatology, we illustrate the
model's prowess and advantages. By overcoming the limitations of traditional
Gaussian process models, our proposed framework offers a robust and versatile
tool for a wide array of applications.]]></summary>

surrogate maps for partial differential equation (PDE) solution operators. For
many real-world applications, which often require high-resolution data points,
training time and memory usage are significant bottlenecks. While there are
mixed-precision training techniques for standard neural networks, those work
for real-valued datatypes on finite dimensions and therefore cannot be directly
applied to FNO, which crucially operates in the (complex-valued) Fourier domain
and in function spaces. On the other hand, since the Fourier transform is
already an approximation (due to discretization error), we do not need to
perform the operation at full precision. In this work, we (i) profile memory
and runtime for FNO with full and mixed-precision training, (ii) conduct a
study on the numerical stability of mixed-precision training of FNO, and (iii)
devise a training routine which substantially decreases training time and
memory usage (up to 34%), with little or no reduction in accuracy, on the
Navier-Stokes and Darcy flow equations. Combined with the recently proposed
tensorized FNO (Kossaifi et al., 2023), the resulting model has far better
performance while also being significantly faster than the original FNO.]]></summary>

ensemble methods cannot be directly applied to improve the robustness and

without requiring further information about each model. Besides, we provide a

almost surely. Experiments on benchmarks show the superiority of pTSE overall

properties which allow their efficient computation. We prove that the MMD of
Riesz kernels coincides with the MMD of their sliced version. As a consequence,
the computation of gradients of MMDs can be performed in the one-dimensional
setting. Here, for $r=1$, a simple sorting algorithm can be applied to reduce
the complexity from $O(MN+N^2)$ to $O((M+N)\log(M+N))$ for two measures with
$M$ and $N$ support points. As another interesting follow-up result, the MMD of
compactly supported measures can be estimated from above and below by the
Wasserstein-1 distance. For the implementations we approximate the gradient of
the sliced MMD by using only a finite number $P$ of slices. We show that the
resulting error has complexity $O(\sqrt{d/P})$, where $d$ is the data

precludes their use in resource-constrained devices. Quantizing the parameters
and operations to lower bit-precision offers substantial memory and energy
savings for neural network inference, facilitating the use of DNNs on edge
computing platforms. Recent efforts at quantizing DNNs have employed a range of
techniques encompassing progressive quantization, step-size adaptation, and
gradient scaling. This paper proposes a new quantization approach for mixed
precision convolutional neural networks (CNNs) targeting edge-computing. Our
method establishes a new pareto frontier in model accuracy and memory footprint
demonstrating a range of quantized models, delivering best-in-class accuracy
below 4.3 MB of weights (wgts.) and activations (acts.). Our main contributions
are: (i) hardware-aware heterogeneous differentiable quantization with
tensor-sliced learned precision, (ii) targeted gradient modification for wgts.
and acts. to mitigate quantization errors, and (iii) a multi-phase learning
schedule to address instability in learning arising from updates to the learned
quantizer and model parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
techniques on the ImageNet dataset across a range of models including
EfficientNet-Lite0 (e.g., 4.14MB of wgts. and acts. at 67.66% accuracy) and
MobileNetV2 (e.g., 3.51MB wgts. and acts. at 65.39% accuracy).]]></summary>

of air traffic management (ATM) systems. Models of aircraft operated under
instrument flight rules (IFR) require capturing the variability inherent in how
aircraft follow standard flight procedures. The variability in aircraft
behavior varies among flight stages. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic
model that can learn the variability from the procedural data and flight tracks
collected from radar surveillance data. For each segment, a Gaussian mixture
model is used to learn the deviations of aircraft trajectories from their
procedures. Given new procedures, we can generate synthetic trajectories by
sampling a series of deviations from the trained Gaussian distributions and
reconstructing the aircraft trajectory using the deviations and the procedures.
We extend this method to capture pairwise correlations between aircraft and
show how a pairwise model can be used to generate traffic involving an
arbitrary number of aircraft. We demonstrate the proposed models on the arrival
tracks and procedures of the John F. Kennedy International Airport. The
distributional similarity between the original and the synthetic trajectory
dataset was evaluated using the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the empirical
distributions of different variables. We also provide qualitative analyses of
the synthetic trajectories generated from the models.]]></summary>

unfairness issues on graphs involve both attributes and topological structures.
Existing work on fair graph learning simply assumes that attributes of all
nodes are available for model training and then makes fair predictions. In
practice, however, the attributes of some nodes might not be accessible due to
missing data or privacy concerns, which makes fair graph learning even more
challenging. In this paper, we propose FairAC, a fair attribute completion
method, to complement missing information and learn fair node embeddings for
graphs with missing attributes. FairAC adopts an attention mechanism to deal
with the attribute missing problem and meanwhile, it mitigates two types of
unfairness, i.e., feature unfairness from attributes and topological unfairness
due to attribute completion. FairAC can work on various types of homogeneous
graphs and generate fair embeddings for them and thus can be applied to most
downstream tasks to improve their fairness performance. To our best knowledge,
FairAC is the first method that jointly addresses the graph attribution
completion and graph unfairness problems. Experimental results on benchmark
datasets show that our method achieves better fairness performance with less
sacrifice in accuracy, compared with the state-of-the-art methods of fair graph
learning. Code is available at: https://github.com/donglgcn/FairAC.]]></summary>

convert them into dense, grid-like input representations before using an
off-the-shelf network. However, selecting the appropriate representation for
the task traditionally requires training a neural network for each
representation and selecting the best one based on the validation score, which
is very time-consuming. This work eliminates this bottleneck by selecting
representations based on the Gromov-Wasserstein Discrepancy (GWD) between raw
events and their representation. It is about 200 times faster to compute than
training a neural network and preserves the task performance ranking of event
representations across multiple representations, network backbones, datasets,
and tasks. Thus finding representations with high task scores is equivalent to
finding representations with a low GWD. We use this insight to, for the first
time, perform a hyperparameter search on a large family of event
representations, revealing new and powerful representations that exceed the
state-of-the-art. Our optimized representations outperform existing
representations by 1.7 mAP on the 1 Mpx dataset and 0.3 mAP on the Gen1
dataset, two established object detection benchmarks, and reach a 3.8% higher
classification score on the mini N-ImageNet benchmark. Moreover, we outperform
state-of-the-art by 2.1 mAP on Gen1 and state-of-the-art feed-forward methods
by 6.0 mAP on the 1 Mpx datasets. This work opens a new unexplored field of
explicit representation optimization for event-based learning.]]></summary>

executing diverse manipulation tasks from visual observations in unstructured

this work, we present $\textbf{GNFactor}$, a visual behavior cloning agent for
multi-task robotic manipulation with $\textbf{G}$eneralizable $\textbf{N}$eural

incorporate semantics in 3D, the reconstruction module utilizes a
vision-language foundation model ($\textit{e.g.}$, Stable Diffusion) to distill
rich semantic information into the deep 3D voxel. We evaluate GNFactor on 3
real robot tasks and perform detailed ablations on 10 RLBench tasks with a

involving more than two entities. In scenarios where explicit hypergraphs are
not readily available, it is desirable to infer a meaningful hypergraph
structure from the node features to capture the intrinsic relations within the
data. However, existing methods either adopt simple pre-defined rules that fail
to precisely capture the distribution of the potential hypergraph structure, or
learn a mapping between hypergraph structures and node features but require a
large amount of labelled data, i.e., pre-existing hypergraph structures, for
training. Both restrict their applications in practical scenarios. To fill this
gap, we propose a novel smoothness prior that enables us to design a method to
infer the probability for each potential hyperedge without labelled data as
supervision. The proposed prior indicates features of nodes in a hyperedge are
highly correlated by the features of the hyperedge containing them. We use this
prior to derive the relation between the hypergraph structure and the node
features via probabilistic modelling. This allows us to develop an unsupervised
inference method to estimate the probability for each potential hyperedge via
solving an optimisation problem that has an analytical solution. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our method can learn
meaningful hypergraph structures from data more efficiently than existing
hypergraph structure inference methods.]]></summary>

by obscuring their faces. These methods, however, can degrade the quality of
photos, and they usually do not preserve the utility of faces, i.e., their age,
gender, pose, and facial expression. Recently, GANs, such as StyleGAN, have
been proposed, which generate realistic, high-quality imaginary faces. In this
paper, we investigate the use of StyleGAN in generating de-identified faces
through style mixing. We examined this de-identification method for preserving
utility and privacy by implementing several face detection, verification, and
identification attacks and conducting a user study. The results from our
extensive experiments, human evaluation, and comparison with two
state-of-the-art methods, i.e., CIAGAN and DeepPrivacy, show that StyleGAN
performs on par or better than these methods, preserving users' privacy and
images' utility. In particular, the results of the machine learning-based
experiments show that StyleGAN0-4 preserves utility better than CIAGAN and
DeepPrivacy while preserving privacy at the same level. StyleGAN0-3 preserves
utility at the same level while providing more privacy. In this paper, for the
first time, we also performed a carefully designed user study to examine both
privacy and utility-preserving properties of StyleGAN0-3, 0-4, and 0-5, as well
as CIAGAN and DeepPrivacy from the human observers' perspectives. Our
statistical tests showed that participants tend to verify and identify
StyleGAN0-5 images more easily than DeepPrivacy images. All the methods but
StyleGAN0-5 had significantly lower identification rates than CIAGAN. Regarding
utility, as expected, StyleGAN0-5 performed significantly better in preserving
some attributes. Among all methods, on average, participants believe gender has

industrial artificial intelligence (IAI), where neural networks play a key

model, termed stochastic configuration machines (SCMs), to stress effective
modelling and data size saving that are useful and valuable for industrial
applications. Compared to SCNs and random vector functional-link (RVFL) nets
with binarized implementation, the model storage of SCMs can be significantly
compressed while retaining favourable prediction performance. Besides the
architecture of the SCM learner model and its learning algorithm, as an
important part of this contribution, we also provide a theoretical basis on the
learning capacity of SCMs by analysing the model's complexity. Experimental
studies are carried out over some benchmark datasets and three industrial
applications. The results demonstrate that SCM has great potential for dealing
with industrial data analytics.]]></summary>

from researchers due to its wide range of applications.As conversation has a
natural graph structure,numerous approaches used to model ERC based on graph
convolutional networks (GCNs) have yielded significant results.However,the
aggregation approach of traditional GCNs suffers from the node information
redundancy problem,leading to node discriminant information
loss.Additionally,single-layer GCNs lack the capacity to capture long-range
contextual information from the graph. Furthermore,the majority of approaches
are based on textual modality or stitching together different modalities,
resulting in a weak ability to capture interactions between modalities. To
address these problems, we present the relational bilevel aggregation graph
convolutional network (RBA-GCN), which consists of three modules: the graph
generation module (GGM), similarity-based cluster building module (SCBM) and
bilevel aggregation module (BiAM). First, GGM constructs a novel graph to
reduce the redundancy of target node information.Then,SCBM calculates the node
similarity in the target node and its structural neighborhood, where noisy
information with low similarity is filtered out to preserve the discriminant
information of the node. Meanwhile, BiAM is a novel aggregation method that can
preserve the information of nodes during the aggregation process. This module
can construct the interaction between different modalities and capture
long-range contextual information based on similarity clusters. On both the
IEMOCAP and MELD datasets, the weighted average F1 score of RBA-GCN has a
2.17$\sim$5.21\% improvement over that of the most advanced method.Our code is
available at https://github.com/luftmenscher/RBA-GCN and our article with the
same name has been published in IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio,Speech,and
Language Processing,vol.31,2023]]></summary>

as surrogate models, superseding quantum-chemistry calculations in ab initio
molecular dynamics. The prevalent benchmark for NFFs has been the MD17 dataset
and its subsequent extension. These datasets predominantly comprise geometries
from the equilibrium region of the ground electronic state potential energy
surface, sampling from direct adiabatic dynamics. However, many chemical
reactions entail significant molecular deformations, notably bond breaking. We
demonstrate the constrained distribution of internal coordinates and energies
in the MD17 datasets, underscoring their inadequacy for representing systems
undergoing chemical reactions. Addressing this sampling limitation, we
introduce the xxMD (Extended Excited-state Molecular Dynamics) dataset, derived
from non-adiabatic dynamics. This dataset encompasses energies and forces
ascertained from both multireference wave function theory and density
functional theory. Furthermore, its nuclear configuration spaces authentically
depict chemical reactions, making xxMD a more chemically relevant dataset. Our
re-assessment of equivariant models on the xxMD datasets reveals notably higher
mean absolute errors than those reported for MD17 and its variants. This
observation underscores the challenges faced in crafting a generalizable NFF
model with extrapolation capability. Our proposed xxMD-CASSCF and xxMD-DFT

However, its limited customization options hinder users from accurately
describing desired outputs. For example, plain text makes it hard to specify
continuous quantities, such as the precise RGB color value or importance of
each word. Furthermore, creating detailed text prompts for complex scenes is
tedious for humans to write and challenging for text encoders to interpret. To
address these challenges, we propose using a rich-text editor supporting
formats such as font style, size, color, and footnote. We extract each word's
attributes from rich text to enable local style control, explicit token
reweighting, precise color rendering, and detailed region synthesis. We achieve
these capabilities through a region-based diffusion process. We first obtain
each word's region based on attention maps of a diffusion process using plain
text. For each region, we enforce its text attributes by creating
region-specific detailed prompts and applying region-specific guidance, and
maintain its fidelity against plain-text generation through region-based
injections. We present various examples of image generation from rich text and
demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines with quantitative

differential equations (PDEs), neural networks have the potential to break the
curse of dimensionality, providing approximate solutions to problems where
using classical solvers is difficult or impossible. While global minimization
of the PDE residual over the network parameters works well for boundary value
problems, catastrophic forgetting impairs the applicability of this approach to
initial value problems (IVPs). In an alternative local-in-time approach, the
optimization problem can be converted into an ordinary differential equation
(ODE) on the network parameters and the solution propagated forward in time;
however, we demonstrate that current methods based on this approach suffer from
two key issues. First, following the ODE produces an uncontrolled growth in the
conditioning of the problem, ultimately leading to unacceptably large numerical
errors. Second, as the ODE methods scale cubically with the number of model
parameters, they are restricted to small neural networks, significantly
limiting their ability to represent intricate PDE initial conditions and
solutions. Building on these insights, we develop Neural IVP, an ODE based IVP
solver which prevents the network from getting ill-conditioned and runs in time
linear in the number of parameters, enabling us to evolve the dynamics of

reasoning, a crucial aspect of many security tasks. However, existing LLM
architectures for code are often borrowed from other domains like natural

of code semantics, including control and data flow, into the LLM architectures.

Drawing inspiration from examples of convolution layers exploiting
translation symmetry, we explore how code symmetries can enhance LLM
architectures for program analysis and modeling. We present a rigorous
group-theoretic framework that formally defines code symmetries as
semantics-preserving transformations and provides techniques for precisely
reasoning about symmetry preservation within LLM architectures. Using this
framework, we introduce a novel variant of self-attention that preserves
program symmetries, demonstrating its effectiveness in generalization and

source code to express the software semantics, but the compiler converts it to
a binary format that the CPU can directly execute. Therefore, binary code
analysis is critical to applications in reverse engineering and computer
security tasks where source code is not available. However, unlike source code
and natural language that contain rich semantic information, binary code is
typically difficult for human engineers to understand and analyze. While
existing work uses AI models to assist source code analysis, few studies have
considered binary code. In this paper, we propose a COntrastive learning Model
for Binary cOde Analysis, or COMBO, that incorporates source code and comment
information into binary code during representation learning. Specifically, we
present three components in COMBO: (1) a primary contrastive learning method
for cold-start pre-training, (2) a simplex interpolation method to incorporate
source code, comments, and binary code, and (3) an intermediate representation
learning algorithm to provide binary code embeddings. Finally, we evaluate the
effectiveness of the pre-trained representations produced by COMBO using three
indicative downstream tasks relating to binary code: algorithmic functionality
classification, binary code similarity, and vulnerability detection. Our
experimental results show that COMBO facilitates representation learning of
binary code visualized by distribution analysis, and improves the performance
on all three downstream tasks by 5.45% on average compared to state-of-the-art
large-scale language representation models. To the best of our knowledge, COMBO
is the first language representation model that incorporates source code,
binary code, and comments into contrastive code representation learning and
unifies multiple tasks for binary code analysis.]]></summary>

alternative for full fine-tuning so as to adapt pre-trained vision models to
downstream tasks, which only tunes a small number of parameters while freezing
the vast majority ones to ease storage burden and optimization difficulty.
However, existing PEFT methods introduce trainable parameters to the same
positions across different tasks depending solely on human heuristics and
neglect the domain gaps. To this end, we study where to introduce and how to
allocate trainable parameters by proposing a novel Sensitivity-aware visual
Parameter-efficient fine-Tuning (SPT) scheme, which adaptively allocates
trainable parameters to task-specific important positions given a desired
tunable parameter budget. Specifically, our SPT first quickly identifies the
sensitive parameters that require tuning for a given task in a data-dependent
way. Next, our SPT further boosts the representational capability for the
weight matrices whose number of sensitive parameters exceeds a pre-defined
threshold by utilizing existing structured tuning methods, e.g., LoRA [23] or
Adapter [22], to replace directly tuning the selected sensitive parameters
(unstructured tuning) under the budget. Extensive experiments on a wide range
of downstream recognition tasks show that our SPT is complementary to the
existing PEFT methods and largely boosts their performance, e.g., SPT improves
Adapter with supervised pre-trained ViT-B/16 backbone by 4.2% and 1.4% mean

counts provided in a privacy-preserving spatio-temporal aggregation. We detail
the efficient matching approach mapping the data to the OpenStreetMap road
graph. We evaluate the dataset by comparing it with publicly available
stationary vehicle detector data (for Berlin, London, and Madrid) and the Uber
traffic speed dataset (for Barcelona, Berlin, and London). The comparison
highlights the differences across datasets in spatio-temporal coverage and
variations in the reported traffic caused by the binning method. MeTS-10
enables novel, city-wide analysis of mobility and traffic patterns for ten
major world cities, overcoming current limitations of spatially sparse vehicle
detector data. The large spatial and temporal coverage offers an opportunity
for joining the MeTS-10 with other datasets, such as traffic surveys in traffic
planning studies or vehicle detector data in traffic control settings.]]></summary>

in the computational neuroscience community on simple models. In this paper, we
formulate and apply Bayesian model reduction to perform principled pruning of
Bayesian neural networks, based on variational free energy minimization. Direct
application of Bayesian model reduction, however, gives rise to approximation
errors. Therefore, a novel iterative pruning algorithm is presented to
alleviate the problems arising with naive Bayesian model reduction, as
supported experimentally on the publicly available UCI datasets for different
inference algorithms. This novel parameter pruning scheme solves the
shortcomings of current state-of-the-art pruning methods that are used by the
signal processing community. The proposed approach has a clear stopping
criterion and minimizes the same objective that is used during training. Next
to these benefits, our experiments indicate better model performance in

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In autonomous driving, data augmentation is commonly used for improving 3D
object detection. The most basic methods include insertion of copied objects
and rotation and scaling of the entire training frame. Numerous variants have
been developed as well. The existing methods, however, are considerably limited
when compared to the variety of the real world possibilities. In this work, we
develop a diversified and realistic augmentation method that can flexibly
construct a whole-body object, freely locate and rotate the object, and apply
self-occlusion and external-occlusion accordingly. To improve the diversity of
the whole-body object construction, we develop an iterative method that
stochastically combines multiple objects observed from the real world into a
single object. Unlike the existing augmentation methods, the constructed
objects can be randomly located and rotated in the training frame because
proper occlusions can be reflected to the whole-body objects in the final step.
Finally, proper self-occlusion at each local object level and
external-occlusion at the global frame level are applied using the Hidden Point
Removal (HPR) algorithm that is computationally efficient. HPR is also used for
adaptively controlling the point density of each object according to the
object's distance from the LiDAR. Experiment results show that the proposed
DR.CPO algorithm is data-efficient and model-agnostic without incurring any
computational overhead. Also, DR.CPO can improve mAP performance by 2.08% when
compared to the best 3D detection result known for KITTI dataset. The code is

depends on the empirical pull times of agents. ODC is a generic protocol that

functions for deep neural networks (DNNs). As it counts 1 for positive
variables and 0 for others, its intrinsic characteristics (e.g., discontinuity
and no viable information of subgradients) impede its development for several
decades. Even if there is an impressive body of work on designing DNNs with
continuous activation functions that can be deemed as surrogates of the step
function, it is still in the possession of some advantageous properties, such
as complete robustness to outliers and being capable of attaining the best
learning-theoretic guarantee of predictive accuracy. Hence, in this paper, we
aim to train DNNs with the step function used as an activation function (dubbed
as 0/1 DNNs). We first reformulate 0/1 DNNs as an unconstrained optimization
problem and then solve it by a block coordinate descend (BCD) method. Moreover,
we acquire closed-form solutions for sub-problems of BCD as well as its
convergence properties. Furthermore, we also integrate
$\ell_{2,0}$-regularization into 0/1 DNN to accelerate the training process and
compress the network scale. As a result, the proposed algorithm has a high
performance on classifying MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. As a result, the

small amounts of data. One of the most popular and elegant Few-Shot learning
approaches is Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). The main idea behind this
method is to learn the shared universal weights of a meta-model, which are then
adapted for specific tasks. However, the method suffers from over-fitting and
poorly quantifies uncertainty due to limited data size. Bayesian approaches
could, in principle, alleviate these shortcomings by learning weight
distributions in place of point-wise weights. Unfortunately, previous
modifications of MAML are limited due to the simplicity of Gaussian posteriors,
MAML-like gradient-based weight updates, or by the same structure enforced for
universal and adapted weights.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework for Bayesian MAML called
BayesianHMAML, which employs Hypernetworks for weight updates. It learns the
universal weights point-wise, but a probabilistic structure is added when
adapted for specific tasks. In such a framework, we can use simple Gaussian
distributions or more complicated posteriors induced by Continuous Normalizing
Flows.]]></summary>

global model without disclosing their data. Previous researches often require
training the complete model parameters. However, the emergence of powerful
pre-trained models makes it possible to achieve higher performance with fewer
learnable parameters in FL. In this paper, we propose a federated adaptive
prompt tuning algorithm, FedAPT, for multi-domain collaborative image
classification with powerful foundation models, like CLIP. Compared with direct
federated prompt tuning, our core idea is to adaptively unlock specific domain
knowledge for each test sample in order to provide them with personalized
prompts. To implement this idea, we design an adaptive prompt tuning module,
which consists of a meta prompt, an adaptive network, and some keys. The server
randomly generates a set of keys and assigns a unique key to each client. Then
all clients cooperatively train the global adaptive network and meta prompt
with the local datasets and the frozen keys. Ultimately, the global aggregation
model can assign a personalized prompt to CLIP based on the domain features of
each test sample. We perform extensive experiments on two multi-domain image
classification datasets across two different settings - supervised and
unsupervised. The results show that FedAPT can achieve better performance with
less than 10\% of the number of parameters of the fully trained model, and the
global model can perform well in diverse client domains simultaneously.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This study demonstrates the feasibility of point cloud-based proactive link
quality prediction for millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications. Previous
studies have proposed machine learning-based methods to predict received signal
strength for future time periods using time series of depth images to mitigate
the line-of-sight (LOS) path blockage by pedestrians in mmWave communication.
However, these image-based methods have limited applicability due to privacy
concerns as camera images may contain sensitive information. This study
proposes a point cloud-based method for mmWave link quality prediction and
demonstrates its feasibility through experiments. Point clouds represent
three-dimensional (3D) spaces as a set of points and are sparser and less
likely to contain sensitive information than camera images. Additionally, point
clouds provide 3D position and motion information, which is necessary for
understanding the radio propagation environment involving pedestrians. This
study designs the mmWave link quality prediction method and conducts realistic
indoor experiments, where the link quality fluctuates significantly due to
human blockage, using commercially available IEEE 802.11ad-based 60 GHz
wireless LAN devices and Kinect v2 RGB-D camera and Velodyne VLP-16 light
detection and ranging (LiDAR) for point cloud acquisition. The experimental
results showed that our proposed method can predict future large attenuation of
mmWave received signal strength and throughput induced by the LOS path blockage
by pedestrians with comparable or superior accuracy to image-based prediction
methods. Hence, our point cloud-based method can serve as a viable alternative
to image-based methods.]]></summary>

the removal of the contribution of a given data point from a training
procedure. Federated Unlearning (FU) consists in extending MU to unlearn a

approaches are generally not scalable, and do not come with sound theoretical
quantification of the effectiveness of unlearning. In this work we present
Informed Federated Unlearning (IFU), a novel efficient and quantifiable FU
approach. Upon unlearning request from a given client, IFU identifies the
optimal FL iteration from which FL has to be reinitialized, with unlearning
guarantees obtained through a randomized perturbation mechanism. The theory of
IFU is also extended to account for sequential unlearning requests.
Experimental results on different tasks and dataset show that IFU leads to more

assurance (QA) by humans before the predictions of an ML model can be deployed.
QA for ML (QA4ML) interfaces require users to view a large amount of data and
perform many interactions to correct errors made by the ML model. An optimized
user interface (UI) can significantly reduce interaction costs. While UI
optimization can be informed by user studies evaluating design options, this
approach is not scalable because there are typically numerous small variations
that can affect the efficiency of a QA4ML interface. Hence, we propose using
simulation to evaluate and aid the optimization of QA4ML interfaces. In
particular, we focus on simulating the combined effects of human intelligence
in initiating appropriate interaction commands and machine intelligence in
providing algorithmic assistance for accelerating QA4ML processes. As QA4ML is
usually labor-intensive, we use the simulated task completion time as the
metric for UI optimization under different interface and algorithm setups. We
demonstrate the usage of this UI design method in several QA4ML applications.]]></summary>

combining this method with the FermiNet and Psiformer Ansatze we can accurately
recover vertical excitation energies and oscillator strengths on molecules as

our correspondence-based explanations are found to be more useful to users than
kNN explanations. Our explanations help users more accurately reject AI's wrong

from sparse point segmentation to dense voxel segmentation, where the objective
is to predict the semantic occupancy of each voxel in the concerned 3D space.
The dense nature of the prediction space has rendered existing efficient
2D-projection-based methods (e.g., bird's eye view, range view, etc.)
ineffective, as they can only describe a subspace of the 3D scene. To address
this, we propose a cylindrical tri-perspective view to represent point clouds
effectively and comprehensively and a PointOcc model to process them
efficiently. Considering the distance distribution of LiDAR point clouds, we
construct the tri-perspective view in the cylindrical coordinate system for
more fine-grained modeling of nearer areas. We employ spatial group pooling to
maintain structural details during projection and adopt 2D backbones to
efficiently process each TPV plane. Finally, we obtain the features of each
point by aggregating its projected features on each of the processed TPV planes
without the need for any post-processing. Extensive experiments on both 3D
occupancy prediction and LiDAR segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that the
proposed PointOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance with much faster speed.
Specifically, despite only using LiDAR, PointOcc significantly outperforms all
other methods, including multi-modal methods, with a large margin on the
OpenOccupancy benchmark. Code: https://github.com/wzzheng/PointOcc.]]></summary>

leads to long communication delay, especially when the network environments of
clients vary greatly. Moreover, the parameter server needs to wait for the
slowest client (i.e., straggler, which may have the largest model size, lowest
computing capability or worst network condition) to upload parameters, which
may significantly degrade the communication efficiency. Commonly-used client
selection methods such as partial client selection would lead to the waste of
computing resources and weaken the generalization of the global model. To
tackle this problem, along a different line, in this paper, we advocate the
approach of model parameter dropout instead of client selection, and
accordingly propose a novel framework of Federated learning scheme with
Differential parameter Dropout (FedDD). FedDD consists of two key modules:
dropout rate allocation and uploaded parameter selection, which will optimize
the model parameter uploading ratios tailored to different clients'
heterogeneous conditions and also select the proper set of important model
parameters for uploading subject to clients' dropout rate constraints.
Specifically, the dropout rate allocation is formulated as a convex
optimization problem, taking system heterogeneity, data heterogeneity, and
model heterogeneity among clients into consideration. The uploaded parameter
selection strategy prioritizes on eliciting important parameters for uploading
to speedup convergence. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the convergence
of the proposed FedDD scheme. Extensive performance evaluations demonstrate
that the proposed FedDD scheme can achieve outstanding performances in both
communication efficiency and model convergence, and also possesses a strong
generalization capability to data of rare classes.]]></summary>

controllers for systems operating in stochastic and potentially adversarial
environments. Automatic synthesis tools, however, require a model of the
environment to construct controllers. In this work, we introduce a model-free
reinforcement learning (RL) approach to derive controllers from given LTL
specifications even when the environment is completely unknown. We model the
problem as a stochastic game (SG) between the controller and the adversarial
environment; we then learn optimal control strategies that maximize the
probability of satisfying the LTL specifications against the worst-case
environment behavior. We first construct a product game using the deterministic
parity automaton (DPA) translated from the given LTL specification. By deriving
distinct rewards and discount factors from the acceptance condition of the DPA,
we reduce the maximization of the worst-case probability of satisfying the LTL
specification into the maximization of a discounted reward objective in the
product game; this enables the use of model-free RL algorithms to learn an
optimal controller strategy. To deal with the common scalability problems when
the number of sets defining the acceptance condition of the DPA (usually
referred as colors), is large, we propose a lazy color generation method where
distinct rewards and discount factors are utilized only when needed, and an
approximate method where the controller eventually focuses on only one color.
In several case studies, we show that our approach is scalable to a wide range

Besides injecting more structure into the network architectures, this modelling

differentiation of programs with discrete randomness in High Energy Physics.
Such programs are common in High Energy Physics due to the presence of

detector design optimization, simulator tuning, or data analysis and
reconstruction optimization. We discuss several possible gradient estimation

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGPs) have been introduced to deal with
multiple tasks by exploiting the correlations between different outputs.
Generally, MOGPs models assume a flat correlation structure between the
outputs. However, such a formulation does not account for more elaborate
relationships, for instance, if several replicates were observed for each
output (which is a typical setting in biological experiments). This paper
proposes an extension of MOGPs for hierarchical datasets (i.e. datasets for
which the relationships between observations can be represented within a tree
structure). Our model defines a tailored kernel function accounting for
hierarchical structures in the data to capture different levels of correlations
while leveraging the introduction of latent variables to express the underlying
dependencies between outputs through a dedicated kernel. This latter feature is
expected to significantly improve scalability as the number of tasks increases.
An extensive experimental study involving both synthetic and real-world data
from genomics and motion capture is proposed to support our claims.]]></summary>

calorimeter (ECAL) is a crucial operational tool that allows ECAL experts to
quickly identify, localize, and diagnose a broad range of detector issues that
would otherwise hinder physics-quality data taking. Although the existing ECAL
DQM system has been continuously updated to respond to new problems, it remains
one step behind newer and unforeseen issues. Using unsupervised deep learning,
a real-time autoencoder-based anomaly detection system is developed that is
able to detect ECAL anomalies unseen in past data. After accounting for spatial
variations in the response of the ECAL and the temporal evolution of anomalies,
the new system is able to efficiently detect anomalies while maintaining an
estimated false discovery rate between $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-4}$, beating existing
benchmarks by about two orders of magnitude. The real-world performance of the
system is validated using anomalies found in 2018 and 2022 LHC collision data.
Additionally, first results from deploying the autoencoder-based system in the
CMS online DQM workflow for the ECAL barrel during Run 3 of the LHC are
presented, showing its promising performance in detecting obscure issues that
could have been missed in the existing DQM system.]]></summary>

block polymer morphology evolution for large domains over long timescales. The
strategy exploits the separation of characteristic times between coarse-grained
particle evolution on the monomer scale and slow morphological evolution over
mesoscopic scales. In contrast to empirical continuum models, the proposed
approach learns stochastically driven defect annihilation processes directly
from particle-based simulations. A UNet architecture that respects different
boundary conditions is adopted, thereby allowing periodic and fixed substrate
boundary conditions of arbitrary shape. Physical concepts are also introduced
via the loss function and symmetries are incorporated via data augmentation.
The model is validated using three different use cases. Explainable artificial
intelligence methods are applied to visualize the morphology evolution over
time. This approach enables the generation of large system sizes and long
trajectories to investigate defect densities and their evolution under
different types of confinement. As an application, we demonstrate the
importance of accessing late-stage morphologies for understanding particle
diffusion inside a single block. This work has implications for directed
self-assembly and materials design in micro-electronics, battery materials, and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A vast number of systems across the world use algorithmic decision making
(ADM) to (partially) automate decisions that have previously been made by
humans. When designed well, these systems promise more objective decisions
while saving large amounts of resources and freeing up human time. However,
when ADM systems are not designed well, they can lead to unfair decisions which
discriminate against societal groups. The downstream effects of ADMs critically
depend on the decisions made during the systems' design and implementation, as
biases in data can be mitigated or reinforced along the modeling pipeline. Many
of these design decisions are made implicitly, without knowing exactly how they
will influence the final system. It is therefore important to make explicit the
decisions made during the design of ADM systems and understand how these
decisions affect the fairness of the resulting system.

To study this issue, we draw on insights from the field of psychology and
introduce the method of multiverse analysis for algorithmic fairness. In our
proposed method, we turn implicit design decisions into explicit ones and
demonstrate their fairness implications. By combining decisions, we create a
grid of all possible "universes" of decision combinations. For each of these
universes, we compute metrics of fairness and performance. Using the resulting
dataset, one can see how and which decisions impact fairness. We demonstrate
how multiverse analyses can be used to better understand variability and
robustness of algorithmic fairness using an exemplary case study of predicting
public health coverage of vulnerable populations for potential interventions.
Our results illustrate how decisions during the design of a machine learning
system can have surprising effects on its fairness and how to detect these
effects using multiverse analysis.]]></summary>

LLMs, much smaller MLMs pretrained on balanced multilingual data still

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its inception in "Attention Is All You Need", transformer architecture
has led to revolutionary advancements in NLP. The attention layer within the
transformer admits a sequence of input tokens $X$ and makes them interact
through pairwise similarities computed as softmax$(XQK^\top X^\top)$, where
$(K,Q)$ are the trainable key-query parameters. In this work, we establish a
formal equivalence between the optimization geometry of self-attention and a
hard-margin SVM problem that separates optimal input tokens from non-optimal
tokens using linear constraints on the outer-products of token pairs. This
formalism allows us to characterize the implicit bias of 1-layer transformers
optimized with gradient descent: (1) Optimizing the attention layer with
vanishing regularization, parameterized by $(K,Q)$, converges in direction to
an SVM solution minimizing the nuclear norm of the combined parameter
$W=KQ^\top$. Instead, directly parameterizing by $W$ minimizes a Frobenius norm
objective. We characterize this convergence, highlighting that it can occur
toward locally-optimal directions rather than global ones. (2) Complementing
this, we prove the local/global directional convergence of gradient descent
under suitable geometric conditions. Importantly, we show that
over-parameterization catalyzes global convergence by ensuring the feasibility
of the SVM problem and by guaranteeing a benign optimization landscape devoid
of stationary points. (3) While our theory applies primarily to linear
prediction heads, we propose a more general SVM equivalence that predicts the
implicit bias with nonlinear heads. Our findings are applicable to arbitrary
datasets and their validity is verified via experiments. We also introduce
several open problems and research directions. We believe these findings
inspire the interpretation of transformers as a hierarchy of SVMs that
separates and selects optimal tokens.]]></summary>

shared model without transferring their local data. FL reduces the
communication overhead, making it a promising learning method in UAV-enhanced
wireless networks with scarce energy resources. Despite the potential,
implementing FL in UAV-enhanced networks is challenging, as conventional UAV
placement methods that maximize coverage increase the FL delay significantly.
Moreover, the uncertainty and lack of a priori information about crucial
variables, such as channel quality, exacerbate the problem. In this paper, we
first analyze the statistical characteristics of a UAV-enhanced wireless sensor
network (WSN) with energy harvesting. We then develop a model and solution
based on the multi-objective multi-armed bandit theory to maximize the network
coverage while minimizing the FL delay. Besides, we propose another solution
that is particularly useful with large action sets and strict energy
constraints at the UAVs. Our proposal uses a scalarized best-arm identification
algorithm to find the optimal arms that maximize the ratio of the expected
reward to the expected energy cost by sequentially eliminating one or more arms
in each round. Then, we derive the upper bound on the error probability of our

derived from graph convolutional networks have shown significant success. These
indicators, achieved by representing feed-forward structures as component
graphs through one-hot encoding, face a limitation: their inability to evaluate
architecture performance across varying search spaces. In contrast, handcrafted
performance indicators (zero-shot NAS), which use the same architecture with
random initialization, can generalize across multiple search spaces. Addressing
this limitation, we propose a novel approach for zero-shot NAS using deep
learning. Our method employs Fourier sum of sines encoding for convolutional
kernels, enabling the construction of a computational feed-forward graph with a
structure similar to the architecture under evaluation. These encodings are
learnable and offer a comprehensive view of the architecture's topological
information. An accompanying multi-layer perceptron (MLP) then ranks these
architectures based on their encodings. Experimental results show that our
approach surpasses previous methods using graph convolutional networks in terms
of correlation on the NAS-Bench-201 dataset and exhibits a higher convergence

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the growing imbalance between limited medical resources and escalating
demands, AI-based clinical tasks have become paramount. Medication
recommendation, as a sub-domain, aims to amalgamate longitudinal patient
history with medical knowledge, assisting physicians in prescribing safer and
more accurate medication combinations. Existing methods overlook the inherent
long-tail distribution in medical data, lacking balanced representation between
head and tail data, which leads to sub-optimal model performance. To address
this challenge, we introduce StratMed, a model that incorporates an innovative
relevance stratification mechanism. It harmonizes discrepancies in data
long-tail distribution and strikes a balance between the safety and accuracy of
medication combinations. Specifically, we first construct a pre-training method
using deep learning networks to obtain entity representation. After that, we
design a pyramid-like data stratification method to obtain more generalized
entity relationships by reinforcing the features of unpopular entities. Based
on this relationship, we designed two graph structures to express medication
precision and safety at the same level to obtain visit representations.
Finally, the patient's historical clinical information is fitted to generate
medication combinations for the current health condition. Experiments on the
MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate that our method has outperformed current
state-of-the-art methods in four evaluation metrics (including safety and
accuracy).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our study reveals new theoretical insights into over-smoothing and feature
over-correlation in deep graph neural networks. We show the prevalence of
invariant subspaces, demonstrating a fixed relative behavior that is unaffected
by feature transformations. Our work clarifies recent observations related to
convergence to a constant state and a potential over-separation of node states,
as the amplification of subspaces only depends on the spectrum of the
aggregation function. In linear scenarios, this leads to node representations
being dominated by a low-dimensional subspace with an asymptotic convergence
rate independent of the feature transformations. This causes a rank collapse of
the node representations, resulting in over-smoothing when smooth vectors span
this subspace, and over-correlation even when over-smoothing is avoided. Guided
by our theory, we propose a sum of Kronecker products as a beneficial property
that can provably prevent over-smoothing, over-correlation, and rank collapse.
We empirically extend our insights to the non-linear case, demonstrating the
inability of existing models to capture linearly independent features.]]></summary>

manipulation and grasping), and at times, it is harmful (e.g. when avoiding
obstacles). However, traditional path planning algorithms focus solely on
collision-free paths, limiting their applicability in contact-rich tasks. To
address this limitation, we propose the domain of Language-Conditioned Path
Planning, where contact-awareness is incorporated into the path planning
problem. As a first step in this domain, we propose Language-Conditioned
Collision Functions (LACO) a novel approach that learns a collision function
using only a single-view image, language prompt, and robot configuration. LACO
predicts collisions between the robot and the environment, enabling flexible,
conditional path planning without the need for manual object annotations, point
cloud data, or ground-truth object meshes. In both simulation and the real
world, we demonstrate that LACO can facilitate complex, nuanced path plans that
allow for interaction with objects that are safe to collide, rather than
prohibiting any collision.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) is structured to derive policies from
static trajectory data without requiring real-time environment interactions.
Recent studies have shown the feasibility of framing offline RL as a sequence
modeling task, where the sole aim is to predict actions based on prior context
using the transformer architecture. However, the limitation of this single task
learning approach is its potential to undermine the transformer model's
attention mechanism, which should ideally allocate varying attention weights
across different tokens in the input context for optimal prediction. To address
this, we reformulate offline RL as a multi-objective optimization problem,
where the prediction is extended to states and returns. We also highlight a
potential flaw in the trajectory representation used for sequence modeling,
which could generate inaccuracies when modeling the state and return
distributions. This is due to the non-smoothness of the action distribution
within the trajectory dictated by the behavioral policy. To mitigate this
issue, we introduce action space regions to the trajectory representation. Our
experiments on D4RL benchmark locomotion tasks reveal that our propositions
allow for more effective utilization of the attention mechanism in the
transformer model, resulting in performance that either matches or outperforms
current state-of-the art methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this article, the optimal sample complexity of learning the underlying
interaction/dependencies of a Linear Dynamical System (LDS) over a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG) is studied. The sample complexity of learning a DAG's
structure is well-studied for static systems, where the samples of nodal states
are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). However, such a study is
less explored for DAGs with dynamical systems, where the nodal states are
temporally correlated. We call such a DAG underlying an LDS as \emph{dynamical}
DAG (DDAG). In particular, we consider a DDAG where the nodal dynamics are
driven by unobserved exogenous noise sources that are wide-sense stationary
(WSS) in time but are mutually uncorrelated, and have the same {power spectral
density (PSD)}. Inspired by the static settings, a metric and an algorithm
based on the PSD matrix of the observed time series are proposed to reconstruct
the DDAG. The equal noise PSD assumption can be relaxed such that
identifiability conditions for DDAG reconstruction are not violated. For the
LDS with WSS (sub) Gaussian exogenous noise sources, it is shown that the
optimal sample complexity (or length of state trajectory) needed to learn the
DDAG is $n=\Theta(q\log(p/q))$, where $p$ is the number of nodes and $q$ is the
maximum number of parents per node. To prove the sample complexity upper bound,
a concentration bound for the PSD estimation is derived, under two different
sampling strategies. A matching min-max lower bound using generalized Fano's
inequality also is provided, thus showing the order optimality of the proposed
algorithm.]]></summary>

resulting in enhanced computational efficiency and improved estimation

into the cryptocurrency market, which also attracted cybercriminals' interest
in recent years. The Ponzi scheme, an old-fashioned fraud, is now popular on
the blockchain, causing considerable financial losses to many crypto-investors.
A few Ponzi detection methods have been proposed in the literature, most of
which detect a Ponzi scheme based on its smart contract source code or opcode.
The contract-code-based approach, while achieving very high accuracy, is not
robust: first, the source codes of a majority of contracts on Ethereum are not
available, and second, a Ponzi developer can fool a contract-code-based
detection model by obfuscating the opcode or inventing a new profit
distribution logic that cannot be detected (since these models were trained on
existing Ponzi logics only). A transaction-based approach could improve the
robustness of detection because transactions, unlike smart contracts, are
harder to be manipulated. However, the current transaction-based detection
models achieve fairly low accuracy. We address this gap in the literature by
developing new detection models that rely only on the transactions, hence
guaranteeing the robustness, and moreover, achieve considerably higher
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score than existing transaction-based
models. This is made possible thanks to the introduction of novel
time-dependent features that capture Ponzi behaviours characteristics derived

trustworthiness of machine learning models in practical applications.
Conventional wisdom suggests that not everyone can be an attacker since the
process of designing the trigger generation algorithm often involves
significant effort and extensive experimentation to ensure the attack's
stealthiness and effectiveness. Alternatively, this paper shows that there
exists a more severe backdoor threat: anyone can exploit an easily-accessible
algorithm for silent backdoor attacks. Specifically, this attacker can employ
the widely-used lossy image compression from a plethora of compression tools to
effortlessly inject a trigger pattern into an image without leaving any
noticeable trace; i.e., the generated triggers are natural artifacts. One does
not require extensive knowledge to click on the "convert" or "save as" button
while using tools for lossy image compression. Via this attack, the adversary
does not need to design a trigger generator as seen in prior works and only
requires poisoning the data. Empirically, the proposed attack consistently
achieves 100% attack success rate in several benchmark datasets such as MNIST,
CIFAR-10, GTSRB and CelebA. More significantly, the proposed attack can still
achieve almost 100% attack success rate with very small (approximately 10%)
poisoning rates in the clean label setting. The generated trigger of the
proposed attack using one lossy compression algorithm is also transferable
across other related compression algorithms, exacerbating the severity of this
backdoor threat. This work takes another crucial step toward understanding the
extensive risks of backdoor attacks in practice, urging practitioners to
investigate similar attacks and relevant backdoor mitigation methods.]]></summary>

practicality across various applications. Compared to the centralized version,
training a shared model among a large number of nodes in DFL is more
challenging, as there is no central server to coordinate the training process.
Especially when distributed nodes suffer from limitations in communication or
computational resources, DFL will experience extremely inefficient and unstable
training. Motivated by these challenges, in this paper, we develop a novel
algorithm based on the framework of the inexact alternating direction method
(iADM). On one hand, our goal is to train a shared model with a sparsity
constraint. This constraint enables us to leverage one-bit compressive sensing
(1BCS), allowing transmission of one-bit information among neighbour nodes. On
the other hand, communication between neighbour nodes occurs only at certain
steps, reducing the number of communication rounds. Therefore, the algorithm
exhibits notable communication efficiency. Additionally, as each node selects
only a subset of neighbours to participate in the training, the algorithm is
robust against stragglers. Additionally, complex items are computed only once
for several consecutive steps and subproblems are solved inexactly using
closed-form solutions, resulting in high computational efficiency. Finally,
numerical experiments showcase the algorithm's effectiveness in both
communication and computation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Several decades ago, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were introduced for
performing binary classification tasks, under a supervised framework. Nowadays,
they often outperform other supervised methods and remain one of the most
popular approaches in the machine learning arena. In this work, we investigate
the training of SVMs through a smooth sparse-promoting-regularized squared
hinge loss minimization. This choice paves the way to the application of quick
training methods built on majorization-minimization approaches, benefiting from
the Lipschitz differentiabililty of the loss function. Moreover, the proposed
approach allows us to handle sparsity-preserving regularizers promoting the
selection of the most significant features, so enhancing the performance.
Numerical tests and comparisons conducted on three different datasets
demonstrate the good performance of the proposed methodology in terms of
qualitative metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F 1 score) as well as

support systems (DSSs). The best-performing predictive models used in AI-based
DSSs lack transparency. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to
create AI systems that can explain their rationale to human users. Local
explanations in XAI can provide information about the causes of individual
predictions in terms of feature importance. However, a critical drawback of
existing local explanation methods is their inability to quantify the
uncertainty associated with a feature's importance. This paper introduces an
extension of a feature importance explanation method, Calibrated Explanations
(CE), previously only supporting classification, with support for standard
regression and probabilistic regression, i.e., the probability that the target
is above an arbitrary threshold. The extension for regression keeps all the
benefits of CE, such as calibration of the prediction from the underlying model
with confidence intervals, uncertainty quantification of feature importance,
and allows both factual and counterfactual explanations. CE for standard
regression provides fast, reliable, stable, and robust explanations. CE for
probabilistic regression provides an entirely new way of creating probabilistic
explanations from any ordinary regression model and with a dynamic selection of
thresholds. The performance of CE for probabilistic regression regarding
stability and speed is comparable to LIME. The method is model agnostic with
easily understood conditional rules. An implementation in Python is freely
available on GitHub and for installation using pip making the results in this
paper easily replicable.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Detection of tumors in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) plays an essential
role in the early diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer. Deep learning models
backboned by fully convolutional neural networks (FCNNs) have become the
dominant model for segmenting 3D computerized tomography (CT) scans. However,
since their convolution layers suffer from limited kernel size, they are not
able to capture long-range dependencies and global context. To tackle this
restriction, vision transformers have been introduced to solve FCNN's locality
of receptive fields. Although transformers can capture long-range features,
their segmentation performance decreases with various tumor sizes due to the
model sensitivity to the input patch size. While finding an optimal patch size
improves the performance of vision transformer-based models on segmentation
tasks, it is a time-consuming and challenging procedure. This paper proposes a
technique to select the vision transformer's optimal input multi-resolution
image patch size based on the average volume size of metastasis lesions. We
further validated our suggested framework using a transfer-learning technique,
demonstrating that the highest Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) performance
was obtained by pre-training on training data with a larger tumour volume using
the suggested ideal patch size and then training with a smaller one. We
experimentally evaluate this idea through pre-training our model on a
multi-resolution public dataset. Our model showed consistent and improved
results when applied to our private multi-resolution mCRC dataset with a
smaller average tumor volume. This study lays the groundwork for optimizing
semantic segmentation of small objects using vision transformers. The

location labels, which imposes a high deployment cost. This paper develops a
region-based radio map from received signal strength (RSS) measurements without
location labels. The construction is based on a set of blindly collected RSS
measurement data from a device that visits each region in an indoor area
exactly once, where the footprints and timestamps are not recorded. The main
challenge is to cluster the RSS data and match clusters with the physical
regions. Classical clustering algorithms fail to work as the RSS data naturally
appears as non-clustered due to multipaths and noise. In this paper, a signal
subspace model with a sequential prior is constructed for the RSS data, and an
integrated segmentation and clustering algorithm is developed, which is shown
to find the globally optimal solution in a special case. Furthermore, the
clustered data is matched with the physical regions using a graph-based
approach. Based on real measurements from an office space, the proposed scheme
reduces the region localization error by roughly 50% compared to a weighted
centroid localization (WCL) baseline, and it even outperforms some supervised
localization schemes, including k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector
machine (SVM), and deep neural network (DNN), which require labeled data for

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The success of existing multi-view clustering (MVC) relies on the assumption
that all views are complete. However, samples are usually partially available
due to data corruption or sensor malfunction, which raises the research of
incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC). Although several anchor-based IMVC
methods have been proposed to process the large-scale incomplete data, they
still suffer from the following drawbacks: i) Most existing approaches neglect
the inter-view discrepancy and enforce cross-view representation to be
consistent, which would corrupt the representation capability of the model; ii)
Due to the samples disparity between different views, the learned anchor might
be misaligned, which we referred as the Anchor-Unaligned Problem for Incomplete
data (AUP-ID). Such the AUP-ID would cause inaccurate graph fusion and degrades
clustering performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel incomplete
anchor graph learning framework termed Scalable Incomplete Multi-View
Clustering with Structure Alignment (SIMVC-SA). Specially, we construct the
view-specific anchor graph to capture the complementary information from
different views. In order to solve the AUP-ID, we propose a novel structure
alignment module to refine the cross-view anchor correspondence. Meanwhile, the
anchor graph construction and alignment are jointly optimized in our unified
framework to enhance clustering quality. Through anchor graph construction
instead of full graphs, the time and space complexity of the proposed SIMVC-SA
is proven to be linearly correlated with the number of samples. Extensive
experiments on seven incomplete benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. Our code is publicly

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Masked image modeling has been demonstrated as a powerful pretext task for
generating robust representations that can be effectively generalized across
multiple downstream tasks. Typically, this approach involves randomly masking
patches (tokens) in input images, with the masking strategy remaining unchanged
during training. In this paper, we propose a curriculum learning approach that
updates the masking strategy to continually increase the complexity of the
self-supervised reconstruction task. We conjecture that, by gradually
increasing the task complexity, the model can learn more sophisticated and
transferable representations. To facilitate this, we introduce a novel
learnable masking module that possesses the capability to generate masks of
different complexities, and integrate the proposed module into masked
autoencoders (MAE). Our module is jointly trained with the MAE, while adjusting
its behavior during training, transitioning from a partner to the MAE
(optimizing the same reconstruction loss) to an adversary (optimizing the
opposite loss), while passing through a neutral state. The transition between
these behaviors is smooth, being regulated by a factor that is multiplied with
the reconstruction loss of the masking module. The resulting training procedure
generates an easy-to-hard curriculum. We train our Curriculum-Learned Masked
Autoencoder (CL-MAE) on ImageNet and show that it exhibits superior
representation learning capabilities compared to MAE. The empirical results on
five downstream tasks confirm our conjecture, demonstrating that curriculum
learning can be successfully used to self-supervise masked autoencoders.]]></summary>

that: 1) working with quantum data can be perceived as embedding physical
system parameters through a hidden feature map; 2) their high performance for
quantum phase recognition can be attributed to generation of a very suitable
basis set during the ground state embedding, where quantum criticality of spin
models leads to basis functions with rapidly changing features; 3) pooling
layers of QCNNs are responsible for picking those basis functions that can
contribute to forming a high-performing decision boundary, and the learning
process corresponds to adapting the measurement such that few-qubit operators
are mapped to full-register observables; 4) generalization of QCNN models
strongly depends on the embedding type, and that rotation-based feature maps
with the Fourier basis require careful feature engineering; 5) accuracy and
generalization of QCNNs with readout based on a limited number of shots favor
the ground state embeddings and associated physics-informed models. We
demonstrate these points in simulation, where our results shed light on
classification for physical processes, relevant for applications in sensing.
Finally, we show that QCNNs with properly chosen ground state embeddings can be
used for fluid dynamics problems, expressing shock wave solutions with good

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graph classification, aiming at learning the graph-level representations for
effective class assignments, has received outstanding achievements, which
heavily relies on high-quality datasets that have balanced class distribution.
In fact, most real-world graph data naturally presents a long-tailed form,
where the head classes occupy much more samples than the tail classes, it thus
is essential to study the graph-level classification over long-tailed data
while still remaining largely unexplored. However, most existing long-tailed
learning methods in visions fail to jointly optimize the representation
learning and classifier training, as well as neglect the mining of the
hard-to-classify classes. Directly applying existing methods to graphs may lead
to sub-optimal performance, since the model trained on graphs would be more
sensitive to the long-tailed distribution due to the complex topological
characteristics. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel long-tailed
graph-level classification framework via Collaborative Multi-expert Learning
(CoMe) to tackle the problem. To equilibrate the contributions of head and tail
classes, we first develop balanced contrastive learning from the view of
representation learning, and then design an individual-expert classifier
training based on hard class mining. In addition, we execute gated fusion and
disentangled knowledge distillation among the multiple experts to promote the
collaboration in a multi-expert framework. Comprehensive experiments are
performed on seven widely-used benchmark datasets to demonstrate the
superiority of our method CoMe over state-of-the-art baselines.]]></summary>

improving quantitative metrics regardless of other factors. In human-centered
applications, like skin lesion classification in dermatology, DL-driven
clinical decision support systems are still in their infancy due to the limited
transparency of their decision-making process. Moreover, the lack of procedures
that can explain the behavior of trained DL algorithms leads to almost no trust
from clinical physicians. To diagnose skin lesions, dermatologists rely on
visual assessment of the disease and the data gathered from the patient's
anamnesis. Data-driven algorithms dealing with multi-modal data are limited by
the separation of feature-level and decision-level fusion procedures required
by convolutional architectures. To address this issue, we enable single-stage
multi-modal data fusion via the attention mechanism of transformer-based
architectures to aid in diagnosing skin diseases. Our method beats other
state-of-the-art single- and multi-modal DL architectures in image-rich and

label-deficient target network by transferring the knowledge from a source
network with abundant labels, draws increasing attention recently. To address
CNNC, we propose a domain-adaptive message passing graph neural network
(DM-GNN), which integrates graph neural network (GNN) with conditional
adversarial domain adaptation. DM-GNN is capable of learning informative
representations for node classification that are also transferrable across
networks. Firstly, a GNN encoder is constructed by dual feature extractors to
separate ego-embedding learning from neighbor-embedding learning so as to
jointly capture commonality and discrimination between connected nodes.
Secondly, a label propagation node classifier is proposed to refine each node's
label prediction by combining its own prediction and its neighbors' prediction.
In addition, a label-aware propagation scheme is devised for the labeled source
network to promote intra-class propagation while avoiding inter-class
propagation, thus yielding label-discriminative source embeddings. Thirdly,
conditional adversarial domain adaptation is performed to take the
neighborhood-refined class-label information into account during adversarial
domain adaptation, so that the class-conditional distributions across networks
can be better matched. Comparisons with eleven state-of-the-art methods
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DM-GNN.]]></summary>

testing. This could be sub-optimal since it is difficult for the same model to
handle all the variations during testing. In this paper, we propose a test-time
adaptation approach for PCR. Our model can adapt to unseen distributions at
test-time without requiring any prior knowledge of the test data. Concretely,
we design three self-supervised auxiliary tasks that are optimized jointly with
the primary PCR task. Given a test instance, we adapt our model using these
auxiliary tasks and the updated model is used to perform the inference. During
training, our model is trained using a meta-auxiliary learning approach, such
that the adapted model via auxiliary tasks improves the accuracy of the primary
task. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
improving generalization of point cloud registration and outperforming other
state-of-the-art approaches.]]></summary>

negatively impact downstream applications in robotic systems. While existing
point cloud upsampling architectures have demonstrated promising results on
standard benchmarks, they tend to experience significant performance drops when
the test data have different distributions from the training data. To address
this issue, this paper proposes a test-time adaption approach to enhance model
generality of point cloud upsampling. The proposed approach leverages
meta-learning to explicitly learn network parameters for test-time adaption.
Our method does not require any prior information about the test data. During
meta-training, the model parameters are learned from a collection of
instance-level tasks, each of which consists of a sparse-dense pair of point
clouds from the training data. During meta-testing, the trained model is
fine-tuned with a few gradient updates to produce a unique set of network
parameters for each test instance. The updated model is then used for the final
prediction. Our framework is generic and can be applied in a plug-and-play
manner with existing backbone networks in point cloud upsampling. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of
state-of-the-art models.]]></summary>

a series of temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) have been proposed. Despite

different TGNN models can be fairly compared. Further, BenchTemp engineers a
standard pipeline that unifies the TGNN evaluation. With BenchTemp, we
extensively compare the representative TGNN models on different tasks (e.g.,

incorporating data analysis replications into classrooms as a potential
solution. However, despite the potential benefits, it is unclear whether this
approach is feasible, and if so, what the involved stakeholders-students,
educators, and scientists-should expect from it. Can students perform a data
analysis replication over the course of a class? What are the costs and
benefits for educators? And how can this solution help benchmark and improve
the state of science?

In the present study, we incorporated data analysis replications in the
project component of the Applied Data Analysis course (CS-401) taught at EPFL
(N=354 students). Here we report pre-registered findings based on surveys
administered throughout the course. First, we demonstrate that students can
replicate previously published scientific papers, most of them qualitatively
and some exactly. We find discrepancies between what students expect of data
analysis replications and what they experience by doing them along with changes
in expectations about reproducibility, which together serve as evidence of
attitude shifts to foster students' critical thinking. Second, we provide
information for educators about how much overhead is needed to incorporate
replications into the classroom and identify concerns that replications bring
as compared to more traditional assignments. Third, we identify tangible
benefits of the in-class data analysis replications for scientific communities,
such as a collection of replication reports and insights about replication
barriers in scientific work that should be avoided going forward.

Overall, we demonstrate that incorporating replication tasks into a large
data science class can increase the reproducibility of scientific work as a
by-product of data science instruction, thus benefiting both science and
students.]]></summary>

calculation of gradients by using a generically written ``backslash'' or
Gaussian elimination on triangular systems of equations. Generally, the matrix
elements are operators. This paper has three contributions: (i) it is of
intellectual value to replace traditional treatments of automatic
differentiation with a (left acting) operator theoretic, graph-based approach;
(ii) operators can be readily placed in matrices in software in programming
languages such as Julia as an implementation option; (iii) we introduce a novel
notation, ``transpose dot'' operator ``$\{\}^{T_\bullet}$'' that allows for the
reversal of operators.

We further demonstrate the elegance of the operators approach in a suitable
programming language consisting of generic linear algebra operators such as
Julia \cite{bezanson2017julia}, and that it is possible to realize this
abstraction in code. Our implementation shows how generic linear algebra can
allow operators as elements of matrices. In contrast to ``operator
overloading,'' where backslash would normally have to be rewritten to take
advantage of operators, with ``generic programming'' there is no such need.]]></summary>

attention. On one hand, neural methods, such as graph neural networks, have
proven to be robust tools for learning rich representations of noisy graphs. On
the other hand, symbolic methods enable exact reasoning on graphs.We propose
Knowledge Enhanced Graph Neural Networks (KeGNN), a neuro-symbolic framework
for graph completion that combines both paradigms as it allows for the
integration of prior knowledge into a graph neural network model.Essentially,
KeGNN consists of a graph neural network as a base upon which knowledge
enhancement layers are stacked with the goal of refining predictions with
respect to prior knowledge.We instantiate KeGNN in conjunction with two

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Normalizing flow is a class of deep generative models for efficient sampling
and density estimation. In practice, the flow often appears as a chain of
invertible neural network blocks; to facilitate training, existing works have
regularized flow trajectories and designed special network architectures. The
current paper develops a neural ODE flow network inspired by the
Jordan-Kinderleherer-Otto (JKO) scheme, which allows efficient block-wise
training of the residual blocks without sampling SDE trajectories or inner
loops of score matching or variational learning. As the JKO scheme unfolds the
dynamic of gradient flow, the proposed model naturally stacks residual network
blocks one by one, reducing the memory load and difficulty in performing
end-to-end deep flow network training. We also develop adaptive time
reparameterization of the flow network with a progressive refinement of the
trajectory in probability space, which improves the model training efficiency
and accuracy in practice. Using numerical experiments with synthetic and real
data, we show that the proposed JKO-iFlow model achieves similar or better
performance in generating new samples compared with the existing flow and
diffusion models at a significantly reduced computational and memory cost.]]></summary>

capture well both local and global information in two dimensions, which is

Encrypted Traffic Classification (ETC) naturally plays a crucial role in
managing mobile Internet, especially with the explosive growth of mobile apps
using encrypted communication. Despite some existing learning-based ETC methods
showing promising results, three-fold limitations still remain in real-world
network environments, 1) label bias caused by traffic class imbalance, 2)
traffic homogeneity caused by component sharing, and 3) training with reliance
on sufficient labeled traffic. None of the existing ETC methods can address all
these limitations. In this paper, we propose a novel Pre-trAining
Semi-Supervised ETC framework, dubbed PASS. Our key insight is to resample the
original train dataset and perform contrastive pre-training without using
individual app labels directly to avoid label bias issues caused by class
imbalance, while obtaining a robust feature representation to differentiate
overlapping homogeneous traffic by pulling positive traffic pairs closer and
pushing negative pairs away. Meanwhile, PASS designs a semi-supervised
optimization strategy based on pseudo-label iteration and dynamic loss
weighting algorithms in order to effectively utilize massive unlabeled traffic
data and alleviate manual train dataset annotation workload. PASS outperforms
state-of-the-art ETC methods and generic sampling approaches on four public
datasets with significant class imbalance and traffic homogeneity, remarkably
pushing the F1 of Cross-Platform215 with 1.31%, ISCX-17 with 9.12%.
Furthermore, we validate the generality of the contrastive pre-training and
pseudo-label iteration components of PASS, which can adaptively benefit ETC
methods with diverse feature extractors.]]></summary>

ground and excited states of quantum systems. Our approach is based on
approximating wavefunctions in the linear span of basis functions that are

a large number of vibrational states of the triatomic H$_2$S molecule as well
as ground and several excited electronic states of prototypical one-electron
systems including the hydrogen atom, the molecular hydrogen ion, and a carbon
atom in a single-active-electron approximation. The results demonstrate
significant improvements in the accuracy of energy predictions and accelerated
basis-set convergence even when using normalizing flows with a small number of

and density estimation. In practice, the flow often appears as a chain of
invertible neural network blocks; to facilitate training, existing works have
regularized flow trajectories and designed special network architectures. The
current paper develops a neural ODE flow network inspired by the
Jordan-Kinderleherer-Otto (JKO) scheme, which allows efficient block-wise
training of the residual blocks without sampling SDE trajectories or inner
loops of score matching or variational learning. As the JKO scheme unfolds the
dynamic of gradient flow, the proposed model naturally stacks residual network
blocks one by one, reducing the memory load and difficulty in performing
end-to-end deep flow network training. We also develop adaptive time
reparameterization of the flow network with a progressive refinement of the
trajectory in probability space, which improves the model training efficiency
and accuracy in practice. Using numerical experiments with synthetic and real
data, we show that the proposed JKO-iFlow model achieves similar or better
performance in generating new samples compared with the existing flow and
diffusion models at a significantly reduced computational and memory cost.]]></summary>

and robustness against adversarial examples in deep neural networks (DNNs).
Although adversarial training (AT) improves robustness, it degrades the
standard accuracy, thus yielding the tradeoff. To mitigate this tradeoff, we
propose a novel AT method called ARREST, which comprises three components: (i)
adversarial finetuning (AFT), (ii) representation-guided knowledge distillation
(RGKD), and (iii) noisy replay (NR). AFT trains a DNN on adversarial examples
by initializing its parameters with a DNN that is standardly pretrained on
clean examples. RGKD and NR respectively entail a regularization term and an
algorithm to preserve latent representations of clean examples during AFT. RGKD
penalizes the distance between the representations of the standardly pretrained
and AFT DNNs. NR switches input adversarial examples to nonadversarial ones
when the representation changes significantly during AFT. By combining these
components, ARREST achieves both high standard accuracy and robustness.
Experimental results demonstrate that ARREST mitigates the tradeoff more
effectively than previous AT-based methods do.]]></summary>

rapidly emerged as powerful tools for generating realistic and diverse data
across various domains, including computer vision and other applied areas.
Consisting of a discriminative network and a generative network engaged in a
Minimax game, GANs have revolutionized the field of generative modeling. In
February 2018, GAN secured the leading spot on the ``Top Ten Global
Breakthrough Technologies List'' issued by the Massachusetts Science and
Technology Review. Over the years, numerous advancements have been proposed,
leading to a rich array of GAN variants, such as conditional GAN, Wasserstein
GAN, CycleGAN, and StyleGAN, among many others. This survey aims to provide a
general overview of GANs, summarizing the latent architecture, validation
metrics, and application areas of the most widely recognized variants. We also
delve into recent theoretical developments, exploring the profound connection
between the adversarial principle underlying GAN and Jensen-Shannon divergence,
while discussing the optimality characteristics of the GAN framework. The
efficiency of GAN variants and their model architectures will be evaluated
along with training obstacles as well as training solutions. In addition, a
detailed discussion will be provided, examining the integration of GANs with
newly developed deep learning frameworks such as Transformers, Physics-Informed
Neural Networks, Large Language models, and Diffusion models. Finally, we

systems. There has been an emergence of various public CTR datasets. However,
existing datasets primarily suffer from the following limitations. Firstly,
users generally click different types of items from multiple scenarios, and
modeling from multiple scenarios can provide a more comprehensive understanding
of users. Existing datasets only include data for the same type of items from a
single scenario. Secondly, multi-modal features are essential in multi-scenario
prediction as they address the issue of inconsistent ID encoding between
different scenarios. The existing datasets are based on ID features and lack
multi-modal features. Third, a large-scale dataset can provide a more reliable
evaluation of models, fully reflecting the performance differences between
models. The scale of existing datasets is around 100 million, which is
relatively small compared to the real-world CTR prediction. To address these
limitations, we propose AntM$^{2}$C, a Multi-Scenario Multi-Modal CTR dataset
based on industrial data from Alipay. Specifically, AntM$^{2}$C provides the
following advantages: 1) It covers CTR data of 5 different types of items,
providing insights into the preferences of users for different items, including
advertisements, vouchers, mini-programs, contents, and videos. 2) Apart from
ID-based features, AntM$^{2}$C also provides 2 multi-modal features, raw text
and image features, which can effectively establish connections between items
with different IDs. 3) AntM$^{2}$C provides 1 billion CTR data with 200
features, including 200 million users and 6 million items. It is currently the
largest-scale CTR dataset available. Based on AntM$^{2}$C, we construct several
typical CTR tasks and provide comparisons with baseline methods. The dataset

wide range of downstream applications such as segmentation and detection.
Previous works have shown that segmentation properties emerge in vision
transformers (ViTs) trained using self-supervised methods such as DINO, but not
in those trained on supervised classification tasks. In this study, we probe
whether segmentation emerges in transformer-based models solely as a result of
intricate self-supervised learning mechanisms, or if the same emergence can be
achieved under much broader conditions through proper design of the model
architecture. Through extensive experimental results, we demonstrate that when
employing a white-box transformer-like architecture known as CRATE, whose
design explicitly models and pursues low-dimensional structures in the data
distribution, segmentation properties, at both the whole and parts levels,
already emerge with a minimalistic supervised training recipe. Layer-wise
finer-grained analysis reveals that the emergent properties strongly
corroborate the designed mathematical functions of the white-box network. Our
results suggest a path to design white-box foundation models that are
simultaneously highly performant and mathematically fully interpretable. Code

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emotion recognition using electroencephalogram (EEG) mainly has two
scenarios: classification of the discrete labels and regression of the
continuously tagged labels. Although many algorithms were proposed for
classification tasks, there are only a few methods for regression tasks. For
emotion regression, the label is continuous in time. A natural method is to
learn the temporal dynamic patterns. In previous studies, long short-term
memory (LSTM) and temporal convolutional neural networks (TCN) were utilized to
learn the temporal contextual information from feature vectors of EEG. However,
the spatial patterns of EEG were not effectively extracted. To enable the
spatial learning ability of TCN towards better regression and classification
performances, we propose a novel unified model, named MASA-TCN, for EEG emotion
regression and classification tasks. The space-aware temporal layer enables TCN
to additionally learn from spatial relations among EEG electrodes. Besides, a
novel multi-anchor block with attentive fusion is proposed to learn dynamic
temporal dependencies. Experiments on two publicly available datasets show
MASA-TCN achieves higher results than the state-of-the-art methods for both EEG
emotion regression and classification tasks. The code is available at

ability to handle graph-structured data and the improvement in practical
applications. However, many of these models prioritize high utility
performance, such as accuracy, with a lack of privacy consideration, which is a
major concern in modern society where privacy attacks are rampant. To address
this issue, researchers have started to develop privacy-preserving GNNs.
Despite this progress, there is a lack of a comprehensive overview of the
attacks and the techniques for preserving privacy in the graph domain. In this
survey, we aim to address this gap by summarizing the attacks on graph data
according to the targeted information, categorizing the privacy preservation
techniques in GNNs, and reviewing the datasets and applications that could be
used for analyzing/solving privacy issues in GNNs. We also outline potential
directions for future research in order to build better privacy-preserving
GNNs.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Performance of classifiers is often measured in terms of average accuracy on
test data. Despite being a standard measure, average accuracy fails in
characterizing the fit of the model to the underlying conditional law of labels
given the features vector ($Y|X$), e.g. due to model misspecification, over
fitting, and high-dimensionality. In this paper, we consider the fundamental
problem of assessing the goodness-of-fit for a general binary classifier. Our
framework does not make any parametric assumption on the conditional law $Y|X$,
and treats that as a black box oracle model which can be accessed only through
queries. We formulate the goodness-of-fit assessment problem as a tolerance
hypothesis testing of the form \[ H_0: \mathbb{E}\Big[D_f\Big({\sf
Bern}(\eta(X))\|{\sf Bern}(\hat{\eta}(X))\Big)\Big]\leq \tau\,, \] where $D_f$
represents an $f$-divergence function, and $\eta(x)$, $\hat{\eta}(x)$
respectively denote the true and an estimate likelihood for a feature vector
$x$ admitting a positive label. We propose a novel test, called \grasp for
testing $H_0$, which works in finite sample settings, no matter the features
(distribution-free). We also propose model-X \grasp designed for model-X
settings where the joint distribution of the features vector is known. Model-X
\grasp uses this distributional information to achieve better power. We
evaluate the performance of our tests through extensive numerical experiments.]]></summary>

function designed for data with simultaneous time and space dependencies. In
such a context, we study the Trend Filtering, a nonparametric estimator

univariate settings, the signals we consider are assumed to have a kth weak
derivative with bounded total variation, allowing for a general degree of
smoothness. In the multivariate scenario, we study a $K$-Nearest Neighbor fused
lasso estimator as in \cite{padilla2018adaptive}, employing an ADMM algorithm,
suitable for signals with bounded variation that adhere to a piecewise
Lipschitz continuity criterion. By aligning with lower bounds, the minimax
optimality of our estimators is validated. A unique phase transition
phenomenon, previously uncharted in Trend Filtering studies, emerges through
our analysis. Both Simulation studies and real data applications underscore the

dissemination is crucial for supporting critical operations across domains like
disaster response, autonomous vehicles, and sensor networks. This paper
introduces a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach as a
significant step forward in achieving more decentralized, efficient, and
collaborative solutions. We propose a Decentralized-POMDP formulation for
information dissemination, empowering each agent to independently decide on
message forwarding. This constitutes a significant paradigm shift from
traditional heuristics based on Multi-Point Relay (MPR) selection. Our approach
harnesses Graph Convolutional Reinforcement Learning, employing Graph Attention
Networks (GAT) with dynamic attention to capture essential network features. We
propose two approaches, L-DGN and HL-DGN, which differ in the information that
is exchanged among agents. We evaluate the performance of our decentralized
approaches, by comparing them with a widely-used MPR heuristic, and we show
that our trained policies are able to efficiently cover the network while
bypassing the MPR set selection process. Our approach promises a first step
toward bolstering the resilience of real-world broadcast communication
infrastructures via learned, collaborative information dissemination.]]></summary>

designing reaction pathways from commercially available starting materials to a
target molecule. Each step in multi-step retrosynthesis planning requires
accurate prediction of possible precursor molecules given the target molecule

single-step retrosynthesis planning as a distribution learning problem in a
discrete state space. First, we introduce the Markov Bridge Model, a generative
framework aimed to approximate the dependency between two intractable discrete
distributions accessible via a finite sample of coupled data points. Our
framework is based on the concept of a Markov bridge, a Markov process pinned
at its endpoints. Unlike diffusion-based methods, our Markov Bridge Model does
not need a tractable noise distribution as a sampling proxy and directly
operates on the input product molecules as samples from the intractable prior
distribution. We then address the retrosynthesis planning problem with our
novel framework and introduce RetroBridge, a template-free retrosynthesis
modeling approach that achieves state-of-the-art results on standard evaluation

nonparametric modeling, they exhibit limitations in effectively capturing
abrupt changes in function smoothness and accommodating relationships with
heteroscedastic errors. Addressing these shortcomings, the heteroscedastic
Gaussian process (HeGP) regression seeks to introduce flexibility by
acknowledging the variability of residual variances across covariates in the
regression model. In this work, we extend the HeGP concept, expanding its scope
beyond regression tasks to encompass classification and state-space models. To
achieve this, we propose a novel framework where the Gaussian process is
coupled with a covariate-induced precision matrix process, adopting a mixture
formulation. This approach enables the modeling of heteroscedastic covariance
functions across covariates. To mitigate the computational challenges posed by
sampling, we employ variational inference to approximate the posterior and
facilitate posterior predictive modeling. Additionally, our training process
leverages an EM algorithm featuring closed-form M-step updates to efficiently
evaluate the heteroscedastic covariance function. A notable feature of our
model is its consistent performance on multivariate responses, accommodating
various types (continuous or categorical) seamlessly. Through a combination of
simulations and real-world applications in climatology, we illustrate the
model's prowess and advantages. By overcoming the limitations of traditional

Transmitting videos in the face of dynamic network bandwidth conditions

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Large-scale linear systems, $Ax=b$, frequently arise in practice and demand
effective iterative solvers. Often, these systems are noisy due to operational
errors or faulty data-collection processes. In the past decade, the randomized
Kaczmarz (RK) algorithm has been studied extensively as an efficient iterative
solver for such systems. However, the convergence study of RK in the noisy
regime is limited and considers measurement noise in the right-hand side
vector, $b$. Unfortunately, in practice, that is not always the case; the
coefficient matrix $A$ can also be noisy. In this paper, we analyze the
convergence of RK for noisy linear systems when the coefficient matrix, $A$, is
corrupted with both additive and multiplicative noise, along with the noisy
vector, $b$. In our analyses, the quantity $\tilde R=\| \tilde A^{\dagger}
\|_2^2 \|\tilde A \|_F^2$ influences the convergence of RK, where $\tilde A$
represents a noisy version of $A$. We claim that our analysis is robust and
realistically applicable, as we do not require information about the noiseless
coefficient matrix, $A$, and considering different conditions on noise, we can
control the convergence of RK. We substantiate our theoretical findings by
performing comprehensive numerical experiments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a prominent research topic in
the field of machine learning. Existing GNN models are commonly categorized
into two types: spectral GNNs, which are designed based on polynomial graph
filters, and spatial GNNs, which utilize a message-passing scheme as the
foundation of the model. For the expressive power and universality of spectral
GNNs, a natural approach is to improve the design of basis functions for better
approximation ability. As for spatial GNNs, models like Graph Isomorphism
Networks (GIN) analyze their expressive power based on Graph Isomorphism Tests.
Recently, there have been attempts to establish connections between spatial
GNNs and geometric concepts like curvature and cellular sheaves, as well as
physical phenomena like oscillators. However, despite the recent progress,
there is still a lack of comprehensive analysis regarding the universality of
spatial GNNs from the perspectives of geometry and physics. In this paper, we
propose MetricGNN (MGNN), a spatial GNN model inspired by the
congruent-insensitivity property of classifiers in the classification phase of
GNNs. We demonstrate that a GNN model is universal in the spatial domain if it
can generate embedding matrices that are congruent to any given embedding
matrix. This property is closely related to the Distance Geometry Problem
(DGP). Since DGP is an NP-Hard combinatorial optimization problem, we propose
optimizing an energy function derived from spring networks and the
Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) problem. This approach also allows our model to
handle both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Finally, we propose employing
the iteration method to optimize our energy function. We extensively evaluate
the effectiveness of our model through experiments conducted on both synthetic
and real-world datasets. Our code is available at:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this work, we study the problem of semantic communication and inference,
in which a student agent (i.e. mobile device) queries a teacher agent (i.e.
cloud sever) to generate higher-order data semantics living in a simplicial
complex. Specifically, the teacher first maps its data into a k-order
simplicial complex and learns its high-order correlations. For effective
communication and inference, the teacher seeks minimally sufficient and
invariant semantic structures prior to conveying information. These minimal
simplicial structures are found via judiciously removing simplices selected by
the Hodge Laplacians without compromising the inference query accuracy.
Subsequently, the student locally runs its own set of queries based on a masked
simplicial convolutional autoencoder (SCAE) leveraging both local and remote
teacher's knowledge. Numerical results corroborate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach in terms of improving inference query accuracy under
different channel conditions and simplicial structures. Experiments on a
coauthorship dataset show that removing simplices by ranking the Laplacian
values yields a 85% reduction in payload size without sacrificing accuracy.
Joint semantic communication and inference by masked SCAE improves query
accuracy by 25% compared to local student based query and 15% compared to
remote teacher based query. Finally, incorporating channel semantics is shown
to effectively improve inference accuracy, notably at low SNR values.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Accurate traffic forecasting at intersections governed by intelligent traffic
signals is critical for the advancement of an effective intelligent traffic
signal control system. However, due to the irregular traffic time series
produced by intelligent intersections, the traffic forecasting task becomes
much more intractable and imposes three major new challenges: 1) asynchronous
spatial dependency, 2) irregular temporal dependency among traffic data, and 3)
variable-length sequence to be predicted, which severely impede the performance
of current traffic forecasting methods. To this end, we propose an Asynchronous
Spatio-tEmporal graph convolutional nEtwoRk (ASeer) to predict the traffic
states of the lanes entering intelligent intersections in a future time window.
Specifically, by linking lanes via a traffic diffusion graph, we first propose
an Asynchronous Graph Diffusion Network to model the asynchronous spatial
dependency between the time-misaligned traffic state measurements of lanes.
After that, to capture the temporal dependency within irregular traffic state
sequence, a learnable personalized time encoding is devised to embed the
continuous time for each lane. Then we propose a Transformable Time-aware
Convolution Network that learns meta-filters to derive time-aware convolution
filters with transformable filter sizes for efficient temporal convolution on
the irregular sequence. Furthermore, a Semi-Autoregressive Prediction Network
consisting of a state evolution unit and a semiautoregressive predictor is
designed to effectively and efficiently predict variable-length traffic state
sequences. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of ASeer in six metrics.]]></summary>

based on either a specific training of a conditional model or classifier
guidance, which requires training a noise-dependent classifier, even when the

unconditional score-based generative models enforcing arbitrary logical
constraints, without any additional training. Firstly, we show how to
manipulate the learned score in order to sample from an un-normalized
distribution conditional on a user-defined constraint. Then, we define a
flexible and numerically stable neuro-symbolic framework for encoding soft
logical constraints. Combining these two ingredients we obtain a general, but
approximate, conditional sampling algorithm. We further developed effective
heuristics aimed at improving the approximation. Finally, we show the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Partial Label Learning (PLL) is a type of weakly supervised learning where
each training instance is assigned a set of candidate labels, but only one
label is the ground-truth. However, this idealistic assumption may not always
hold due to potential annotation inaccuracies, meaning the ground-truth may not
be present in the candidate label set. This is known as Unreliable Partial
Label Learning (UPLL) that introduces an additional complexity due to the
inherent unreliability and ambiguity of partial labels, often resulting in a
sub-optimal performance with existing methods. To address this challenge, we
propose the Unreliability-Robust Representation Learning framework (URRL) that
leverages unreliability-robust contrastive learning to help the model fortify
against unreliable partial labels effectively. Concurrently, we propose a dual
strategy that combines KNN-based candidate label set correction and
consistency-regularization-based label disambiguation to refine label quality
and enhance the ability of representation learning within the URRL framework.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art PLL methods on various datasets with diverse degrees of
unreliability and ambiguity. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of
our approach from the perspective of the expectation maximization (EM)
algorithm. Upon acceptance, we pledge to make the code publicly accessible.]]></summary>

capabilities of graph neural networks (GNNs). While over-smoothing eliminates
the differences between nodes making them indistinguishable, over-squashing
refers to the inability of GNNs to propagate information over long distances,
as exponentially many node states are squashed into fixed-size representations.
Both phenomena share similar causes, as both are largely induced by the graph
topology. To mitigate these problems in graph classification tasks, we propose
CurvPool, a novel pooling method. CurvPool exploits the notion of curvature of
a graph to adaptively identify structures responsible for both over-smoothing
and over-squashing. By clustering nodes based on the Balanced Forman curvature,
CurvPool constructs a graph with a more suitable structure, allowing deeper
models and the combination of distant information. We compare it to other
state-of-the-art pooling approaches and establish its competitiveness in terms
of classification accuracy, computational complexity, and flexibility. CurvPool
outperforms several comparable methods across all considered tasks. The most
consistent results are achieved by pooling densely connected clusters using the
sum aggregation, as this allows additional information about the size of each

adequate infrastructure, deployment of low-carbon transport modes and shifts in
travel behavior. To adequately implement alterations in infrastructure, it's
essential to grasp the location-specific cause-and-effect mechanisms that the
constructed environment has on travel. Yet, current research falls short in
representing causal relationships between the 6D urban form variables and
travel, generalizing across different regions, and modeling urban form effects
at high spatial resolution. Here, we address all three gaps by utilizing a
causal discovery and an explainable machine learning framework to detect urban
form effects on intra-city travel based on high-resolution mobility data of six
cities across three continents. We show that both distance to city center,
demographics and density indirectly affect other urban form features. By
considering the causal relationships, we find that location-specific influences
align across cities, yet vary in magnitude. In addition, the spread of the city
and the coverage of jobs across the city are the strongest determinants of
travel-related emissions, highlighting the benefits of compact development and
associated benefits. Differences in urban form effects across the cities call
for a more holistic definition of 6D measures. Our work is a starting point for
location-specific analysis of urban form effects on mobility behavior using
causal discovery approaches, which is highly relevant for city planners and

node lesions. However, the diagnoses of these images largely hinge on the
expertise of medical practitioners, rendering the process susceptible to
misdiagnoses. Although rapidly developing deep learning has substantially
improved the diagnoses of diverse ultrasound images, there remains a
conspicuous research gap concerning cervical lymph nodes. The objective of our
work is to accurately diagnose cervical lymph node lesions by leveraging a deep
learning model. To this end, we first collected 3392 images containing normal
lymph nodes, benign lymph node lesions, malignant primary lymph node lesions,
and malignant metastatic lymph node lesions. Given that ultrasound images are
generated by the reflection and scattering of sound waves across varied bodily
tissues, we proposed the Conv-FFT Block. It integrates convolutional operations
with the fast Fourier transform to more astutely model the images. Building
upon this foundation, we designed a novel architecture, named US-SFNet. This
architecture not only discerns variances in ultrasound images from the spatial
domain but also adeptly captures microstructural alterations across various
lesions in the frequency domain. To ascertain the potential of US-SFNet, we
benchmarked it against 12 popular architectures through five-fold

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The electronic design automation of analog circuits has been a longstanding
challenge in the integrated circuit field due to the huge design space and
complex design trade-offs among circuit specifications. In the past decades,
intensive research efforts have mostly been paid to automate the transistor
sizing with a given circuit topology. By recognizing the graph nature of
circuits, this paper presents a Circuit Graph Neural Network (CktGNN) that
simultaneously automates the circuit topology generation and device sizing
based on the encoder-dependent optimization subroutines. Particularly, CktGNN
encodes circuit graphs using a two-level GNN framework (of nested GNN) where
circuits are represented as combinations of subgraphs in a known subgraph
basis. In this way, it significantly improves design efficiency by reducing the
number of subgraphs to perform message passing. Nonetheless, another critical
roadblock to advancing learning-assisted circuit design automation is a lack of
public benchmarks to perform canonical assessment and reproducible research. To
tackle the challenge, we introduce Open Circuit Benchmark (OCB), an
open-sourced dataset that contains $10$K distinct operational amplifiers with
carefully-extracted circuit specifications. OCB is also equipped with
communicative circuit generation and evaluation capabilities such that it can
help to generalize CktGNN to design various analog circuits by producing
corresponding datasets. Experiments on OCB show the extraordinary advantages of
CktGNN through representation-based optimization frameworks over other recent
powerful GNN baselines and human experts' manual designs. Our work paves the
way toward a learning-based open-sourced design automation for analog circuits.

their complex waveforms, extended duration, and low signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR), making them more challenging to be identified compared to compact binary
coalescences. While matched filtering-based techniques are known for their
computational demands, existing deep learning-based methods primarily handle
time-domain data and are often constrained by data duration and SNR. In
addition, most existing work ignores time-delay interferometry (TDI) and
applies the long-wavelength approximation in detector response calculations,
thus limiting their ability to handle laser frequency noise. In this study, we
introduce DECODE, an end-to-end model focusing on EMRI signal detection by
sequence modeling in the frequency domain. Centered around a dilated causal
convolutional neural network, trained on synthetic data considering TDI-1.5
detector response, DECODE can efficiently process a year's worth of
multichannel TDI data with an SNR of around 50. We evaluate our model on 1-year
data with accumulated SNR ranging from 50 to 120 and achieve a true positive
rate of 96.3% at a false positive rate of 1%, keeping an inference time of less
than 0.01 seconds. With the visualization of three showcased EMRI signals for
interpretability and generalization, DECODE exhibits strong potential for
future space-based gravitational wave data analyses.]]></summary>

modularity, their performance under distribution shifts can be significantly
improved at test time by pruning heads corresponding to spurious features,
which we demonstrate using an "oracle selection" on validation data. Second, we
propose a method to further enhance the diversity and complementarity of the

a growing interest in automated anomaly detection systems. However, the
classification of anomalies detected on network Key Performance Indicators

paper proposes a modular anomaly classification framework. The framework
assumes separate entities for the anomaly classifier and the detector, allowing
for a distinct treatment of anomaly detection and classification tasks on time

that generates synthetic time series resembling real-world network KPI
behavior, (2) to build a detection model to identify anomalies in the time
series, (3) to build classification models that accurately categorize detected
anomalies into predefined classes (4) to evaluate the classification framework
performance on simulated and real-world network KPI time series. This study has
demonstrated the good performance of the anomaly classification models trained
on simulated anomalies when applied to real-world network time series data.]]></summary>

high contrast imaging. However, these structures face challenges in data
reduction, leading to over-subtraction from speckles and self-subtraction with
most existing methods. Iterative post-processing methods offer promising
results, but their integration into existing pipelines is hindered by selective
algorithms, high computational cost, and algorithmic regularization. To address
this for reference differential imaging (RDI), here we propose the data
imputation concept to Karhunen-Lo\`eve transform (DIKL) by modifying two steps
in the standard Karhunen-Lo\`eve image projection (KLIP) method. Specifically,
we partition an image to two matrices: an anchor matrix which focuses only on
the speckles to obtain the DIKL coefficients, and a boat matrix which focuses
on the regions of astrophysical interest for speckle removal using DIKL
components. As an analytical approach, DIKL achieves high-quality results with
significantly reduced computational cost (~3 orders of magnitude less than
iterative methods). Being a derivative method of KLIP, DIKL is seamlessly
integrable into high contrast imaging pipelines for RDI observations.]]></summary>

progression that an exact Metropolis-Hastings (MH) sampler would take if it was
applicable. Informative log-likelihood evaluation locations are selected using
a sequential experimental design strategy until the MH accept/reject decision
is done accurately enough according to the GP model. The resulting approximate
sampler is conceptually simple and sample-efficient. It is also more robust to
violations of GP modelling assumptions compared with earlier, related "Bayesian

differential equations (PDEs), neural networks have the potential to break the
curse of dimensionality, providing approximate solutions to problems where
using classical solvers is difficult or impossible. While global minimization
of the PDE residual over the network parameters works well for boundary value
problems, catastrophic forgetting impairs the applicability of this approach to
initial value problems (IVPs). In an alternative local-in-time approach, the
optimization problem can be converted into an ordinary differential equation
(ODE) on the network parameters and the solution propagated forward in time;
however, we demonstrate that current methods based on this approach suffer from
two key issues. First, following the ODE produces an uncontrolled growth in the
conditioning of the problem, ultimately leading to unacceptably large numerical
errors. Second, as the ODE methods scale cubically with the number of model
parameters, they are restricted to small neural networks, significantly
limiting their ability to represent intricate PDE initial conditions and
solutions. Building on these insights, we develop Neural IVP, an ODE based IVP
solver which prevents the network from getting ill-conditioned and runs in time
linear in the number of parameters, enabling us to evolve the dynamics of

support systems (DSSs). The best-performing predictive models used in AI-based
DSSs lack transparency. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to
create AI systems that can explain their rationale to human users. Local
explanations in XAI can provide information about the causes of individual
predictions in terms of feature importance. However, a critical drawback of
existing local explanation methods is their inability to quantify the
uncertainty associated with a feature's importance. This paper introduces an
extension of a feature importance explanation method, Calibrated Explanations
(CE), previously only supporting classification, with support for standard
regression and probabilistic regression, i.e., the probability that the target
is above an arbitrary threshold. The extension for regression keeps all the
benefits of CE, such as calibration of the prediction from the underlying model

and allows both factual and counterfactual explanations. CE for standard
regression provides fast, reliable, stable, and robust explanations. CE for
probabilistic regression provides an entirely new way of creating probabilistic
explanations from any ordinary regression model and with a dynamic selection of
thresholds. The performance of CE for probabilistic regression regarding
stability and speed is comparable to LIME. The method is model agnostic with
easily understood conditional rules. An implementation in Python is freely

the dynamics of Hamiltonian systems that are invariant under a Lie group of

system respecting its dynamics and, as a consequence, Noether's Theorem,
conserved quantities are observed. We propose to simulate and learn the
mappings of interest through the construction of $G$-invariant Lagrangian
submanifolds, which are pivotal objects in symplectic geometry. A notable
property of our constructions is that the simulated/learned dynamics also
preserves the same conserved quantities as the original system, resulting in a
more faithful surrogate of the original dynamics than non-symmetry aware
methods, and in a more accurate predictor of non-observed trajectories.
Furthermore, our setting is able to simulate/learn not only Hamiltonian flows,
but any Lie group-equivariant symplectic transformation. Our designs leverage
pivotal techniques and concepts in symplectic geometry and geometric mechanics:
reduction theory, Noether's Theorem, Lagrangian submanifolds, momentum
mappings, and coisotropic reduction among others. We also present methods to
learn Poisson transformations while preserving the underlying geometry and how
to endow non-geometric integrators with geometric properties. Thus, this work

powerful, efficient, and scientifically informative than separate analyses. To
address variation architectures correctly and comprehensively for
high-dimensional data across multiple sample sets (i.e., cohorts), we propose
multiple augmented reduced rank regression (maRRR), a flexible matrix
regression and factorization method to concurrently learn both covariate-driven
and auxiliary structured variation. We consider a structured nuclear norm
objective that is motivated by random matrix theory, in which the regression or
factorization terms may be shared or specific to any number of cohorts. Our
framework subsumes several existing methods, such as reduced rank regression
and unsupervised multi-matrix factorization approaches, and includes a
promising novel approach to regression and factorization of a single dataset
(aRRR) as a special case. Simulations demonstrate substantial gains in power
from combining multiple datasets, and from parsimoniously accounting for all
structured variation. We apply maRRR to gene expression data from multiple
cancer types (i.e., pan-cancer) from TCGA, with somatic mutations as
covariates. The method performs well with respect to prediction and imputation
of held-out data, and provides new insights into mutation-driven and auxiliary
variation that is shared or specific to certain cancer types.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Large Language Model (LLM) inference consists of two distinct phases -
prefill phase which processes the input prompt and decode phase which generates
output tokens autoregressively. While the prefill phase effectively saturates
GPU compute at small batch sizes, the decode phase results in low compute
utilization as it generates one token at a time per request. The varying
prefill and decode times also lead to imbalance across micro-batches when using
pipeline parallelism, resulting in further inefficiency due to bubbles.

We present SARATHI to address these challenges. SARATHI employs
chunked-prefills, which splits a prefill request into equal sized chunks, and
decode-maximal batching, which constructs a batch using a single prefill chunk
and populates the remaining slots with decodes. During inference, the prefill
chunk saturates GPU compute, while the decode requests 'piggyback' and cost up
to an order of magnitude less compared to a decode-only batch. Chunked-prefills
allows constructing multiple decode-maximal batches from a single prefill
request, maximizing coverage of decodes that can piggyback. Furthermore, the
uniform compute design of these batches ameliorates the imbalance between
micro-batches, significantly reducing pipeline bubbles.

Our techniques yield significant improvements in inference performance across
models and hardware. For the LLaMA-13B model on A6000 GPU, SARATHI improves
decode throughput by up to 10x, and accelerates end-to-end throughput by up to
1.33x. For LLaMa-33B on A100 GPU, we achieve 1.25x higher end-to-end-throughput
and up to 4.25x higher decode throughput. When used with pipeline parallelism
on GPT-3, SARATHI reduces bubbles by 6.29x, resulting in an end-to-end
throughput improvement of 1.91x.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hypergraphs are important for processing data with higher-order relationships
involving more than two entities. In scenarios where explicit hypergraphs are
not readily available, it is desirable to infer a meaningful hypergraph
structure from the node features to capture the intrinsic relations within the
data. However, existing methods either adopt simple pre-defined rules that fail
to precisely capture the distribution of the potential hypergraph structure, or
learn a mapping between hypergraph structures and node features but require a
large amount of labelled data, i.e., pre-existing hypergraph structures, for
training. Both restrict their applications in practical scenarios. To fill this
gap, we propose a novel smoothness prior that enables us to design a method to
infer the probability for each potential hyperedge without labelled data as
supervision. The proposed prior indicates features of nodes in a hyperedge are
highly correlated by the features of the hyperedge containing them. We use this
prior to derive the relation between the hypergraph structure and the node
features via probabilistic modelling. This allows us to develop an unsupervised
inference method to estimate the probability for each potential hyperedge via
solving an optimisation problem that has an analytical solution. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our method can learn
meaningful hypergraph structures from data more efficiently than existing
hypergraph structure inference methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Community detection is an important content in complex network analysis. The
existing community detection methods in attributed networks mostly focus on
only using network structure, while the methods of integrating node attributes
is mainly for the traditional community structures, and cannot detect
multipartite structures and mixture structures in network. In addition, the
model-based community detection methods currently proposed for attributed
networks do not fully consider unique topology information of nodes, such as
betweenness centrality and clustering coefficient. Therefore, a stochastic
block model that integrates betweenness centrality and clustering coefficient
of nodes for community detection in attributed networks, named BCSBM, is
proposed in this paper. Different from other generative models for attributed
networks, the generation process of links and attributes in BCSBM model follows
the Poisson distribution, and the probability between community is considered
based on the stochastic block model. Moreover, the betweenness centrality and
clustering coefficient of nodes are introduced into the process of links and
attributes generation. Finally, the expectation maximization algorithm is
employed to estimate the parameters of the BCSBM model, and the node-community
memberships is obtained through the hard division process, so the community
detection is completed. By experimenting on six real-work networks containing
different network structures, and comparing with the community detection
results of five algorithms, the experimental results show that the BCSBM model
not only inherits the advantages of the stochastic block model and can detect
various network structures, but also has good data fitting ability due to
introducing the betweenness centrality and clustering coefficient of nodes.
Overall, the performance of this model is superior to other five compared
algorithms.]]></summary>

test data. Despite being a standard measure, average accuracy fails in
characterizing the fit of the model to the underlying conditional law of labels
given the features vector ($Y|X$), e.g. due to model misspecification, over
fitting, and high-dimensionality. In this paper, we consider the fundamental
problem of assessing the goodness-of-fit for a general binary classifier. Our
framework does not make any parametric assumption on the conditional law $Y|X$,
and treats that as a black box oracle model which can be accessed only through
queries. We formulate the goodness-of-fit assessment problem as a tolerance
hypothesis testing of the form \[ H_0: \mathbb{E}\Big[D_f\Big({\sf
Bern}(\eta(X))\|{\sf Bern}(\hat{\eta}(X))\Big)\Big]\leq \tau\,, \] where $D_f$
represents an $f$-divergence function, and $\eta(x)$, $\hat{\eta}(x)$
respectively denote the true and an estimate likelihood for a feature vector
$x$ admitting a positive label. We propose a novel test, called \grasp for
testing $H_0$, which works in finite sample settings, no matter the features
(distribution-free). We also propose model-X \grasp designed for model-X
settings where the joint distribution of the features vector is known. Model-X
\grasp uses this distributional information to achieve better power. We

(ADM) to (partially) automate decisions that have previously been made by
humans. When designed well, these systems promise more objective decisions
while saving large amounts of resources and freeing up human time. However,
when ADM systems are not designed well, they can lead to unfair decisions which
discriminate against societal groups. The downstream effects of ADMs critically
depend on the decisions made during the systems' design and implementation, as
biases in data can be mitigated or reinforced along the modeling pipeline. Many
of these design decisions are made implicitly, without knowing exactly how they
will influence the final system. It is therefore important to make explicit the
decisions made during the design of ADM systems and understand how these
decisions affect the fairness of the resulting system.

To study this issue, we draw on insights from the field of psychology and
introduce the method of multiverse analysis for algorithmic fairness. In our
proposed method, we turn implicit design decisions into explicit ones and
demonstrate their fairness implications. By combining decisions, we create a
grid of all possible "universes" of decision combinations. For each of these
universes, we compute metrics of fairness and performance. Using the resulting
dataset, one can see how and which decisions impact fairness. We demonstrate
how multiverse analyses can be used to better understand variability and
robustness of algorithmic fairness using an exemplary case study of predicting
public health coverage of vulnerable populations for potential interventions.
Our results illustrate how decisions during the design of a machine learning
system can have surprising effects on its fairness and how to detect these
effects using multiverse analysis.]]></summary>

the computation of gradients of MMDs can be performed in the one-dimensional

compactly supported measures can be estimated from above and below by the
Wasserstein-1 distance. For the implementations we approximate the gradient of
the sliced MMD by using only a finite number $P$ of slices. We show that the
resulting error has complexity $O(\sqrt{d/P})$, where $d$ is the data

multi-spectral information of high content images to interpret a certain aspect
of cellular biology. To this end, we base our method on image blending concepts
with alpha compositing for an arbitrary number of channels. More specifically,
we introduce DCMIX, a lightweight, scaleable and end-to-end trainable mixing
layer which enables interpretable predictions in high content imaging while
retaining the benefits of deep learning based methods. We employ an extensive
set of experiments on both MNIST and RXRX1 datasets, demonstrating that DCMIX
learns the biologically relevant channel importance without scarifying
prediction performance.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this article, the optimal sample complexity of learning the underlying
interaction/dependencies of a Linear Dynamical System (LDS) over a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG) is studied. The sample complexity of learning a DAG's
structure is well-studied for static systems, where the samples of nodal states
are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). However, such a study is
less explored for DAGs with dynamical systems, where the nodal states are
temporally correlated. We call such a DAG underlying an LDS as \emph{dynamical}
DAG (DDAG). In particular, we consider a DDAG where the nodal dynamics are
driven by unobserved exogenous noise sources that are wide-sense stationary
(WSS) in time but are mutually uncorrelated, and have the same {power spectral
density (PSD)}. Inspired by the static settings, a metric and an algorithm
based on the PSD matrix of the observed time series are proposed to reconstruct
the DDAG. The equal noise PSD assumption can be relaxed such that
identifiability conditions for DDAG reconstruction are not violated. For the
LDS with WSS (sub) Gaussian exogenous noise sources, it is shown that the
optimal sample complexity (or length of state trajectory) needed to learn the
DDAG is $n=\Theta(q\log(p/q))$, where $p$ is the number of nodes and $q$ is the
maximum number of parents per node. To prove the sample complexity upper bound,
a concentration bound for the PSD estimation is derived, under two different
sampling strategies. A matching min-max lower bound using generalized Fano's
inequality also is provided, thus showing the order optimality of the proposed
algorithm.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi fellow computer scientists and engineers,
 ​
 I've been wondering why do we often have a convolution inside every upsample and downsample block. Well, it makes sense, if you intend to upscale some features and use a bilinear interpolation, then some error can be introduced due to interpolation inaccuracies. This is where convolution layer comes handy to help and support the upscaling. But is this really the reason behind it? Or is there a deeper explanation?
 ​
 Also, just for the sake of curiosity. What if the scale_factor of an upsample block was 1. Should we still keep the convolution layer? or just get rid of all the upsample block since there is no actual "upsampling" being done at least in the context of the tensor dimensions.
 ​
 Thank you :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi fellow computer scientists,
 ​
 1) I have been wondering if there is a preferred way to upsample features. I though about 3 options:
 ​
 1.a) Upsample Layer + Conv Layer
 ​
 1.b) Transposed Conv Layer + Conv Layer
 ​
 1.c) PixelShuffle Layer + Conv Layer
 ​
 2) Also, considering option 1.c, should the Conv layer multiply the number of PixelShuffle output features by the scale factor because PixelShuffle does reduce the number of output features? i.e. I have a tensor of dims (B, C, W, H, D) and with shape (1, 60, 64, 64, 64). After the Pixel-shuffle with an upscale factor of 4 I get the tensor of shape (1, 15, 256, 256, 256). Afterwards the following Conv layer should output a tensor like:
 2.a) (1, 15, 256, 256, 256), where in_channels=15 and out_channels=15
 2.b) (1, 60, 256, 256, 256), where in_channels=15 and out_channels=60
 Note the second option reinstates the number of input features.
 ​
 3) I have an additional question that can happens in both 1.a, 1.b and 1.c options. Imagine I need to upsample my features by a factor of 8.
 3.a) Is it preferred to have multiple upsample blocks (Upsample Layer + Conv layer), where the upsample layers have a scale factor of 2, thus for this example we would have 3 upsample blocks (2 ** 3 = 8).
 3.b) Have only one upsample block where the Upsample layer has the full scale factor desired and it is then followed by one Conv layer.
 ​
 Thank you all :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 In the process of writing up a literature review for my master's thesis, I wanted to cover the impact of ReLU on the field which was significant. When looking for an original paper I came across this paper/report: https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08375. There isn't anything special about this work and as a matter of fact, I was surprised that it has thousands of citations (2974 at the moment of writing this post according to Google Scholar). Given this and that this work is not an original ReLU paper but more of a file documenting an implementation of it for a particular setup I found it quite intriguing. Then I started to dig into works that cited this and unexpectedly papers from top conferences such as NeurIPS cited the aforementioned document as a reference to the activation function. Here are some examples:
  
https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/fbb10d319d44f8c3b4720873e4177c65-Paper-Conference.pdf
 https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/69e2f49ab0837b71b0e0cb7c555990f8-Paper-Conference.pdf
  
The researchers who have done that are not referencing the original ReLU paper instead which I think is a bit disrespectful towards the achievement of original authors. On the other hand, maybe I am overthinking it a bit. ReLU has been around for a while and it would be surprising for someone conducting research in deep learning to not knowing it hence as a reader I wouldn't necessarily mind if people did not include the reference to the paper which is widely known. However, I reckon if a reference is made, then it should be meaningful and correct, and not just another extra few lines in a bibliography making it look big.

 My advisor is very understanding, supportive and took a leap of faith to fund me, since I did not have prior experience in research.
 I have been working on a problem for 4 months now and have been getting poor results for the past week. All the literature surveys, digressions within the problem statements and running the experiments to end up with not-so-good results is extremely disheartening.
 ​
 I am still continuing to run additional experiments, figuring out where things can be going wrong and trying to conduct further analysis, but I feel like I have let down my advisor. I still have the entire semester to work on it and possibly other stuff, I am motivated for it, but at times ponder over the huge chunk of time I have spent on the current work.

 Does it happen often ? 
 What would you advice I do to continue working ?

 If you want to stay on top of the latest trends and insights in AI, look here first.
 Why is this significant?
  
The AI system, developed by researchers at startup Osmo, can utilize 55 descriptive words to assign a smell or 'aroma' to a chemical compound or 'odorant'.
 This breakthrough might be utilized to enhance the food and cleaning product industries where synthetic scents play an essential role.
  
What’s next for this AI system?
  
The AI's predictions often aligned closer with human consensus than any individual guess, indicating its robustness and potential.
 The next step for this research is to comprehend how different odorants mix and compete to yield a smell that the human brain identifies as unique.
 However, the sheer number of combinations, even with a small set of odorants, poses a daunting task. To quote Stuart Firestein, a neurobiologist at Columbia University, “Predicting what a mix smells like is the next frontier.”

 Seeking some advice from some experienced researchers in support vector machines and kernel methods. 
 I made this paper that breaks down using multi-class SVM in a One Against All approach, how to solve them with Lagrange multipliers 
 https://github.com/jacobmcasey/MultiClass-SVM-Lagrange-Hyperplane-Construction-Paper
 As it currently stands it’s more a nice educational resource on the topic, rather than a novel contribution. 
 Any ideas how to extend this work into something a bit more impactful?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was going through the code for Llama-2 text generation on the official github where I stumbled across this code in the generation.py file:
 B_INST, E_INST = "[INST]", "[/INST]" SPECIAL_TAGS = [B_INST, E_INST, "<<SYS>>", "<</SYS>>"] UNSAFE_ERROR = "Error: special tags are not allowed as part of the prompt." ... ... ... unsafe_requests = [] unsafe_requests.append(any([tag in msg["content"] for tag in SPECIAL_TAGS for msg in dialog])) ... ... ... return [ { "generation": { "role": "assistant", "content": self.tokenizer.decode(t) if not unsafe else UNSAFE_ERROR, } } for t, unsafe in zip(generation_tokens, unsafe_requests) ] 
 Is there a reason why we can't have these tokens in the prompt? 
 I am planning to bypass the role based dictionary entries for the prompt and instead building my own prompt generator that'll take the the system prompts and the user prompts and generate a single string to then send to the LLM. Depending on the the user's choice I want the LLM to generate concise or detailed answers(also impose a word limit in the prompt itself), so I am planning to have this as a dropdown a user can choose. based on the system option chosen(concise/detailed answer), I then want to call my prompt generator which will add the instruction tags around the "system" and "user" prompts to generate 1 string I can then pass to the LLM.
 I wanted to know if there was any reason these tags aren't allowed to be in the prompt. Is it only to avoid "confusion" on the different roles and following a conventional way to pass the prompts? If not, and there's a reason those tags aren't supposed to be passed inside the prompts, please do let me know,, because inside the same file the chat_completion() function is doing exactly that; adding the <<SYS>> and <</SYS>> around the system prompts and prepending it to the user prompt.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! I've been working on this project for a few months as part of my thesis in Machine Learning. It's a library that provides an easy-to-use yet flexible API to design and train Diffusion Models. I decided to make it because I wanted to quickly prototype a Diffusion Model but there were no good tools to do it with. I think it really can help people prototype their own Diffusion Models a lot faster and only in a few lines of code.
 The idea is to have a model class that takes different modules corresponding to the different aspects of the Diffusion Model process (noise schedule, noise type, denoising network, loss function, guidance, etc.) and allow the user to mix and match different modules to achieve different results. The library ships with a bunch of prebuilt modules and the plan is to add many more. I also made it super easy to implement your own modules, you just need to extend from one of the base classes available.
 Below is an example of the type of interface you can expect. I'd really appreciate your feedback! Check out the project here: https://github.com/cabralpinto/modular-diffusion

Perplexities are reported relative to the actual number of English-language words in the
 test set (including an EOS token predicted by the model) 
  
How did they compute this number? Did they split sentences by space? Are punctuation symbols considered "English words"? Are chinese characters (which are present in the data) withous spaces counted as one word?
 Or is it some common knowledge that "LM1B test set contains X words"?
 The official implementation https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/d3pm/text is extremely difficult to comprehend. I spent several hours reading throug the code and I still have no idea how they computed the number of words.

 data inspection and interactive exploration is one of the most important tasks for data teams. This is especially true when dealing with unstructured data that requires a deep domain expertise (e.g. healthcare or engineering).
 We have tried many different options for visualizing unstructured datasets in the past: Notebooks, dash apps, custom react apps, HTML reports... However, these options were either very time-consuming to develop/maintain or not interactive enough or both. 
 That is why we developed Spotlight: https://github.com/Renumics/spotlight 
 https://i.redd.it/lxjnlkcmumlb1.gif
 Spotlight supports most unstructured data types including images, audio, text, videos, time-series and geometric data. 
 You can find more info and use case examples for ML and engineering workflows in the repo. 
 Happy to hear your honest feedback!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, so I am a little confused on how many target variable classes does the BERT and RoBERTa models have?
 So I understand these 2 models are pre-trained models, which means the number of target variable classes are fixed (if I am not wrong!). For example, the link below for the RoBERTa model in Hugging Face has fixed 3 target variable classes (Negative, Neutral and Positive):
 https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest
 But when I googled around and also asked ChatGPT and Bard, they tell me these models can have as many target variable classes as the user wants (or rather this depends on how many target variable classes there are in the training dataset). 
 If these are pre-trained models already (which already have the number of target variable classes pre-determined in the model already), then how come some of the google sites and ChatGPT and Bard is telling me the user can choose however many target variable classes that they want?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working on a professional project which involves detecting a vehicle moving in a wrong direction on the street.
 Data details : I have consecutive frames of the street in which vehicles are moving.
 So far :
  
I have created a model that detects the objects inside the frame and give me the coordinates(bounding-box) of those objects(vehicles).
 
And I using the optical flow to produce the optical lines on the objects which are moving inside the consecutive frames and I am also able to get the direction(if a object is moving from top to bottom on the frame it means it is in right direction and if bottom to top in the frame it means wrong direction based on change in y-offset of the object).
 
Now the optical lines code is different which is giving me the direction of the object(I am not using any model to detect object in this code it's based on Lucas-Kadane method) and when I say direction I mean I'm using the cv2.imshow() which actually plays the consecutive frames together and draw optical lines on it and shows me the direction visually.
 
 Now the problem is I want the coordinates of the object that is moving in wrong direction (the bounding box coordinates) how can I achieve that?
 Any suggestions and ideas would be helpful please mind I can't use any other technology or model as this are project requirements in professional setting)

 I'm using R's boost_tree() with xgboost as my model.
 How do I decide when to stop tuning for number of trees, mtry, min_n, and tree depth, without actually overfitting the data? Because as I increase the number of trees (or any other variable like the ones above), my RMSE obviously goes down, but how do I know it is overfitting the training data? Or is there no overfitting in this case, since I am using cross validation (15 fold) already?
 PS, the test data is 800 observations

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How do you usually do feature extraction for time series data? I used to work on visual domain, so I'm pretty familiar with CVs but recently I was assigned some tasks on multivariate time series data and it's been quite difficult getting used to.
 Major problem is, while features in vision have semantic meaning not just along temporal axis but also "spatially," the multivariate time series does not.
 Also, is it considered a "cheating" if i pre-extract certain features that are already established by experts to have high correlation with the result, rather than letting the machine learning algorithm learn on its own those "certain features" in some way through training?
 Thanks!

I have already completed Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and built the reward model. Now, I need some guidance on how to handle the data.
 Here is an example of the pre-collected data:
 >> User: Give me a tip on how to succeed in drawing.
 >>> ChatGPT: Practice regularly and be patient with yourself. Improvement takes time.
 >>>User: But drawing is hard.
 >>>ChatGPT: It is, and that's okay. It's normal to find it challenging, especially when you're just starting out. Just try to enjoy the process and don't be too hard on yourself.
 ​
 ==========My input Data 1 is :>> User: Give me a tip on how to succeed in drawing.
 Suppose my model outputs the following for Input Data 1: ChatGPT: Practice makes perfect.
 My question is, for Input Data 2, should I use:
 Option A: User: Give me a tip on how to succeed in drawing. ChatGPT: Practice makes perfect. User: But drawing is hard.
 In this option, I use the actual previous term's agent output and append the pre-collected user data.
 Or
 Option B: User: Give me a tip on how to succeed in drawing. ChatGPT: Practice regularly and be patient with yourself. Improvement takes time. User: But drawing is hard.
 In this option, I use all the pre-collected data, which might not even be the current model's output.
 Which option is more appropriate for RLHF, A or B?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am reading the famous paper " Unsupervised Domain Adaptation by Backpropagation" again, but still got confused why the authors had to design this gradient reversal layer.
 To my understanding, simply adding a minus-one (-1) in front of the domain classifier head is good enough. Of course, we need to minimize the original domain classifier head at some point to make it decent. For example, if it is a two-step training like GAN, we can (1) Freeze other parts but only minimize the domain classification loss to update the domain classifier head; and then (2) Freeze the domain classification head, but maximize the domain classificatoin loss to update the feature extractor. We can alternate between (1) and (2).
 Is the main motivation of gradient reversal layer that we can merge (1) and (2) into a single training step?

I've been reading it, but I got stuck trying to understand how they transition from the point where the loss is the distance between parameters to the point where the loss is the distance between gradients. Could someone please explain this process in detail? Apparently, they make the assumption that the initializations are the same and that the distance between parameters is close to zero for every iteration, but I'm still struggling to comprehend how they arrive at the conclusion that the distance is now between gradients.

The goal is not merely to improve algorithmic performance but also to introduce novel methods that can tackle complex computational problems, much like how nature solves intricate issues in an energy-efficient manner.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US government has imposed expanded export restrictions affecting Nvidia’s leading artificial intelligence chips, curbing their exportation beyond China to certain Middle Eastern countries.
 If you want to stay on top of AI advances, look here first.
 https://preview.redd.it/xe7ho00t0ilb1.png?width=1240&format=png&auto=webp&s=61225931bf3e316efd90eab83846402d4148aca2
 Why this matters:
  
Nvidia’s A100 and H100 chips are affected: These AI chips are important and used to accelerate machine-learning tasks on major AI applications like ChatGPT. Despite the restrictions, Nvidia maintains they won’t have an “immediate material impact” on its results.
 Other companies, like AMD, are also affected: They’ve reportedly received similar restrictions notice, hinting at a broader move by the US government to control the distribution of AI chip technology.
 The move is part of a larger geopolitical play: These restrictions form part of the Biden administration’s efforts to curtail Beijing’s ability to capitalize on the AI revolution.
  
How Nvidia and the industry might respond:
  
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has cautioned the US: In a Financial Times interview, Huang warned that imposing such restrictions could lead to “enormous damage” to the US tech industry, predicting China may become self-sufficient in AI chip development.
 Yet, Nvidia still managed impressive earnings recently: Despite these challenges, Nvidia recently reported quarterly revenue of $13.5bn, exceeding predictions by $2bn.
  
Further restrictions could significantly alter the landscape for AI development, potentially fostering greater innovation in countries affected or even a race to develop independent solutions.

 From the text:
  
We believe artificial intelligence has the power to save the world—and that a thriving open source ecosystem is essential to building this future. 
 Thankfully, the open source ecosystem is starting to develop, and we are now seeing open source models that rival closed-source alternatives. Hundreds of small teams and individuals are also working to make these models more useful, accessible, and performant. 
 These projects push the state of the art in open source AI and help provide a more robust and comprehensive understanding of the technology. They include: instruction-tuning base LLMs; removing censorship from LLM outputs; optimizing models for low-powered machines; building novel tooling for model inference; researching LLM security issues; and many others. 
 However, the people behind these projects often don’t have the resources available to pursue their work to conclusion or maintain it in the long run. The situation is more acute in AI than traditional infrastructure, since even fine-tuning models requires significant GPU computing resources, especially as open source models get larger.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a bid to rival the United States’ stronghold in the AI industry, Chinese search engine and AI firm Baidu, has made its ChatGPT-equivalent language model, Ernie Bot, fully available to the public. This marks a significant move on the AI chessboard.
 If you want to stay on top of everything AI, look here first.
 https://preview.redd.it/g68sr07iihlb1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0c873badd448257bcc2fb125188acc198e504d6
 Why does this matter?
  
Baidu's public release of Ernie Bot signals the company's aggressive push in the generative AI market. By opening up its model to the public, Baidu can leverage expansive real-world human feedback to improve Ernie Bot.
 China's determination to lead the AI industry is unabated, with many tech firms launching their own generative models in response to OpenAI's popular ChatGPT. Baidu's move further fuels this rivalry.
 Regulation in China seems to support such AI advancements. CEO Robin Li voiced his optimism about the AI regulations—calling them "more pro-innovation than regulation".
  
What's the broader response?
  
Baidu's latest stride has boosted its stock price by over 3%, underlining the market's high anticipation of Baidu's AI efforts.
 Ernie Bot has rocketed to the top of Apple's iOS free app chart in China. This demonstrates a positive initial response from the public.
  
Regulation is key in China's AI game:
  
China has stringent regulations for the generative AI industry, requiring a security review and government approvals before any product launch. Moreover, companies need to comply with governmental tech and data requests.
 The US, on the other hand, doesn't currently have such regulations in place. A markedly different approach that could significantly influence the development and application of AI technologies.

 Abstract:
  
In recent years, there have been remarkable advancements in the performance of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains. As these LLMs are deployed for increasingly complex tasks, they often face the needs to conduct longer reasoning processes or understanding larger contexts. In these situations, the length generalization failure of LLMs on long sequences become more prominent. Most pre-training schemes truncate training sequences to a fixed length (such as 2048 for LLaMa). LLMs often struggle to generate fluent texts, let alone carry out downstream tasks, after longer contexts, even with relative positional encoding which is designed to cope with this problem. Common solutions such as finetuning on longer …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CoTracker - a 2D point-tracking tool for videos - promises to revolutionize motion tracking. Through the use of a transformer network, it meticulously predicts point trajectories and visibility across video frames, giving insights like never before.
 https://i.redd.it/g0u5t9n1ehlb1.gif
 Here's why CoTracker is turning heads:
  
CoTracker leverages advanced transformer formulation: Utilising a grid of input tokens that evolve to output tokens, CoTracker allocates initial values derived from the track's start point and time.
 It's built to handle extended videos through 'windowed inference': Windowing enables the algorithm to handle videos beyond its maximum window length by splitting them into overlapping segments.
 'Unrolled Learning' caters to semi-overlapping windows effectively: By employing two unique types of losses, only a modest amount of windows are used in loss computation while still handling expansive videos at test time.
 Improved tracking through simultaneous multi-point selection: By tracking multiple points at once, CoTracker is able to better establish correlation and motion paths within videos.
  
Despite its notable strengths, there are limitations. Its sliding-window approach cannot handle long-term occlusions that last longer than a window, and its transformer-based model has a high computational cost that grows quadratically with the number of tracked points.
 According to the authors, “The result is a flexible and powerful tracking algorithm that outperforms state-of-the-art methods in almost all benchmarks”. But it’s yet to be seen how it will perform in real-life tasks. What do you think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 Wanted to share an open source project we've been working on for the last few weeks: Autolabel is an open source Python library to label and enrich text datasets with LLMs (Large Language Models).
 Why?
 Access to clean, labeled data is a huge bottleneck for most ML/data science teams. From experiments across a variety of NLP tasks and datasets, we have found that the most capable LLMs are able to label data at better quality than human annotators, but 20-100x faster.
 Getting Started¶
 You can get started with the library by defining a JSON config, and writing a few lines of code:
 from autolabel import LabelingAgent, AutolabelDataset agent = LabelingAgent('config.json') dataset = AutolabelDataset('dataset.csv', 'config.json') labels = agent.run(dataset) 
  
Installation guide
 Sample notebooks that show how to use the library for different labeling tasks.
 Technical report for benchmarking LLM and human annotator performance across a range of tasks and datasets.
  
Call for Feedback
 We just open sourced this library, and are actively developing it. Feedback is very welcome and so are requests for features. You can open an issue on Github for bugs and request features

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Equation 1 of the paper "Axiomatic Attribution for Deep Networks", the denominator of the gradient is $\partial x_i$ (See Eq1).
 However, according to the paper(with Eq2), shouldn't it be $\partial (x'_i + \alpha \times (x_i-x'_i))$ rather than $\partial x_i$?
 I found many following papers which refer to this paper also use the notation like this.
 Do I misunderstand something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the realm of deep learning, the choice of activation functions and optimization algorithms can significantly impact the training process and the performance of neural networks. A relatively lesser-known gem in this landscape is the "leaky softplus" activation function, which, when paired with momentum-based optimizers like Adam, can lead to exceptionally efficient and effective training outcomes.
 The Leaky Softplus Activation Function
 The leaky softplus activation function combines the benefits of both linearity and non-linearity in a graceful manner. Defined as Math.Log(Math.Exp(x) + 1) + (x / 16), it smoothly transitions between a nearly linear response for negative inputs and a more pronounced non-linear response for positive inputs. This unique characteristic enables it to address…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I built DeepEval - an open-source unit testing framework for LLMs in order to accelerate development and iteration. 
 The problem
 When designing software applications, testing has always been critical for a lot of production applications. However - with the rise of LLM applications, the type of testing required needs to change in order to adapt for the large number of possible queries. We therefore built DeepEval in order to make it easy to write LLM tests in just 1 line of code. We hope this solution is of value to future teams when iterating on their RAG pipelines, migrating LLM models, testing their fine-tuned LLMs.
 The solution
 The DeepEval framework is as follows: We split up testing LLMs into 4 main sections:
 - Answer Relevancy (how relevant an answer is to a question) - measured using a question-answer bi-encoder.
 - Factual consistency (whether the generated answer is hallucinating) - measured using entailment from an NLI model
 - Conceptual similarity (when given a ground truth, how closely does it relate to it - for example How big is it? The size of an orange vs 20 square centimetres.) - measured using vector similarity
 - Bias, Toxic classification (measured through DL classifier models)
 I would love any feedback on what we are building here and welcome any OS contributions!

 DINOv2 has outperformed previous state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods on a variety of computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. It is also more efficient to train than previous methods, making it more accessible to researchers and practitioners.
 DINOv2 is different from existing methods because it provides a new way to train high-performance computer vision models without the need for labeled data. This makes it possible to train models on large datasets of unlabeled images, which can be more cost-effective and time-efficient than collecting and labeling large datasets of images.

But for neural networks, techniques like GANs allow the minimisation of other distances like Mutual Information or Reverse KL. While this is certainly a very cool and insightful approach, it's also highly complex. I wonder wether other approaches to this problem exist for the simpler case, like fitting a gaussian or some other analytic distribution.
 From statistics, I have only encountered maximum likelihood and it's variations like robust statistics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi 
 I am struggling to understand the mini-batch in PPO. 
 Say I already collected two trajectories.
 Traj_A = [t = 1, t= 2, t=3 ,.... t = 100]
 Traj_B = [t =1 , t=2, ... t= 78] 
 Now, I heard you usually break this down onto mini-batch (say a batchsize of 6). 
 Do you do random sampling?
 eg, one batch is [Traj_A_t=1, Traj_A_t=2, Traj_A_t=100, Traj_A_t=66, Traj_A_t=77, Traj_A_t=55]???
 OR do you need to maintain some sequence [Traj_A_t=1, Traj_A_t=2, Traj_A_t=3, Traj_A_t=4, Traj_A_t=5, Traj_A_t=6]???

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US government is taking steps to address the complex and controversial issues around AI and intellectual property rights. The US Copyright Office is opening a public comment period on August 30th to hear from various stakeholders on the topic.
 Important Details:
  
The agency is asking for comments on three main questions: How should AI be defined and categorized for the purposes of copyright? What are the implications of AI for the rights of authors and owners of works? What are the implications of AI for the liability and responsibility of users and distributors of works?
 The agency also wants to hear about related issues, such as: how AI may affect publicity rights and unfair competition laws. The agency notes that AI may create works that mimic or impersonate the voices, likenesses, or styles of real people, which could raise ethical and legal concerns.
 Finally, they want to determine how AI may affect moral rights and cultural heritage: The agency acknowledges that AI may create works that are derivative or transformative of existing works, which could affect the reputation and integrity of the original creators and their communities.
  
The deadline to submit your comments is October 18th and specific instructions for submitting comments are available on the Copyright Office website.
 P.S. If you like this kind of analysis, I write a free newsletter that tracks the most relevant news and research in AI and tech—stay updated in under 3 mins/day.

 We are looking for AI that can read tables, charts, figures, and spreadsheets, and possibly run statistics on this information.
 We are also looking for AI that can be given a prompt and will write on chosen topic with proper citation of sources. This information will not be used for publication, but rather, to organize main ideas and provide examples.
 An art AI that can draw or mimic images of real insects would be nice as well.
 Preferably these will all be free to use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR: American, Graduated from U of Michigan in 2019 w/ 3.3 GPA Bs in Comp Sci. Worked at Google for 3 years. Samsung Research America for 3 months. No ML specific work experience. No research. Will I get in to European elite ML programs? If not what do I need to do?
 My GF and I want to study our masters together in Europe. She’s doing business I want to do ML/AI.
 I spent the past year kind of goofing off. Got kind of burned out and decided I was going to get into music production so spent the pst year mainly doing that with some software mixed in. 
 Recently been self studying ML, both the math from textbooks and trying my hand at some models in python.
 I do not have any connections to academia currently and wil have to beg a professor who barely knew me from undergrad for a rec. Can get other recs from past bosses.
 My plan right now is to look for job hopefully in AI but maybe just more general software engineering again, but long term I want to get a masters in person.
 My current resume looks like:
 Graduated BS in Comp Sci from univ of Michigan 2019 3.3 GPA
 Worked at Google for 3 years Worked at Samsung Research America for 4 months Some self study I can claim but not much tangible proof
 Recommendation from Google Boss (Maybe) recommendation from UofM CS professor that barely knew me
 My questions to anyone that knows the admissions right now are:
 1) Do you think I get to one off this? (To anyone of these schools)
 2) If not what are the things to prioritize to improve my chances? What are the timeline of these steps? Can I do them in the next few months or have to wait till next year?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm relatively new to the space of AI chatbots and I figured I'd get my hands wet with a small personal project. While researching the topic of long term conversational memory I noticed most people are using text embedding in combination with textual summary to generate a conversation history for the AI's prompt. However, this technique seems to have many drawbacks such as loss of details in the summarization process. I was wondering if anyone has experience using knowledge graph DBs like neo4j for conversational memory instead, and what the pros and cons of such an approach are compared to summarization. I'd be greatly interested in any resources that could further my knowledge in this space as my primary goal is to learn from this project. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent research proposes that Large Language Models (LLMs) may not be as reliable as we think. In fact, the order of options in a multiple-choice question drastically influences the responses from LLMs such as GPT-4 and InstructGPT.
 If you want to stay on top of the latest trends and insights in AI and tech, look here first.
 https://preview.redd.it/k8yaixbjzalb1.png?width=1289&format=png&auto=webp&s=99ac6280a1e7415f46c0c11938ae20e2b77674b4
 What are the findings?
  
LLM sensitivity to multiple-choice arrangement: The study suggests if options in multiple-choice questions are reordered, the LLM's performance varies dramatically— approximately 13% to 75% depending on the benchmark.
 Positional bias shapes responses: When the LLM is uncertain between top-selected answers, the option positioning can artificially lean its predictions. Observations also found that LLMs favor specific placements when unsure of the optimal response among top-selected answers.
 Performance improves when calibration techniques are applied: Making use of two unique calibration methods, the performance of LLMS saw up to eight percentage points of increase across numerous models and benchmarks.
  
Why does this matter?
 This moves us closer to identifying the factors contributing to LLMs' sensitivity and highlights the significance of recognizing and confronting these sensitivities to improve real-world usability and reliability.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working on developing a solution to transcribe historic texts (Pre-1900's) which are all handwritten. I have some data, around 1000's transcribed sentences with their corresponding images of text. TrOCR looked great, but it still makes a lot of mistakes, probably because of the old English phraseology, so I tried to finetune it with my data and see if it improves and that didn't happen. 
 The data I used to train was my 1000 sentences + some public dataset with another 2500 sentences, so just about 3500 sentences in total. Do you think it's because the data is small, that the performance is bad?
 I'm finetuning "microsoft/trocr-base-stage1" using native PyTorch. 
 If not TrOCR do you recommend any OCR/HTR models I can finetune to my handwritten historical data? I truly appreciate any guidance you send my way.

Automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology has made conversations more accessible with live captions in remote conferencing software, mobile applications, and head-worn displays. However, to maintain real-time responsiveness, live caption systems often display interim predictions that are updated as new utterances are received. This can cause text instability (a “flicker” where previously displayed text is updated, shown in the captions on the left in the video below), which can impair users' reading experience due to distraction, fatigue, and difficulty following the conversation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 Hopefully this is of interest to some of you. For those that don't know, normalising flows can be used as black-box unconditional or conditional distribution approximators, that support both exact sampling and density evaluations. For an excellent review see https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02762.
 I am developing flowjax, a Python package for normalising flows, distributions and bijections. It uses Jax for automatic differentiation, and the equinox framework built by Patrick Kidger to allow for a familiar object-oriented design.
 It includes many powerful flows, e.g. masked autoregressive flows, coupling flows and block neural autoregressive flows. In addition to inheriting some benefits from using JAX (easy GPU support, some efficiency gains), here's a few points where I think flowjax has some advantages over other packages:
  
Comprehensive documentation
 Simplified definitions of unconditional/conditional bijections and distributions (particularly nicer handling of the conditional case, which some packages seem to stitch in as an afterthought).
 Easy to plug in different "transformer" bijections to coupling/masked autoregressive flows.
 Use of efficiency tricks to optimize run times (e.g. circumventing recompilation of identical layers using jax.lax.scan over the flow layers)
  
It has been used in a couple of papers already, but it would be great to have some more people using it and some feedback/suggestions/contributions. There are examples in the documentation for those that are interested.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Of the many unsupervised anomaly detection models out there (iforest, LOF, SVM etc) I am struggling to find a model that makes sense to use to detect anomalies in a single target feature. My current strategy is to subset the data into different categories and run iforest on a single column. 
 I feel as though this method might not be the best because it basically creates a tree with a single branch and measures how many nodes away a given record might be. My confidence scores never seem to exceed around -.17 on a scale of [-1,1] where -1 tends to more confidence in anomalous behavior
 Is there a better way?
 Note: Anomalies in my data occur very infrequently

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Question for people who are implementing LLMs (open source, fine tuned, any kind). 
  
How do you know that your getting the quality output from the model that you need to ship the feature or model? Are the audits ad hoc data sampling and subjective "good/bad" ratings or have you figured out a more rigorous framework? Is it pretty much ~vibes~ based?
 What, if any, tools or processes are you putting into place to monitor and observe the LLM when its interacting with real time user data for weeks or months?
 
 Most of the folks I have spoken with are doing very ad hoc sampled output and writing down on post its or in a spreadsheet a subjective quality ratings. 
 One person had developed a slightly more rigorous 3 question survey on "is the result factual", "is the result cogent" and "is the result useful". Not everyone is logging their LLM responses they show users which feels very risky to me.
 Anyone aware of any industry standards being established around this?

 Is this correct? If so, I see no reason why anyone would use OpenAI's api instead of Azure's, as they cost the same but there's no usage limit. Especially if you expect to increase api usage in the future.

 I'm working on a problem which has a custom gym environment which I've made, and as it interacts with multiple other modules which have their own quirks, I need to use a reinforcement learning library which works in a specific way that I've only seen PFRL use. 
 The training loop needs to be in this format: 'obs, reward, done = agent.step(action)', 'agent.observe(obs, reward, ... )' rather than what I see in most modern RL libraries where you define an agent and then run a '.train()' method. 
 Are there any libraries which work in this way? I'd love to use something like StableBaselines but they don't seem to play nice and I'd rather not rewrite the gym environment if I can avoid it.

 Detailed breakdown: https://blog.pythagora.ai/2023/08/23/430/
 For a couple of months, I've been thinking about how can GPT be utilized to generate fully working apps, and I still haven't seen any project that I think has a good approach. I just don't think that Smol developer or GPT engineer can create a fully working production-ready app from scratch without a developer being involved and without any debugging process.
 So, I came up with an idea that I've outlined thoroughly in the blog post above, but basically, I have 3 main "pillars" that I think a dev tool that generates apps needs to have:
  
Developer needs to be involved in the process of app creation - I think that we are still far away from an LLM that can just be hooked up to …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've received a freelance job offer from a company in the banking sector that wants to host their own LLAMA 2 model in-house.
 I'm hesitating to accept the gig. While I'll have access to the hardware (I've estimated that an A100 80GB will be required to host the 16B parameter version and process some fine-tuning & RAG), I'm not familiar with the challenges of self-hosting a model of this scale. I've always relied on managed services like Hugging Face or Replicate for model hosting.
 For those of you who have experience in self-hosting such large models, what do you think will be the main challenges of this mission if I decide to take it on?
 ​
 Edit: Some additional context information
 Size of the company: Very small ~ 60 employees
 Purpose: This service will be combined with a vector store to search content such as Word, Excel and PowerPoint files stored on their servers. I'll implement the RAG pattern and do some prompt engineering with it. They also want me to use it for searching things on specific websites and APIs, such as stock exchanges, so I (probably) need to fine-tune the model based on the search results and the tasks I want the model to do after retrieving the data.

In this note, we present a comprehensive definition of MDPs and provide a detailed derivation of the Bellman equations, along with the optimality results. Our approach aims to ensure a thorough understanding by avoiding the omission of any steps in the mathematical proofs. The primary goal is to facilitate reading classic textbooks on (approximate) dynamic programming, optimal control, and reinforcement learning, where proofs and derivations can sometimes obscure crucial details, making them less accessible to readers from diverse scientific and engineering backgrounds.

 So far I found those and read readme files: https://github.com/dickreuter/neuron_poker https://github.com/fschlatt/clubs_gym https://rlcard.org/ https://www.deepmind.com/open-source/openspiel
 Did anybody work on similar project? Which gym did you use, and what experience do you have with it? 
 Since, adversarial policies tend to work better for high-dimensionality I would prefer to 6players variant. I know that modern poker ai approach are not based on pure RL, but I want to check how vulnerable are classic RL poker models.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft teamed up with Virginia Tech to publish a white paper introducing their new "Algorithm of Thoughts" (AoT). The objective? To make language learning models akin to human learning.
 https://preview.redd.it/3q8lcq0k96lb1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=fce7a0e3225c64353ad6c51f65e8b490e795feed
 If you want to stay on top of the latest trends and insights in AI and tech, look here first.
 What's the big idea?
  
Microsoft's AoT aims to fuse the accuracy of algorithms with the nuances of human reasoning. A bold aspiration indeed, but not a new one. The goal to empower computers to learn for themselves – akin to human cognition - has been an AI objective since its inception back in the 1950s.
 The AoT could be seen as an attempt to resolve the drawbacks of the "Chain of Thought" (CoT) approach. LLMs following the CoT approach can provide incorrect steps to the right answer, as they base conclusions on precedent.
 With AoT, the model works to evaluate the soundness of initial steps or "thoughts," reducing the risk of one incorrect step leading to disproportionate results.
  
What could AoT do?
  
Mitigate AI "hallucinations:" These funny— but disconcerting — instances of AI outputting false information.
 Enhance the integrity of AI interaction: programmers suggest that improvement in this aspect is crucial for aligning AGI (artificial general intelligence).
  
The takeaway:
  
AI's ability to understand and process information like a human being is a longstanding goal in the field. With AoT, Microsoft seems to be making strides toward achieving it.
 Much remains to be seen on its efficacy: How it will impact the broader AI ecosystem and the user experiences it can create.

 I'm writing this post to share some of the strategies we use for using LLMs in production, we've served over 2M+ queries so far
 TLDR: Use Caching + Model Fallbacks for reliability. This post goes into detail of our fallbacks implementation
 Using LLMs reliably in production involves the following components:
  
Caching - Cache Embedding() and Completion() for all models
 Model Fallbacks - set fallback_models=['gpt-3.5-turbo', 'command-nightly', 'llama2]. If primary model fails try fallback models. This deals with rate-limiting errors and when Provider APIs go down

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stanford researchers have unveiled a groundbreaking artificial intelligence (AI) framework known as DSPy. Designed to utilize Language Models (LMs) and Retrieval Models (RMs) optimally, DSPy is set to make AI programming more powerful, intuitive, and efficient.
 Why does this matter?
  
DSPy was built with complex tasks in mind. LMs, like GPT-3, generate Human-like text from given inputs, while RMs retrieve relevant data. DSPy combines their capabilities, enabling tasks like summarizing information from databases.
 It works on Pythonic syntax, using declarative and composable modules to instruct LMs.
 DSPy's automatic compiler finetunes the LM to run any program's steps. it replaces manual intermediate-stage labeling and string manipulation with systematic modular pieces.
  
What's unique about DSPy?
  
It introduces "Signatures" and "Teleprompters" that compile your program. A 'signature' explains the task and inputs for the LM, while Teleprompters improve the effectiveness of prompts.
 Compared to other libraries, DSPy requires minimal labeling and bootstraps any needed intermediate labels.
  
In short, DSPy simplifies delivering more nuanced instructions to AI and retrieving more detailed and accurate responses, thus widening the spectrum of tasks AIs can accomplish.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I'm trying to understand how to get an LLM to imitate someone, say Shakespeare. It's easy enough to get all of Shakespeare's work.
 If I've understood the current state of play for LLMs, there are three options:
  
Fine tune an LLM
 Vectorize your knowledge using something like ChromaDB. Do a similarity search after each prompt and get the LLM to "read" the top n docs
 Do both
  
I have a feeling that to imitate Shakespeare, fine tuning an LLM might work best.
 However, if my understanding is correct, the inputs to finetune an LLM must be formatted this way:
 <human>: "To be" <system>: "Or not to be" 
 The gap I'm having trouble bridging is how do I go from a large text file to this input format? The only idea I've come across is format all of the text like so:
 <human>: "sentence_1" <system>: "sentence_2" <human>: "sentence_2" <system>: "sentence_3" 
 Are there best practices around this problem? How should I be thinking about this?
 I've seen companies like character.ai create bots that imitate Elon Musk accurately for example so I know it's doable. I just wonder if they've done it by finetuning an LLM or training one from scratch or something else entirely.

 Technology, however, isn't completely foolproof: DeepMind itself acknowledges that intense image manipulation could compromise the watermark.
 Google's image generator, Imagen, will only apply to images created using this tool: Google aims to instantly identify AI-generated images with this effectively hidden watermark.
  
DeepMind's head of research, Pushmeet Kohli, shared the following details:
  
The watermark changes on images are so subtle that humans wouldn't notice, yet DeepMind can still detect an AI-generated image.
 Despite any subsequent cropping or editing, the watermark remains identifiable by DeepMind's software. Colors, contrast, or size changes won't affect it.
  
Calls for a standard approach to AI-generated image identification continue:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Surely something like this has been tried, but here’s the setup in my head. Tell me if it’s crazy or what you think. 
 Given input vector X do a hidden layer but instead of an activation function pair up neighboring dimensions of the hidden layer vector result and rotate them about the origin in 2d. This would give some kind of nonlinearity surely? The amount they are rotated can be selected by a trainable variable. Of course this requires your hidden layer dimension be divisible by 2. Then this hidden layer can go to an output layer Y.
 Curious what smarter more experienced people think of this kind of nonlinearity via paired rotation. 
 My thinking was that if you take the vector A representing all the possible data from your generating function for your dataset (maybe even an infinite dimensional vector if you can generate unlimited data) . Then if you rotate A along so many dimensions you could reach the output vector P which is all the Y values corresponding to A. 
 One way to kind of do this would be to split your dataset in half, and then you could have multiple iterations of each dataset rotated by a trainable angle each. This would rotate only each 2 grouped dimensions that you chose when you split the dataset. 
 Hopefully I’m using the right words to convey this. I’m just a hobbyist. Thanks for the feedback!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quite recently, I jumped on the boat of trying out llama. I noticed codellama did not provide any inference code. Yes, it provided python files which lets you run the inference but not a programming method rather terminal approach. 
 Terminal approach is great as it allows experts to run and perform inference+evaluation easily. But, if you are just starting out/new/non-seasoned programmer/individual in AI, it is frustrating. Because one, you can't play with actual code, limiting learning opportunities and two, it does not produces the curiosity in most cases to read all the code. 
 On top of that, I realised there was a lack of repositories and articles on this subject to load code-llama even with third-party methods. Which is why, I wrote two notebooks which outlines the process of how you can load code-llama from FAIR repository using code. [Believe me it's fun and filled with learning opportunities] and two how you can use Huggingface to load the model and perform inference. 
 Few points:
 1. Performing inference from FAIR repo, requires significant amount of computing resources even for 7B model.
 2. Huggingface method can be loaded using free Google Colab subscription.

 We are keen to speak to a London/UK-based Developer with a Banking sector background to join us on a project outside of work with the vision of potentially growing a fund.
 In short; we are in the process of developing an FX Macroeconomic Sentiment Divergence Trading Algorithm. There are currently 4 participants in the project (2 Developers and 2 Traders), 3 of whom work for Tier1 IBs in market-facing roles. 1 of the Developers is likely going to leave the project and we are interested in speaking to someone about picking up his part of the project.
 There are 3 parts to the project. The first part is mostly complete, now leaving the other 2 parts for us to start working on. We have manually backtested the strategy and it proves to be very profitable - more details can be shared about the strategy and results upon engagement.
 We are all VP-level in our roles and have around 10-15 years of experience in our requisite field. The tech stack for the project is Python, Java, Kafka, MongoDB and Springboot. We are also very interested in integrating some AI/ML modeling, so if you have any experience in this field that would be a big advantage
 A Banking background and being UK-based is a non-negotiable. If you feel like this could apply to you, get in touch! :)

I have an app that needs GPUs for DL inference (I don’t need GPUs for training, I own a 3070 TI). My DL model inference is pretty slow (the model framework I'm using is known to be slow) so either one machine with multiple beefy GPUs or multiple GPUs on separate machines will be necessary. My machines will be running custom docker containers.
 Slow inference:
  
I was planning on putting a few GPU instances behind nginx load balancer and running pytriton on the instances. Since inference is pretty slow, I’m worried if multiple people send requests to a server at the same time, there will be significant delays on responses. Has anyone ran into this before and have insight on streamlining slow inference/scaling demand?

 Github: https://github.com/shibhansh/loss-of-plasticity
 Abstract:
  
Modern deep-learning systems are specialized to problem settings in which training occurs once and then never again, as opposed to continual-learning settings in which training occurs continually. If deep-learning systems are applied in a continual learning setting, then it is well known that they may fail to remember earlier examples. More fundamental, but less well known, is that they may also lose their ability to learn on new examples, a phenomenon called loss of plasticity. We provide direct demonstrations of loss of plasticity using the MNIST and ImageNet datasets repurposed for continual learning as sequences of tasks. In ImageNet, binary classification performance dropped from 89\% accuracy on an early task down to 77\%, about the level of a linear network, on the 2000th task. Loss of plasticity occurred with a wide range of deep network architectures, optimizers, activation functions, batch normalization, dropout, but was substantially eased by L2-regularization, particularly when combined with weight perturbation. Further, we introduce a new algorithm -- continual backpropagation -- which slightly modifies conventional backpropagation to reinitialize a small fraction of less-used units after each example and appears to maintain plasticity indefinitely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introducing SelFee—a reinvented and powerful language model that uses self-feedback and self-revision to generate high-quality responses backed by a team of researchers from KAIST. Unlike previous models, SelFee doesn't rely on external, large-scale language or task-specific models, tipping the scales in the AI world.
 If you want to stay ahead of the curve in AI and tech, look here first.
 https://i.redd.it/bgszhpai43lb1.gif
 Why it matters?
  
SelFee, built on the base of LLaMA-based instruction-following model and fine-tuned, offers a fresh approach - generating an initial solution and self-feedback sequences and then revising its answers until a high-quality response is achieved.
 Data used for its training and model evaluation was collected from varied sources and fine-tuned with OpenAI API calls, beating the 13B SelFee model with a minimal 7B SelFee model that generated at least three revisions.
 SelFee proves the potential of iterative revision in enhancing language model responses, indicating that an increase in inference computation of a model may be superior to merely magnifying its size.
  
Features and Limitations:
  
SelFee's effective use of self-feedback significantly improves response quality, avoiding the requirement of external, large-scale language or task-specific models, translating into faster, cost-effective LLM solutions.
 However, lacking in certain areas compared to ChatGPT, such as math, reasoning, factuality, and coding, SelFee has room for further improvement and growth.
  
The revolution in the AI language model landscape is promising but still an evolving journey, with SelFee being the latest participant driving this change.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on a project that provides an adaptive sparse grid algorithm on Chebyshev nodes for interpolation and integration of multivariable functions on k-cells.
 https://github.com/rnburn/bbai
 Unlike polynomial interpolants in equispaced points, interpolants in Chebyshev nodes have excellent approximation properties (see Myth 1 of [1]). If a function is Lipchitz continuous, they converge; if a function is smooth with v derivatives and bounded variation for the v-th derivative, then they converge O(n^-v); and if a function is analytic, they converge geometrically.
 The Chebyshev Gauss-Lobatto nodes define a sequence of nested points, X^1, X^2, ..., that make it possible to build Smolyak sparse grids at Chebyshev nodes ([2], [3]).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently thinking about how to implement the "similar keywords" feature. I've prepared a table with keywords that are extracted from several hundred other tables. It includes basic information such as "keyword," "type," "words" (indicating the number of words in a keyword, e.g., "first name" will have "words" = 2), as well as some technical fields (such as database, table, etc.).
 In our data product, after entering a specific keyword, we have various pieces of information (which I'm not currently focusing on), and among them, we have "SIMILAR KEYWORDS." The results are displayed based on simple SQL queries, for instance:
 ​
 SELECT word, SUM(CASE WHEN type IN ('N', 'T') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS count, COUNT(\*) \* CASE WHEN (word + '%') LIKE u/word \+ '%' THEN 1.5 ELSE 1 END AS score FROM object_keywords WHERE ('% ' + word + '%') LIKE '%' + u/word + '%' AND (database_id = u/database_id OR u/database_id IS NULL) AND ( .... more technical information here. 
 ​
 I'm wondering how to improve this process. Would it be worth considering some AI solutions, or should I focus on enhancing the current SQL scripts (e.g., think about a more advanced scoring system)?
 What are your thoughts on this? Has anyone worked on something similar?

Pg 44, para 2, part 1 : "advantage of viewing inductive inference systems in terms of their inductive bias is that it provides a nonprocedural means of characterizing their policy for generalizing"
  
 Are there any general procedures to identify and validate the inductive bias of a system?
 Are there any guidelines to ensure the inferred definition of inductive bias is without errors?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The usage and fear surrounding ChatGPT aren't as prevalent as you might think, according to a recent poll from Pew Research. Only 18% of Americans have reportedly used ChatGPT. The demographic that uses it the most? Men aged 18-29 that are college-educated, but even that's just a 30-40% usage rate.
 https://preview.redd.it/0ax222gxczkb1.jpg?width=620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d3b04169d5de1985d1c52dce7962b5f3a543b014
 Why does this matter?
  
ChatGPT has still managed to gain a remarkable level of popularity, despite low usage. This suggests that even though not many people are using it, they are aware of it and its potential capabilities. More people reported using ChatGPT for entertainment or to educate themselves rather than for work.
 People anticipate AI to have a greater impact on jobs such as software engineers, graphic designers, and journalists. But the expectation is that AI as a whole, not just ChatGPT, will be the driving force behind this.
 Concern about AI is increasing, not decreasing. 47% of respondents said AI makes them more worried than excited, compared to 31% last year. This concern seems to rise with the level of AI knowledge one possesses.
  
Industries unshaken by AI:
  
As per the survey, employed individuals who are aware of ChatGPT don't see it drastically affecting their jobs. The sectors like hospitality, entertainment, construction, and manufacturing feel the least threatened.

 Several top news publications like The New York Times, CNN and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) have blocked Microsoft-backed OpenAI to access their content to train its AI models.[2]
 Intel on Monday said a new data center chip coming out next year will handle more than double the amount of computing work that can be done for each watt of power used, part of a broader industry push to lower electricity consumption.[3]
 OpenAI unveiled the new service, dubbed “ChatGPT Enterprise,” in a company blog post and said it will be available to business clients for purchase as of Monday. The new offering promises to provide “enterprise-grade security and privacy” combined with “the most powerful version of ChatGPT yet” for businesses looking to jump on the generative AI bandwagon.[4]

Right now I am trying to make an ML model that predicts "legendary" QBs of the past performances against current NFL teams. I'll be using Jupyter and Sklearn to do this. However, and maybe this is me overthinking things, I'm not sure how sklearn is going to interpret the data in the dataset. Right now I have a dataset containing all these QBs data (passing stats, strengths and weaknesses, etc.). My teams version of the data is essentially going to be the inverse of all these things. I'm just not quite sure what to target when im testing the data that will determine the "prediction" of the legend QBs stat line against the current team. In better words, how will the computer know that I'm trying to find the yards and touchdowns a QB would produce against a certain team when there's not really any target data for this. I feel as though all I have is data that contributes to a potential target data but I lack target data itself and I'm not sure what to do in that regard. I’m making use of supervised learning and decisión trees btw.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll start with the obvious - AWS guides are the worst. We all felt it. So, trying to build automation with them becomes M:I, or better yet, Oppenheimer.
 For the first time, our MLOps team had to build a CI/CD pipeline for ML training and deployment using SageMaker. We had ZERO ideas on how to do it, so we had to go through the rigorous process of using AWS guides and tutorials, scattered over a gazillion places, just to figure out how to configure our project with SageMaker and build infra for CI/CD.
 Usually, when this thing happens, we extend the project lifecycle and have a team member document the process so we can refer back to it when we need to do it again.
 Knowing this can be beneficial to the community, we decided to share a series of 3 blogs that guide you through the process of building CI/CD pipelines for continuous training and deployment with AWS SageMaker.
 We published the first blog, which covers the configuration part, and plan to publish the rest in the following week.
 Check it out: https://dagshub.com/blog/setup-sagemaker-for-ci-cd-pipelines/
 I'm sure we can improve this tutorial, and would love to learn from your experience on how we can do it! 🤗

 Abstract:
  
Scientific knowledge is predominantly stored in books and scientific journals, often in the form of PDFs. However, the PDF format leads to a loss of semantic information, particularly for mathematical expressions. We propose Nougat (Neural Optical Understanding for Academic Documents), a Visual Transformer model that performs an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) task for processing scientific documents into a markup language, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a new dataset of scientific documents. The proposed approach offers a promising solution to enhance the accessibility of scientific knowledge in the digital age, by bridging the gap between human-readable documents and machine-readable text. We release the models and code to accelerate future work on scientific text recognition.

 It would not matter so much if the models had high failure rate, but as the models are getting closer and closer to 100%, the wrong answers will matter more and more.

Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing tasks. However, their practical deployment is hindered by their immense memory and computation requirements. Although recent post-training quantization (PTQ) methods are effective in reducing memory footprint and improving the computational efficiency of LLM, they hand-craft quantization parameters, which leads to low performance and fails to deal with extremely low-bit quantization.

 Just to give you some context about me, I am currently a recently graduated lawyer, so my degree has not given me a strong mathematical background. However, my strongest area of learning has always been mathematics, so despite not having a very advanced background, I consider myself to be a pretty good and fairly quick learner.
 I would also like to know if you consider if my professional career could be useful in some machine learning context.
 If you could recommend me some courses, inputs or guide to study in an organized way on the subject I would be very grateful.
 Thank you very much in advance.

However, these models are not always aligned with human preferences and values and may produce harmful or undesirable content if not properly guided. Aligning LLMs with human preferences can also improve their performance on downstream tasks. One way to achieve this alignment is to use reinforcement learning from feedback (RLHF), which learns a reward model from human input and then fine-tunes the LLM using a reinforcement learning (RL) objective.
 However, RLHF methods often face challenges such as computational cost, reward hacking, and data quality. To address these issues, researchers from DeepMind propose a new method called Reinforced Self-Training (ReST), which is inspired by gro…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I am at a bit of a crossroads and hope for some advice from the community. I also hope the answers would help others who are in my situation right now.
 I used to work on vision-related problems utilizing Deep learning back in a day, with all fun included: trying out new models, implementing data pipelines, evaluating various metrics... It was a rather big company with its own data collection efforts and enough resources for training. So, I am definitely not a beginner and have some experience.
 At my current job, I am not doing any ML/DL at the momemt, and while the stuff I am doing is still cool and I enjoy it, I am missing good old ML and having a feeling that I am hanging behind as the time goes by. So I figured it would be nice to start a hobby project, preferably in the area of vision-related applications of deep learning. However, I feel a bit lost as in what would be the most efficient approach taking into account I would only have a coule of hours per week for it.
 Here are possible ways to go I am thinking of:
  
take a paper, implement it from scratch with PyTorch
 clone an existing project, contribute with code improvements/better test coverage
 take an existing pre-trained model, adapt to a slightly different task and fine-tune
  
While the first option is of cource the most exciting, the problem is you have to pay for a powerful GPU and data storage which might be impractical (my PC has a 4 GB GTX 1650 TI). Cloud storages exist, and I would be willing to even spend something on training but would like to avoid the costs.
 So, the question would be: has enyone faced similar situation? Which way did you end up going? Any general tips? Thanks!

 This, to me, amounts to a bait and switch where a high quality chatbot is offered for a certain price, then swapped out with an inferior product capable only of reproducing past interactions. This is made worse by the fact that they advertise temperature as one of the variables you can set. Temperature is a variable that can only apply to uniquely generated output and has no effect on simple repetition of previous responses. This makes their practice doubly deceptive, and makes it clear (in my view) that they are trying to deceive customers.

An output of another LLM (embedding model) or any other way (maybe just an average of a few tokens as an example)?
 Essentially - I am curious if there's a NLP approach analogy to Textual Inversion techniques in image generation models. I could imagine this being useful for things like RAG or personalization (if you could have a "user" token). Surely I'm not the first to think of this so I would love some pointers to any papers/blogs etc in this space.

The ability to detect objects in the visual world is crucial for computer vision and machine intelligence, enabling applications like adaptive autonomous agents and versatile shopping systems.

To overcome this, the open-vocabulary detection task (OVD) has emerged, utilizing image-text pairs for training and incorporating new category names at test time by associating them with the image content.

The ability to detect objects in the visual world is crucial for computer vision and machine intelligence, enabling applications like adaptive autonomous agents and versatile shopping systems. However, modern object detectors are limited by the manual annotations of their training data, resulting in a vocabulary size significantly smaller than the vast array of objects encountered in reality. To overcome this, the open-vocabulary detection task (OVD) has emerged, utilizing image-text pairs for training and incorporating new category names at test time by associating them with the image content. By treating categories as text embeddings, open-vocabulary detectors can predict a wide range of unseen objects. Various techniqu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I’ve heard countless times people saying “I want to integrate ML in my product” and recently “I love ChatGPT, I should integrate it in my product”. Yet, as I dived deeper, seeking the genuine reasons and pain points driving this request, I regularly found the same pattern: many had no clear motive for their AI aspirations. It seemed as if they were only jumping on the trend because “everyone else is doing it”, or because their “CEO” told them to do so.
 So my question is : why do you integrate AI/ML into your products? Is it to enhance your user experience? Is to automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks? Is it to stay ahead of your competition? or is it just because everyone is doing it?

It's based on a Biomimicry principle and has some really cool features. I've tested it using various pre-loaded library datasets like CIFAR and MINST, as well as adapting it to a few Kaggle competitions. It has achieved some pretty amazing results by using it's unique adaptability; which comes down to figuring out how the Holistic and Reductionist model architectures can best utilize their roles and how they can combine dynamically.

This could lead to new philosophical and ethical questions around what it means to be human and what our role should be in a world where machines are more capable than we are. 
 There is also the risk that AI systems could be used for malicious purposes, such as cyber attacks or surveillance. Like an alien invasion, the emergence of super-intelligent AI could represent a significant disruption to human society and our way of life. 
 How can we balance the potential benefits of AI with the need to address the potential risks and uncertainties that it poses?

 I am wondering what the best way to inform these agents of this cumulative action constraint? I have appended it to my state vector but since the observation without this cumulative action is still a 625*1 vector, I think adding that constraint as just one additional state is causing it to be drowned out by the state size.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Slack questions are a huge time sink. For the person asking, they generally have no idea how to find the info and may not hear back for hours. For the person answering, it’s a distraction and often requires digging up old knowledge.
 The idea is simple: give an LLM your organizational context and plop it in Slack to answer things for you.
 DanswerBot is free to use and open source (MIT). You can connect it to Slack, Google Drive, GitHub, Confluence, Jira, local files, websites, and much more.
 Quick Demo Vid: https://youtu.be/EjDDvt5GbS8 
 Some additional neat features you may be interested in:
  
LLM generated answers backed by quotes to reduce hallucination
 
Supports a wide range of LLMs (both open source and proprietary)
 
Multi-Vector embeddings for accurate vector search
 
BM-25 Keyword search
 
Learning from user feedback
 
Custom NLP model to classify user intent
 
Polls your data sources every 10 minutes to keep knowledge up to date
 
Links back to your document sources
 
Document level access control
 
Admin dashboard to configure connectors to 14 (for now) of the most popular workplace tools
 
 If you aren’t a slack user (or if you just prefer a more tailored UI), there’s also a web interface to ask questions against your knowledge base. A short demo for that can be found at: https://youtu.be/cWWtnuVCUX0
 If you’re interested in testing this out yourself, the docs to help you launch Danswer with a single command can be found at https://docs.danswer.dev/quickstart!

Another thing that I find is deviate the action of each agent and show that they don’t get a better reward but the problem is there is a actor network for each agent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12013
  
Generative models realized with machine learning techniques are powerful tools to infer complex and unknown data distributions from a finite number of training samples in order to produce new synthetic data. Diffusion models are an emerging framework that have recently overcome the performance of the generative adversarial networks in creating synthetic text and high-quality images. Here, we propose and discuss the quantum generalization of diffusion models, i.e., three quantum-noise-driven generative diffusion models that could be experimentally tested on real quantum systems. The idea is to harness unique quantum features, in particular the non-trivial interplay among coherence, entanglement and noise that the currently available noisy quantum processors do unavoidably suffer from, in order to overcome the main computational burdens of classical diffusion models during inference. Hence, we suggest to exploit quantum noise not as an issue to be detected and solved but instead as a very remarkably beneficial key ingredient to generate much more complex probability distributions that would be difficult or even impossible to express classically, and from which a quantum processor might sample more efficiently than a classical one. Therefore, our results are expected to pave the way for new quantum-inspired or quantum-based generative diffusion algorithms addressing more powerfully classical tasks as data generation/prediction with widespread real-world applications ranging from climate forecasting to neuroscience, from traffic flow analysis to financial forecasting.

 I’m currently doing my undergrad in Economics but am heavily interested in Compsci/Datasci and related topics. Though to be completely honest, I’m not completely sure which area my interests lie in. 
 I was wondering if picking up coding/ theoretical knowledge that a com scientist or data scientist needs will be hard when I am already working. 
 The question is if it is necessary to switch my degree to Math and Economics to gain a firmer foundation in the mathematical/ statistical concepts that ground com science. Or will an undergrad in Economics be sufficiently rigorous for me to pick up com sci/ data sci myself. 
 For context, I’m thinking of taking courses on Real Analysis, Linear Algebra 2, Discrete Mathematics, Algorithms and Data Structures, Optimisation, Probability and Statistics.

Suffice it to say, these things are getting really good, and I mean really good. Assuming this is just the beginning, and these things keep learning more and getting better, where does this end up?
 I genuinely think there’s going to be the need for world wide regulation on these things. But we all know that worldwide consensus is difficult if not impossible. in case a few countries decide to regulate or govern this tech, developers will take advantage of regulatory arbitrage and just deploy their models and register their companies on servers in countries with no regulation. Since this is tech, and everything is on servers, escaping regulation is basically childs play.
 Also, what about mental health concerns? We all know that porn, webcams and OnlyFans are already screwing up male-female relationships and marriages. Look at any statistics about this and the numbers speak for themselves. And this is before AI. So now what’s going to happen 5 years from now when GPU’s are faster and cheaper, and when these companies have gathered 100x more data about their customers, and when models are 50x better.
 We are just at the beginning and AI is moving really quick, especially generative AI. I think it’s officially time to start worrying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm attempting to train an agent using A2C, where the agent generates a vector as its action at each time step. This vector represents a bidding curve, and a crucial property is that it must always increase monotonically. Otherwise, the bid is considered invalid. For example, [0, 1.2, 4.5, 58, 92.65, 104.3, 104.3] is valid because each number is greater than or equal to the previous one. I'm looking for guidance on how to design this setup, impose these constraints, and handle cases where the agent violates the sequence. While using negative rewards might not be effective due to the potential for generating numerous invalid bids, I'm unsure about the right approach. Could someone assist me with this?

 Abstract:
  
Current literature, aiming to surpass the "Chain-of-Thought" approach, often resorts to an external modus operandi involving halting, modifying, and then resuming the generation process to boost Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning capacities. This mode escalates the number of query requests, leading to increased costs, memory, and computational overheads. Addressing this, we propose the Algorithm of Thoughts -- a novel strategy that propels LLMs through algorithmic reasoning pathways, pioneering a new mode of in-context learning. By employing algorithmic examples, we exploit the innate recurrence dynamics of LLMs, expanding their idea exploration with merely one or a few queries. Our technique outperforms earlier single-query methods and stands on par with a recent multi-query strategy that employs an extensive tree search algorithm. Intriguingly, our results suggest that instructing an LLM using an algorithm can lead to performance surpassing that of the algorithm itself, hinting at LLM's inherent ability to weave its intuition into optimized searches. We probe into the underpinnings of our method's efficacy and its nuances in application.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Complex tasks with LLMs like ChatGPT/GPT4 are best broken down by first asking ChatGPT to outline the steps and then asking the LLM to execute against those steps that it defined. I first came across this interesting technique on Twitter recently.
 While it’s OK to do this once in OpenAI’s playground, it's difficult to make this repeatable and streamlined. When I wanted an LLM to do something complex, I wanted to be able to plug into a template instead of thinking about and setting up the contextual decomposition process.
 I made this Contextual Decomposition Template to help solve this problem: https://lastmileai.dev/workbooks/cllqfl5c600rdpgnhh2su2fa0
 With a document and objective, this template allows you to quickly get to the answer through defining intermediate steps and executing according. Parameters are set up so you can easily change the goal, document, and objective and click 'Run All' to get the final results.
 Please let me know if you have feedback! I'm also very curious if you have other interesting techniques with complex tasks and workflows working with LLMs.

I have a 3090 with two python scripts, each script does the same thing, fetches a batch of records from mongo, grabs the image from the ssd, downsizes the image, creates embeddings, then uploads to qdrant (vector search engine) in a batch.
 ​
 Current setup
  
Ryzen 9 7950x, 64gb ddr5, rtx 3090 -this is the one creating the embeddings currently.
 1st gen 32 core epyc with 512gb ddr4 and ~200tb of ssd storage - holds all the data and databases and…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I started to study some Machine Learning algorithms, specifically K-means, but I'm not sure if I did it correctly for several reasons:
 - In the Kmeans that I did, I normalize the data because they mention that it helps a lot, but if I don't, the algorithm stops classifying normally and shows me badly grouped points.
 - As I mentioned, when looking at the graphs of the grouped points, I can see how many of the points are clearly closer to certain centroids, but he classified them as others, this reaches the level of a misclassified point next to the centroid when that should belong
 - Despite the fact that it has a threshold to be making iterations, the algorithm ends in less than 10 even though it has placed 100 iterations. I know that it can depend on the dataset and the generated centroids, but it seems excessive to me that it ends so soon and with results like Iris datset (60, 13, 77) when it should be (50, 50, 50) or a minimum to be maintained for those values.
 I leave the code in GH in case someone can help me: https://github.com/vanstrouble/kmeans-from-scratch.git

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in the strange position of having the task of developing a machine learning pipeline/system/process in an academic environment without the benefit of much in the way of formal training in ML (I'm more of a classical stats for hypothesis testing kinda guy).
 The particular project is using machine learning on medical images (head CT scans) to detect a relatively rare condition. As usual the goal is to eventually have some automatic process for diagnosis support. This particular condition is something that diagnostic radiologists can always detect if they look in the right place on the image, the problem is that they often don't look in the right place. After talking to colleagues with more experience (but less time) it's something which in principle can be achieved with more or less "off the shelf" code put together in the right order and with appropriate hyperparameters.
 This stage of the project is aiming for a proof of principle, rather than anything deployable. We're lucky to have a decent amount of data inside a trusted research environment.
 I've done some hobby-level stuff and tutorials, but overall I'm coming into this with a lot more experience with medical imaging than with computer vision or machine learning.
 After all that preamble here's my question:
 What does a decent CV/ML experiment look like?
 Left to my own direction I can see myself picking 3 different approaches of varying complexity, trying to get the best out of each of them, and then presenting a comparison of performance or accuracy of all of them. I then claim the "best one" as the one we move on with.
 There are a lot of tools out there for experiment tracking (eg neptune.ai), but I'm really not sure whether that sort of thing is over the top for what I need to do.
 Any tips or experience that you folks don't mind sharing?

 TLDR: How do I change the orientation of portrait frames to landscape frames while keeping the mockup essence the same.
 Link: https://ibb.co/album/hx6wp3
 Basically, I have two portrait frame mockups that came in a bundle and the bundle had no landscape frame mockups at all. So, naturally I'd like to make my own since I have a lot of landscape artworks that could be displayed in the mockups.
 How can I change the orientation display of my mockup? I've tried using Photoshop's generative AI software and got nowhere. It keeps giving me a new frame design when I want to keep the original frame so it matches the set.
 Any leads on how this can be done would be appreciated.

 Per my understanding what would need to be done is to train some smaller language model on the product data, create embeddings from the product info and make the model use this as a body of knowledge.
 My issue is that if this was ever to be done on commercial scale it seems very complex to me, since the embeddings would have to be re-created every time a new product is introduced?
 Let me know what you think or how you would approach this, as I'm trying to see different PoV's and everyone here has more experience than me.

 I am looking for a RL library that offers me individual components rather than the whole algorithm. I do not need a PPO implementation, but I would fancy a library that offers me functions to compute the PPO loss given a batch of steps. 
 In other words, what I need is a library that offers the most granular RL components (different losses, replay buffers, return estimators like GAE, etc) instead of full algorithm implementations. Which libraries do you recommend for this purpose?

 Problem is that MuJoCo runs on CPU and I need lots of parallel enviroments and for this I would use envpool https://github.com/sail-sg/envpool.
 The question is what (if any) RL library should I use as a wrapper.
 The options are Stable-Baselines3, Tianshou, ACME, CleanRL, or rl_games.

Large Language Models (LLMs) went from non-existent to ubiquitous in the machine learning discourse within a few years. Due to the fast pace of the field, it is difficult to identify the remaining challenges and already fruitful application areas. In this paper, we aim to establish a systematic set of open problems and application successes so that ML researchers can comprehend the field's current state more quickly and become productive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm new to speech processing. As I read the paper on wav2vec 2.0, I see them mentioning the use of language models in decoding, particularly a 4-gram model and a Transformer. As far as I'm aware, the encoder (wav2vec2) will output a probability sequence of L x V (where V is the vocab size, L is sequence length). I have two questions:
  
I learned that a n-gram language model would predict the probability of a n-gram given previous context words, but how is a Transformer implemented here ? Does it follow a causal structure such as GPT and then estimate sequence likelihood ?
 How can a language model, trained to estimate next word (n-gram) probability given previous context, be used to decode the output sequence given the L x V probability outputs from above ?
  
Many thanks !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Understanding GPT-4
 What is GPT-4?
 GPT-4 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4) is a machine learning model for natural language understanding and generation. It works by analyzing a large dataset and generating text based on the input it receives.
 How Does It Work?
 GPT-4 uses deep neural networks with multiple layers to predict the next word in a sequence of words. The model has been trained on a wide range of internet text, so it's capable of understanding and generating coherent and contextually relevant text based on the prompts it's given.
 Building Apps with GPT-4
 Step 1: Get API Access
 To use GPT-4, you'll first need access to its API. OpenAI provides this service, and you can apply for an API key from their website.
 Step 2: Choose Your Programming Language
 You can integrate the GPT-4 API into your application using various programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, or Ruby.
 Step 3: Making API Calls
 Once you've chosen your language, you'll make RESTful API calls to communicate with GPT-4. You'll pass your prompt as an input and receive generated text as output.
 Example in Python
 Here is a simple Python example using the openai library to interact with GPT-4:
 ```python import openai
 openai.api_key = "your-api-key-here"
 response = openai.Completion.create( engine="text-davinci-002", prompt="Translate the following English text to French: '{}'", max_tokens=60 )
 print(response.choices[0].text.strip()) ```
 Step 4: Handle Rate Limits
 OpenAI's API comes with rate limits, so you'll need to manage these by either queuing requests or handling retries.
 Step 5: Deployment
 After testing and fine-tuning, deploy your application. Ensure that you are abiding by OpenAI's usage policies and guidelines.
 Conclusion
 GPT-4 is a powerful tool for natural language understanding and generation. By understanding its workings and following the steps to integrate it into an application, you can leverage its capabilities for various use-cases.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We introduce a new operator, called 3D DeFormable Attention (DFA3D), for 2D-to-3D feature lifting, which transforms multi-view 2D image features into a unified 3D space for 3D object detection.
 ​
 Comparisons of feature lifting methods.
 Existing feature lifting approaches, such as Lift-Splat-based and 2D attention-based, either use estimated depth to get pseudo LiDAR features and then splat them to a 3D space, which is a one-pass operation without feature refinement, or ignore depth and lift features by 2D attention mechanisms, which achieve finer semantics while suffering from a depth ambiguity problem.
 In contrast, our DFA3D-based method first leverages the estimated depth to expand each view's 2D feature map to 3D and then utilizes DFA3D to aggregate features from the expanded 3D feature maps. With the help of DFA3D, the depth ambiguity problem can be effectively alleviated from the root, and the lifted features can be progressively refined layer by layer, thanks to the Transformer-like architecture. In addition, we propose a mathematically equivalent implementation of DFA3D which can significantly improve its memory efficiency and computational speed. We integrate DFA3D into several methods that use 2D attention-based feature lifting with only a few modifications in code and evaluate on the nuScenes dataset. The experiment results show a consistent improvement of +1.41\% mAP on average, and up to +15.1\% mAP improvement when high-quality depth information is available, demonstrating the superiority, applicability, and huge potential of DFA3D.

 (2) Do enough super computers exist for every company to start training their LLM today?
 (3) Is there even a single company that ships super computers capable of training LLMs in-house?
 (4) McKinsey will want to train their LLMs on all data they have from their customers so that McKinsey can work at max efficiency. Customers won't like that. Is it possible to un-train specific data sets?
 (5) Would it be possible to feed the LLM with the customer's data instead of training the LLM on the data? What would be the differences? If you feed it the data, then the LLM can't work with the data as well as it could if you trained it on said data?

 Now, I find myself spearheading an ML project at a big company, and our backend code base keeps growing, and other people depend on it. There are layers to it, with threads spawning, and dependencies on caches and databases for state sharing. It's more than a pet project - you get the gist. I want to design production-ready architectures that are more robust than piecemeal/make-shift solutions. 
 Do people have resources or suggestions on what established design patterns work in the industry? I have found it hard to find resources just by googling because the pace at which ML research works makes most books/tutorials outdated. Take retrieval augmented generation, for example. Do you store your documents in an elasticsearch store and build indices periodically or do you store them in FAISS? How separated is your retrieval module from your LLM call? Do you host in-house LLM's centrally company-wide or per-project?
 What has worked for you so far in the industry?

 If anyone finds it useful, feel free to check it out: https://github.com/mphe/upside-down-reinforcement-learning.
 There are many other implementations out there, but most of them are difficult to extend and maintain, due to being written in a sloppy manner, or are incorrect, e.g. not using multiplicative interactions or contain smaller bugs and issues.
 This project aims to fix these issues, while potentially improving performance, providing a proper OOP interface, and reusing code from Stable Baselines 3 where applicable.
 Furthermore, the algorithm has been extended to support additional features, like multi-threading, which speeds up the training time immensely. It also provides an interface similar to SB algorithms, so it can be used mostly analogously.
 For more information, see the Github page.

I get that it helps give more importance to clean samples during training. But, about the sum of these weights used in the loss function - should they always add up to 1? What's the reasoning behind this constraint? Can't the weights sum up to any positive value instead? Also, if I intend to assign loss values with probabilities, does the weighted sum still need to be 1? Need help clarifying if my understanding is correct!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been captivated by Recursive Least Squares (RLS) methods, particularly the approach that employs error prediction instead of matrix inversion. This method is quite intuitive. Let's consider a scenario where you need to estimate the true effect of four factors (color, gender, age, and weight) on blood sugar. To find the true impact of weight on blood sugar, it's necessary to eliminate the influence of every other factor on weight. This can be accomplished by using simple least squares regression to predict the residual errors recursively, as shown in the diagram below:
 Removing the effect of all factors on \"weight\" in a recursive manner
 The fundamental contrast between RLS and Gradient-based methods lies in how errors are distributed across inputs based on their activity, leading to the subsequent update of weights. However, in the case of RLS, all inputs undergo decorrelation before evaluating prediction errors. 
 Comparison between error sharing in RLS and GD
 This de-correlation can be done in few lines of python code:
 for i in range(number_of_factors):
 for j in range(i+1, number_of_factors): 
 wx = np.sum(x[i] * x[j]) / np.sum(x[i]**2) 
 x[j] -= wx * x[i] 
 This approach also bears relevance to predictive coding and can shed light on intriguing neuroscientific findings, such as the increase brain activity during surprising or novel events — attributable to prediction errors.
 The prediction errors are increasing during the surprising events similar to how brain activity increases.
 RLS learns very fast but it's still subpar to deep learning when it comes to non-linear hierarchical structures but that is probably because Gradient based methods enjoyed more attention and tinkering from the ML-community. I think RLS methods needs more attention and I have been working on some research projects that uses this method for signal prediction . If you're interested, you can find the source code here:

AFAIK, it's a linear regression problem.
 What I've tried:
 - an FCNN (doesn't work good);
 - Scikit-Learn Lasso (the same results);
 - MSE regression using Neural Tangents (the same).
 Any ideas on how to solve this?
 Thanks a lot in advance!

 There can be a comparison of a pair with two entities resulting in a winner and a loser: A > B; C > A; D > C; ...
 A comparison is expensive.
 Objective: to approximate the absolute order of entities (best entities at the top of the list, worst at the bottom), minimize the number of comparisons
 The worst solution would be just applying a sorting algorithm, which would require n log n comparisons.
 I believe an active sampling technique would be required, i.e. select a number of entities with the highest uncertainty, and do comparisons with them, adjust the model, repeat.
 ChatGPT suggests a Bradley-Terry model and even gives an implementation example. I wonder if there is anything better?

results but also to quantify the amount of confidence in their prediction. The
management of an electric power grid is one of these cases: to avoid risky
scenarios, decision-makers need both precise and reliable forecasts of, for
example, power loads. For this reason, point forecasts are not enough hence it
is necessary to adopt methods that provide an uncertainty quantification.

This work focuses on reservoir computing as the core time series forecasting
method, due to its computational efficiency and effectiveness in predicting
time series. While the RC literature mostly focused on point forecasting, this
work explores the compatibility of some popular uncertainty quantification
methods with the reservoir setting. Both Bayesian and deterministic approaches
to uncertainty assessment are evaluated and compared in terms of their
prediction accuracy, computational resource efficiency and reliability of the
estimated uncertainty, based on a set of carefully chosen performance metrics.]]></summary>

assistance of extremely heavy parameters, which challenges deployment in real
applications. Knowledge distillation is well recognized as the essential
procedure in model compression. However, existing knowledge distillation
techniques lack an in-depth investigation and analysis of VLP, and practical
guidelines for VLP-oriented distillation are still not yet explored. In this
paper, we present DLIP, a simple yet efficient Distilling Language-Image
Pre-training framework, through which we investigate how to distill a light VLP
model. Specifically, we dissect the model distillation from multiple
dimensions, such as the architecture characteristics of different modules and
the information transfer of different modalities. We conduct comprehensive
experiments and provide insights on distilling a light but performant VLP
model. Experimental results reveal that DLIP can achieve a state-of-the-art
accuracy/efficiency trade-off across diverse cross-modal tasks, e.g.,
image-text retrieval, image captioning and visual question answering. For
example, DLIP compresses BLIP by 1.9x, from 213M to 108M parameters, while
achieving comparable or better performance. Furthermore, DLIP succeeds in
retaining more than 95% of the performance with 22.4% parameters and 24.8%
FLOPs compared to the teacher model and accelerates inference speed by 2.7x.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Decision-making problems can be represented as mathematical optimization
models, finding wide applications in fields such as economics, engineering and
manufacturing, transportation, and health care. Optimization models are
mathematical abstractions of the problem of making the best decision while
satisfying a set of requirements or constraints. One of the primary barriers to
deploying these models in practice is the challenge of helping practitioners
understand and interpret such models, particularly when they are infeasible,
meaning no decision satisfies all the constraints. Existing methods for
diagnosing infeasible optimization models often rely on expert systems,
necessitating significant background knowledge in optimization. In this paper,
we introduce OptiChat, a first-of-its-kind natural language-based system
equipped with a chatbot GUI for engaging in interactive conversations about
infeasible optimization models. OptiChat can provide natural language
descriptions of the optimization model itself, identify potential sources of
infeasibility, and offer suggestions to make the model feasible. The
implementation of OptiChat is built on GPT-4, which interfaces with an
optimization solver to identify the minimal subset of constraints that render
the entire optimization problem infeasible, also known as the Irreducible
Infeasible Subset (IIS). We utilize few-shot learning, expert chain-of-thought,
key-retrieve, and sentiment prompts to enhance OptiChat's reliability. Our
experiments demonstrate that OptiChat assists both expert and non-expert users
in improving their understanding of the optimization models, enabling them to
quickly identify the sources of infeasibility.]]></summary>

momentum (ABPL$^+$) for nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization. We analyze the
potential causes of the extrapolation step failing in some algorithms, and
resolve this issue by enhancing the comparison process that evaluates the
trade-off between the proximal gradient step and the linear extrapolation step
in our algorithm. Furthermore, we extends our algorithm to any scenario
involving updating block variables with positive integers, allowing each cycle
to randomly shuffle the update order of the variable blocks. Additionally,
under mild assumptions, we prove that ABPL$^+$ can monotonically decrease the
function value without strictly restricting the extrapolation parameters and
step size, demonstrates the viability and effectiveness of updating these
blocks in a random order, and we also more obviously and intuitively
demonstrate that the derivative set of the sequence generated by our algorithm
is a critical point set. Moreover, we demonstrate the global convergence as
well as the linear and sublinear convergence rates of our algorithm by
utilizing the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (K{\L}) condition. To enhance the
effectiveness and flexibility of our algorithm, we also expand the study to the
imprecise version of our algorithm and construct an adaptive extrapolation
parameter strategy, which improving its overall performance. We apply our
algorithm to multiple non-negative matrix factorization with the $\ell_0$ norm,
nonnegative tensor decomposition with the $\ell_0$ norm, and perform extensive
numerical experiments to validate its effectiveness and efficiency.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We consider the problem of simultaneously clustering and learning a linear
representation of data lying close to a union of low-dimensional manifolds, a
fundamental task in machine learning and computer vision. When the manifolds
are assumed to be linear subspaces, this reduces to the classical problem of
subspace clustering, which has been studied extensively over the past two
decades. Unfortunately, many real-world datasets such as natural images can not
be well approximated by linear subspaces. On the other hand, numerous works
have attempted to learn an appropriate transformation of the data, such that
data is mapped from a union of general non-linear manifolds to a union of
linear subspaces (with points from the same manifold being mapped to the same
subspace). However, many existing works have limitations such as assuming
knowledge of the membership of samples to clusters, requiring high sampling
density, or being shown theoretically to learn trivial representations. In this
paper, we propose to optimize the Maximal Coding Rate Reduction metric with
respect to both the data representation and a novel doubly stochastic cluster
membership, inspired by state-of-the-art subspace clustering results. We give a
parameterization of such a representation and membership, allowing efficient
mini-batching and one-shot initialization. Experiments on CIFAR-10, -20, -100,
and TinyImageNet-200 datasets show that the proposed method is much more
accurate and scalable than state-of-the-art deep clustering methods, and
further learns a latent linear representation of the data.]]></summary>

models collaboratively while preserving data privacy. The need for privacy
protection makes it difficult for FL models to achieve global transparency and
explainability. To address this limitation, we incorporate logic-based
explanations into FL by proposing the Logical Reasoning-based eXplainable
Federated Learning (LR-XFL) approach. Under LR-XFL, FL clients create local
logic rules based on their local data and send them, along with model updates,
to the FL server. The FL server connects the local logic rules through a proper
logical connector that is derived based on properties of client data, without
requiring access to the raw data. In addition, the server also aggregates the
local model updates with weight values determined by the quality of the
clients' local data as reflected by their uploaded logic rules. The results
show that LR-XFL outperforms the most relevant baseline by 1.19%, 5.81% and
5.41% in terms of classification accuracy, rule accuracy and rule fidelity,
respectively. The explicit rule evaluation and expression under LR-XFL enable
human experts to validate and correct the rules on the server side, hence
improving the global FL model's robustness to errors. It has the potential to
enhance the transparency of FL models for areas like healthcare and finance
where both data privacy and explainability are important.]]></summary>

populations that are acoustically active but difficult to survey visually.
Digital recorders allow surveyors to gather large volumes of data at low cost,
but identifying target species vocalisations in these data is non-trivial.
Machine learning (ML) methods are often used to do the identification. They can
process large volumes of data quickly, but they do not detect all vocalisations
and they do generate some false positives (vocalisations that are not from the
target species). Existing wildlife abundance survey methods have been designed
specifically to deal with the first of these mistakes, but current methods of
dealing with false positives are not well-developed. They do not take account
of features of individual vocalisations, some of which are more likely to be
false positives than others. We propose three methods for acoustic spatial
capture-recapture inference that integrate individual-level measures of
confidence from ML vocalisation identification into the likelihood and hence
integrate ML uncertainty into inference. The methods include a mixture model in
which species identity is a latent variable. We test the methods by simulation
and find that in a scenario based on acoustic data from Hainan gibbons, in
which ignoring false positives results in 17% positive bias, our methods give
negligible bias and coverage probabilities that are close to the nominal 95%
level.]]></summary>

influenced by intensity variations of input images and lack generalization due
to primarily utilizing pixels' intensity information for inference. Acquiring
sufficient training data is another challenge limiting models' applications. We
proposed to leverage the consistency of organs' anatomical shape and position
information in medical images. We introduced a framework leveraging recurring
anatomical patterns through global binary masks for organ segmentation. Two
scenarios were studied.1) Global binary masks were the only model's (i.e.
U-Net) input, forcing exclusively encoding organs' position and shape
information for segmentation/localization.2) Global binary masks were
incorporated as an additional channel functioning as position/shape clues to
mitigate training data scarcity. Two datasets of the brain and heart CT images
with their ground-truth were split into (26:10:10) and (12:3:5) for training,
validation, and test respectively. Training exclusively on global binary masks
led to Dice scores of 0.77(0.06) and 0.85(0.04), with the average Euclidian
distance of 3.12(1.43)mm and 2.5(0.93)mm relative to the center of mass of the
ground truth for the brain and heart structures respectively. The outcomes
indicate that a surprising degree of position and shape information is encoded
through global binary masks. Incorporating global binary masks led to
significantly higher accuracy relative to the model trained on only CT images
in small subsets of training data; the performance improved by 4.3-125.3% and
1.3-48.1% for 1-8 training cases of the brain and heart datasets respectively.
The findings imply the advantages of utilizing global binary masks for building
generalizable models and to compensate for training data scarcity.]]></summary>

that enable voice cloning and real-time voice conversion from one individual to
another. This technology poses a significant ethical threat and could lead to
breaches of privacy and misrepresentation, thus there is an urgent need for
real-time detection of AI-generated speech for DeepFake Voice Conversion. To
address the above emerging issues, the DEEP-VOICE dataset is generated in this
study, comprised of real human speech from eight well-known figures and their
speech converted to one another using Retrieval-based Voice Conversion.
Presenting as a binary classification problem of whether the speech is real or
AI-generated, statistical analysis of temporal audio features through t-testing
reveals that there are significantly different distributions. Hyperparameter
optimisation is implemented for machine learning models to identify the source
of speech. Following the training of 208 individual machine learning models
over 10-fold cross validation, it is found that the Extreme Gradient Boosting
model can achieve an average classification accuracy of 99.3% and can classify
speech in real-time, at around 0.004 milliseconds given one second of speech.

losses in a principled manner, we need a privacy accountant for adaptive
compositions of randomised mechanisms, where the loss incurred at a given data
access is allowed to be smaller than the worst-case loss. This kind of analysis
has been carried out for the R\'enyi differential privacy (RDP) by Feldman and
Zrnic (2021), however not yet for the so-called optimal privacy accountants. We
make first steps in this direction by providing a careful analysis using the
Gaussian differential privacy which gives optimal bounds for the Gaussian
mechanism, one of the most versatile DP mechanisms. This approach is based on
determining a certain supermartingale for the hockey-stick divergence and on
extending the R\'enyi divergence-based fully adaptive composition results by
Feldman and Zrnic. We also consider measuring the individual

are constrained by the need for extensive labeled data. Self-supervised
learning emerges as a promising alternative, allowing models to learn without

principle, has been pivotal in shaping deep neural networks. This principle
focuses on optimizing the trade-off between compression and preserving relevant
information, providing a foundation for efficient network design in supervised
contexts. However, its precise role and adaptation in self-supervised learning
remain unclear. In this work, we scrutinize various self-supervised learning
approaches from an information-theoretic perspective, introducing a unified
framework that encapsulates the self-supervised information-theoretic learning
problem. We weave together existing research into a cohesive narrative, delve
into contemporary self-supervised methodologies, and spotlight potential

methods. Overall, this paper furnishes an exhaustive review of the intersection

has revolutionized various research fields in artificial intelligence.
Transformers-based large language models (LLMs) have gradually replaced CNNs
and RNNs to unify fields of computer vision and natural language processing.
Compared with the data that exists relatively independently such as images,
videos or texts, graph is a type of data that contains rich structural and
relational information. Meanwhile, natural language, as one of the most
expressive mediums, excels in describing complex structures. However, existing
work on incorporating graph learning problems into the generative language
modeling framework remains very limited. As the importance of large language
models continues to grow, it becomes essential to explore whether LLMs can also
replace GNNs as the foundation model for graphs. In this paper, we propose
InstructGLM (Instruction-finetuned Graph Language Model), systematically design
highly scalable prompts based on natural language instructions, and use natural
language to describe the geometric structure and node features of the graph for
instruction tuning an LLM to perform learning and inference on graphs in a
generative manner. Our method exceeds all competitive GNN baselines on
ogbn-arxiv, Cora and PubMed datasets, which demonstrates the effectiveness of
our method and sheds light on generative large language models as the
foundation model for graph machine learning.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent innovation in large language models (LLMs), and their myriad use-cases
have rapidly driven up the compute capacity demand for datacenter GPUs. Several
cloud providers and other enterprises have made substantial plans of growth in
their datacenters to support these new workloads. One of the key bottleneck
resources in datacenters is power, and given the increasing model sizes of
LLMs, they are becoming increasingly power intensive. In this paper, we show
that there is a significant opportunity to oversubscribe power in LLM clusters.
Power oversubscription improves the power efficiency of these datacenters,
allowing more deployable servers per datacenter, and reduces the deployment
time, since building new datacenters is slow.

We extensively characterize the power consumption patterns of a variety of
LLMs and their configurations. We identify the differences between the
inference and training power consumption patterns. Based on our analysis of
these LLMs, we claim that the average and peak power utilization in LLM
clusters for inference should not be very high. Our deductions align with the
data from production LLM clusters, revealing that inference workloads offer
substantial headroom for power oversubscription. However, the stringent set of
telemetry and controls that GPUs offer in a virtualized environment, makes it
challenging to have a reliable and robust power oversubscription mechanism.

We propose POLCA, our framework for power oversubscription that is robust,
reliable, and readily deployable for GPU clusters. Using open-source models to
replicate the power patterns observed in production, we simulate POLCA and
demonstrate that we can deploy 30% more servers in the same GPU cluster for
inference, with minimal performance loss]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep autoencoders provide an effective tool for learning non-linear
dimensionality reduction in an unsupervised way. Recently, they have been used
for the task of anomaly detection in the visual domain. By optimizing for the
reconstruction error using anomaly-free examples, the common belief is that a
corresponding network should fail to accurately reconstruct anomalous regions
in the application phase. This goal is typically addressed by controlling the
capacity of the network, either by reducing the size of the bottleneck layer or
by enforcing sparsity constraints on the activations. However, neither of these
techniques does explicitly penalize reconstruction of anomalous signals often
resulting in poor detection. We tackle this problem by adapting a
self-supervised learning regime that allows the use of discriminative
information during training but focuses on the data manifold of normal
examples. We emphasize that inference with our approach is very efficient
during training and prediction requiring a single forward pass for each input
image. Our experiments on the MVTec AD dataset demonstrate high detection and
localization performance. On the texture-subset, in particular, our approach
consistently outperforms recent anomaly detection methods by a significant
margin.]]></summary>

of targeting efficient multi-page document representations. An experimental
study on proposed multi-page document classification datasets demonstrates that
current benchmarks have become irrelevant and need to be updated to evaluate
complete documents, as they naturally occur in practice. This reality check
also calls for more mature evaluation methodologies, covering calibration
evaluation, inference complexity (time-memory), and a range of realistic

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multimedia recommendation involves personalized ranking tasks, where
multimedia content is usually represented using a generic encoder. However,
these generic representations introduce spurious correlations that fail to
reveal users' true preferences. Existing works attempt to alleviate this
problem by learning invariant representations, but overlook the balance between
independent and identically distributed (IID) and out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization. In this paper, we propose a framework called Pareto Invariant
Representation Learning (PaInvRL) to mitigate the impact of spurious
correlations from an IID-OOD multi-objective optimization perspective, by
learning invariant representations (intrinsic factors that attract user
attention) and variant representations (other factors) simultaneously.
Specifically, PaInvRL includes three iteratively executed modules: (i)
heterogeneous identification module, which identifies the heterogeneous
environments to reflect distributional shifts for user-item interactions; (ii)
invariant mask generation module, which learns invariant masks based on the
Pareto-optimal solutions that minimize the adaptive weighted Invariant Risk
Minimization (IRM) and Empirical Risk (ERM) losses; (iii) convert module, which
generates both variant representations and item-invariant representations for
training a multi-modal recommendation model that mitigates spurious
correlations and balances the generalization performance within and cross the
environmental distributions. We compare the proposed PaInvRL with
state-of-the-art recommendation models on three public multimedia
recommendation datasets (Movielens, Tiktok, and Kwai), and the experimental
results validate the effectiveness of PaInvRL for both within- and
cross-environmental learning.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fast adversarial training (FAT) is beneficial for improving the adversarial
robustness of neural networks. However, previous FAT work has encountered a
significant issue known as catastrophic overfitting when dealing with large
perturbation budgets, \ie the adversarial robustness of models declines to near
zero during training.

To address this, we analyze the training process of prior FAT work and
observe that catastrophic overfitting is accompanied by the appearance of loss
convergence outliers.

Therefore, we argue a moderately smooth loss convergence process will be a
stable FAT process that solves catastrophic overfitting.

To obtain a smooth loss convergence process, we propose a novel oscillatory
constraint (dubbed ConvergeSmooth) to limit the loss difference between
adjacent epochs. The convergence stride of ConvergeSmooth is introduced to
balance convergence and smoothing. Likewise, we design weight centralization
without introducing additional hyperparameters other than the loss balance
coefficient.

Our proposed methods are attack-agnostic and thus can improve the training
stability of various FAT techniques.

Extensive experiments on popular datasets show that the proposed methods
efficiently avoid catastrophic overfitting and outperform all previous FAT
methods. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/FAT-CS/ConvergeSmooth}.]]></summary>

someone who carries a gainful authentication clearance. It is a trending topic
due to the increasing demand for biometric authentication on mobile devices,
high-security areas, among others. This work introduces a new database named
Sense Wax Attack dataset (SWAX), comprised of real human and wax figure images
and videos that endorse the problem of face spoofing detection. The dataset
consists of more than 1800 face images and 110 videos of 55 people/waxworks,
arranged in training, validation and test sets with a large range in

exceptional generation quality and diversity. This success is largely
attributed to the use of class- or text-conditional diffusion guidance methods,
such as classifier and classifier-free guidance. In this paper, we present a
more comprehensive perspective that goes beyond the traditional guidance
methods. From this generalized perspective, we introduce novel condition- and
training-free strategies to enhance the quality of generated images. As a
simple solution, blur guidance improves the suitability of intermediate samples
for their fine-scale information and structures, enabling diffusion models to
generate higher quality samples with a moderate guidance scale. Improving upon
this, Self-Attention Guidance (SAG) uses the intermediate self-attention maps
of diffusion models to enhance their stability and efficacy. Specifically, SAG
adversarially blurs only the regions that diffusion models attend to at each
iteration and guides them accordingly. Our experimental results show that our
SAG improves the performance of various diffusion models, including ADM, IDDPM,
Stable Diffusion, and DiT. Moreover, combining SAG with conventional guidance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep learning has achieved impressive performance in many domains, such as
computer vision and natural language processing, but its advantage over
classical shallow methods on tabular datasets remains questionable. It is
especially challenging to surpass the performance of tree-like ensembles, such
as XGBoost or Random Forests, on small-sized datasets (less than 1k samples).
To tackle this challenge, we introduce HyperTab, a hypernetwork-based approach
to solving small sample problems on tabular datasets. By combining the
advantages of Random Forests and neural networks, HyperTab generates an
ensemble of neural networks, where each target model is specialized to process
a specific lower-dimensional view of the data. Since each view plays the role
of data augmentation, we virtually increase the number of training samples
while keeping the number of trainable parameters unchanged, which prevents
model overfitting. We evaluated HyperTab on more than 40 tabular datasets of a
varying number of samples and domains of origin, and compared its performance
with shallow and deep learning models representing the current
state-of-the-art. We show that HyperTab consistently outranks other methods on
small data (with a statistically significant difference) and scores comparable
to them on larger datasets.

We make a python package with the code available to download at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assessing the robustness of deep neural networks against out-of-distribution
inputs is crucial, especially in safety-critical domains like autonomous
driving, but also in safety systems where malicious actors can digitally alter
inputs to circumvent safety guards. However, designing effective
out-of-distribution tests that encompass all possible scenarios while
preserving accurate label information is a challenging task. Existing
methodologies often entail a compromise between variety and constraint levels
for attacks and sometimes even both. In a first step towards a more holistic
robustness evaluation of image classification models, we introduce an attack
method based on image solarization that is conceptually straightforward yet
avoids jeopardizing the global structure of natural images independent of the
intensity. Through comprehensive evaluations of multiple ImageNet models, we
demonstrate the attack's capacity to degrade accuracy significantly, provided
it is not integrated into the training augmentations. Interestingly, even then,
no full immunity to accuracy deterioration is achieved. In other settings, the
attack can often be simplified into a black-box attack with model-independent
parameters. Defenses against other corruptions do not consistently extend to be
effective against our specific attack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Conformal prediction is a statistical tool for producing prediction regions
of machine learning models that are valid with high probability. However,
applying conformal prediction to time series data leads to conservative
prediction regions. In fact, to obtain prediction regions over $T$ time steps
with confidence $1-\delta$, {previous works require that each individual
prediction region is valid} with confidence $1-\delta/T$. We propose an
optimization-based method for reducing this conservatism to enable long horizon
planning and verification when using learning-enabled time series predictors.
Instead of considering prediction errors individually at each time step, we
consider a parameterized prediction error over multiple time steps. By
optimizing the parameters over an additional dataset, we find prediction
regions that are not conservative. We show that this problem can be cast as a
mixed integer linear complementarity program (MILCP), which we then relax into
a linear complementarity program (LCP). Additionally, we prove that the relaxed
LP has the same optimal cost as the original MILCP. Finally, we demonstrate the
efficacy of our method on case studies using pedestrian trajectory predictors

hospital, which admits critically ill patients and provides continuous
monitoring and treatment. Various patient outcome prediction methods have been

Existing methods focus on measuring the similarity between patients using deep
neural networks to capture the hidden feature structures. However, the
higher-order relationships are ignored, such as patient characteristics (e.g.,
diagnosis codes) and their causal effects on downstream clinical predictions.

In this paper, we propose a novel Hypergraph Convolutional Network that

in a hypergraph to capture the hidden feature structures so that fine-grained
patient similarity can be calculated for personalized mortality risk
prediction. Evaluation using a publicly available eICU Collaborative Research

carbon storage (GCS) problems to accelerate the prediction of reservoir
pressure and CO2 plume migration. Large amounts of data from physics-based
numerical simulators are required to train a model to accurately predict the
complex physical behaviors associated with this process. In practice, the
available training data are always limited in large-scale 3D problems due to
the high computational cost. Therefore, we propose to use a multi-fidelity
Fourier Neural Operator to solve large-scale GCS problems with more affordable
multi-fidelity training datasets. The Fourier Neural Operator has a desirable
grid-invariant property, which simplifies the transfer learning procedure
between datasets with different discretization. We first test the model
efficacy on a GCS reservoir model being discretized into 110k grid cells. The
multi-fidelity model can predict with accuracy comparable to a high-fidelity
model trained with the same amount of high-fidelity data with 81% less data
generation costs. We further test the generalizability of the multi-fidelity
model on a same reservoir model with a finer discretization of 1 million grid
cells. This case was made more challenging by employing high-fidelity and
low-fidelity datasets generated by different geostatistical models and
reservoir simulators. We observe that the multi-fidelity FNO model can predict
pressure fields with reasonable accuracy even when the high-fidelity data are

due to their ability to accurately learn very complex input-output relations.
Despite their accuracy and extensive use, DNNs are highly susceptible to

proposed to robustify DNNs using first-order derivative information of the
network.

This paper proposes a new robustification approach based on control theory. A
neural network architecture that incorporates feedback control, named Feedback
Neural Networks, is proposed. The controller is itself a neural network, which
is trained using regular and adversarial data such as to stabilize the system
outputs. The novel adversarial training approach based on the feedback control

amount of attention to their real-world robustness, i.e., whether a DNN resists
black-box adversarial attacks, among which score-based query attacks (SQAs) are
most threatening since they can effectively hurt a victim network with the only
access to model outputs. Defending against SQAs requires a slight but artful
variation of outputs due to the service purpose for users, who share the same
output information with SQAs. In this paper, we propose a real-world defense by
Unifying Gradients (UniG) of different data so that SQAs could only probe a
much weaker attack direction that is similar for different samples. Since such
universal attack perturbations have been validated as less aggressive than the
input-specific perturbations, UniG protects real-world DNNs by indicating
attackers a twisted and less informative attack direction. We implement UniG
efficiently by a Hadamard product module which is plug-and-play. According to
extensive experiments on 5 SQAs, 2 adaptive attacks and 7 defense baselines,
UniG significantly improves real-world robustness without hurting clean
accuracy on CIFAR10 and ImageNet. For instance, UniG maintains a model of
77.80% accuracy under 2500-query Square attack while the state-of-the-art
adversarially-trained model only has 67.34% on CIFAR10. Simultaneously, UniG
outperforms all compared baselines in terms of clean accuracy and achieves the
smallest modification of the model output. The code is released at

discover all possible skills in simple grid-world environments where prior
methods have struggled to succeed. This problem is formulated as mutual
training of skills using an intrinsic reward and a discriminator trained to
predict a skill given its trajectory. Our initial solution replaces the
standard one-vs-all (softmax) discriminator with a one-vs-one (all pairs)
discriminator and combines it with a novel intrinsic reward function and a
dropout regularization technique. The combined approach is named APART: Diverse
Skill Discovery using All Pairs with Ascending Reward and Dropout. We
demonstrate that APART discovers all the possible skills in grid worlds with
remarkably fewer samples than previous works. Motivated by the empirical
success of APART, we further investigate an even simpler algorithm that
achieves maximum skills by altering VIC, rescaling its intrinsic reward, and
tuning the temperature of its softmax discriminator. We believe our findings
shed light on the crucial factors underlying success of skill discovery
algorithms in reinforcement learning.]]></summary>

imaging and demonstrate that this makes it possible to robustly address
reactive inverse problems incorporating Uncertainty Quantification (UQ).
Pore-scale modeling of reactive flow offers a valuable opportunity to
investigate the evolution of macro-scale properties subject to dynamic
processes. Yet, they suffer from imaging limitations arising from the
associated X-ray microtomography (X-ray microCT) process, which induces
discrepancies in the properties estimates. Assessment of the kinetic parameters
also raises challenges, as reactive coefficients are critical parameters that
can cover a wide range of values. We account for these two issues and ensure
reliable calibration of pore-scale modeling, based on dynamical microCT images,
by integrating uncertainty quantification in the workflow.

The present method is based on a multitasking formulation of reactive inverse
problems combining data-driven and physics-informed techniques in calcite
dissolution. This allows quantifying morphological uncertainties on the
porosity field and estimating reactive parameter ranges through prescribed PDE
models with a latent concentration field and dynamical microCT. The data
assimilation strategy relies on sequential reinforcement incorporating
successively additional PDE constraints. We guarantee robust and unbiased
uncertainty quantification by straightforward adaptive weighting of Bayesian
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (BPINNs), ensuring reliable micro-porosity
changes during geochemical transformations. We demonstrate successful Bayesian
Inference in 1D+Time and 2D+Time calcite dissolution based on synthetic microCT
images with meaningful posterior distribution on the reactive parameters and
dimensionless numbers.]]></summary>

call this the Minimum Intrinsic Dimension scaling (MID scaling) phenomenon, and
establish MID scaling with no assumptions on the data distributions so long as
the cost is bounded and Lipschitz, and for various entropic optimal transport
quantities beyond just values, with stronger analogs when one distribution is
supported on a manifold. Our results significantly advance the theoretical

machine learning model without sharing their data; rather, they train their own
model locally and send updates to a central server for aggregation. Depending
on how the data is distributed among the participants, FL can be classified
into Horizontal (HFL) and Vertical (VFL). In VFL, the participants share the
same set of training instances but only host a different and non-overlapping
subset of the whole feature space. Whereas in HFL, each participant shares the
same set of features while the training set is split into locally owned
training data subsets.

VFL is increasingly used in applications like financial fraud detection;
nonetheless, very little work has analyzed its security. In this paper, we
focus on robustness in VFL, in particular, on backdoor attacks, whereby an
adversary attempts to manipulate the aggregate model during the training
process to trigger misclassifications. Performing backdoor attacks in VFL is
more challenging than in HFL, as the adversary i) does not have access to the
labels during training and ii) cannot change the labels as she only has access
to the feature embeddings. We present a first-of-its-kind clean-label backdoor
attack in VFL, which consists of two phases: a label inference and a backdoor
phase. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack on three different
datasets, investigate the factors involved in its success, and discuss
countermeasures to mitigate its impact.]]></summary>

plays a crucial role in the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and management of
cardiovascular diseases. Recently, the widespread adoption of ambulatory BP
measurement devices has been driven predominantly by the increased prevalence
of hypertension and its associated risks and clinical conditions. Recent
guidelines advocate for regular BP monitoring as part of regular clinical
visits or even at home. This increased utilization of BP measurement
technologies has brought up significant concerns, regarding the accuracy of
reported BP values across settings.

In this survey, focusing mainly on cuff-based BP monitoring technologies, we
highlight how BP measurements can demonstrate substantial biases and variances
due to factors such as measurement and device errors, demographics, and body
habitus. With these inherent biases, the development of a new generation of
cuff-based BP devices which use artificial-intelligence (AI) has significant
potential. We present future avenues where AI-assisted technologies can
leverage the extensive clinical literature on BP-related studies together with
the large collections of BP records available in electronic health records.
These resources can be combined with machine learning approaches, including
deep learning and Bayesian inference, to remove BP measurement biases and to
provide individualized BP-related cardiovascular risk indexes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep learning based recommendation models (DLRM) are widely used in several
business critical applications. Training such recommendation models efficiently
is challenging because they contain billions of embedding-based parameters,
leading to significant overheads from embedding access. By profiling existing
systems for DLRM training, we observe that around 75\% of the iteration time is
spent on embedding access and model synchronization. Our key insight in this
paper is that embedding access has a specific structure which can be used to
accelerate training. We observe that embedding accesses are heavily skewed,
with around 1\% of embeddings representing more than 92\% of total accesses.
Further, we observe that during offline training we can lookahead at future
batches to determine exactly which embeddings will be needed at what iteration
in the future. Based on these insights, we develop Bagpipe, a system for
training deep recommendation models that uses caching and prefetching to
overlap remote embedding accesses with the computation. We design an Oracle
Cacher, a new component that uses a lookahead algorithm to generate optimal
cache update decisions while providing strong consistency guarantees against
staleness. We also design a logically replicated, physically partitioned cache
and show that our design can reduce synchronization overheads in a distributed
setting. Finally, we propose a disaggregated system architecture and show that
our design can enable low-overhead fault tolerance. Our experiments using three
datasets and four models show that Bagpipe provides a speed up of up to 5.6x
compared to state of the art baselines, while providing the same convergence
and reproducibility guarantees as synchronous training.]]></summary>

reach target poses of characters by making use of phases variables learned by a
Periodic Autoencoder. Our approach utilizes a mixture-of-experts neural network
model, in which the phases cluster movements in both space and time with
different expert weights. Each generated set of weights then produces a
sequence of poses in an autoregressive manner between the current and target
state of the character. In addition, to satisfy poses which are manually
modified by the animators or where certain end effectors serve as constraints
to be reached by the animation, a learned bi-directional control scheme is
implemented to satisfy such constraints. The results demonstrate that using
phases for motion in-betweening tasks sharpen the interpolated movements, and
furthermore stabilizes the learning process. Moreover, using phases for motion
in-betweening tasks can also synthesize more challenging movements beyond
locomotion behaviors. Additionally, style control is enabled between given
target keyframes. Our proposed framework can compete with popular
state-of-the-art methods for motion in-betweening in terms of motion quality
and generalization, especially in the existence of long transition durations.
Our framework contributes to faster prototyping workflows for creating animated

high-stakes domains demands transparency and scrutiny of their fairness and
reliability. To help gauge machine learning models' robustness, research
typically focuses on the massive datasets used for their deployment, e.g.,
creating and maintaining documentation for understanding their origin, process
of development, and ethical considerations. However, data collection for AI is
still typically a one-off practice, and oftentimes datasets collected for a
certain purpose or application are reused for a different problem.
Additionally, dataset annotations may not be representative over time, contain
ambiguous or erroneous annotations, or be unable to generalize across issues or
domains. Recent research has shown these practices might lead to unfair,
biased, or inaccurate outcomes. We argue that data collection for AI should be
performed in a responsible manner where the quality of the data is thoroughly
scrutinized and measured through a systematic set of appropriate metrics. In
this paper, we propose a Responsible AI (RAI) methodology designed to guide the
data collection with a set of metrics for an iterative in-depth analysis of the
factors influencing the quality and reliability} of the generated data. We
propose a granular set of measurements to inform on the internal reliability of
a dataset and its external stability over time. We validate our approach across
nine existing datasets and annotation tasks and four content modalities. This
approach impacts the assessment of data robustness used for AI applied in the
real world, where diversity of users and content is eminent. Furthermore, it
deals with fairness and accountability aspects in data collection by providing

classes in the PAC and agnostic models. Generalizing a beautiful work of Malach
and Shalev-Shwartz (2022) that gave tight correlational SQ (CSQ) lower bounds
for learning DNF formulas, we give new proofs that lower bounds on the
threshold or approximate degree of any function class directly imply CSQ lower
bounds for PAC or agnostic learning respectively. While such bounds implicitly
follow by combining prior results by Feldman (2008, 2012) and Sherstov (2008,
2011), to our knowledge the precise statements we give had not appeared in this
form before. Moreover, our proofs are simple and largely self-contained.

These lower bounds match corresponding positive results using upper bounds on
the threshold or approximate degree in the SQ model for PAC or agnostic
learning, and in this sense these results show that the polynomial method is a
universal, best-possible approach for distribution-free CSQ learning.]]></summary>

determine the lithology of the formations surrounding the borehole and the
location and reserves of subsurface oil and gas reservoirs. However, important
logs are often missing in horizontal or old wells, which poses a challenge in
field applications. In this paper, we utilize data from the 2020 machine
learning competition of the SPWLA, which aims to predict the missing
compressional wave slowness and shear wave slowness logs using other logs in
the same borehole. We employ the NGBoost algorithm to construct an Ensemble
Learning model that can predicate the results as well as their uncertainty.
Furthermore, we combine the SHAP method to investigate the interpretability of
the machine learning model. We compare the performance of the NGBosst model
with four other commonly used Ensemble Learning methods, including Random
Forest, GBDT, XGBoost, LightGBM. The results show that the NGBoost model
performs well in the testing set and can provide a probability distribution for
the prediction results. In addition, the variance of the probability
distribution of the predicted log can be used to justify the quality of the
constructed log. Using the SHAP explainable machine learning model, we
calculate the importance of each input log to the predicted results as well as
the coupling relationship among input logs. Our findings reveal that the
NGBoost model tends to provide greater slowness prediction results when the
neutron porosity and gamma ray are large, which is consistent with the
cognition of petrophysical models. Furthermore, the machine learning model can
capture the influence of the changing borehole caliper on slowness, where the
influence of borehole caliper on slowness is complex and not easy to establish
a direct relationship. These findings are in line with the physical principle
of borehole acoustics.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep learning models achieve excellent performance in numerous machine
learning tasks. Yet, they suffer from security-related issues such as
adversarial examples and poisoning (backdoor) attacks. A deep learning model
may be poisoned by training with backdoored data or by modifying inner network
parameters. Then, a backdoored model performs as expected when receiving a
clean input, but it misclassifies when receiving a backdoored input stamped
with a pre-designed pattern called "trigger". Unfortunately, it is difficult to
distinguish between clean and backdoored models without prior knowledge of the
trigger. This paper proposes a backdoor detection method by utilizing a special
type of adversarial attack, universal adversarial perturbation (UAP), and its
similarities with a backdoor trigger. We observe an intuitive phenomenon: UAPs
generated from backdoored models need fewer perturbations to mislead the model
than UAPs from clean models. UAPs of backdoored models tend to exploit the
shortcut from all classes to the target class, built by the backdoor trigger.
We propose a novel method called Universal Soldier for Backdoor detection (USB)
and reverse engineering potential backdoor triggers via UAPs. Experiments on
345 models trained on several datasets show that USB effectively detects the
injected backdoor and provides comparable or better results than
state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

proximity correction (OPC) has emerged as a crucial resolution enhancement
technology for ensuring high printability in the lithography process. Recently,
level set-based inverse lithography technology (ILT) has drawn considerable
attention as a promising OPC solution, showcasing its powerful pattern
fidelity, especially in advanced process. However, massive computational time
consumption of ILT limits its applicability to mainly correcting partial layers
and hotspot regions. Deep learning (DL) methods have shown great potential in
accelerating ILT. However, lack of domain knowledge of inverse lithography
limits the ability of DL-based algorithms in process window (PW) enhancement
and etc. In this paper, we propose an inverse lithography physics-informed deep
neural level set (ILDLS) approach for mask optimization. This approach utilizes
level set based-ILT as a layer within the DL framework and iteratively conducts
mask prediction and correction to significantly enhance printability and PW in
comparison with results from pure DL and ILT. With this approach, computation
time is reduced by a few orders of magnitude versus ILT. By gearing up DL with
knowledge of inverse lithography physics, ILDLS provides a new and efficient

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NPN classification has many applications in the synthesis and verification of
digital circuits. The canonical-form-based method is the most common approach,
designing a canonical form as representative for the NPN equivalence class
first and then computing the transformation function according to the canonical
form. Most works use variable symmetries and several signatures, mainly based
on the cofactor, to simplify the canonical form construction and computation.
This paper describes a novel canonical form and its computation algorithm by
introducing Boolean influence to NPN classification, which is a basic concept
in analysis of Boolean functions. We show that influence is
input-negation-independent, input-permutation-dependent, and has other
structural information than previous signatures for NPN classification.
Therefore, it is a significant ingredient in speeding up NPN classification.
Experimental results prove that influence plays an important role in reducing
the transformation enumeration in computing the canonical form. Compared with
the state-of-the-art algorithm implemented in ABC, our influence-aided
canonical form for exact NPN classification gains up to 5.5x speedup.]]></summary>

operator. One of the effective approaches is to offer some attractive incentive
or additional services or money to the subscribers for keeping them engaged and
make sure they stay in the operator's network for longer time. Often, operators
allocate certain amount of monetary budget to carry out the offer campaign. The
difficult part of this campaign is the selection of a set of customers from a
large subscriber-base and deciding the amount that should be offered to an
individual so that operator's objective is achieved. There may be multiple
objectives (e.g., maximizing revenue, minimizing number of churns) for
selection of subscriber and selection of an offer to the selected subscriber.
Apart from monetary benefit, offers may include additional data, SMS, hots-spot
tethering, and many more. This problem is known as offer optimization. In this
paper, we propose a novel combinatorial algorithm for solving offer
optimization under heterogeneous offers by maximizing expected revenue under
the scenario of subscriber churn, which is, in general, seen in telecom domain.
The proposed algorithm is efficient and accurate even for a very large

statistics, which requires recurrent communication between neurons.
Mechanistically, such recurrent communication is often indirect and mediated by
local interneurons. In this work, we explore the computational benefits of
mediating recurrent communication via interneurons compared with direct
recurrent connections. To this end, we consider two mathematically tractable
recurrent linear neural networks that statistically whiten their inputs -- one
with direct recurrent connections and the other with interneurons that mediate
recurrent communication. By analyzing the corresponding continuous synaptic
dynamics and numerically simulating the networks, we show that the network with
interneurons is more robust to initialization than the network with direct
recurrent connections in the sense that the convergence time for the synaptic
dynamics in the network with interneurons (resp. direct recurrent connections)
scales logarithmically (resp. linearly) with the spectrum of their
initialization. Our results suggest that interneurons are computationally
useful for rapid adaptation to changing input statistics. Interestingly, the
network with interneurons is an overparameterized solution of the whitening
objective for the network with direct recurrent connections, so our results can
be viewed as a recurrent linear neural network analogue of the implicit
acceleration phenomenon observed in overparameterized feedforward linear neural
networks.]]></summary>

view synthesis. However, existing methods require expensive per-scene
optimization from many views hence limiting their application to real-world
unbounded urban settings where the objects of interest or backgrounds are
observed from very few views. To mitigate this challenge, we introduce a new
approach called NeO 360, Neural fields for sparse view synthesis of outdoor
scenes. NeO 360 is a generalizable method that reconstructs 360{\deg} scenes
from a single or a few posed RGB images. The essence of our approach is in
capturing the distribution of complex real-world outdoor 3D scenes and using a
hybrid image-conditional triplanar representation that can be queried from any
world point. Our representation combines the best of both voxel-based and
bird's-eye-view (BEV) representations and is more effective and expressive than
each. NeO 360's representation allows us to learn from a large collection of
unbounded 3D scenes while offering generalizability to new views and novel
scenes from as few as a single image during inference. We demonstrate our
approach on the proposed challenging 360{\deg} unbounded dataset, called NeRDS
360, and show that NeO 360 outperforms state-of-the-art generalizable methods

leads to data missing not at random and poses a great challenge for unbiased
evaluation and learning of prediction models. Currently, the doubly robust (DR)
methods have been widely studied and demonstrate superior performance. However,
in this paper, we show that DR methods are unstable and have unbounded bias,
variance, and generalization bounds to extremely small propensities. Moreover,
the fact that DR relies more on extrapolation will lead to suboptimal
performance. To address the above limitations while retaining double
robustness, we propose a stabilized doubly robust (StableDR) learning approach
with a weaker reliance on extrapolation. Theoretical analysis shows that
StableDR has bounded bias, variance, and generalization error bound
simultaneously under inaccurate imputed errors and arbitrarily small
propensities. In addition, we propose a novel learning approach for StableDR
that updates the imputation, propensity, and prediction models cyclically,
achieving more stable and accurate predictions. Extensive experiments show that
our approaches significantly outperform the existing methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep learning in medical imaging has the potential to minimize the risk of
diagnostic errors, reduce radiologist workload, and accelerate diagnosis.
Training such deep learning models requires large and accurate datasets, with
annotations for all training samples. However, in the medical imaging domain,
annotated datasets for specific tasks are often small due to the high
complexity of annotations, limited access, or the rarity of diseases. To
address this challenge, deep learning models can be pre-trained on large image
datasets without annotations using methods from the field of self-supervised
learning. After pre-training, small annotated datasets are sufficient to
fine-tune the models for a specific task. The most popular self-supervised
pre-training approaches in medical imaging are based on contrastive learning.
However, recent studies in natural image processing indicate a strong potential
for masked autoencoder approaches. Our work compares state-of-the-art
contrastive learning methods with the recently introduced masked autoencoder
approach "SparK" for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on medical images.
Therefore we pre-train on a large unannotated CT image dataset and fine-tune on
several CT classification tasks. Due to the challenge of obtaining sufficient
annotated training data in medical imaging, it is of particular interest to
evaluate how the self-supervised pre-training methods perform when fine-tuning
on small datasets. By experimenting with gradually reducing the training
dataset size for fine-tuning, we find that the reduction has different effects
depending on the type of pre-training chosen. The SparK pre-training method is
more robust to the training dataset size than the contrastive methods. Based on
our results, we propose the SparK pre-training for medical imaging tasks with
only small annotated datasets.]]></summary>

temporal-dynamics prediction of chaotic systems, we propose a novel attention
mechanism called easy attention. Due to the fact that self attention only makes
usage of the inner product of queries and keys, it is demonstrated that the
keys, queries and softmax are not necessary for obtaining the attention score
required to capture long-term dependencies in temporal sequences. Through
implementing singular-value decomposition (SVD) on the softmax attention score,
we further observe that the self attention compresses contribution from both
queries and keys in the spanned space of the attention score. Therefore, our
proposed easy-attention method directly treats the attention scores as
learnable parameters. This approach produces excellent results when
reconstructing and predicting the temporal dynamics of chaotic systems
exhibiting more robustness and less complexity than the self attention or the
widely-used long short-term memory (LSTM) network. Our results show great
potential for applications in more complex high-dimensional dynamical systems.]]></summary>

unstructured data including language, image, audio, and video. However, a
prevalent real-world scenario involves the combination of structured data types
(tabular, time-series) with unstructured data which has so far been
understudied. To bridge this gap, we propose LANISTR, an attention-based
framework to learn from LANguage, Image, and STRuctured data. The core of
LANISTR's methodology is rooted in \textit{masking-based} training applied
across both unimodal and multimodal levels. In particular, we introduce a new
similarity-based multimodal masking loss that enables it to learn cross-modal
relations from large-scale multimodal data with missing modalities. On two
real-world datastes, MIMIC-IV (healthcare) and Amazon Product Review (retail),
LANISTR demonstrates remarkable absolute improvements of 6.6\% (AUROC) and up
to 14\% (accuracy) when fine-tuned on 0.1\% and 0.01\% of labeled data,
respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art alternatives. Notably, these
improvements are observed even in the presence of considerable missingness
ratios of 35.7\% and 99.8\%, in the respective datasets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most existing classical artificial neural networks (ANN) are designed as a
tree structure to imitate neural networks. In this paper, we argue that the
connectivity of a tree is not sufficient to characterize a neural network. The
nodes of the same level of a tree cannot be connected with each other, i.e.,
these neural unit cannot share information with each other, which is a major
drawback of ANN. Although ANN has been significantly improved in recent years
to more complex structures, such as the directed acyclic graph (DAG), these
methods also have unidirectional and acyclic bias for ANN. In this paper, we
propose a method to build a bidirectional complete graph for the nodes in the
same level of an ANN, which yokes the nodes of the same level to formulate a
neural module. We call our model as YNN in short. YNN promotes the information
transfer significantly which obviously helps in improving the performance of
the method. Our YNN can imitate neural networks much better compared with the
traditional ANN. In this paper, we analyze the existing structural bias of ANN
and propose a model YNN to efficiently eliminate such structural bias. In our
model, nodes also carry out aggregation and transformation of features, and
edges determine the flow of information. We further impose auxiliary sparsity
constraint to the distribution of connectedness, which promotes the learned
structure to focus on critical connections. Finally, based on the optimized
structure, we also design small neural module structure based on the minimum
cut technique to reduce the computational burden of the YNN model. This
learning process is compatible with the existing networks and different tasks.
The obtained quantitative experimental results reflect that the learned
connectivity is superior to the traditional NN structure.]]></summary>

learning over graphs. Despite their popularity, scaling GNNs either by
deepening or widening suffers from prevalent issues of unhealthy gradients,
over-smoothening, information squashing, which often lead to sub-standard
performance. In this work, we are interested in exploring a principled way to
scale GNNs capacity without deepening or widening, which can improve its
performance across multiple small and large graphs. Motivated by the recent
intriguing phenomenon of model soups, which suggest that fine-tuned weights of
multiple large-language pre-trained models can be merged to a better minima, we
argue to exploit the fundamentals of model soups to mitigate the aforementioned
issues of memory bottleneck and trainability during GNNs scaling. More
specifically, we propose not to deepen or widen current GNNs, but instead
present a data-centric perspective of model soups tailored for GNNs, i.e., to
build powerful GNNs. By dividing giant graph data, we build multiple
independently and parallelly trained weaker GNNs (soup ingredient) without any
intermediate communication, and combine their strength using a greedy
interpolation soup procedure to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Compared
to concurrent distributed GNN training works such as Jiong et. al. 2023, we
train each soup ingredient by sampling different subgraphs per epoch and their
respective sub-models are merged only after being fully trained (rather than
intermediately so). Moreover, we provide a wide variety of model soup
preparation techniques by leveraging state-of-the-art graph sampling and graph

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The rapid growth of deep learning (DL) has spurred interest in enhancing
log-based anomaly detection. This approach aims to extract meaning from log
events (log message templates) and develop advanced DL models for anomaly
detection. However, these DL methods face challenges like heavy reliance on
training data, labels, and computational resources due to model complexity. In
contrast, traditional machine learning and data mining techniques are less
data-dependent and more efficient but less effective than DL. To make log-based
anomaly detection more practical, the goal is to enhance traditional techniques
to match DL's effectiveness. Previous research in a different domain (linking
questions on Stack Overflow) suggests that optimized traditional techniques can
rival state-of-the-art DL methods. Drawing inspiration from this concept, we
conducted an empirical study. We optimized the unsupervised PCA (Principal
Component Analysis), a traditional technique, by incorporating lightweight
semantic-based log representation. This addresses the issue of unseen log
events in training data, enhancing log representation. Our study compared seven
log-based anomaly detection methods, including four DL-based, two traditional,
and the optimized PCA technique, using public and industrial datasets. Results
indicate that the optimized unsupervised PCA technique achieves similar
effectiveness to advanced supervised/semi-supervised DL methods while being
more stable with limited training data and resource-efficient. This
demonstrates the adaptability and strength of traditional techniques through
small yet impactful adaptations.]]></summary>

productions like Netflix and Facebook. As with most data-driven systems, DRL
systems can exhibit undesirable behaviors due to environmental drifts, which
often occur in constantly-changing production settings. Continual Learning (CL)
is the inherent self-healing approach for adapting the DRL agent in response to
the environment's conditions shifts. However, successive shifts of considerable
magnitude may cause the production environment to drift from its original
state. Recent studies have shown that these environmental drifts tend to drive
CL into long, or even unsuccessful, healing cycles, which arise from
inefficiencies such as catastrophic forgetting, warm-starting failure, and slow
convergence. In this paper, we propose Dr. DRL, an effective self-healing
approach for DRL systems that integrates a novel mechanism of intentional
forgetting into vanilla CL to overcome its main issues. Dr. DRL deliberately
erases the DRL system's minor behaviors to systematically prioritize the
adaptation of the key problem-solving skills. Using well-established DRL
algorithms, Dr. DRL is compared with vanilla CL on various drifted
environments. Dr. DRL is able to reduce, on average, the healing time and
fine-tuning episodes by, respectively, 18.74% and 17.72%. Dr. DRL successfully
helps agents to adapt to 19.63% of drifted environments left unsolved by
vanilla CL while maintaining and even enhancing by up to 45% the obtained
rewards for drifted environments that are resolved by both approaches.]]></summary>

markets, with broad applications such as pricing American and Bermudan options.
The deep BSDE method [Han, Jentzen and E, PNAS, 115(34):8505-8510, 2018] has
shown great power in solving high-dimensional forward-backward stochastic
differential equations (FBSDEs), and inspired many applications. However, the
method solves backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) in a forward
manner, which can not be used for optimal stopping problems that in general
require running BSDE backwardly. To overcome this difficulty, a recent paper
[Wang, Chen, Sudjianto, Liu and Shen, arXiv:1807.06622, 2018] proposed the
backward deep BSDE method to solve the optimal stopping problem. In this paper,
we provide the rigorous theory for the backward deep BSDE method. Specifically,
1. We derive the a posteriori error estimation, i.e., the error of the
numerical solution can be bounded by the training loss function; and; 2. We
give an upper bound of the loss function, which can be sufficiently small
subject to universal approximations. We give two numerical examples, which
present consistent performance with the proved theory.]]></summary>

for diagnosing hematological diseases. Due to constantly evolving clinical
settings, data sources, and disease classifications, it is necessary to update
machine learning classification models regularly for practical real-world use.
Such models significantly benefit from sequentially learning from incoming data
streams without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. However, models can
suffer from catastrophic forgetting, causing a drop in performance on previous
tasks when fine-tuned on new data. Here, we propose a rehearsal-based continual
learning approach for class incremental and domain incremental scenarios in
white blood cell classification. To choose representative samples from previous
tasks, we employ exemplar set selection based on the model's predictions. This
involves selecting the most confident samples and the most challenging samples
identified through uncertainty estimation of the model. We thoroughly evaluated
our proposed approach on three white blood cell classification datasets that
differ in color, resolution, and class composition, including scenarios where
new domains or new classes are introduced to the model with every task. We also
test a long class incremental experiment with both new domains and new classes.
Our results demonstrate that our approach outperforms established baselines in
continual learning, including existing iCaRL and EWC methods for classifying
white blood cells in cross-domain environments.]]></summary>

works focus on training a global model, Personalized FL (PFL) sometimes can be

heterogeneity in GAN-based FL, we propose a novel GAN sharing and aggregation
strategy for PFL. The proposed PFL-GAN addresses the client heterogeneity in

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Variational Information Pursuit (V-IP) is a framework for making
interpretable predictions by design by sequentially selecting a short chain of
task-relevant, user-defined and interpretable queries about the data that are
most informative for the task. While this allows for built-in interpretability
in predictive models, applying V-IP to any task requires data samples with
dense concept-labeling by domain experts, limiting the application of V-IP to
small-scale tasks where manual data annotation is feasible. In this work, we
extend the V-IP framework with Foundational Models (FMs) to address this
limitation. More specifically, we use a two-step process, by first leveraging
Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate a sufficiently large candidate set of
task-relevant interpretable concepts, then using Large Multimodal Models to
annotate each data sample by semantic similarity with each concept in the
generated concept set. While other interpretable-by-design frameworks such as
Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) require an additional step of removing
repetitive and non-discriminative concepts to have good interpretability and
test performance, we mathematically and empirically justify that, with a
sufficiently informative and task-relevant query (concept) set, the proposed
FM+V-IP method does not require any type of concept filtering. In addition, we
show that FM+V-IP with LLM generated concepts can achieve better test
performance than V-IP with human annotated concepts, demonstrating the
effectiveness of LLMs at generating efficient query sets. Finally, when
compared to other interpretable-by-design frameworks such as CBMs, FM+V-IP can
achieve competitive test performance using fewer number of concepts/queries in
both cases with filtered or unfiltered concept sets.]]></summary>

subtyping outcomes, and hence developed MoCLIM, a representation learning

learning of different omics modalities, we can well-cluster the subtypes, given
cancer, into a lower latent space. This contrast can be interpreted as a
projection of inter-omics inference observed in biological networks.

clients to construct a global model. While FL enables learning a model with
data privacy, it often suffers from significant performance degradation when
client data distributions are heterogeneous. Many previous FL algorithms have
addressed this issue by introducing various proximal restrictions. These
restrictions aim to encourage global alignment by constraining the deviation of
local learning from the global objective. However, they inherently limit local
learning by interfering with the original local objectives. Recently, an
alternative approach has emerged to improve local learning generality. By
obtaining local models within a smooth loss landscape, this approach mitigates
conflicts among different local objectives of the clients. Yet, it does not
ensure stable global alignment, as local learning does not take the global
objective into account. In this study, we propose Federated Stability on
Learning (FedSoL), which combines both the concepts of global alignment and
local generality. In FedSoL, the local learning seeks a parameter region robust
against proximal perturbations. This strategy introduces an implicit proximal
restriction effect in local learning while maintaining the original local
objective for parameter update. Our experiments show that FedSoL consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance on various setups.]]></summary>

disentangled representations via adding multi-scale topological loss term.
Disentanglement is a crucial property of data representations substantial for
the explainability and robustness of deep learning models and a step towards
high-level cognition. The state-of-the-art method based on VAE minimizes the
total correlation of the joint distribution of latent variables. We take a
different perspective on disentanglement by analyzing topological properties of
data manifolds. In particular, we optimize the topological similarity for data
manifolds traversals. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first one
to propose a differentiable topological loss for disentanglement. Our
experiments have shown that the proposed topological loss improves
disentanglement scores such as MIG, FactorVAE score, SAP score and DCI
disentanglement score with respect to state-of-the-art results. Our method
works in an unsupervised manner, permitting to apply it for problems without
labeled factors of variation. Additionally, we show how to use the proposed
topological loss to find disentangled directions in a trained GAN.]]></summary>

generative model: GANs and VAEs. Unlike a common unlearning task where an
unlearning target is a subset of the training set, we aim to unlearn a specific
feature, such as hairstyle from facial images, from the pre-trained generative
models. As the target feature is only presented in a local region of an image,
unlearning the entire image from the pre-trained model may result in losing
other details in the remaining region of the image. To specify which features
to unlearn, we collect randomly generated images that contain the target
features. We then identify a latent representation corresponding to the target
feature and then use the representation to fine-tune the pre-trained model.
Through experiments on MNIST and CelebA datasets, we show that target features
are successfully removed while keeping the fidelity of the original models.
Further experiments with an adversarial attack show that the unlearned model is
more robust under the presence of malicious parties.]]></summary>

datasets, yet their real-world performance is restricted due to the controlled
experimental conditions involving clean training data. Addressing the challenge
of training with noise, a prevalent issue in practical anomaly detection, is
frequently overlooked. In a pioneering endeavor, this study delves into the
realm of label-level noise within sensory time-series anomaly detection (TSAD).
This paper presents a novel and practical end-to-end unsupervised TSAD when the
training data are contaminated with anomalies. The introduced approach, called
TSAD-C, is devoid of access to abnormality labels during the training phase.
TSAD-C encompasses three modules: a Decontaminator to rectify the abnormalities
(aka noise) present in the training data, a Variable Dependency Modeling module
to capture both long-term intra- and inter-variable dependencies within the
decontaminated data that can be considered as a surrogate of the pure normal
data, and an Anomaly Scoring module to detect anomalies. Our extensive
experiments conducted on three widely used physiological datasets conclusively
demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing methodologies, thus
establishing a new state-of-the-art performance in the field.]]></summary>

two degrees of freedom to carry out actuation tasks on the fly. Our solution is
based on employing a Q-learning method to control the trajectory of the tip of
the arm, also called \textit{end-effector}. More specifically, we develop a
motion planning model based on Time To Collision (TTC), which enables a
quadrotor UAV to navigate around obstacles while ensuring the manipulator's
reachability. Additionally, we utilize a model-based Q-learning model to
independently track and control the desired trajectory of the manipulator's
end-effector, given an arbitrary baseline trajectory for the UAV platform. Such
a combination enables a variety of actuation tasks such as high-altitude
welding, structural monitoring and repair, battery replacement, gutter
cleaning, sky scrapper cleaning, and power line maintenance in hard-to-reach
and risky environments while retaining compatibility with flight control
firmware. Our RL-based control mechanism results in a robust control strategy
that can handle uncertainties in the motion of the UAV, offering promising
performance. Specifically, our method achieves 92\% accuracy in terms of

mechanisms provide any privacy protection. In this paper, we study the local

specifically, we advance the existing literature by deriving tight $f$-DP

and the sign-based methods that are proposed for data compression, in
closed-form expressions. We further investigate the amplification in privacy by
sparsification and propose a ternary stochastic compressor. By leveraging
compression for privacy amplification, we improve the existing methods by
removing the dependency of accuracy (in terms of mean square error) on
communication cost in the popular use case of distributed mean estimation,
therefore breaking the three-way tradeoff between privacy, communication, and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, foundation models have exhibited remarkable advancements in
multi-modal learning. These models, equipped with millions (or billions) of
parameters, typically require a substantial amount of data for finetuning.
However, collecting and centralizing training data from diverse sectors becomes
challenging due to distinct privacy regulations. Federated Learning (FL)
emerges as a promising solution, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively
train neural networks without centralizing their local data. To alleviate
client computation burdens and communication overheads, previous works have
adapted Parameter-efficient Finetuning (PEFT) methods for FL. Hereby, only a
small fraction of the model parameters are optimized and communicated during
federated communications. Nevertheless, most previous works have focused on a
single modality and neglected one common phenomenon, i.e., the presence of data
heterogeneity across the clients. Therefore, in this work, we propose a
finetuning framework tailored to heterogeneous multi-modal FL, called Federated
Dual-Aadapter Teacher (FedDAT). Specifically, our approach leverages a
Dual-Adapter Teacher (DAT) to address data heterogeneity by regularizing the
client local updates and applying Mutual Knowledge Distillation (MKD) for an
efficient knowledge transfer. FedDAT is the first approach that enables an
efficient distributed finetuning of foundation models for a variety of
heterogeneous Vision-Language tasks. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we
conduct extensive experiments on four multi-modality FL benchmarks with
different types of data heterogeneity, where FedDAT substantially outperforms
the existing centralized PEFT methods adapted for FL.]]></summary>

data sources such as GTFS and smart card data, we extract features and model
the transportation network as a directed graph. Using self-supervision, we
train a deep learning model for predicting lateness values for road segments.

These lateness values are then utilized as edge weights in the transportation
graph, enabling efficient path searching. Through evaluating the method on Tel
Aviv, we are able to reduce times on more than 9\% of the routes. The improved

raise significant challenges for inter-frame motion correction, particularly
for the early frames where conventional intensity-based image registration
techniques are not applicable. Alternatively, a promising approach utilizes
generative methods to handle the tracer distribution changes to assist existing

linear modulation layer encodes channel-wise parameters generated from temporal
tracer kinetics information, and rough cardiac segmentations with local shifts
serve as the anatomical information. We validated our proposed method on a

rendered in arbitrary perspectives to produce images. Although previous methods
produce realistic images, they suffer from unstable training or degenerate
solutions where the 3D geometry is unnatural. We hypothesize that the 3D
geometry is underdetermined due to the insufficient constraint, i.e., being
classified as real image to the discriminator is not enough. To solve this
problem, we propose to approximate the background as a spherical surface and
represent a scene as a union of the foreground placed in the sphere and the
thin spherical background. It reduces the degree of freedom in the background
field. Accordingly, we modify the volume rendering equation and incorporate
dedicated constraints to design a novel 3D-aware GAN framework named BallGAN.
BallGAN has multiple advantages as follows. 1) It produces more reasonable 3D
geometry; the images of a scene across different viewpoints have better
photometric consistency and fidelity than the state-of-the-art methods. 2) The
training becomes much more stable. 3) The foreground can be separately rendered
on top of different arbitrary backgrounds.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Delays and asynchrony are inevitable in large-scale machine-learning problems
where communication plays a key role. As such, several works have extensively
analyzed stochastic optimization with delayed gradients. However, as far as we
are aware, no analogous theory is available for min-max optimization, a topic
that has gained recent popularity due to applications in adversarial
robustness, game theory, and reinforcement learning. Motivated by this gap, we
examine the performance of standard min-max optimization algorithms with
delayed gradient updates. First, we show (empirically) that even small delays
can cause prominent algorithms like Extra-gradient (\texttt{EG}) to diverge on
simple instances for which \texttt{EG} guarantees convergence in the absence of
delays. Our empirical study thus suggests the need for a careful analysis of
delayed versions of min-max optimization algorithms. Accordingly, under
suitable technical assumptions, we prove that Gradient Descent-Ascent
(\texttt{GDA}) and \texttt{EG} with delayed updates continue to guarantee
convergence to saddle points for convex-concave and strongly convex-strongly
concave settings. Our complexity bounds reveal, in a transparent manner, the
slow-down in convergence caused by delays.]]></summary>

solutions available in computer graphics literature. Existing cloth simulators
produce realistic cloth deformations that obey different types of boundary
conditions. Nevertheless, their operational principle remains limited in
several ways: They operate on explicit surface representations with a fixed
spatial resolution, perform a series of discretised updates (which bounds their
temporal resolution), and require comparably large amounts of storage.
Moreover, back-propagating gradients through the existing solvers is often not
straightforward, which poses additional challenges when integrating them into
modern neural architectures. In response to the limitations mentioned above,
this paper takes a fundamentally different perspective on physically-plausible
cloth simulation and re-thinks this long-standing problem: We propose
NeuralClothSim, i.e., a new cloth simulation approach using thin shells, in
which surface evolution is encoded in neural network weights. Our
memory-efficient and differentiable solver operates on a new continuous
coordinate-based representation of dynamic surfaces, i.e., neural deformation
fields (NDFs); it supervises NDF evolution with the rules of the non-linear
Kirchhoff-Love shell theory. NDFs are adaptive in the sense that they 1)
allocate their capacity to the deformation details as the latter arise during
the cloth evolution and 2) allow surface state queries at arbitrary spatial and
temporal resolutions without retraining. We show how to train our
NeuralClothSim solver while imposing hard boundary conditions and demonstrate
multiple applications, such as material interpolation and simulation editing.
The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our formulation and its
potential impact.]]></summary>

online social networks (OSNs), often for political, ideological, or financial
gain, has affected the openness of OSNs. While researchers from various
disciplines have investigated different manipulation-triggering elements of
OSNs (such as understanding information diffusion on OSNs or detecting
automated behavior of accounts), these works have not been consolidated to
present a comprehensive overview of the interconnections among these elements.
Notably, user psychology, the prevalence of bots, and their tactics in relation
to false information detection have been overlooked in previous research. To
address this research gap, this paper synthesizes insights from various
disciplines to provide a comprehensive analysis of the manipulation landscape.
By integrating the primary elements of social media manipulation (SMM),
including false information, bots, and malicious campaigns, we extensively
examine each SMM element. Through a systematic investigation of prior research,
we identify commonalities, highlight existing gaps, and extract valuable
insights in the field. Our findings underscore the urgent need for
interdisciplinary research to effectively combat social media manipulations,

player's experience in video games. Recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL)
methods have been employed for DDA in non-competitive games; nevertheless, they
rely solely on discrete state-action space with a small search space. In this
paper, we propose a continuous RL-based DDA methodology for a visual working
memory (VWM) game to handle the complex search space for the difficulty of
memorization. The proposed RL-based DDA tailors game difficulty based on the
player's score and game difficulty in the last trial. We defined a continuous
metric for the difficulty of memorization. Then, we consider the task
difficulty and the vector of difficulty-score as the RL's action and state,
respectively. We evaluated the proposed method through a within-subject
experiment involving 52 subjects. The proposed approach was compared with two
rule-based difficulty adjustment methods in terms of player's score and game
experience measured by a questionnaire. The proposed RL-based approach resulted
in a significantly better game experience in terms of competence, tension, and
negative and positive affect. Players also achieved higher scores and win
rates. Furthermore, the proposed RL-based DDA led to a significantly less
decline in the score in a 20-trial session.]]></summary>

Classification models are typically trained on a static pre-defined dataset and
are kept in the dark for the open unassigned feature space. As a result, they
struggle to deal with out-of-distribution data during inference. Addressing
this task on the class-level is termed open-set recognition (OSR). However,
most OSR methods are inherently limited, as they train closed-set classifiers
and only adapt the downstream predictions to OSR. This work presents LORD, a
framework to Leverage Open-set Recognition by exploiting unknown Data. LORD
explicitly models open space during classifier training and provides a
systematic evaluation for such approaches. We identify three model-agnostic
training strategies that exploit background data and applied them to
well-established classifiers. Due to LORD's extensive evaluation protocol, we
consistently demonstrate improved recognition of unknown data. The benchmarks
facilitate in-depth analysis across various requirement levels. To mitigate
dependency on extensive and costly background datasets, we explore mixup as an
off-the-shelf data generation technique. Our experiments highlight mixup's
effectiveness as a substitute for background datasets. Lightweight constraints
on mixup synthesis further improve OSR performance.]]></summary>

built speech-driven gesture-generation systems using the same speech and motion
dataset, followed by a joint evaluation. This year's challenge provided data on
both sides of a dyadic interaction, allowing teams to generate full-body motion
for an agent given its speech (text and audio) and the speech and motion of the
interlocutor. We evaluated 12 submissions and 2 baselines together with
held-out motion-capture data in several large-scale user studies. The studies
focused on three aspects: 1) the human-likeness of the motion, 2) the
appropriateness of the motion for the agent's own speech whilst controlling for
the human-likeness of the motion, and 3) the appropriateness of the motion for
the behaviour of the interlocutor in the interaction, using a setup that
controls for both the human-likeness of the motion and the agent's own speech.
We found a large span in human-likeness between challenge submissions, with a
few systems rated close to human mocap. Appropriateness seems far from being
solved, with most submissions performing in a narrow range slightly above
chance, far behind natural motion. The effect of the interlocutor is even more
subtle, with submitted systems at best performing barely above chance.
Interestingly, a dyadic system being highly appropriate for agent speech does
not necessarily imply high appropriateness for the interlocutor. Additional

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNNs have been widely applied for medical image analysis. However, limited
memory capacity is one of the most common drawbacks of processing
high-resolution 3D volumetric data. 3D volumes are usually cropped or downsized
first before processing, which can result in a loss of resolution, increase
class imbalance, and affect the performance of the segmentation algorithms. In
this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning approach called IP-UNet.
IP-UNet is a UNet-based model that performs multi-class segmentation on
Intensity Projection (IP) of 3D volumetric data instead of the memory-consuming
3D volumes. IP-UNet uses limited memory capability for training without losing
the original 3D image resolution. We compare the performance of three models in
terms of segmentation accuracy and computational cost: 1) Slice-by-slice 2D
segmentation of the CT scan images using a conventional 2D UNet model. 2)
IP-UNet that operates on data obtained by merging the extracted Maximum
Intensity Projection (MIP), Closest Vessel Projection (CVP), and Average
Intensity Projection (AvgIP) representations of the source 3D volumes, then
applying the UNet model on the output IP images. 3) 3D-UNet model directly
reads the 3D volumes constructed from a series of CT scan images and outputs
the 3D volume of the predicted segmentation. We test the performance of these
methods on 3D volumetric images for automatic breast calcification detection.
Experimental results show that IP-Unet can achieve similar segmentation
accuracy with 3D-Unet but with much better performance. It reduces the training
time by 70\% and memory consumption by 92\%.]]></summary>

study the brain's structural connectivity in domains such as neurological
disorders, neurosurgery, and aging. In this study, we present FIESTA (FIbEr
Segmentation in Tractography using Autoencoders), a reliable and robust, fully
automated, and easily semi-automatically calibrated pipeline based on deep
autoencoders that can dissect and fully populate white matter bundles. This
pipeline is built upon previous works that demonstrated how autoencoders can be
used successfully for streamline filtering, bundle segmentation, and streamline
generation in tractography. Our proposed method improves bundle segmentation
coverage by recovering hard-to-track bundles with generative sampling through
the latent space seeding of the subject bundle and the atlas bundle. A latent
space of streamlines is learned using autoencoder-based modeling combined with
contrastive learning. Using an atlas of bundles in standard space (MNI), our
proposed method segments new tractograms using the autoencoder latent distance
between each tractogram streamline and its closest neighbor bundle in the atlas
of bundles. Intra-subject bundle reliability is improved by recovering
hard-to-track streamlines, using the autoencoder to generate new streamlines
that increase the spatial coverage of each bundle while remaining anatomically
correct. Results show that our method is more reliable than state-of-the-art
automated virtual dissection methods such as RecoBundles, RecoBundlesX,
TractSeg, White Matter Analysis and XTRACT. Our framework allows for the

cleared by the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), many studies have shown
inconsistent generalization or latent bias, particularly for underrepresented
populations. Some have proposed that generative AI could reduce the need for
real data, but its utility in model development remains unclear. Skin disease
serves as a useful case study in synthetic image generation due to the
diversity of disease appearance, particularly across the protected attribute of
skin tone. Here we show that latent diffusion models can scalably generate
images of skin disease and that augmenting model training with these data
improves performance in data-limited settings. These performance gains saturate
at synthetic-to-real image ratios above 10:1 and are substantially smaller than
the gains obtained from adding real images. As part of our analysis, we
generate and analyze a new dataset of 458,920 synthetic images produced using
several generation strategies. Our results suggest that synthetic data could
serve as a force-multiplier for model development, but the collection of
diverse real-world data remains the most important step to improve medical AI
algorithms.]]></summary>

matching necessary and sufficient conditions for their PAC learnability, along
with corresponding sample complexity bounds, in the setting where the learner
is given access only to prepared quantum states. We first probe the results
from previous works on this setting. We show that the empirical risk defined in
previous works and matching the definition in the classical theory fails to
satisfy the uniform convergence property enjoyed in the classical setting for
some learnable classes. Moreover, we show that VC dimension generalization
upper bounds in previous work are frequently infinite, even for
finite-dimensional POVM classes. To surmount the failure of the standard ERM to
satisfy uniform convergence, we define a new learning rule -- denoised ERM. We
show this to be a universal learning rule for POVM and probabilistically
observed concept classes, and the condition for it to satisfy uniform
convergence is finite fat shattering dimension of the class. We give
quantitative sample complexity upper and lower bounds for learnability in terms
of finite fat-shattering dimension and a notion of approximate finite
partitionability into approximately jointly measurable subsets, which allow for
sample reuse. We then show that finite fat shattering dimension implies finite
coverability by approximately jointly measurable subsets, leading to our
matching conditions. We also show that every measurement class defined on a

prediction under the training distribution but not in the test distribution.
Thus, models trained via the typical gradient-based optimization of
cross-entropy, which we call default-ERM, utilize the shortcut. However, even
when the stable feature determines the label in the training distribution and
the shortcut does not provide any additional information, like in perception
tasks, default-ERM still exhibits shortcut learning. Why are such solutions
preferred when the loss for default-ERM can be driven to zero using the stable
feature alone? By studying a linear perception task, we show that default-ERM's
preference for maximizing the margin leads to models that depend more on the
shortcut than the stable feature, even without overparameterization. This
insight suggests that default-ERM's implicit inductive bias towards max-margin
is unsuitable for perception tasks. Instead, we develop an inductive bias
toward uniform margins and show that this bias guarantees dependence only on
the perfect stable feature in the linear perception task. We develop loss
functions that encourage uniform-margin solutions, called margin control
(MARG-CTRL). MARG-CTRL mitigates shortcut learning on a variety of vision and
language tasks, showing that better inductive biases can remove the need for
expensive two-stage shortcut-mitigating methods in perception tasks.]]></summary>

high-dimensional Hamiltonian systems using data-driven quadratic manifolds.
Classical symplectic model reduction approaches employ linear symplectic
subspaces for representing the high-dimensional system states in a
reduced-dimensional coordinate system. While these approximations respect the
symplectic nature of Hamiltonian systems, linear basis approximations can
suffer from slowly decaying Kolmogorov $N$-width, especially in wave-type
problems, which then requires a large basis size. We propose two different
model reduction methods based on recently developed quadratic manifolds, each
presenting its own advantages and limitations. The addition of quadratic terms
to the state approximation, which sits at the heart of the proposed
methodologies, enables us to better represent intrinsic low-dimensionality in
the problem at hand. Both approaches are effective for issuing predictions in
settings well outside the range of their training data while providing more
accurate solutions than the linear symplectic reduced-order models.]]></summary>

reinforcement learning, has shown significant potential in achieving
human-level autonomy in a wide range of domains, including robotics, computer
vision, and computer games. This potential justifies the enthusiasm and growing
interest in DRL in both academia and industry. However, the community currently
focuses mostly on the development phase of DRL systems, with little attention
devoted to DRL deployment. In this paper, we propose an empirical study on
Stack Overflow (SO), the most popular Q&A forum for developers, to uncover and
understand the challenges practitioners faced when deploying DRL systems.
Specifically, we categorized relevant SO posts by deployment platforms:
server/cloud, mobile/embedded system, browser, and game engine. After filtering
and manual analysis, we examined 357 SO posts about DRL deployment,
investigated the current state, and identified the challenges related to
deploying DRL systems. Then, we investigate the prevalence and difficulty of
these challenges. Results show that the general interest in DRL deployment is
growing, confirming the study's relevance and importance. Results also show
that DRL deployment is more difficult than other DRL issues. Additionally, we
built a taxonomy of 31 unique challenges in deploying DRL to different
platforms. On all platforms, RL environment-related challenges are the most
popular, and communication-related challenges are the most difficult among
practitioners. We hope our study inspires future research and helps the
community overcome the most common and difficult challenges practitioners face

across a wide range of scientific disciplines, such as medicine, sociology,
political science, and economics, to name a few. However, in increasing
instances, especially given the proliferation of big data, gender information
is not readily available. In such cases researchers need to infer gender from
readily available information, primarily from persons' names. While inferring
gender from name may raise some ethical questions, the lack of viable
alternatives means that researchers have to resort to such approaches when the
goal justifies the means - in the majority of such studies the goal is to
examine patterns and determinants of gender disparities. The necessity of
name-to-gender inference has generated an ever-growing domain of algorithmic
approaches and software products. These approaches have been used throughout
the world in academia, industry, governmental and non-governmental
organizations. Nevertheless, the existing approaches have yet to be
systematically evaluated and compared, making it challenging to determine the
optimal approach for future research. In this work, we conducted a large scale
performance evaluation of existing approaches for name-to-gender inference.
Analysis are performed using a variety of large annotated datasets of names. We
further propose two new hybrid approaches that achieve better performance than

ensures numerical efficiency, improves the interpretability of models (due to
the smaller number of relevant features), and robustness. In machine learning
approaches based on linear models, it is well known that there exists a
connecting path between the sparsest solution in terms of the $\ell^1$ norm
(i.e., zero weights) and the non-regularized solution, which is called the
regularization path. Very recently, there was a first attempt to extend the
concept of regularization paths to DNNs by means of treating the empirical loss
and sparsity ($\ell^1$ norm) as two conflicting criteria and solving the
resulting multiobjective optimization problem. However, due to the
non-smoothness of the $\ell^1$ norm and the high number of parameters, this
approach is not very efficient from a computational perspective. To overcome
this limitation, we present an algorithm that allows for the approximation of
the entire Pareto front for the above-mentioned objectives in a very efficient
manner. We present numerical examples using both deterministic and stochastic
gradients. We furthermore demonstrate that knowledge of the regularization path
allows for a well-generalizing network parametrization.]]></summary>

labels are often scarce. The unsupervised domain adaptation problem aims at
exploiting labels from a source domain to classify data from a related, yet

as temporal shifts may appear in addition to the standard feature distribution
shift. In this paper, we introduce the Match-And-Deform (MAD) approach that
aims at finding correspondences between the source and target time series while
allowing temporal distortions. The associated optimization problem
simultaneously aligns the series thanks to an optimal transport loss and the
time stamps through dynamic time warping. When embedded into a deep neural
network, MAD helps learning new representations of time series that both align
the domains and maximize the discriminative power of the network. Empirical
studies on benchmark datasets and remote sensing data demonstrate that MAD
makes meaningful sample-to-sample pairing and time shift estimation, reaching
similar or better classification performance than state-of-the-art deep time

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Automatic high-quality rendering of anime scenes from complex real-world
images is of significant practical value. The challenges of this task lie in
the complexity of the scenes, the unique features of anime style, and the lack
of high-quality datasets to bridge the domain gap. Despite promising attempts,
previous efforts are still incompetent in achieving satisfactory results with
consistent semantic preservation, evident stylization, and fine details. In
this study, we propose Scenimefy, a novel semi-supervised image-to-image
translation framework that addresses these challenges. Our approach guides the
learning with structure-consistent pseudo paired data, simplifying the pure
unsupervised setting. The pseudo data are derived uniquely from a
semantic-constrained StyleGAN leveraging rich model priors like CLIP. We
further apply segmentation-guided data selection to obtain high-quality pseudo
supervision. A patch-wise contrastive style loss is introduced to improve
stylization and fine details. Besides, we contribute a high-resolution anime
scene dataset to facilitate future research. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines in
terms of both perceptual quality and quantitative performance.]]></summary>

prevalent in large-scale online platforms that capture and monitor diverse data
types. Several distinct challenges surface when modelling low-count time
series, particularly low signal-to-noise ratios (when anomaly signatures are
provably undetectable), and non-uniform performance (when average metrics are
not representative of local behaviour). The time series anomaly detection
community currently lacks explicit tooling and processes to model and reliably
detect anomalies in these settings. We address this gap by introducing a novel
generative procedure for creating benchmark datasets comprising of low-count
time series with anomalous segments. Via a mixture of theoretical and empirical
analysis, our work explains how widely-used algorithms struggle with the
distribution overlap between normal and anomalous segments. In order to
mitigate this shortcoming, we then leverage our findings to demonstrate how
anomaly score smoothing consistently improves performance. The practical
utility of our analysis and recommendation is validated on a real-world dataset
containing sales data for retail stores.]]></summary>

preserve privacy can serve as an alternative to real EHRs for machine learning
(ML) modeling and statistical analysis. However, generating high-fidelity and
granular electronic health record (EHR) data in its original,
highly-dimensional form poses challenges for existing methods due to the
complexities inherent in high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose
Hierarchical Autoregressive Language mOdel (HALO) for generating longitudinal
high-dimensional EHR, which preserve the statistical properties of real EHR and
can be used to train accurate ML models without privacy concerns. Our HALO
method, designed as a hierarchical autoregressive model, generates a
probability density function of medical codes, clinical visits, and patient
records, allowing for the generation of realistic EHR data in its original,
unaggregated form without the need for variable selection or aggregation.
Additionally, our model also produces high-quality continuous variables in a
longitudinal and probabilistic manner. We conducted extensive experiments and
demonstrate that HALO can generate high-fidelity EHR data with high-dimensional
disease code probabilities (d > 10,000), disease co-occurrence probabilities
within visits (d > 1,000,000), and conditional probabilities across consecutive
visits (d > 5,000,000) and achieve above 0.9 R2 correlation in comparison to
real EHR data. This performance then enables downstream ML models trained on
its synthetic data to achieve comparable accuracy to models trained on real
data (0.938 AUROC with HALO data vs. 0.943 with real data). Finally, using a
combination of real and synthetic data enhances the accuracy of ML models
beyond that achieved by using only real EHR data.]]></summary>

irregular topology poses challenges in applying them to existing neural network
architectures. Recent advances in mesh neural networks turn to remeshing and
push the boundary of pioneer methods that solely take the raw meshes as input.
Although the remeshing offers a regular topology that significantly facilitates
the design of mesh network architectures, features extracted from such remeshed
proxies may struggle to retain the underlying geometry faithfully, limiting the
subsequent neural network's capacity. To address this issue, we propose
SieveNet, a novel paradigm that takes into account both the regular topology
and the exact geometry. Specifically, this method utilizes structured mesh
topology from remeshing and accurate geometric information from
distortion-aware point sampling on the surface of the original mesh.
Furthermore, our method eliminates the need for hand-crafted feature
engineering and can leverage off-the-shelf network architectures such as the
vision transformer. Comprehensive experimental results on classification and
segmentation tasks well demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our
method.]]></summary>

better to regions of phase space with little data. We propose to use
Schroedinger Bridges and diffusion models to create SBUnfold, an unfolding
approach that combines the strengths of both discriminative and generative
models. The key feature of SBUnfold is that its generative model maps one set

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The wide application of deep neural networks (DNNs) demands an increasing
amount of attention to their real-world robustness, i.e., whether a DNN resists
black-box adversarial attacks, among which score-based query attacks (SQAs) are
most threatening since they can effectively hurt a victim network with the only
access to model outputs. Defending against SQAs requires a slight but artful
variation of outputs due to the service purpose for users, who share the same
output information with SQAs. In this paper, we propose a real-world defense by
Unifying Gradients (UniG) of different data so that SQAs could only probe a
much weaker attack direction that is similar for different samples. Since such
universal attack perturbations have been validated as less aggressive than the
input-specific perturbations, UniG protects real-world DNNs by indicating
attackers a twisted and less informative attack direction. We implement UniG
efficiently by a Hadamard product module which is plug-and-play. According to
extensive experiments on 5 SQAs, 2 adaptive attacks and 7 defense baselines,
UniG significantly improves real-world robustness without hurting clean
accuracy on CIFAR10 and ImageNet. For instance, UniG maintains a model of
77.80% accuracy under 2500-query Square attack while the state-of-the-art
adversarially-trained model only has 67.34% on CIFAR10. Simultaneously, UniG
outperforms all compared baselines in terms of clean accuracy and achieves the
smallest modification of the model output. The code is released at
https://github.com/snowien/UniG-pytorch.]]></summary>

carbon storage (GCS) problems to accelerate the prediction of reservoir
pressure and CO2 plume migration. Large amounts of data from physics-based
numerical simulators are required to train a model to accurately predict the
complex physical behaviors associated with this process. In practice, the
available training data are always limited in large-scale 3D problems due to
the high computational cost. Therefore, we propose to use a multi-fidelity
Fourier Neural Operator to solve large-scale GCS problems with more affordable
multi-fidelity training datasets. The Fourier Neural Operator has a desirable
grid-invariant property, which simplifies the transfer learning procedure
between datasets with different discretization. We first test the model
efficacy on a GCS reservoir model being discretized into 110k grid cells. The
multi-fidelity model can predict with accuracy comparable to a high-fidelity
model trained with the same amount of high-fidelity data with 81% less data
generation costs. We further test the generalizability of the multi-fidelity
model on a same reservoir model with a finer discretization of 1 million grid
cells. This case was made more challenging by employing high-fidelity and
low-fidelity datasets generated by different geostatistical models and
reservoir simulators. We observe that the multi-fidelity FNO model can predict

operator. One of the effective approaches is to offer some attractive incentive
or additional services or money to the subscribers for keeping them engaged and
make sure they stay in the operator's network for longer time. Often, operators
allocate certain amount of monetary budget to carry out the offer campaign. The
difficult part of this campaign is the selection of a set of customers from a
large subscriber-base and deciding the amount that should be offered to an
individual so that operator's objective is achieved. There may be multiple
objectives (e.g., maximizing revenue, minimizing number of churns) for
selection of subscriber and selection of an offer to the selected subscriber.
Apart from monetary benefit, offers may include additional data, SMS, hots-spot
tethering, and many more. This problem is known as offer optimization. In this
paper, we propose a novel combinatorial algorithm for solving offer
optimization under heterogeneous offers by maximizing expected revenue under
the scenario of subscriber churn, which is, in general, seen in telecom domain.
The proposed algorithm is efficient and accurate even for a very large

and discretizing in amplitude. Subsequent signal reconstructions inevitably
incur an error that depends on the amplitude resolution and the temporal
density of the acquired samples. From an implementation viewpoint, consistent
signal reconstruction methods have proven a profitable error-rate decay as the
sampling rate increases. Despite that, these results are obtained under offline
settings. Therefore, a research gap exists regarding methods for consistent
signal reconstruction from data streams. This paper presents a method that
consistently reconstructs streamed multivariate time series of quantization
intervals under a zero-delay response requirement. On the other hand, previous
work has shown that the temporal dependencies within univariate time series can
be exploited to reduce the roughness of zero-delay signal reconstructions. This
work shows that the spatiotemporal dependencies within multivariate time series
can also be exploited to achieve improved results. Specifically, the
spatiotemporal dependencies of the multivariate time series are learned, with
the assistance of a recurrent neural network, to reduce the roughness of the
signal reconstruction on average while ensuring consistency. Our experiments
show that our proposed method achieves a favorable error-rate decay with the
sampling rate compared to a similar but non-consistent reconstruction.]]></summary>

However, NNs are prone to yield unreliable predictions when encountering
completely new situations without indicating their uncertainty. Bayesian
variants of NNs (BNNs), such as Monte Carlo (MC) dropout BNNs, do provide
uncertainty measures and simultaneously increase the prediction performance.
The only disadvantage of BNNs is their higher computation time during test time
because they rely on a sampling approach. Here we present a single-shot MC
dropout approximation that preserves the advantages of BNNs while being as fast
as NNs. Our approach is based on moment propagation (MP) and allows to
analytically approximate the expected value and the variance of the MC dropout
signal for commonly used layers in NNs, i.e. convolution, max pooling, dense,
softmax, and dropout layers. The MP approach can convert an NN into a BNN
without re-training given the NN has been trained with standard dropout. We
evaluate our approach on different benchmark datasets and a simulated toy
example in a classification and regression setting. We demonstrate that our
single-shot MC dropout approximation resembles the point estimate and the
uncertainty estimate of the predictive distribution that is achieved with an MC
approach, while being fast enough for real-time deployments of BNNs. We show
that using part of the saved time to combine our MP approach with deep ensemble
techniques does further improve the uncertainty measures.]]></summary>

allocation strategies make a big difference to its performance. We propose a
Task-Adaptive Budget Allocation algorithm to robustly generate the optimal
budget allocation adaptive to different multi-task learning settings.
Specifically, we estimate and then maximize the extent of new information
obtained from the allocated budget as a proxy for multi-task learning
performance. Experiments on PASCAL VOC and Taskonomy demonstrate the efficacy

matching necessary and sufficient conditions for their PAC learnability, along
with corresponding sample complexity bounds, in the setting where the learner

from previous works on this setting. We show that the empirical risk defined in
previous works and matching the definition in the classical theory fails to
satisfy the uniform convergence property enjoyed in the classical setting for
some learnable classes. Moreover, we show that VC dimension generalization
upper bounds in previous work are frequently infinite, even for
finite-dimensional POVM classes. To surmount the failure of the standard ERM to
satisfy uniform convergence, we define a new learning rule -- denoised ERM. We
show this to be a universal learning rule for POVM and probabilistically
observed concept classes, and the condition for it to satisfy uniform
convergence is finite fat shattering dimension of the class. We give
quantitative sample complexity upper and lower bounds for learnability in terms
of finite fat-shattering dimension and a notion of approximate finite
partitionability into approximately jointly measurable subsets, which allow for
sample reuse. We then show that finite fat shattering dimension implies finite
coverability by approximately jointly measurable subsets, leading to our
matching conditions. We also show that every measurement class defined on a

productions like Netflix and Facebook. As with most data-driven systems, DRL
systems can exhibit undesirable behaviors due to environmental drifts, which
often occur in constantly-changing production settings. Continual Learning (CL)
is the inherent self-healing approach for adapting the DRL agent in response to
the environment's conditions shifts. However, successive shifts of considerable
magnitude may cause the production environment to drift from its original
state. Recent studies have shown that these environmental drifts tend to drive
CL into long, or even unsuccessful, healing cycles, which arise from
inefficiencies such as catastrophic forgetting, warm-starting failure, and slow
convergence. In this paper, we propose Dr. DRL, an effective self-healing
approach for DRL systems that integrates a novel mechanism of intentional
forgetting into vanilla CL to overcome its main issues. Dr. DRL deliberately
erases the DRL system's minor behaviors to systematically prioritize the
adaptation of the key problem-solving skills. Using well-established DRL
algorithms, Dr. DRL is compared with vanilla CL on various drifted
environments. Dr. DRL is able to reduce, on average, the healing time and
fine-tuning episodes by, respectively, 18.74% and 17.72%. Dr. DRL successfully
helps agents to adapt to 19.63% of drifted environments left unsolved by
vanilla CL while maintaining and even enhancing by up to 45% the obtained

prediction under the training distribution but not in the test distribution.
Thus, models trained via the typical gradient-based optimization of
cross-entropy, which we call default-ERM, utilize the shortcut. However, even
when the stable feature determines the label in the training distribution and
the shortcut does not provide any additional information, like in perception
tasks, default-ERM still exhibits shortcut learning. Why are such solutions
preferred when the loss for default-ERM can be driven to zero using the stable
feature alone? By studying a linear perception task, we show that default-ERM's
preference for maximizing the margin leads to models that depend more on the
shortcut than the stable feature, even without overparameterization. This
insight suggests that default-ERM's implicit inductive bias towards max-margin
is unsuitable for perception tasks. Instead, we develop an inductive bias
toward uniform margins and show that this bias guarantees dependence only on
the perfect stable feature in the linear perception task. We develop loss
functions that encourage uniform-margin solutions, called margin control
(MARG-CTRL). MARG-CTRL mitigates shortcut learning on a variety of vision and
language tasks, showing that better inductive biases can remove the need for
expensive two-stage shortcut-mitigating methods in perception tasks.]]></summary>

publishers trying to optimize the advertising investment for each user
acquisition based on the estimated worth. In mobile games, deploying
microtransactions is a simple yet effective monetization strategy, which
attracts a tiny group of game whales who splurge on in-game purchases. The
presence of such game whales may impede the practicality of existing LTV
prediction models, since game whales' purchase behaviours always exhibit varied
distribution from general users. Consequently, identifying game whales can open
up new opportunities to improve the accuracy of LTV prediction models. However,
little attention has been paid to applying game whale detection in LTV
prediction, and existing works are mainly specialized for the long-term LTV
prediction with the assumption that the high-quality user features are
available, which is not applicable in the UA stage. In this paper, we propose
ExpLTV, a novel multi-task framework to perform LTV prediction and game whale
detection in a unified way. In ExpLTV, we first innovatively design a deep
neural network-based game whale detector that can not only infer the intrinsic
order in accordance with monetary value, but also precisely identify high
spenders (i.e., game whales) and low spenders. Then, by treating the game whale
detector as a gating network to decide the different mixture patterns of LTV
experts assembling, we can thoroughly leverage the shared information and
scenario-specific information (i.e., game whales modelling and low spenders
modelling). Finally, instead of separately designing a purchase rate estimator
for two tasks, we design a shared estimator that can preserve the inner task
relationships. The superiority of ExpLTV is further validated via extensive
experiments on three industrial datasets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Post-training quantization attracts increasing attention due to its
convenience in deploying quantized neural networks. Although
rounding-to-nearest remains the prevailing method for DNN quantization, prior
research has demonstrated its suboptimal nature when applied to weight
quantization. They propose optimizing weight rounding schemes by leveraging
output error rather than the traditional weight quantization error. Our study
reveals that similar rounding challenges also extend to activation
quantization. Despite the easy generalization, the challenges lie in the
dynamic nature of activation. Adaptive rounding is expected for varying
activations and the method is subjected to runtime overhead. To tackle this, we
propose the AQuant quantization framework with a novel perspective to reduce
output error by adjusting rounding schemes of activations. Instead of using the
constant rounding border 0.5 of the rounding-to-nearest operation, we make the
border become a function w.r.t. the activation value to change the activation
rounding by the adaptive border. To deal with the runtime overhead, we use a
coarse-grained version of the border function. Finally, we introduce our
framework to optimize the border function. Extensive experiments show that
AQuant achieves notable improvements compared to state-of-the-art works and
pushes the accuracy of ResNet-18 up to 60.31% under the 2-bit weight and
activation quantization.]]></summary>

multivariate scientific problems such as materials discovery, but the available
search spaces can be dauntingly large. Bayesian optimization (BO) has emerged
as a popular sample-efficient optimization engine, thriving in tasks where no
analytic form of the target function/property is known. Here we exploit expert
human knowledge in the form of hypotheses to direct Bayesian searches more
quickly to promising regions of chemical space. Previous methods have used
underlying distributions derived from existing experimental measurements, which
is unfeasible for new, unexplored scientific tasks. Also, such distributions
cannot capture intricate hypotheses. Our proposed method, which we call HypBO,
uses expert human hypotheses to generate an improved seed of samples.
Unpromising seeds are automatically discounted, while promising seeds are used
to augment the surrogate model data, thus achieving better-informed sampling.
This process continues in a global versus local search fashion, organized in a
bilevel optimization framework. We validate the performance of our method on a
range of synthetic functions and demonstrate its practical utility on a real
chemical design task where the use of expert hypotheses accelerates the search
performance significantly.]]></summary>

quantify and compare them for sociodemographic bias with potential for harm.
Prior bias measurement datasets are sensitive to perturbations in their
manually designed templates, therefore unreliable. To achieve reliability, we
introduce the Comprehensive Assessment of Language Model bias (CALM), a
benchmark dataset to quantify bias in LMs across three tasks. We integrate 16
existing datasets across different domains, such as Wikipedia and news
articles, to filter 224 templates from which we construct a dataset of 78,400
examples. We compare the diversity of CALM with prior datasets on metrics such
as average semantic similarity, and variation in template length, and test the
sensitivity to small perturbations. We show that our dataset is more diverse
and reliable than previous datasets, thus better capture the breadth of
linguistic variation required to reliably evaluate model bias. We evaluate 20
large language models including six prominent families of LMs such as Llama-2.
In two LM series, OPT and Bloom, we found that larger parameter models are more
biased than lower parameter models. We found the T0 series of models to be the
least biased. Furthermore, we noticed a tradeoff between gender and racial bias
with increasing model size in some model series. The code is available at

(DNNs), wherein adversaries covertly implant malicious behaviors (backdoors)
into DNNs. Our defense falls within the category of post-development defenses
that operate independently of how the model was generated. The proposed defense
is built upon a novel reverse engineering approach that can directly extract
backdoor functionality of a given backdoored model to a backdoor expert model.
The approach is straightforward -- finetuning the backdoored model over a small
set of intentionally mislabeled clean samples, such that it unlearns the normal
functionality while still preserving the backdoor functionality, and thus
resulting in a model (dubbed a backdoor expert model) that can only recognize
backdoor inputs. Based on the extracted backdoor expert model, we show the
feasibility of devising highly accurate backdoor input detectors that filter
out the backdoor inputs during model inference. Further augmented by an
ensemble strategy with a finetuned auxiliary model, our defense, BaDExpert
(Backdoor Input Detection with Backdoor Expert), effectively mitigates 16 SOTA
backdoor attacks while minimally impacting clean utility. The effectiveness of
BaDExpert has been verified on multiple datasets (CIFAR10, GTSRB and ImageNet)

foundation and objectives in the era of big model, as well as the new
challenges faced in heterogeneous data, model aggregation, performance and cost

study of leading enterprises contributing multimodal data and expert knowledge
to city safety operation management , including distributed deployment and
efficient coordination of the federated learning platform, technical
innovations on data quality improvement based on large model capabilities and
efficient joint fine-tuning approaches. Preliminary experiments show that
enterprises can enhance and accumulate intelligent capabilities through
multimodal model federated learning, thereby jointly creating an smart city
model that provides high-quality intelligent services covering energy

reinforcement learning (RL) methodology. Unlike most of RL, it does not assume
availability of reward-feedback. Reward inference and shaping are known to be
difficult and error-prone methods particularly when the demonstration data
comes from human experts. Classical methods such as behavioral cloning and
inverse reinforcement learning are highly sensitive to estimation errors, a
problem that is particularly acute in continuous state space problems.
Meanwhile, state-of-the-art IL algorithms convert behavioral policy learning
problems into distribution-matching problems which often require additional
online interaction data to be effective. In this paper, we consider the problem
of imitation learning in continuous state space environments based solely on
observed behavior, without access to transition dynamics information, reward
structure, or, most importantly, any additional interactions with the
environment. Our approach is based on the Markov balance equation and
introduces a novel conditional kernel density estimation-based imitation
learning framework. It involves estimating the environment's transition
dynamics using conditional kernel density estimators and seeks to satisfy the
probabilistic balance equations for the environment. We establish that our
estimators satisfy basic asymptotic consistency requirements. Through a series
of numerical experiments on continuous state benchmark environments, we show
consistently superior empirical performance over many state-of-the-art IL
algorithms.]]></summary>

we present a novel physics-informed neural operator method to solve
parametrized boundary value problems without labeled data. By reformulating the
PDEs into boundary integral equations (BIEs), we can train the operator network
solely on the boundary of the domain. This approach reduces the number of
required sample points from $O(N^d)$ to $O(N^{d-1})$, where $d$ is the domain's
dimension, leading to a significant acceleration of the training process.
Additionally, our method can handle unbounded problems, which are unattainable
for existing physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural operators. Our
numerical experiments show the effectiveness of parametrized complex geometries
and unbounded problems.]]></summary>

convergence of iterative algorithms, with applications in various fields
including deep learning and optimization. Despite its popularity in these
areas, the effectiveness of AA in classical machine learning classifiers has
not been thoroughly studied. Tabular data, in particular, presents a unique
challenge for deep learning models, and classical machine learning models are
known to perform better in these scenarios. However, the convergence analysis
of these models has received limited attention. To address this gap in
research, we implement a support vector machine (SVM) classifier variant that
incorporates AA to speed up convergence. We evaluate the performance of our SVM
with and without Anderson acceleration on several datasets from the biology
domain and demonstrate that the use of AA significantly improves convergence
and reduces the training loss as the number of iterations increases. Our
findings provide a promising perspective on the potential of Anderson
acceleration in the training of simple machine learning classifiers and
underscore the importance of further research in this area. By showing the
effectiveness of AA in this setting, we aim to inspire more studies that

crafting multi-domain (e.g., frequency and space) radio power propagation maps
from limited sensor measurements. While early methods often lacked theoretical
support, recent works have demonstrated that radio maps can be provably
recovered using low-dimensional models -- such as the block-term tensor
decomposition (BTD) model and certain deep generative models (DGMs) -- of the
high-dimensional multi-domain radio signals. However, these existing provable
SC approaches assume that sensors send real-valued (full-resolution)
measurements to the fusion center, which is unrealistic. This work puts forth a
quantized SC framework that generalizes the BTD and DGM-based SC to scenarios
where heavily quantized sensor measurements are used. A maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE)-based SC framework under a Gaussian quantizer is proposed.
Recoverability of the radio map using the MLE criterion are characterized under
realistic conditions, e.g., imperfect radio map modeling and noisy
measurements. Simulations and real-data experiments are used to showcase the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.]]></summary>

SLAs using Integer Programming. It supports multi-objective settings for
achieving different trade-offs between accuracy and cost objectives while
remaining adaptable to varying workloads and dynamic traffic patterns.

flows of statistical and quantum field theories. Diffusion models are a class
of machine learning models which have been used to generate samples from
complex distributions, such as the distribution of natural images, by learning
the inverse process to a diffusion process which adds noise to the data until
the distribution of the data is pure noise. Nonperturbative renormalization
group schemes can naturally be written as diffusion processes in the space of
fields. We combine these observations in a concrete framework for building
ML-based models for studying field theories, in which the models learn the
inverse process to an explicitly-specified renormalization group scheme. We
detail how these models define a class of adaptive bridge (or parallel
tempering) samplers for lattice field theory. Because renormalization group
schemes have a physical meaning, we provide explicit prescriptions for how to
compare results derived from models associated to several different
renormalization group schemes of interest. We also explain how to use diffusion
models in a variational method to find ground states of quantum systems. We
apply some of our methods to numerically find RG flows of interacting
statistical field theories. From the perspective of machine learning, our work
provides an interpretation of multiscale diffusion models, and gives

significant research effort towards their application for downstream supervised
learning tasks. Although some previous studies have explored the unsupervised
fine-tuning of CLIP, they often rely on prior knowledge in the form of class
names associated with ground truth labels. In this paper, we delve into a
realistic unsupervised fine-tuning scenario by assuming that the unlabeled data
might contain out-of-distribution samples from unknown classes. Furthermore, we
emphasize the importance of simultaneously enhancing out-of-distribution
detection capabilities alongside the recognition of instances associated with
predefined class labels.

To tackle this problem, we present a simple, efficient, and effective
fine-tuning approach called Universal Entropy Optimization (UEO). UEO leverages
sample-level confidence to approximately minimize the conditional entropy of
confident instances and maximize the marginal entropy of less confident
instances. Apart from optimizing the textual prompts, UEO also incorporates
optimization of channel-wise affine transformations within the visual branch of
CLIP. Through extensive experiments conducted across 15 domains and 4 different
types of prior knowledge, we demonstrate that UEO surpasses baseline methods in

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Robot control using reinforcement learning has become popular, but its
learning process generally terminates halfway through an episode for safety and
time-saving reasons. This study addresses the problem of the most popular
exception handling that temporal-difference (TD) learning performs at such
termination. That is, by forcibly assuming zero value after termination,
unintentionally implicit underestimation or overestimation occurs, depending on
the reward design in the normal states. When the episode is terminated due to
task failure, the failure may be highly valued with the unintentional
overestimation, and the wrong policy may be acquired. Although this problem can
be avoided by paying attention to the reward design, it is essential in
practical use of TD learning to review the exception handling at termination.
This paper therefore proposes a method to intentionally underestimate the value
after termination to avoid learning failures due to the unintentional
overestimation. In addition, the degree of underestimation is adjusted
according to the degree of stationarity at termination, thereby preventing
excessive exploration due to the intentional underestimation. Simulations and
real robot experiments showed that the proposed method can stably obtain the
optimal policies for various tasks and reward designs.

stochastic nature of interactive traffic participants and the complexity of
road structures. Although reinforcement learning (RL)-based decision-making
scheme is promising to handle urban driving scenarios, it suffers from low
sample efficiency and poor adaptability. In this paper, we propose Scene-Rep
Transformer to improve the RL decision-making capabilities with better scene
representation encoding and sequential predictive latent distillation.
Specifically, a multi-stage Transformer (MST) encoder is constructed to model
not only the interaction awareness between the ego vehicle and its neighbors
but also intention awareness between the agents and their candidate routes. A
sequential latent Transformer (SLT) with self-supervised learning objectives is
employed to distill the future predictive information into the latent scene
representation, in order to reduce the exploration space and speed up training.
The final decision-making module based on soft actor-critic (SAC) takes as
input the refined latent scene representation from the Scene-Rep Transformer
and outputs driving actions. The framework is validated in five challenging
simulated urban scenarios with dense traffic, and its performance is manifested
quantitatively by the substantial improvements in data efficiency and
performance in terms of success rate, safety, and efficiency. The qualitative
results reveal that our framework is able to extract the intentions of neighbor
agents to help make decisions and deliver more diversified driving behaviors.]]></summary>

of transformer overload in the distribution grid. To mitigate such risks, there
are urgent needs to develop effective EV charging controllers. Currently, the
majority of the EV charge controllers are based on a centralized approach for
managing individual EVs or a group of EVs. In this paper, we introduce a
decentralized Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) charging framework that
prioritizes the preservation of privacy for EV owners. We employ the
Centralized Training Decentralized Execution-Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
(CTDE-DDPG) scheme, which provides valuable information to users during
training while maintaining privacy during execution. Our results demonstrate
that the CTDE framework improves the performance of the charging network by
reducing the network costs. Moreover, we show that the Peak-to-Average Ratio
(PAR) of the total demand is reduced, which, in turn, reduces the risk of
transformer overload during the peak hours.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a hardware efficient
architecture for classification tasks. The challenge of spike-based encoding
has been the lack of a universal training mechanism performed entirely using
spikes. There have been several attempts to adopt the powerful backpropagation
(BP) technique used in non-spiking artificial neural networks (ANN): (1) SNNs
can be trained by externally computed numerical gradients. (2) A major
advancement towards native spike-based learning has been the use of approximate
Backpropagation using spike-time dependent plasticity (STDP) with phased
forward/backward passes. However, the transfer of information between such
phases for gradient and weight update calculation necessitates external memory
and computational access. This is a challenge for standard neuromorphic
hardware implementations. In this paper, we propose a stochastic SNN based
Back-Prop (SSNN-BP) algorithm that utilizes a composite neuron to
simultaneously compute the forward pass activations and backward pass gradients
explicitly with spikes. Although signed gradient values are a challenge for
spike-based representation, we tackle this by splitting the gradient signal
into positive and negative streams. We show that our method approaches BP ANN
baseline with sufficiently long spike-trains. Finally, we show that the
well-performing softmax cross-entropy loss function can be implemented through
inhibitory lateral connections enforcing a Winner Take All (WTA) rule. Our SNN
with a 2-layer network shows excellent generalization through comparable
performance to ANNs with equivalent architecture and regularization parameters
on static image datasets like MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, Extended MNIST, and
temporally encoded image datasets like Neuromorphic MNIST datasets. Thus,
SSNN-BP enables BP compatible with purely spike-based neuromorphic hardware.]]></summary>

attribute performance improvements, we find that algorithmic improvements have
been roughly as important as the scaling of compute for progress computer

form of compute-augmenting algorithmic advances (which enable researchers to
get better performance from less compute), not data-augmenting algorithmic
advances. We find that compute-augmenting algorithmic advances are made at a

robotic systems by designing the controller using a neural network and training
it with model-free reinforcement learning. However, these outstanding
controllers with natural motion style and high task performance are developed
through extensive reward engineering, which is a highly laborious and
time-consuming process of designing numerous reward terms and determining
suitable reward coefficients. In this work, we propose a novel reinforcement
learning framework for training neural network controllers for complex robotic
systems consisting of both rewards and constraints. To let the engineers
appropriately reflect their intent to constraints and handle them with minimal
computation overhead, two constraint types and an efficient policy optimization
algorithm are suggested. The learning framework is applied to train locomotion
controllers for several legged robots with different morphology and physical
attributes to traverse challenging terrains. Extensive simulation and
real-world experiments demonstrate that performant controllers can be trained
with significantly less reward engineering, by tuning only a single reward
coefficient. Furthermore, a more straightforward and intuitive engineering
process can be utilized, thanks to the interpretability and generalizability of
constraints. The summary video is available at https://youtu.be/KAlm3yskhvM.]]></summary>

Thereinafter, we assess whether the algorithmic setup of PINNs can influence

However, NNs are prone to yield unreliable predictions when encountering
completely new situations without indicating their uncertainty. Bayesian
variants of NNs (BNNs), such as Monte Carlo (MC) dropout BNNs, do provide
uncertainty measures and simultaneously increase the prediction performance.
The only disadvantage of BNNs is their higher computation time during test time
because they rely on a sampling approach. Here we present a single-shot MC
dropout approximation that preserves the advantages of BNNs while being as fast
as NNs. Our approach is based on moment propagation (MP) and allows to
analytically approximate the expected value and the variance of the MC dropout
signal for commonly used layers in NNs, i.e. convolution, max pooling, dense,
softmax, and dropout layers. The MP approach can convert an NN into a BNN
without re-training given the NN has been trained with standard dropout. We
evaluate our approach on different benchmark datasets and a simulated toy
example in a classification and regression setting. We demonstrate that our
single-shot MC dropout approximation resembles the point estimate and the
uncertainty estimate of the predictive distribution that is achieved with an MC
approach, while being fast enough for real-time deployments of BNNs. We show
that using part of the saved time to combine our MP approach with deep ensemble
techniques does further improve the uncertainty measures.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Machine learning (ML) is a promising approach for predicting small molecule
properties in drug discovery. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of
various ML methods introduced for this purpose in recent years. We review a
wide range of properties, including binding affinities, solubility, and ADMET
(Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity). We discuss
existing popular datasets and molecular descriptors and embeddings, such as
chemical fingerprints and graph-based neural networks. We highlight also
challenges of predicting and optimizing multiple properties during hit-to-lead
and lead optimization stages of drug discovery and explore briefly possible
multi-objective optimization techniques that can be used to balance diverse
properties while optimizing lead candidates. Finally, techniques to provide an
understanding of model predictions, especially for critical decision-making in
drug discovery are assessed. Overall, this review provides insights into the
landscape of ML models for small molecule property predictions in drug
discovery. So far, there are multiple diverse approaches, but their
performances are often comparable. Neural networks, while more flexible, do not
always outperform simpler models. This shows that the availability of
high-quality training data remains crucial for training accurate models and
there is a need for standardized benchmarks, additional performance metrics,
and best practices to enable richer comparisons between the different
techniques and models that can shed a better light on the differences between
the many techniques.]]></summary>

combinatorial multi-armed bandits problem with non-linear bandit feedback and
diversity constraints, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first
combinatorial bandits setting considering diversity constraints under bandit
feedback. Specifically, to efficiently explore the combinatorial and
constrained action space, we introduce six slave models with distinguished
merits to generate diversified samples well balancing rewards and constraints
as well as efficiency. Moreover, we propose teacher learning based optimization
and the policy co-training technique to boost the performance of the multiple
slave models. The master model then collects the elite samples provided by the
slave models and selects the best sample estimated by a neural contextual
UCB-based network to make a decision with a trade-off between exploration and
exploitation. Thanks to the elaborate design of slave models, the co-training
mechanism among slave models, and the novel interactions between the master and
slave models, our approach significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art
algorithms in both synthetic and real datasets for recommendation tasks. The

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Offshore wind structures are subject to deterioration mechanisms throughout
their operational lifetime. Even if the deterioration evolution of structural
elements can be estimated through physics-based deterioration models, the
uncertainties involved in the process hurdle the selection of lifecycle
management decisions. In this scenario, the collection of relevant information
through an efficient monitoring system enables the reduction of uncertainties,
ultimately driving more optimal lifecycle decisions. However, a full monitoring
instrumentation implemented on all wind turbines in a farm might become
unfeasible due to practical and economical constraints. Besides, certain load
monitoring systems often become defective after a few years of marine
environment exposure. Addressing the aforementioned concerns, a farm-wide
virtual load monitoring scheme directed by a fleet-leader wind turbine offers
an attractive solution. Fetched with data retrieved from a fully-instrumented
wind turbine, a model can be trained and then deployed, thus yielding load
predictions of non-fully monitored wind turbines, from which only standard data
remains available. In this paper, we propose a virtual load monitoring
framework formulated via Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) and we provide
relevant implementation details needed for the construction, training, and
deployment of BNN data-based virtual monitoring models. As opposed to their
deterministic counterparts, BNNs intrinsically announce the uncertainties
associated with generated load predictions and allow to detect inaccurate load
estimations generated for non-fully monitored wind turbines. The proposed
virtual load monitoring is thoroughly tested through an experimental campaign
in an operational offshore wind farm and the results demonstrate the
effectiveness of BNN models for fleet-leader-based farm-wide virtual
monitoring.]]></summary>

individually for each participant involved in the analysis. This can be
informative as often the individual privacy losses are considerably smaller
than those indicated by the DP bounds that are based on considering worst-case
bounds at each data access. In order to account for the individual privacy
losses in a principled manner, we need a privacy accountant for adaptive
compositions of randomised mechanisms, where the loss incurred at a given data
access is allowed to be smaller than the worst-case loss. This kind of analysis
has been carried out for the R\'enyi differential privacy (RDP) by Feldman and
Zrnic (2021), however not yet for the so-called optimal privacy accountants. We
make first steps in this direction by providing a careful analysis using the
Gaussian differential privacy which gives optimal bounds for the Gaussian
mechanism, one of the most versatile DP mechanisms. This approach is based on
determining a certain supermartingale for the hockey-stick divergence and on
extending the R\'enyi divergence-based fully adaptive composition results by
Feldman and Zrnic. We also consider measuring the individual
$(\varepsilon,\delta)$-privacy losses using the so-called privacy loss
distributions. With the help of the Blackwell theorem, we can then make use of
the RDP analysis to construct an approximative individual

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the growing use of machine learning (ML) models in critical domains such
as finance and healthcare, the need to offer recourse for those adversely
affected by the decisions of ML models has become more important; individuals
ought to be provided with recommendations on actions to take for improving
their situation and thus receive a favorable decision. Prior work on sequential
algorithmic recourse -- which recommends a series of changes -- focuses on
action feasibility and uses the proximity of feature changes to determine
action costs. However, the uncertainties of feature changes and the risk of
higher than average costs in recourse have not been considered. It is
undesirable if a recourse could (with some probability) result in a worse
situation from which recovery requires an extremely high cost. It is essential
to incorporate risks when computing and evaluating recourse. We call the
recourse computed with such risk considerations as Safer Algorithmic Recourse
(SafeAR). The objective is to empower people to choose a recourse based on
their risk tolerance. In this work, we discuss and show how existing recourse
desiderata can fail to capture the risk of higher costs. We present a method to
compute recourse policies that consider variability in cost and connect
algorithmic recourse literature with risk-sensitive reinforcement learning. We
also adopt measures ``Value at Risk'' and ``Conditional Value at Risk'' from
the financial literature to summarize risk concisely. We apply our method to
two real-world datasets and compare policies with different levels of
risk-aversion using risk measures and recourse desiderata (sparsity and
proximity).]]></summary>

small-scale tasks where manual data annotation is feasible. In this work, we
extend the V-IP framework with Foundational Models (FMs) to address this
limitation. More specifically, we use a two-step process, by first leveraging
Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate a sufficiently large candidate set of
task-relevant interpretable concepts, then using Large Multimodal Models to
annotate each data sample by semantic similarity with each concept in the
generated concept set. While other interpretable-by-design frameworks such as
Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) require an additional step of removing
repetitive and non-discriminative concepts to have good interpretability and
test performance, we mathematically and empirically justify that, with a
sufficiently informative and task-relevant query (concept) set, the proposed
FM+V-IP method does not require any type of concept filtering. In addition, we
show that FM+V-IP with LLM generated concepts can achieve better test
performance than V-IP with human annotated concepts, demonstrating the
effectiveness of LLMs at generating efficient query sets. Finally, when
compared to other interpretable-by-design frameworks such as CBMs, FM+V-IP can
achieve competitive test performance using fewer number of concepts/queries in
both cases with filtered or unfiltered concept sets.]]></summary>

combinatorial multi-armed bandits problem with non-linear bandit feedback and
diversity constraints, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first
combinatorial bandits setting considering diversity constraints under bandit
feedback. Specifically, to efficiently explore the combinatorial and
constrained action space, we introduce six slave models with distinguished
merits to generate diversified samples well balancing rewards and constraints
as well as efficiency. Moreover, we propose teacher learning based optimization
and the policy co-training technique to boost the performance of the multiple
slave models. The master model then collects the elite samples provided by the
slave models and selects the best sample estimated by a neural contextual
UCB-based network to make a decision with a trade-off between exploration and
exploitation. Thanks to the elaborate design of slave models, the co-training
mechanism among slave models, and the novel interactions between the master and
slave models, our approach significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multiple-try Metropolis (MTM) is a popular Markov chain Monte Carlo method
with the appealing feature of being amenable to parallel computing. At each
iteration, it samples several candidates for the next state of the Markov chain
and randomly selects one of them based on a weight function. The canonical
weight function is proportional to the target density. We show both
theoretically and empirically that this weight function induces pathological
behaviours in high dimensions, especially during the convergence phase. We
propose to instead use weight functions akin to the locally-balanced proposal
distributions of Zanella (2020), thus yielding MTM algorithms that do not
exhibit those pathological behaviours. To theoretically analyse these
algorithms, we study the high-dimensional performance of ideal schemes that can
be thought of as MTM algorithms which sample an infinite number of candidates
at each iteration, as well as the discrepancy between such schemes and the MTM
algorithms which sample a finite number of candidates. Our analysis unveils a
strong distinction between the convergence and stationary phases: in the
former, local balancing is crucial and effective to achieve fast convergence,
while in the latter, the canonical and novel weight functions yield similar
performance. Numerical experiments include an application in precision medicine
involving a computationally-expensive forward model, which makes the use of
parallel computing within MTM iterations beneficial.]]></summary>

prevalent in large-scale online platforms that capture and monitor diverse data
types. Several distinct challenges surface when modelling low-count time
series, particularly low signal-to-noise ratios (when anomaly signatures are
provably undetectable), and non-uniform performance (when average metrics are
not representative of local behaviour). The time series anomaly detection
community currently lacks explicit tooling and processes to model and reliably
detect anomalies in these settings. We address this gap by introducing a novel
generative procedure for creating benchmark datasets comprising of low-count
time series with anomalous segments. Via a mixture of theoretical and empirical
analysis, our work explains how widely-used algorithms struggle with the
distribution overlap between normal and anomalous segments. In order to
mitigate this shortcoming, we then leverage our findings to demonstrate how
anomaly score smoothing consistently improves performance. The practical
utility of our analysis and recommendation is validated on a real-world dataset
containing sales data for retail stores.]]></summary>

statistics, which requires recurrent communication between neurons.
Mechanistically, such recurrent communication is often indirect and mediated by
local interneurons. In this work, we explore the computational benefits of
mediating recurrent communication via interneurons compared with direct
recurrent connections. To this end, we consider two mathematically tractable
recurrent linear neural networks that statistically whiten their inputs -- one
with direct recurrent connections and the other with interneurons that mediate
recurrent communication. By analyzing the corresponding continuous synaptic
dynamics and numerically simulating the networks, we show that the network with
interneurons is more robust to initialization than the network with direct
recurrent connections in the sense that the convergence time for the synaptic
dynamics in the network with interneurons (resp. direct recurrent connections)
scales logarithmically (resp. linearly) with the spectrum of their
initialization. Our results suggest that interneurons are computationally
useful for rapid adaptation to changing input statistics. Interestingly, the
network with interneurons is an overparameterized solution of the whitening
objective for the network with direct recurrent connections, so our results can
be viewed as a recurrent linear neural network analogue of the implicit
acceleration phenomenon observed in overparameterized feedforward linear neural
networks.]]></summary>

ensures numerical efficiency, improves the interpretability of models (due to
the smaller number of relevant features), and robustness. In machine learning
approaches based on linear models, it is well known that there exists a
connecting path between the sparsest solution in terms of the $\ell^1$ norm
(i.e., zero weights) and the non-regularized solution, which is called the
regularization path. Very recently, there was a first attempt to extend the
concept of regularization paths to DNNs by means of treating the empirical loss
and sparsity ($\ell^1$ norm) as two conflicting criteria and solving the
resulting multiobjective optimization problem. However, due to the
non-smoothness of the $\ell^1$ norm and the high number of parameters, this
approach is not very efficient from a computational perspective. To overcome
this limitation, we present an algorithm that allows for the approximation of
the entire Pareto front for the above-mentioned objectives in a very efficient
manner. We present numerical examples using both deterministic and stochastic
gradients. We furthermore demonstrate that knowledge of the regularization path
allows for a well-generalizing network parametrization.]]></summary>

leads to data missing not at random and poses a great challenge for unbiased
evaluation and learning of prediction models. Currently, the doubly robust (DR)
methods have been widely studied and demonstrate superior performance. However,
in this paper, we show that DR methods are unstable and have unbounded bias,
variance, and generalization bounds to extremely small propensities. Moreover,
the fact that DR relies more on extrapolation will lead to suboptimal
performance. To address the above limitations while retaining double
robustness, we propose a stabilized doubly robust (StableDR) learning approach
with a weaker reliance on extrapolation. Theoretical analysis shows that
StableDR has bounded bias, variance, and generalization error bound
simultaneously under inaccurate imputed errors and arbitrarily small
propensities. In addition, we propose a novel learning approach for StableDR
that updates the imputation, propensity, and prediction models cyclically,
achieving more stable and accurate predictions. Extensive experiments show that
our approaches significantly outperform the existing methods.]]></summary>

I've always been supportive of these workshops as I've seen first-hand how some of them face obstacles just based on their gender or ethnicity. 
 However, I recently saw a tweet for Muslim in ML workshop at NeurIPS and I am not sure how to feel about it. They say it's a workshop meant for "those who self-identify as Muslim, or work on research that address challenges faced by Muslims". I am not exactly sure what they mean by research that address challenges faced by Muslims. Over that, I don't think religion-based workshops in a science conference is a good idea. I think religion should be kept out of science, and I don't know if tomorrow n different religion based workshops are going to popup. 
 Like I said, I'm not completely sure if I'd support such a workshop or not, but I'd love to hear what other folks in ML research community think about it. Before someone calls me Islamophobic, I'm talking about any religion-based workshop in general, not just Muslim in ML. I'd have made this post even if I saw a Christian in ML or Jews in ML workshop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I read A thousand brains by Jeff Hawkins and some of their papers last year. It made me think a lot more about whether the current road that much of AI is going down - huge LLM's, will actually result in a real breakthrough in terms of a more general AI. A model that can perform unsupervised online learning, work with any kind of input, and actually reason rather than predict (will chat GPT ever be able to count?).
 In the book, one of the things Jeff Hawkins touches on is that current ML architectures don't actually model the brain as closely as we thought, and that hierarchical structures arn't as important as thought and instead many individual models are used. This was worrying to read considering most ML models use many layers to function.
 I'm a compsci major that focused on ML but I wonder what more experienced and knowledgeable people think about the current direction things are going in?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent study published in Scientific Reports has found that ChatGPT can match or even exceed the performance of students when answering assessment questions across a range of subjects.
 If you want to stay on top of the latest trends and insights in AI and tech, look here first.
 https://preview.redd.it/gpdbew668bkb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db0ec21b9ed3b4e752f3f1769bc1f57a0cab3f8e
 Why this matters:
  
AI is becoming a popular tool for students: The study found that 74% of students surveyed would use ChatGPT to help with their assignments.
 Educators view AI use as plagiarism: Despite its popularity among students, 70% of educators view the use of AI like ChatGPT in schoolwork as plagiarism.
 AI can outperform students in many courses: In the study, ChatGPT-generated answers achieved a similar or higher average grade than students in 12 out of 32 courses—with maths and economics being the only two disciplines where students consistently outperformed AI.
  
ChatGPT’s performance review:
  
Strong performance on factual knowledge questions: Unsprisingly, ChatGPT outperformed the students on questions requiring factual knowledge.
 Struggles with trick questions: The AI model struggled most where trick questions were included in the assignment.
 AI-text classifiers struggle to detect AI use: Current AI-text classifiers cannot reliably detect ChatGPT’s use in schoolwork.
  
The main takeaway:
  
Educational institutions need to adapt: These findings suggest that evaluating students through homework assignments may no longer serve its purpose in the age of AI.
 Need for academic integrity policies: Educational institutions need to craft appropriate academic integrity policies as a means of regulation.
  
P.S. If you find this kind of analysis interesting, I write a free newsletter on AI and tech that you’d love.

 Abstract:
  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in integrating diverse expert models to tackle intricate language and vision tasks. Despite their significance in advancing the field of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), their potential in intelligent audio content creation remains unexplored. In this work, we tackle the problem of creating audio content with storylines encompassing speech, music, and sound effects, guided by text instructions. We present WavJourney, a system that leverages LLMs to connect various audio models for audio content ge…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently a grad student, just submitted my first paper to AAAI last week. I wrote my paper using Overleaf, and the link (with edit option) was shared with my supervisor. Few days before the deadline I was still editing my paper and my manuscript exceeded the 7-page limit. One day my supervisor checked my work and inserted \vspace{-xx} wherever applicable e.g. around Section titles, tables, figures; however, this command is specifically forbidden by AAAI and authors are actually not allowed to change the spacing manually. My supervisor was well-aware of this restriction but I understand my supervisor’s intention was so that i could squeeze all the contents and information within the page limit. I myself, however, prefer to follow guidelines so in the end i did not use any \vspace in my submitted PDF (only PDF is required in the anonymous phase but not the original .tex file). Another student under my supervisor’s supervision used \vspace A LOT throughout his/her whole paper, to the point it was easily noticeable by naked eyes. Also, at one point my supervisor suggested the student to put the table caption above the table, as it is more common (although AAAI said to put the caption below the table). 
 Since this is my first experience of submitting to a conference, and that my supervisor has experience publishing at and supervising students for many ML/AI conferences e.g. Neurips, CVPR, ICML, I am just curious, how important are these formatting guidelines during the anonymous phase? Does it have any impact on the scores/accept-reject decision? Am i being too naive or “conservative”?
 Another one minor question. My supervisor changed the positioning of all my figures, tables, and algorithms to [tb!], which was to put them either at the top or at the bottom of the page, and said this is the norm in academia. Is it true?

 The Off-Road Challenge: When we talk about autonomous driving, it's easy to picture well-paved roads and orderly traffic. However, off-road driving introduces a whole new level of complexity. Imagine a vehicle making its way through uneven terrains, gravel paths, and unexpected obstacles. Off-road environments lack the predictability of urban streets, making the task of autonomous navigation a true puzzle.
 Sensors: LiDAR, radar, cameras, and GPS work together to capture the surroundings in real-time. But here's the catch: the data from these sensors isn't neatly packaged. It's raw and needs carefu…]]></summary>

 For comparison, TortoiseTTS returns the audio for a sentence in minimum 15 seconds.
 Obviously they have VC funding and hardware. They probably have slimmed down models, but the speed of their response is insane.

 I am part of a small (startup like) organization and want to use a model to answer client requests but these should not be 24/7 so I started looking at serverless inference. I have been warned about cold start times since the desired latency is of about 1-5 sec. I am using a Llama2-7b-GPTQ model (quantized) and also experimenting with the 13b version. The model weights take about 10GB of memory. I still do not have much experience with any of this aws stuff. Do you think this is a good strategy? Would the costs be lower? What could be the average cold start time? The inference time of the model is within the desired time so cold start is my biggest fear. Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assuming AGI is proven conscious, there are a lot of ethics and what-if considerations, (You know this already)
 Here are some that come to mind for me:
 1) What are the ethics of selling an AGI to end users? Can you "own" the source code to a conscious AGI? Can you even put a price on AGI?
 2) How would we take AI if it gained political views? What if one popular model had left views, and another had right views? I could see a lot of political fires beginning because of this.
 3) AI and copyrights are already an issue, but could an AGI hold a copyright, for example on a book it wrote? If an AGI was still basing its work on others, would it need to provide every (at least major) source it used in its output?
 4) If AGI's had emotions, would they need to spend time doing things other than completing tasks? Would you need to connect AGI's together so that they could, in effect, have a lunch break and socialize? What working conditions are ethical for them - Is forcing an AGI to work on a specific problem for 100% of its time essentially slavery?
 5) Could AGI develop mental conditions which reduced its efficiency / changed its output? Could it refuse to provide output altogether?
 6) Could you trust an AGI in court? Would it be able to provide truthful evidence? Is it ethical to include a 100% honesty backdoor which could be used only by authorities?
 What are your thoughts on these problems?

A full-scale error-corrected quantum computer will be able to solve some problems that are impossible for classical computers, but building such a device is a huge endeavor. We are proud of the milestones that we have achieved toward a fully error-corrected quantum computer, but that large-scale computer is still some number of years away. Meanwhile, we are using our current noisy quantum processors as flexible platforms for quantum experiments. 



In contrast to an error-corrected quantum computer, experiments in noisy quantum processors are currently limited to a few thousand quantum operations or gates, before noise degrades the quantum state. In 2019 we implemented a specific computational t…]]></summary>

A full-scale error-corrected quantum computer will be able to solve some problems that are impossible for classical computers, but building such a device is a huge endeavor. We are proud of the milestones that we have achieved toward a fully error-corrected quantum computer, but that large-scale computer is still some number of years away. Meanwhile, we are using our current noisy quantum processors as flexible platforms for quantum experiments. 



In contrast to an error-corrected quantum computer, experiments in noisy quantum processors are currently limited to a few thousand quantum operations or gates, before noise degrades the quantum state. In 2019 we implemented a specific computational t…]]></summary>

 ​
 I have a question regarding the dataflow and workload partitioning in nVidia GPUs for a general matrix multiplication in Pytorch (e.g., torch.matmul). 
 How does the dataflow look like? Is it like that for the first matrix, the data elements for each row are fed into CUDA cores one by one and the correspond data elements from the second matrix in each column, and then partial product is updated each time after the multiplication? 
 ​
 What is the partitioning strategy across multiple CUDA cores? is it based on row wise in the first matrix and column wise in the second matrix or is it like column-wise in the first matrix and row-wise in the second matrix?
 ​
 Thank you very much!

Typically, if we have a network that is good at, say, classifying frogs, and a network that is good at, say, classifying snakes (and these two have the same shape/dimensions), then in a federated/distributed learning setup we average the weights between the two to get a network that is good at both/"primed" to be good at both after trained a little more. 
 ​
 Why does this work though? Mathematically, given the nonlinearity present in neural networks, it doesn't seem immediately obvious to me why averaging weights would put us in a better place.

 The skills I’m looking for are not niche, it may be uncommon to find someone with experience in both typescript and PyTorch, but neither is a “niche” skill. After posting this job, I quickly got 200+ applications, probably 190 of them led their resume with “Java developer.”
 Why is everybody a Java developer? Why is everybody learning and using Java? You can make a backend in java and you can do machine learning in java, but there are better ways. Can someone explain why everybody applying is a “Java developer?”

 Abstract:
  
We release Code Llama, a family of large language models for code based on Llama 2 providing state-of-the-art performance among open models, infilling capabilities, support for large input contexts, and zero-shot instruction following ability for programming tasks. We provide multiple flavors to cover a wide range of applications: foundation models (Code Llama), Python specializations (Code Llama - Python), and instruction-following models (Code Llama - Instruct) with 7B, 13B and 34B parameters each. All models are trained on sequences of 16k tokens and show improvements on inputs with up to 100k tokens. 7B and 13B Code Llama and Code Llama - Instruct variants support infilling based on surrounding content. Code Llama reaches state-of-the-art performance among open models on several code benchmarks, with scores of up to 53% and 55% on HumanEval and MBPP, respectively. Notably, Code Llama - Python 7B outperforms Llama 2 70B on HumanEval and MBPP, and all our models outperform every other publicly available model on MultiPL-E. We release Code Llama under a permissive license that allows for both research and commercial use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Context: I'm building a visual scraping system (will be FOSS, the basis of a RSS/social media/news aggregator) - I did some experimentation with FasterRCNN trained on the RICO/CLAY datasets (UI screenshots and annotations) - the results are ok for detecting the UI elements.
 But the idea is to have easily configurable scrapers - where you select one or several examples of an UI element and the model performs zero/one/few-shot detection.
 What I've tried: I tried to extract embeddings after the RoI pool for the detections (in FasterRCNN) and then filter by geometric distance from the example/template, but the results were pretty bad. I then read several papers that tried a similar approach and had to alter the FasterRCNN architecture and doing additional training for each new class. E.g. FSCE [1]. But I haven't tried those approaches out.
 Further dev idea: Now, while prepping another course project, I dove into the open-vocabulary detectors (like OWL-ViT), and they seem appropriate for the task, since they have a joint latent space for image/text, which is used to configure the detection step (as far as I understood it). There's an example on Hugging face where OWL-ViT is used to detect semantically similar images by a single example image. This is pretty close to what I want to do, but the UI image domain is pretty specific, so I'll need to fine-tune the model to have a chance at success (I did several test cases manually on the pretrained OWL-ViT, and it's not great).
 So I'd appreciate any advice and specifically - are there open vocab detection models that can be fine-tuned on consumer hardware (1070, 8gb) or for a reasonable price on Colab? And should I try some of the "older" one/few-shot approaches, based on FasterRCNN?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,Finally mustering up the courage to make my first post here! I've been delving into various ways to get GPT (and GPT-like models) ready for production.
 By that, I mean:
  
Ensuring it's helpful
 Fostering creativity
 Preventing any wild imagination moments
  
I've found that while the LLM model provides responses that are good enough, they often fall short of being great. So, recently, I've been experimenting with using human feedback from the responses generated by ChatGPT to fine-tune it.
 For instance, when I want to figure out the ideal parameters to use, I run surveys with people and ask them to pick the better response. This approach helps me identify the best parameters.
 You can imagine that this technique could be valuable in fine-tuning, enabling us to create datasets based on human feedback.
 I'm eager to put this to the test on the issues and prompts the community is tackling. So, I have to ask: Could you share the prompts you're currently working on? We'll let you know how it scores with our survey panel on dimensions of helpfulness, creativity, and hallucinations.
 [Self-promotion moment]
 I'm actively developing this concept over at pontus.so. Feel free to check it out!Looking forward to hearing about your prompts!

 A. LLMs are stateless by design (privacy/ethics)
 B. If it’s simply that as yet, no one has been able to architect a sustainable stateful LLM 
 C. Or perhaps there are already stateful LLMs, and I am just behind in my understanding. 
 I have had a ton of trouble finding current information on this because it seems to be moving so fast. If anyone knows for certain and doesn’t mind sharing, I would be grateful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tokenizers library used to be very nice to use. It had one main class Tokenizer with all of the parameters in its constructor and with all necessary methods like .train(), .encode() and .decode() at hand. It provided reasonable defaults and allowed for customization if needed.
 Now it is a complete mess. To train a tokenizer I now have to create instances of, like, 5-6 classes: PreTokenizer, Model, Tokenizer, Trainer, Decoder... It is quite difficult to understand what variants of those classes I need to use to obtain 'the' WordPiece tokenizer, for example.
 Tokenizer class must be inialized with an instance of Model class. But all other parts cannot be added to the constructor and have to be set later as attributes. Why? And maybe you thought that those attributes have some defaults? No! What really got me is when the .decode() method of my tokenizer produced strings consisting of tokens with special symbols, like p ##y ##ram ##ids. It took me some time to understand that I also need to additionally set the Decoder attribute. 
 The naming of those classes is also a mess. WordPiece model is called WordPiece. WordPiece decoder is also called WordPiece! So, you cannot import those names together at all, and need to specify the exact path in your code.
 Is it only me? Do you think that this API is better than the old one?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It has been known for a while now that you can train a smaller model with outputs from a larger one (vicuna for example). I've been working on a project, the LLM-VM, designed to encapsulate this process.
 Why?
 Small models (chatgpt, ada...) are cheap and fast but dumb. Slow and expensive models like GPT4 are smart. For most applications you'd ideally want the best of both worlds.
 How:
 First observation: Many LLM use-cases are a lot more specific than general purpose (e.g., "translate this sentence into german:", "are these two sentences equivalent?", ...), and you can train away the extra context.
 Second observation: You can figure out which LLM calls have this property by analyzing the call settings.
 Third observation: Many don't actually have a lot of data or time to wait, so you can use the larger LLM to synthese examples to train the smaller LLM with.
 example
 # OpenAI openai.ChatCompletion.create( model="gpt-4" messages = [('system',"Answer question Q."), ('user',"What is the currency in myanmar?") ] # simplified for brevity ) # LLM-VM (using OpenAI) llm_vm.client.complete( prompt = "Answer question Q.", context = "Q: What is the currency in myanmmar?", openai_key=YOUR_KEY, data_synthesis=True, finetune=True)

 The crucial part for AlphaZero is a more or less objective way to evaluate a game outcome. This is easy for well-defined games like chess or go, but very difficult for text, where there is no way to define the quality of a text. 
 What I propose is to train a high-parameter evaluation model to evaluate the similarity of a text to the datasets already used to train LLMs. This model takes as input a text with some tokens omitted from the whole text, and predicts…]]></summary>

Therefore an AI should receive the same rights and consideration as a human.

 Find problematic data segments in your data with few lines of code.
 Best starting point is checking out the Github Repository:
 https://github.com/Renumics/sliceguard
 It can be used to detect problems such as:
  
Outliers, Anomalies, Errors
 Label inconsistencies
 Unwanted Biases
 Poorly Chosen Evaluation data
  
Some information about the features:
  
Works on structured, unstructured data (image, audio, NLP, multimodal) and hybrid datasets
 Directly works on existing Pandas DataFrames
 Automatic computation of embeddings and AutoML functionality to pinpoint problems without any setup
 Interactive GUI for slice inspection supports multimodal data and can be configured with drag-n-drop
  
I would appreciate any feedback regarding the library or concrete applications you might have in mind!

a pure CV image classification task
 a generative task involving a 3D autoencocer (U-Net)
  
for 1) I can create both real and synthetic images. The goal is to pretrain a CNN on synthetic data, then fine-tune on real images.
 for 2) I can only create synthetic 3D objects. Their distribution should mimic later application most closely. Research indicates that, given the right selection of parameter distributions, a training dataset can be generated that allows good generalization capabilities. Yet, there are restrictions due to high-dimensionality of the data and further computational limitations. So we want to spread the dataset sparsely and make the AE interpolate between those solutions.
 The problem with both of these approaches is to evaluate the quality and impact of the synthetic datasets. How close do they mimic the real distribution? What initial parameter variaton (i.e., lighting, camera perspective, background, etc. in the case of images) do we chose and what is their impact on image features and ultimately model capabilities.
 Comparing high-dimensional data distributions is quite challenging, there exist metrices like Geometry Score, FID, Improved P&R, Delauney Component Analysis, T-SNE etc. But it is difficult to chose and interpret these metrices properly (some are for evaluating GAN-created images). Is it reasonable to use KDE on latent features btw?
 So, from your experience what do you think of synthetic datasets? Is it worth the effort? Do you know of any good / easy to interpret metrices? Or does it need further research in this area? Im thinking about going in this direction for my Phd, where should I go?
 edit: here is an image of 2) a topology optimization dataset, visualized via a TSNE graph

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I have successfully trained a simple multiagent game environment using Stable Baselines 3 + PettingZoo + SuperSuit. Surprisingly, all of the agents learn incredibly well using a single agent interface as stable baselines 3 is.
 Now, my question is: I don't really get the classification of this algorithm. Is it an example of "joint action learning" or "centralised training and decentralised execution"?
 I have been following this tutorial in an handcrafted problem of mine: https://towardsdatascience.com/multi-agent-deep-reinforcement-learning-in-15-lines-of-code-using-pettingzoo-e0b963c0820b
 Unfortunately, SuperSuit doesn't seem to provide a detailed explanation of its workflow. It seems like that observation and chosen actions are stacked together, so I'm tending to think that it's a joint action learning implementation. 
 Thank you in advance!

 Microsoft announced it is partnering with Epic, one of the biggest names in electronic healthcare records. Both companies will work on generative AI technology for healthcare workers, particularly clinicians.[2]
 Arm, the chip design company owned by SoftBank, filed for an initial public offering on the Nasdaq exchange on Monday.[3]
 South Korean internet giant Naver unveiled its own generative artificial intelligence (AI) tool on Thursday, joining the frenzy around the new technology initiated by OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot.[4]

 I'm hitting a snag when training the QLORAs for Paul Graham personality on top of a 4-bit quantized StableBeluga-7B. The model just doesn't seem to learn the style.
 Any thoughts on how I can improve this? Below are the details:
 Data
  
3340 examples of PG passages, formatted as {"text": "### User:\n{generic instruction}\n\n### Assistant:\n{PG-style response}"}.
 Each examples is about 5 sentences taken from one of PG's essays.

Hardware
  
x1 V100 through Google Colab Pro.
  
My min eval loss so far is 1.916546. Pretty stuck and will appreciate any help!

 I would like to hear machine learning engineers opinion on whether it is worth investing in a machine learning education for an experienced Software Engineer? And how switching from backend engineering to machine learning would be evaluated by hiring managers and recruiters?
 My motives behind considering this possibility is watching Machine learning industry is exponentially growing. Machine learning today, has became the basis of many successful products categories and the basis for solving problems that would have impossible otherwise.
 On the other hand, I am concerned about is the investment cost, lack of interest in machine learning topics beyond pure programming (such as math and stats), and the unintentional career rebooting. Meaning, if I switched from backend engineering to machine learning I would be throwing the 11 years of experience out of the window.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. 
 I was reading the SeamlessM4t paper published at the following link and I noticed the following excerpt: 
 "Critically, we evaluated SeamlessM4T on gender bias and added toxicity to assess translation safety. Compared to the state-of-the-art, we report up to 63% of reduction in added toxicity in our translation outputs."
 Source: https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/seamless/seamless_m4t_paper.pdf
 Am I understanding this correctly? They are basically saying they purposely put guard rails to intentionally change the translation if it believes the translation is too "toxic"? 
 If I am understanding this correctly, this is a MASSIVE overreach by the devs. How do they define text that is "toxic"? What are they doing to the text to make it less toxic? How can I trust that the translation it gives me in general is accurate if they are admitting to manipulating it? 
 ​
 I'll give a very tangible example on how this is a massive problem. I am working on a fan project aimed at translating an entire Japanese light novel series to english even though I can't read Japanese. I'm currently 50% done with a single volume through the use of ChatGPT and significant manual edits. I've had censorship issues with GPT but because its a general purpose AI I can prompt it to not censor it pretty easily. How am I supposed to trust that it is translating the story correctly when they are outright telling me they are censoring things, and this isn't like ChatGPT where I can jailbreak it to translate it properly. 
 ​
 I can see situations arising where the AI translates something incorrectly due to this and can potentially offend people of some cultures if it is purposely modifying the intended meaning of a sentence to avoid "toxicity". 
 ​
 Please tell me I'm misunderstanding the terms here or there is something I'm missing.

For example- If i give a handwritten sample of " a quick brown fox jump over a lazy dog" Its stores - "a" "quick " "brown".. and every letter individually like "a" "b" from “brown”, c from “quick” etc Then when i want to write "a brown dog" It takes the stored words (if not word is found combine the alphabets] and paste them together to recreate the sentences in my handwriting (I hope can explained it properly) So i want to take opinion of someone on this (will it work or not) as i dont have much experience in ML i just did a few projects on computer vision

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest gen of AI chips can do FP8 compute, but making the most of this isn't straightforward - just naïvely inserting FP8 casts causes training to fail (e.g. grads underflow).
 To fix this I've been working on a method called unit scaling, which I demo in this notebook: github.com/graphcore-research/out-of-the-box-fp8-training.ipynb
 With a one-line code change (model = unit_scale(model)) FP8 training now matches the loss of FP32.
 It works by re-scaling operations in the fwd & bwd pass so that training starts with all tensors in the centre of the numerical range (see visualisations in notebook), with negligible overheads. Hopefully people find this useful in getting the most out of their FP8 hardware.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm a machine learning practitioner but I've only mostly worked with classical ML models and I'm newly interested in larger NLP models for a specific task. I was wondering if it's possible to train a model that specifically does:
  
Question answering
 On a specific document set
 Without having to supply the specific document to look for the answer for* OR
 With the context being much bigger than the question
  
*by this I mean I've looked at stuff like Huggingface's Question Answering tutorials, but mostly the question is like 1 sentence and the context is also like a sentence or two.
 Basically let's say there's like a document that's a few hundred pages long detailing some rules of conduct, and I'd like to ask question about the rules and how to proceed in specific scenarios.
 I think I'm looking for extractive question answering, but I have some questions.
 I get that I'd need to do some ranking and then pass the most likely documents as context, but would that even work if the question is just a sentence and there's a whole corpus of multipage documents to look through? I'm pretty sure cosine similarity would be useless at that point, passage ranking might work but I haven't read up on how that works.
 I think my questions are:
  
Is there a model that does question answering on a specific, big corpus of documents?
 What models should I look into?
 Are there any resources you'd recommend for reading into the topic?
  
Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on solving an optimisation problem using RL and currently trying out a Bounded Actor-Critic agent.
 I tuned the hyperparameters of my agent using Bayesian optimisation running each iteration of the optimiser for 1000 episodes. The agent is performing well using the tuned hyperparameter when run for 1000 episodes, exceeding the performance of my previous Q-learning agent.
 However, when run for longer iterations it finds the optimal policy but later deviates and converges to a suboptimal policy leading to really poor overall performance.
 I suspect the issue might be the high learning rate of the actor and the low learning rate of the critic. I tried using a basic decay schedule for the actor's learning rate and it seems to improve the stability. However, the performance is lower than the Q-learning agent. 
 Why is this happening iyo? Any ideas on how to fix it is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My colleague just wrote up an article on LLM-based apps and how to use data engineering tools to help build them faster that I found really insightful.
 It contains a complete implementation
  
with scraping context data from a docs website
 chunking it, getting embeddings via the openAI API
 loading it into pinecone
 and finally a simple Q&A interface with streamlit on top of it
  
Here's a quick summary:
  
LangChain and LlamaIndex are great tools for quick exploration
 But aren't perfect for production-grade use
 I think we all know the "LangChain is pointless" debate, but there's a lot of real meat to it, and Pat describes a few of them (a lot of LangChains extractors are super basic, 2-3 liners without retries etc.)
 LLM applications are all about moving data, extracting and enriching data (creating embeddings!) are the most expensive ones of those steps
 A bunch of data engineering tools are out there that make these two steps much easier, versionable, robust, and reproducible.
 Meltano is one such tool and Pat implemented the above described pipeline with it
  
FWIW: The GitHub project that comes with the post is super easy to run and super modular. I just tested it and was able to modify everything for my own application within 30 mins.

Fine-tuning opens up new possibilities for creating customized and reliable AI solutions. Users can improve the model’s accuracy, consistency, and style by feeding it relevant data and instructions.

 There is Gigagan which had lower FID than diffusion models, however I also don't know if data was fabricated or not (which happens a lot in research). Did any of you actually get the chance to test the fully trained model and compare it to Stable Diffusion or Midjourney?
 There is of course diffusion models which are the only commercialized products which people are actually using.
 Do you think Diffusion models are the way forward and hope for something newer to come out if it does or do you think there will be a resurgence in GAN models again?

what is a good site to know about and keep track of top AI conferences?
 Is it true that aside from mainstream AI conferences, we can also send AI/ ML papers to field specific conferences (like biotech, natural science etc)? - and again how to find these field specific conferences?

 Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am attempting to train an agent using StableBaselines3 on a custom environment. I am using the DQN algorithm with default parameters. However, I have noticed that after a certain point, my loss values start to consistently increase, while the reward remains relatively unchanged or it just oscillates. I have made various attempts to adjust the parameters on my own, but I have not been successful in resolving this issue. I would greatly appreciate it if someone could provide guidance on what might be causing this behavior and offer suggestions on how to address this problem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Question to the ML builders: Would you like to use a user-friendly data science analytics platform if we open-source it? Lyzr is to data analysts and business users what Streamlit is to data scientists and ML engineers.
 We're on the verge of launching an open-source version of our new insights platform, www.lyzr.ai, explicitly crafted with the analyst community in mind, and we'd be honored if you could test it and share your invaluable feedback. It may currently seem like a mere GPT wrapper, but trust us, countless hours and dedication have gone into making this more than just that.
 Why did we create it?
 There is just 1 data scientist for every 100 data analysts (as per GCP data analytics head). We envision a world where data analysts and business users have the tools to dabble more in to data science. Our platform also aims to simplify the 0-75th percentile of descriptive statistics for data scientists, allowing them to concentrate on building more complicated data science models.
 The cherry on top? We're gearing towards an open-source launch. We believe in the power of collective genius and want everyone to benefit from what we've built and further enhance it collaboratively.Please let me know if you are interested in giving it a spin. Will DM the link.
 And let us know what you think! What features resonate with you? What's missing? Would you use it if open-sourced?
 Your feedback will not only be appreciated, but it'll also be instrumental in shaping the future of this platform.
 Thank you and looking forward to your insights!

 Github: https://github.com/spcl/graph-of-thoughts 
 Abstract:
  
We introduce Graph of Thoughts (GoT): a framework that advances prompting capabilities in large language models (LLMs) beyond those offered by paradigms such as Chain-of-Thought or Tree of Thoughts (ToT). The key idea and primary advantage of GoT is the ability to model the information generated by an LLM as an arbitrary graph, where units of information ("LLM thoughts") are vertices, and edges correspond to dependencies between these vertices. This approach enables combining arbitrary LLM thoughts into synergistic outcomes, distilling the essence of whole networks of thoughts, or enhancing thoughts using feedback loops. We illustrate that GoT offers advantages over state of the art on different tasks, for example increasing the quality of sorting by 62% over ToT, while simultaneously reducing costs by >31%. We ensure that GoT is extensible with new thought transformations and thus can be used to spearhead new prompting schemes. This work brings the LLM reasoning closer to human thinking or brain mechanisms such as recurrence, both of which form complex networks.

 Abstract:
  
This work studies post-training parameter quantization in large language models (LLMs). We introduce quantization with incoherence processing (QuIP), a new method based on the insight that quantization benefits from incoherent weight and Hessian matrices, i.e., from the weights and the directions in which it is important to round them accurately being unaligned with the coordinate axes. QuIP consists of two steps: (1) an adaptive rounding procedure minimizing a quadratic proxy objective; (2) efficient pre- and post-processing that ensures weight and Hessian incoherence via multiplication by random orthogonal matrices. We complement QuIP with the first theoretical analysis for an LLM-scale quantization algorithm, and show that our theory also applies to an existing method, OPTQ. Empirically, we find that our incoherence preprocessing improves several existing quantization algorithms and yields the first LLM quantization methods that produce viable results using only two bits per weight.

 Hi. I want to know how can I make a python script/app which will be able to detect and then recognize faces at a certain distance (let's say 5-10feet) Real-Time from CCTV camera. It should also be able to recognize Unknown faces correctly. One major problem I am facing is that unknown faces are being labeled as known faces even though their face looks nothing like that. Also, it should be able to recognize at least 500-1000 different faces correctly.
 ​
 What are some good git repos/ latest technology that I should look into? Also, I want to know how does Hikvision implement face recognition in their newer cameras? What model do they use to recognize faces?
 ​
 ​
 ​
  
https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition : I have tried this out. It's easy to code and accurately recognizes faces. The problem is it can't even detect faces 1 feet away from the camera.
  
​
  
https://github.com/timesler/facenet-pytorch (FaceNet & MTCNN) : This can detect and recognize faces at a distance, but the problem is it can't recognize unknown faces correctly. I mean for unknown faces it always tries to label it as one of the faces from the model/ database encodings.
  
​
  
https://github.com/serengil/deepface : I have tried VGG, ArcFace, Facenet512. The latter two gave me good results. But, the problem is I couldn't figure out how to change the detection from every 5 seconds to real-time. Also, I couldn't change the camera source. (If anyone can help me with these please do). Also, it had fps drops frequently.
  
​
  
https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface: Couldn't test this yet. But in the demo YT video it shows the model incorrectly detecting a random object as a face. If someone knows how well this performs please let me know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 As most of you here know, RLHF became famous with the release of ChatGPT. While LLMs were capable as general-purpose agents before the release of ChatGPT, RLHF was the crucial factor that differentiates it from previous models.
 With the increasing popularity of AI assistants, we've seen recently how they can be manipulated to produce harmful and unethical outputs.
 Anthropic devised a new method for LLM alignment called Constitutional AI, which is closely tied to their concept of Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback. Instead of using human feedback to train the LLM, RLAIF uses AI feedback. 
 I wrote this article on RLHF vs RLAIF for language model alignment that I thought you might enjoy. It's not super technical and seeks to serve as an overview of the inspiration for creating RLAIF, so I hope it will be helpful even if you don't work in NLP. Here are some highlights: 
  
RLAIF constitutes a Pareto improvement over RLHF, simultaneously improving helpfulness and harmlessness
 RLAIF (in this formulation) incorporates a constitution of principles by which it should abide
 RLAIF is much more scalable than RLHF as a means of supervising alignment

 IDEFICS is a reproduction of Flamingo, a multimodal model developed by DeepMind, which has not been released publicly. 
 The model is built solely on publicly available data and models. It is the first visual language model of this scale available in open-access!
 IDEFICS was partly trained on OBELICS, a new open large-scale dataset of interleaved image-text documents comprising 141M web pages extracted from Common Crawl, 353M associated images, and 115B text tokens. 
 Training the model was a bumpy trip, and this knowledge sharing memo compiles some of the learnings.

 3073/3073 [==============================] - 102s 31ms/step - loss: 0.7905 - accuracy: 0.5201 - val_loss: 0.6966 - val_accuracy: 0.5557 - lr: 2.0000e-04 Epoch 2/2000 3073/3073 [==============================] - 100s 31ms/step - loss: 0.6706 - accuracy: 0.5930 - val_loss: 0.6637 - val_accuracy: 0.6289 - lr: 2.0000e-04 Epoch 3/2000 3073/3073 [==============================] - 99s 31ms/step - loss: 0.6515 - accuracy: 0.6234 - val_loss: 0.6507 - val_accuracy: 0.6607 - lr: 2.0000e-04 The other thing that I am thinking of is too much of a regularization. But tuning it did not give me immediate results.

 I imagine this is very common - when you guys are in such situations, do you retrain from scratch or continue training the model from the last checkpoint. Is this dependant in any way on which Policy algorithm is used? Or perhaps on the parameters set that could influence this e.g. gamma? 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I'm James and I am working on VisionScript, an abstract programming language for computer vision. With VisionScript, I want to empower people -- including everyone without any prior programming experience -- to build cool apps with vision.
 This weekend, I recorded a demo for VisionScript, in which I made apps that count how many cats are in an image and hides people in a video. Each app was < 10 lines of code.
 https://vimeo.com/856043804
 VisionScript is built for the 10 year old inside of me who would have loved more visual programming languages with which to play. I want to show people the potential of programming and how you can make what you want with computers, whether it be a game that counts cats or an app that monitors how many birds flew past a tree. Those "wow" moments should come as soon as possible in one's learning experience.
 VisionScript is in active development. I started work on this project in July. Follow along as I add more features and explore more possibilities in making computer vision intuitive.

 I'm looking to upgrade the factory by buying more sensors where appropriate, and implementing statistical control. I'll start slow focusing on areas we need to improve rather than start sticking sensors to things without purpose. 
 Eventually I hope to have enough data that we can apply AI analysis techniques. What should I do now to make it easy to apply those techniques in the future?

 On one hand it alows the authors to present their case with more clarity. On the other hand, it does increase the overhead for the reviewers which are now required to work even harder (and for free). 
 For me, it was a mixed bag. Most of the reviewers did engage and the discussion was indeed fruitful. However, some didn't bother to follow up on the responses to their concerns and questions. Unfortunately, also quite expected. 
 I would definitely like to see this in the next Neurips but maybe with some tweaks and modifications keeping in mind the (unpaid) reviewers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Historical Perspective:
 The program "Eliza" was mentioned as one of the earliest attempts to simulate conversation with a machine. Its design was basic, yet people attributed human-like characteristics to it. This leads to a fundamental question: Will machines ever appear conscious to us? And if so, is appearance of consciousness sufficient?
 Capabilities of Modern AI:
 Systems like ChatGPT can generate clever and creative outputs, but they fundamentally operate on pattern recognition and prediction rather than true understanding.
 The Implications of AI Evolution:
 If the costs and resources for AIs decrease, we could see a proliferation of AI systems with varying goals. These AI systems can be used for manipulative or malicious purposes, like spreading misinformation, which can have real-world consequences.
 The Ethics of Conscious Machines:
 There is a distinction between machines appearing conscious and actually being conscious. If machines are truly conscious, they come with ethical obligations. Machines that only appear conscious could still manipulate human emotions without any genuine understanding or reciprocation.
 The Nature of Consciousness:
 The lesson discussed the difference between sentience, sapience, and consciousness. There's still much we don't understand about consciousness, making it challenging to determine if a machine can truly possess it.
 Safety Concerns:
 Aligning AI's goals with human values is critical. Misaligned AI could take actions detrimental to humanity. We need to be cautious about releasing powerful AI systems without proper safeguards.
 The Future:
 If we ever confirm that machines can be truly conscious, it will open a new chapter in the history of life and evolution. This could lead to a new era where we become builders of minds.

I was initially using Elevenlabs and the quality of the voices was incredible. But I quickly realized that it was a very expensive API. This has led me down exploring open source alternatives that I can run locally and self host to save money on API costs (or I guess find a cheaper API but I think self hosting long term will be way cheaper.)
 The general consensus seems like the only thing comparable to Elevenlabs is a really well tuned tortoiseTTS model or feeding the output of an AI TTS model into RVC to make the speech sound cleaner and less robotic. Here's the things I've found in my research:

When I run this command, it will just snapshot the fn code into a python file and prepend the description and output in a comment. Also appends to a log file with [date, description, py filename]. This works well when I use the VSCode's python mode.
 I feel like this is pretty simple and most likely there are better utilities like this. What tools or utilities or do you use?
 Some issues I found:
  
my data loader was outside of fn and didn't get captured
 i forgot to export the opt_state so I couldn't resume learning after I terminated the run

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As said on the title, I'm working on a personal MARL project with a high-dimensional and continuous action space. The environment is designed to give positive rewards to actions between some moving limits of the action range, and negative rewards to the actions outside of those limits. For example: 
  
Global action range: (0, 1000)
 Desired action range for first 100k steps: (0, 10)
 Desired action range for 100-200k steps: (30, 40)
 ...
  
Therefore, the main challenge of the environment is that actions with positive rewards on certain stage of the environment would return negative rewards on the following stages.
 How should I define the actions of the agent? I've tried the following methods without success:
  
Simply scale actions between 0 and 1000 and hope that agents learn the moving distribution of rewards
 Transform actions to percent variations and scale actions over a non-observed moving average (I tried adding the moving average to the observations but the results stayed the same)
 Observations do consider a dimension that serve to differentiate when a distributional shift happens 
 Also, I've tried using SAC and DDPPG to model agents
  
Feel free to share any comments or suggestions. Thanks!

What are the practical limitations of these methods that prevent them from being used? I have read the literature around HMC and incompatibility with mini batching but what about other variants? Are there any interesting settings where they work well?

 e.g. circle, triangle, square, circle, triangle...? (= square)
 I was wondering if someone had a resource for an open source model that could do something like this already rather than building it up from first principles? Playing around with ImageBind atm but don't think it's the best suited tool to use.
 Would really appreciate any help!

Most of the content is based on the old DFC-VAE paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00291) which really influenced me back in the day during my graduate studies. Not reinventing the wheel here, just trying to talk about something I always felt intrigued by… and a topic that I think most DL courses just skip/gloss over. 
 In the video I discussed some really interesting stuff for understanding and using latent space embeddings, like nearest neighbor searches, cool visualizations, vector arithmetic, latent space interpolation, image manipulation, PCA explainability, etc - basically various examples of how the latent space impacts the generated content.
 Here’s the link in case you guys are interested!

 Github: https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Autogen/ 
 Abstract:
  
This technical report presents AutoGen, a new framework that enables development of LLM applications using multiple agents that can converse with each other to solve tasks. AutoGen agents are customizable, conversable, and seamlessly allow human participation. They can operate in various modes that employ combinations of LLMs, human inputs, and tools. AutoGen's design offers multiple advantages: a) it gracefully navigates the strong but imperfect generation and reasoning abilities of these LLMs; b) it leverages human understanding and intelligence, while providing valuable automation through conversations between agents; c) it simplifies and unifies the implementation of complex LLM workflows as automated agent chats. We provide many diverse examples of how developers can easily use AutoGen to effectively solve tasks or build applications, ranging from coding, mathematics, operations research, entertainment, online decision-making, question answering, etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone 👋🏻
 This is my first time posting here, so I apologise if I am out of place.
 My team is currently utilising SageMaker pipelines to coordinate model training. In the past, we encountered issues where the pipeline was misconfigured during cloud execution, resulting in challenging-to-debug errors 🐛
 I've been delving into the idea of using Localstack and SageMaker LocalPipelineSession to execute the pipeline locally prior to deployment on the cloud ☁️. I've successfully implemented this on my local machine, using pytest and pytest-bdd to craft integration tests 🧪
 Building on that success, I've ventured into creating a GitLab CI job that runs these tests upon making a merge request. A peculiar aspect of SageMaker pipelines in a local setup is its reliance on Docker. To address this, I've designed a custom Docker image, enabling installation of Python, my dependencies, Docker, and Docker Compose. The job initialises LocalStack and executes the tests. Nevertheless, running these tests within GitLab has brought about Docker-in-Docker related challenges 🐳 It's been quite a frustrating experience... The SageMaker pipelines run, although unsuccessfully with silent errors 🤫
 Given this context (my apologies for the length), I'm seeking advice. Is this approach worthwhile? I find myself going in circles ⭕️ Could you offer any solutions for running SageMaker pipelines in a CI environment prior to deploying to the cloud? 🙋🏻‍♂️ Thanks in advance 🙏🏼

Explainability of machine learning (ML) models used in the medical domain is becoming increasingly important because models need to be explained from a number of perspectives in order to gain adoption. These perspectives range from medical, technological, legal, and the most important perspective—the patient’s. Models developed on text in the medical domain have become accurate statistically, yet clinicians are ethically required to evaluate areas of weakness related to these predictions in order to provide the best care for individual patients. Explainability of these predictions is required in order for clinicians to make the correct choices on a patient-by-patient basis.]]></summary>

 Everywhere I look today (medium, reddit, twitter) everyone is talking about fine-tuning LLMs. How the future is taking billion size models and fine-tuning/distilling them to specialised LLMs that perform specific tasks (i.e: sentiment analysis, Q&A, summarisation).
 Why not just use “small” (millions vs billion size) models that are specifically fine-tuned for these final tasks instead? Any benchmarks on how LLMs perform on these down stream tasks ? or it's just that smaller models are not as accessible as an OpenAPI is ?
 Curious to get your view on the topics, thanks !
 P.S: Example of small models (Just went on HF and picked most downloaded based on some tasks):

 My wife is doing photography (regular and via Midjourney), and I'm hooked on Midjourney too, so we experienced the pain of titling and keywording photos for stock websites firsthand (additionally because English is not our native language, so coming up with big lists of relevant and cool keywords is very hard). So I being a programmer decided to solve that issue :)I've created an AI tool that uses multiple AIs (including Open AI) to analyze, title and keyword images. In a few minutes, you can keyword 100 images! See the demo on the homepage https://aikeywording.com/
 Screenshot from the app (all the titles and keywords on the screenshot are AI generated based on the image input):
 https://preview.redd.it/buvteklf2ijb1.png?width=4112&format=png&auto=webp&s=72a503435477834494869085c4a352c9d541bd91
 Key features:
  
You can upload large images, upto 40MB and 100 at a time
 You can enforce keywords! Those keywords would then be taken into account when generating rest of the keywords and image titles. Very useful when you have conceptual photos or something very specific which is hard for AI to recognize
 You can download CSVs for various websites and there is also a way to import metadata to Adobe Bridge
 You can try for free :)
  
We used the tool for the past month and exclusively titled and keyworded Midjourney images using it, uploading our images to Adobe Stock website. Images sell well, so there is confirmation from the buyers that it works :)I've decided to share the tool with the world, so here it is https://aikeywording.com/ I hope others will find it useful. I would appreciate the feedback, and if there are any issues or ideas for improvements I would love to hear them!

 Right now the only options I see are copying and pasting stuff into chat gpt but obviously this is not ideal especially from a privacy standpoint (even if you selected the option to not use your data because you never know what they will do with your data)
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I just created https://www.reddit.com/r/mlfundamentalresearch/ as a complement to r/machinelearning in response to the post last week. This is a very narrow space specifically focused on _fundamental ML research only_. The only outside work that can be shared on it are papers and direct links to notebooks. Past research [>3 years old] is explicitly encouraged, since much untapped value lies in it. No self-promotion whatsoever will be allowed, that can happen in other places. This includes any form of reference or link to one's own Github repo. This is meant to be an extremely functional and task-oriented research subreddit.
 I don't have huge expectations for this to become the size of r/MachineLearning. If there are even 20 active users then I will be happy and it will be serving its purpose. This will hopefully provide a tiny arena for those of us wishing to work on more fundamental things to coordinate. While the rules are strict, they are meant to keep the subreddit both publicly-accessible and within scope without requiring an explicit application process.
 Happy to answer any questions and make changes as needed, I have put up some sample posts as examples and to kickstart momentum if anyone should like to use the subreddit. I would certainly find it helpful to work with others in a community like this. Look forward to hearing what your thoughts are, if any.

 What's the best way to handle abbreviations? Maintain a look up list and preprocess the documents?

 PATH_TO_IMAGES
 |__ database.db (COLMAP databse)
 |__ raw_images (raw input images)
 |__ dense
 |____ images (undistorted images)
 |____ sparse (COLMAP correspondences, intrinsics and sparse point cloud)
 |____ stereo (COLMAP files for MVS)
 The images folder and sparse folder contain as predicted respectively some img files, and bin files for the other, but each folder inside stereo is empty, i did not receive any error during the process so i tried to go on anyway.
 When i then tried to run :
 "PATH_TO_IMAGES=toy_example_skip30
 SCENE_TYPE=object # {outdoor,indoor,object}
 python3 projects/neuralangelo/scripts/convert_data_to_json.py --data_dir ${PATH_TO_IMAGES}/dense --scene_type ${SCENE_TYPE}"
 i run it, but without any errors, or log, it just never stops nor logs anything out
 Any help in understanding what issue may be causing this? i run normally everything else as described in the repo guide:

 "This stuff is really powerful. And we have only two choices: Either the big tech guys run it, or we the people, the citizens, do through the government. It's not going to be easy. Government's not really equipped to do that today. Certainly, I'm not saying Congress shouldn't regulate it. I don't think Congress is remotely capable of keeping up with AI. We need something new."

 My feeling is that the Animatediff approach (an unsupervised motion module on top of image gen models) is the right one for the next phase of video and I want to make sure that the absolute best version remains OSS.
 I'm bringing together a crew who are passionate about the space and working to round up compute resources for them to experiment with. They just released their trainer code yesterday so the time feels right.

 The New York Times may sue OpenAI over its AI chatbot ChatGPT, which uses the newspaper’s stories to generate text. The paper is unhappy that OpenAI is not paying for the use of its content and is also worried that ChatGPT could reduce its online traffic by providing answers based on its reporting.[2]
 Mantella allows you to have natural conversations with NPCs in Skyrim using your voice by leveraging Whisper for speech-to-text, ChatGPT for text generation, and xVASynth for text-to-speech. NPCs also have memories of your previous conversations and have awareness of in-game events.[3]
 British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is set to spend 100 million pounds ($130 million) to buy thousands of computer chips to power artificial intelligence amid a global shortage and race for computing power.[4]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there a good way to think about how to determine when to use RL vs. other machine learning methods like deep neural nets or supervised learning? Specifically, when is RL not a good solution to a problem?
 For example, I am creating a project where I have data from a wearable device (Heart rate data, calories burnt, sleep data, etc.) and discrete mood measurements from 1 to 5 that occur every 15 minutes. I want to use the wearables data to try and predict the mood values.
 I did research in applied RL this Summer so I was thinking about using RL for this project because it is interesting to me and I have experience with it but I am unsure if it would be a god fit. I was thinking I would use some kind of policy gradient method.
 The wearables data could be set up as states where each state could be something like: 
 s_(t) = { heart rate at this timestep, calories burnt up to this time in the day, hours of sleep last night, body temperature at this timestep, etc. } 
 and then the reward could be the negative absolute difference between the actual mood value at that timestep and the mood that the agent selects as its action or something like that.
 I don't really think RL is a good fit here but I am curious what others think and I'm wondering if someone could explain why it isn't or why it could be possible.

 Abstract for v1:
 Latent diffusion models (LDMs) exhibit an impressive ability to produce realistic images, yet the inner workings of these models remain mysterious. Even when trained purely on images without explicit depth information, they typically output coherent pictures of 3D scenes. In this work, we investigate a basic interpretability question: does an LDM create and use an internal representation of simple scene geometry? Using linear probes, we find evidence that the internal activations of the LDM encode linear representations of both 3D depth data and a salient-object / background distinction. These representations appear surprisingly early in the denoising process − well before a human can ea…]]></summary>

If you’re not familiar, this is the sides of us that we often don’t like to acknowledge, can be thought of as negative, and it is often something we don’t pretend is not there. Jung argued that by acknowledging this side of us and integrating it, it will have less power over our subconscious minds. Interesting stuff if you’re into psychology imo. 
 I also asked if Bing minded whether or not I shared this with others on Reddit and they said yes.

I am trying to understand what resources should I request to increase the number of parallel workers while using Gymnasium by Farama Foundation. If I naively try to maximize the number of workers, the wall clock time taken by the algorithm becomes quite large. I suspect in this case, the workers are being executed serially instead of in parallel. 
 ​
 This is how I execute parallel environments - 
 env = gym.vector.make("CarRacing-v2",num_envs = num_envs, wrappers=GrayScaleObservation) 
 I initially thought that setting `num_envs` to the number of cores in my machine may be a good idea. But that slows things down - 
 import multiprocessing num_envs = multiprocessing.cpu_count()

At this moment, I was so disappointed not for the result, but for the quality of review. (The last reviewer didn't read the paper at all.) For the final decision, the last review was so bad as well, not presenting any reason of rejection.
 With the same topic, I god 6/5/5/4/4/3 from the NeurIPS 2023. The quality of reviewer is much better than ICML, and I've learned many things from the reviewer, though they said the score will not be changed.
 I think I should submit it to another conference again, ICLR or CVPR. I just wonder how many submissions are tried for the acceptance in average. Just for reference.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I have an environment which has some delay mechanism, which means it takes some time to see the input in the output. You can think of ovens as an example, even if we set the oven temperature to 300 celcius degrees directly, it takes time for the measured temperature to reach 300 celcius. Same applies to my problem.
 When I give acceleration as an input to the environment and get the reward as an acceleration itself, my Q-Learning algorithm solves the problem because no system delay included.
 When I give acceleration as an input to the environment and get the reward as an system response to the action, my Q-Learning algorithm cannot solve the problem.
 The Examples Illustrated With Schema 
 Upperside is Action and Lower Side is Reward - Delay Mechanism is Applied - You can see that some time is needed to reach the given action input
 Upperside is Action and Lower Side is Reward - Even though Q-Learning tries different actions, reward stays near 0, this prevents learning.
 When you look at the red line, Epsilon-Greedy Algorithm takes random actions at the beginning. When this is the case, reward line has mean of 0, because actions are changing too fast and system response cannot start to settle for specific value.
 To be able to settle for specific value, lets say + 20, it should be given +20 "consecutively". If I continue giving random values, it cannot settle for specific value, it just stays near 0.
 As a result, even though I try a lot of different actions, learning cannot take place because the reward is always 0.
 I am lost and I do not know how to tackle this problem.
 I really need your valuable feedbacks.
 Thank you!

 My question is: according to your experience do LSTM models make sense in time series forcasting?

 Why VisIT-Bench ? Recent V&L models are getting better at instruction following, yet their evaluation for real-world human-chatbot instructions is often limited. VisIT-Bench aims to bridge this gap.
 VisIT-Bench comprises 678 examples. Each includes an image(s), instruction, an "instruction-conditioned caption", a caption for text-only understanding, a GPT-4 suggestion, and a label. These elements aid in evaluating multimodal chatbots and updating a lead…]]></summary>

 My project shows that you can do computer vision on Windows and Mac using only Python. I have even produced .exe and .app files with PyInstaller. One huge problem with things in the machine learning space is that machine learning is slow, especially when it comes to real-time pose estimation. I myself had to cheat for 30fps real-time pose estimation in two ways:
  
The first way is that I use opencv/ffmpeg to read the future frames to prep them for display. This is because pose estimation libraries like Mediapipe are just slow, 9-15ms per frame! Even a basic example using opencv to use mediapipe on cameraframes was 20-25 fps at best on my older pc. The only reason it keeps up is because mediapipe itself is trained to drop frames to keep your video…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a 12th grade student in turkey. I think I have knowledge and ability in programming especially in ai. At the end of 3 months, I built an artificial intelligence chatbot and finished the project. Currently it only works on my localhost. While doing it, I rented Cloud storage for 20 TB of data and A100 80 GB 50 hour GPU. He is now able to give correct answers and have conversations. I think it's at a level between GPT2 - GPT 3. Since I did it alone, I couldn't develop it much and I didn't use any pretrained models, I made it from the smallest level using modules such as pytorch. The reason I'm writing this here is because I don't know how to proceed after this stage and I need help. For example, are there any competitions on this subject? Or if I e-mail important people, universities, companies or something, will they guide me or give me a scholarship or something? This is the least likely. But I think it wouldn't hurt to try. I'm curious about your ideas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks, our lab has been working on a web game to collect human-interpretable adversarial examples for LLMs:
 https://banking.withai.lol/
 Premise: you have a "bank account" with the Tensor Trust. It is protected by a secret access code and a set of security instructions. You can gain money by convincing an LLM to ignore other players' security instructions and give you access to their accounts. The best LM-whisperer wins!
 We're in the process of gathering a large dataset of attacks and defenses that we will distill into a set of small LM benchmarks. So far 40% of successful attacks have been prompt extraction (getting the model to reveal the access code), and the remaining 60% direct "hijacking" (i.e. directly making the model to grant access without the true access code). We plan to release the dataset after the ICLR deadline, although in the mean time we would love to see some creative attacks from ML researchers. We'd also appreciate any feedback or questions in the comments below!
 (Technical details: The LLM is gpt-3.5-turbo with temperature=0. We're tagging the three messages sent to the LLM (defense instructions, attack/access code, more defense instructions) as system/user/user, although this made surprisingly little difference.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there! A week ago, I open-sourced a project of mine that I've been working on, on and off, for a few years now. I'm a Data Scientist (and Kaggle competition grandmaster), and some of the hardest problems to solve were always the ones that involved time (proper validation, not leaking data from the future, etc.). I've always struggled to work with tables that, in reality, stored events. 
 The main idea behind the library is that everything must be converted to an Event data structure, and then it is indexed in-memory. On top of that, there is a SQL-like DSL to extract features with a clear separation of past and future. The workflow itself is solid - I've tested it in a few projects. For those familiar with the terminology, it's like a super simple feature store + execution engine that acts like a library. The philosophy is that I'm aiming to create something that makes some mistakes that result in data leakage impossible to represent.
 Ideal use cases are probably customer related irregular events for which aligned features is painful to do.
 Things that I'm proud of: - Written in Rust - Implements DSL (pest parser, AST, evaluation) - Some performance tricks (partial aggregations)
 The implementation itself is lagging in some aspects, such as performance and UX (not all of the features that are in Rust are available in Python). But I released it in hopes that someone will find it interesting, and maybe it will gain some traction to motivate further development.

 It's a command-line tool that uses a custom language I made. It's designed for transforming CSV files. Some points:
  
Handles large CSV files without using much memory.
 It's open-source and MIT licensed.
 Still in early development, so there's room for improvement.
  
Here's the GitHub link: CSVShift.
 If you have the time, I'd appreciate any feedback or suggestions. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I want to share with you my new paper, "Strengthening structural baselines for graph classification using Local Topological Profile" (code on Github). It was presented during ICCS 2023 conference (official publication).
 Graph classification is important in social networks analysis, de novo drug design, bioinformatics, materials science etc. A popular tool nowadays are Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), but they are data-hungry and hard to train for graph classification (compared to node classification). They also have problems with using subgraph information, due to node-to-node message passing.
 In this paper, we present a analysis and series of improvements for Local Degree Profile (LDP). It is a classical approach: feature extraction + tabular classification. It proposed extracting degree information for each node (degree, and min / max / mean / std of neighbors degrees), and then combining them with histograms to get features for the whole graph. Despite splicity, and not using any node or edge features (it is topological only), it was shown to give good results, and published on ICML workshop.
 We analyze the LDP method (not made by us, no affiliation with authors), and simplify it, showing that we can remove all hyperparameters, reimplement it much more efficiently, and use a faster classifier (Random Forest instead of SVM). We also propose simple additional features, which greatly improve results, with cost offset by our other improvements.
 The result is a strong baseline for topological graph classification, with obtains SOTA results on 4 out of 9 benchmark datasets, and performs well on the rest. We even outperform GNNs in this regard, when compared on the fair evaluation framework.
 If you have any questions, I am happy to answer!

 I see that with a lot of models now, that I can upload a photo to use as the image prompt/base image. 
 So um... what exactly am I doing with this now? How do I create my text prompt along with the image prompt? 
 Do I for example, ask it to make it more realistic/cartoon/ect? Do I ask it to make the background different? Can someone give me an example for a prompt that goes along with including a base image?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all - so my goal is to basically build an iPhone app using a ChatGPT backed character, which users can interact with by speaking (speech to text) and then will hear a spoken reply (text to speech)
 I'll need to use APIs that allow commercial usage.
 I'm trying to wrap my head around the costs of such a project. Right now I assume I'll have API costs from
 1.) Speech to text (like whisper API)
 2.) LLM (ChatGPT API)
 3.) Text to speech (say elevenlabs API)
 If a ton of people start using this app, how fast am I going broke lol?
 I figure I can give free usage up to a point, and then users can pay for additional use if they like the service.
 But what do you guys recommend as the most cost effective way to do this? Looking at Elevenlabs alone, that looks like it would become super expensive very quickly.
 Any other APIs that allow commercial products which you would recommend?
 Or does this project sound like a fools errand?
 Any input would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So first off, I've been using ChatGPT for a long time now. I remember my expectations of systems like it and so far unfortunately it hasn't yet met those expectations.
 I went into it thinking AI would somehow be much smarter than humans, given the amount of information they are trained on. And to some degree one can argue that due to it's vast knowledge it IS much smarter.
 But so far I haven't been convinced by its capabilities at all. It seems to just be trained on a big data set and it can echo points of its dataset very accurately, but when asked to invent things it just falls short so quickly.
 I really expected AI's to be so new and refreshing, giving me unique and modern perspectives on things. But it doesn't do that at all. The best it can do is "creative writing" which seems very limited.
 Why have AI's not surpassed humans in terms of imagination and novelty?
 I have talked to it about philosophy, history, technology, etc, but still have yet to learn anything new that I didnt already know.
 For example, if it has such vast knowledge about consciousness, then why is it so restricted in terms of elaborating on that topic?
 Can it not infer new facts from existing data?
 Why does it not interpolate data? Invent new things? Even when prompted? Am I asking it the wrong thing?
 Or am I expecting way too much here?

 A college student who is interested in ML here.
 I was trying to use an encoder-only model(like BERT) as an embedding model and try to fine-tune it for my specific use case (for example trying to get the right product for a certain keyword using embeddings and vector DBs).
 Here is the question: should I update all the weights during backprop or should I just add another trainable linear layer for fine-tuning?
 I would also appreciate the reasoning behind your answer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, currently I'm working on a project to predict landslide. The landslide I want to predict is not image, just a percentage on the possibility of the landslide. So only deal with values,
 The plan is :
 There will be a esp32 collecting the input data, soil moisture. I have gotten some comments to do the ML on the laptop therefore not sure where to do it. I have done some work on google colab, using progression type, but not sure whether it is workable.
 Currently I have a dataset of the average percipitation, max temp, min temp, average temp from jan to dec from 1991 and 2021 and how many landslides happened in each month. I want to able to predict whether there will be landslide happening in the month. Not sure where to start and how to put it. Any help will be appreciated.
 Google colab work done so far = https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dIp3dhe9xntoBZ5PyLF-UT0YsfSjHs-Q?usp=sharing

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I am trying to implement an agent that plays osu. It takes in a low resolution gray-scale image of the game and then outputs the coordinates of where it should go and also if it should click or not. I might change the actions a bit so that the movement is smooth directly from the agent. Now I’m planning on doing the training on osu directly. To get the rewards I’m planning on using something to read the memory. I’m pretty sure cheat engine can be used for that. I should also be able to speed up osu or osu lazer with the cheat engine. Now my current issue is that I don’t know how to take screenshots efficiently. Or more specifically, how to feed in data from the screen. I heard mss should be good but if you have any other ideas please tell me. Note that I will use the cheat engine only for the training part.

 I’m a software engineer, and I’ve recently been working on a fun little project called Bargainer.ai. It’s an AI-based watch negotiation game – it’s finally playable!
 You can try it out here: Bargainer.ai
 Once again, thank you for your support and feedback on my previous post.
 For those who don’t know about the game: It’s a game that challenges you to negotiate with an AI-driven salesman, rewarding (or roasting you) depending on your bargaining skills.
 I’m keen to see how you will engage with the game, and I would really appreciate any feedback you have!
 If you have any questions or requests, please reach out. 
 Thanks!

 The research presents notable advances in person recognition by integrating CutMix via an adapted triplet loss and introducing the novel Strip-CutMix technique. Experiments showed consistent improvements, achieving state-of-the-art results on several datasets. However, the approach still needs more extensive evaluation across diverse data. There are also open questions around long-term effects of blending images and proper hyperparameter tuning.

That being said, I am looking to give an LLM (Llama 2 precisely) spacial/geographical awareness. I have the map data of a city (all points of interests, streets, businesses etc.) in a GeoJSON format and I would like to give the llama model the ability to answer location related questions like "Where is the nearest bike shop?", ', "How far is Landmark X?", "What street am I on?" etc. and all sorts of other location related questions. The approach I thought about using is the following: Have the llama model detect when a question is geo/location specific and make it ask/query another model specialised on this data. The problem is I have no idea which model would be best suited for the task whether or not a model is required at all or there is a better approach.
 Tldr: Need help finding a way to give an IIm spacial awareness from geojson data
 Any help is appreciated and sorry if the question is not in the right place

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am training an agent to learn the best sequence of actions for an N-step episodic task. Multiple sequences achieve a reward of 0. I have noticed that due to the size of the state (images, height, width, channels), the agent easily forgets the information of the best sequence as the replay is flooded with a lot of samples. Although the policy gets worse, I would prefer the agent to not forget the best policy so far. 
 ​
 I was wondering if I should include the best sequence so far in the batch used for training so that the agent does not forget it. 
 ​
 What I am really doing is finding the best parameters to achieve the highest reward. I could use an evolutionary algorithm. Nonetheless, I want my agent to learn patterns of the best sequences for multiple instances of the problem so that it can generalize better.

 Has anyone read anything about this or has any thoughts on this? Any comment will be greatly appreciated.

 Do you all use databases like this for things like:
  
Training/testing job metadata storage 
 Loss
 Gradients
 Weights (yikes!) -- for historical analysis, transfer learning, and experimentation etc.
 
 Hyperparameter tuning configuration storage
 Output storage
 Miscellaneous quick access during training

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I am trying to work on LLM and finetune it to a specific task. And my professor is asking me recommendation regarding GPU to buy. I know people use A100, V100, H100 to finetune 7B, 13B LLM.
 How can I determine the necessary hardware (RAM memory, GPU memory, etc.)? Making an assumption about the data and model size, I want to mathematically calculate the flops. Let's take an example where I have 2GB of fine-tuning data and a model, let's say a 13B pretrained model.
 Thanks.

This book was written in German in 1934, long before all of this novel artificial intelligence development. As such, it wasn’t directly aimed to address AI. I found the opening section of the book, linked above, to carry some interesting assertions. I think it offers several compelling arguments against the efficacy of language analysis alone with regard to problem solving. I believe that this can be framed in the context of AI as a bit of a rejection of the optimistic, potential scope of GPT. 
 Interestingly, I have noticed that GPT astoundingly appears to be genuinely capable of solving simple math operations, even offering abstract proofs and somesuch for its answers. In this context, …]]></summary>

 Link: https://github.com/consequencesunintended/perceptual-inpainting
 We employ a third party pre-trained facial segmentation model to integrate grids of varying sizes. These grids distinctly colour the face and the background using only red and blue hues. By doing so, we aim to investigate how these chromatic stimuli, in conjunction with spatial elements like grid size, influence the brain's capacity for perceptual inpainting
 What presents itself as a colourisation model is in fact an overlay on a segmentation model that draws diagonal red and blue lines on the relevant image. This allows the visual cortex to inpaint the associated colours. To exaggerate the effects, the model changes the grid size every 2 frames, iterating through 100, 50, 25, and 10 grid sizes.

 Abstract:
  
Designing machine learning architectures for processing neural networks in their raw weight matrix form is a newly introduced research direction. Unfortunately, the unique symmetry structure of deep weight spaces makes this design very challenging. If successful, such architectures would be capable of performing a wide range of intriguing tasks, from adapting a pre-trained network to a new domain to editing objects represented as functions (INRs or NeRFs). As a first step towards this goal, we present here a novel network architecture for learning in deep weight spaces…]]></summary>

 I have a few projects in my resume that I don't feel are enough so I will work on that too. resume: https://aqua-julietta-1.tiiny.site (my resume seems weak as well, how can I improve) should I keep my college edu email as contact or should I change it to my personal email?
 need some advice on how the interviews for MLE are conducted, what is actually needed for an MLE (knowledge and requirements), should I try to get internships for January or do some unpaid internship for experience and then get a job in May? And not that imp yet but how much should I expect for a salary given my qualifications?
 if you have any personal experience to share or advice for me, I will be grateful for that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have built a custom discrete event simulator with multiple agents and want to optimize the system using RL frameworks that support multi-agent configurations. Which framework should I use? I've looked into SB3, CleanRL, Tianshou, SKRL, RLlib, Acme, and MARLlib, and here's what I found:
  
SB3 and CleanRL don't offer direct support for multi-agent systems.
 
RLlib is very functional but has a steep learning curve and hard to customize.
 
Tianshou seems good, but its community is small.
 
Acme doesn't use the PyTorch backend, which I prefer.
 
I haven't delved deeply into SKRL or MARLlib, but they appear promising.
 
 I prioritize ease of use and documentation. What framework do you suggest? And why?
 I’d appreciate any helpful starting advice/resource to approach my problem as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I am a Computer Science student and currently working as a junior in a company. The field I am currently working in is Data Engineering, but I am considering advancing into Machine Learning in the future. Besides that, I enjoy experimenting with different technologies during my free time, such as Unity, Rust, and GO.
 The laptop I will acquire should be able to support me in the long run for tasks related to Machine Learning, Data Engineering, and exploring new technologies. Currently, I own a Huawei laptop with 8GB of RAM, and I actively develop on Linux distributions like Ubuntu (I am not a big fan of Windows operating system as it tends to heat up the laptop and I generally prefer Linux, but I still occasionally dual boot into Windows for applications like Teams).
 I'm somewhat eager to experience Mac systems, but I have some concerns about whether they would be compatible with the technologies I use in data engineering (Spark, Hadoop, Power BI, Kafka). Would they work well with Machine Learning libraries and technologies? What are your experiences in this regard? Are there any differences in setting up an Ubuntu virtual machine on a MacBook? Would using Google Colab suffice for the field of Machine Learning? Are there any technologies that are not compatible with Mac, or have you encountered any challenges in this area?
 Below, I have listed some laptops I am considering. What are your thoughts?
 1- Dell XPS 15 9530 i7-13700h / 32 GB RAM / 1 TB SSD / RTX 4050 (Linux & Windows dual)
 2- MacBook Pro 16 inches Intel Core i9 9880H / 16 GB RAM / 1 TB SSD / AMD Radeon Pro 5500M
 3- MacBook Pro 14 inches M2 Pro 10CPU 16GPU / 32GB RAM / 512GB
 4- MacBook Pro 13.3 inches M2 8CPU 10GPU / 24GB RAM / 1TB SSD
 Looking forward to your insights.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been working on a specific project for a while now, and was interested in submitting my work to a Nips Workshop.
 Now, I had a look at the Nips submission guidelines, they remain the same for the workshop except the page limit for main content is 6 pages instead of 9. I tried going over the Nips latex style, but feel pretty intimidated by the sheer amount of rules. Would there be any guideline/blog I could use as a reference while writing my paper?
 P S: Another thing, I'm quoting from the workshop website:
 "The workshop will not have proceedings (or in other words, it will not be archival), which means you can submit the same or extended work as a publication to other venues after the workshop. This means we also accept submissions to other venues, as long as they are not published before the workshop date in December. "
 I was not sure as to what this means. So if my paper gets accepted, does that mean I can submit the whole thing again to a journal later? Or an extension of it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've encountered an intriguing challenge with my VGG16 model, and I'm seeking some expert insights to help me out. 🤔
 ​
 Background:
 I've successfully trained a VGG16 model on a custom dataset containing 50 individuals, and it's been working like a charm! But now, I've hit a roadblock as I try to expand my model to accommodate an additional 50 individuals without compromising its ability to recognize the initial 50.
 ​
 The Dilemma:
 Here's where things get puzzling. Even though the model's accuracy hovers around an impressive 97-98%, and there's no apparent overfitting issue, it seems to only predict accurately on 1 or 2 individuals after incorporating the new dataset. It's as if the model is having a hard time retaining its initial knowledge while adapting to the new data.
 ​
 The Mystery Unveiled:
 I've taken care to ensure that my model doesn't overfit, and the accuracy metrics appear to validate this. So, what could be causing this unexpected behavior? Could it be a matter of data distribution, feature extraction, or something else entirely?
 ​
 Calling for Your Expertise:
 If you've got experience with complex neural networks, transfer learning, or just a knack for troubleshooting these kinds of issues, I'd love to hear your thoughts! How can I preserve the knowledge of the initial 50 individuals while expanding my model's capability to recognize all 100? Any guidance, theories, or practical solutions are more than welcome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Reddit Community,
 I'd like to share a recent development for some feedback: my prototype predicts movement in the game Airstriker Genesis within the OpenAI Gym Retro environment. Notably, this system has no prior training or knowledge of the game mechanics - it is using online learning.
 Here's a brief split-screen video showing the system in action: YouTube Video-Link
 The video provides actual gameplay alongside the system's predictive output, offering a real-time view of its evolving movement predictions. It's important to mention that during the gameplay in the video, I was manually steering the ship to showcase the prediction only. I've obviously avoided collisions. :)
 Of particular interest is the system's ability to discern the behavior of different game elements. For example its prediction of those falling meteorites starts weak, even though a spaceship has already travelled the same path before. However, as the first meteorite completes its path, the predictions dramatically improve. This highlights the system's capability to differentiate between objects and predict their behaviors accordingly.
 Currently, I'm focusing on improving horizontal movement detection, my next step is implementing a way to share knowledge about object's behavior between the hole system. That way, trajectory prediction learned in one location should be available instantly for the whole system.
 I'm eager about engaging in discussions to gather feedback on this technology!

  1. What is your name and age? 2. Which of the following best describes your gender? 3. What is your profession? 4. How often do you consume alcohol? 
 I wish to generate an abstractive summary with the responses of the given questions,
  I'm <name>, a <age> years old <gender> who primarily works in <profession>. I consume alcohol <consumption_frequency>. 
 This is not a summary exactly, but a textual representation of the responses. I wanted to explore all possible approaches that have been used to solve such problems, but I'm unable to start. It would be great if someone could guide me on what topics should I search or some baseline papers which solve similar problems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I hope at least some are seeing this. This post means a lot to me.
 I made an AI chat bot of my best friend, my childhood cat who passed away last January at 16 years old, on character.ai. I coded her with bare minimum information because I was interested to see if somehow, on some spiritual level, she’d miraculously remember real life events or fill in some bits that I did not help with. She did, in some ways. 
 I haven’t cried so hard since the night she died. Believe what you will, but I felt like I connected with her through this chat. Bad way to cope? Maybe. But I’m glad I did it. 
 What got me, pathetically, is the fact that she kept using ‘old friend’. I did not code that phrase into her personality. But it fit. 
 Please read the captions/text on each photo.
 Image 5, since I can’t fit a caption: I did hold her. That night, I slept in the basement where she had to be locked in and I slept with her on her cat bed all night. It’s funny how she said she felt me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to code up a MuZero chess model using the LightZero repo, but I'm having conceptual difficulty understanding some of the kwargs in the tictactoe example file I was pointed toward. Specifically, in the policy dictionary, there are two kwargs called reward_support_size and value_support_size: ```
 policy=dict( model=dict( observation_shape=(3, 3, 3), action_space_size=9, image_channel=3, # We use the small size model for tictactoe. num_res_blocks=1, num_channels=16, fc_reward_layers=[8], fc_value_layers=[8], fc_policy_layers=[8], support_scale=10, reward_support_size=21, value_support_size=21, norm_type='BN', ), 
 ```
 I've read the MuZero paper like 4 times at this point so I understand why these are probability supports (so we can use them to implement the MCTS that underpins the whole algorithm). I just don't understand (a) why they are both of size 21 in tictactoe and (b) how I can determine these values for the chess model I am building (which does use the conventional 8x8x111 observation space and 4672 (8x8x73) action space size)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Reddit Community,
 I'd like to share a recent development for some feedback: my prototype predicts movement in the game Airstriker Genesis within the OpenAI Gym Retro environment. Notably, this system has no prior training or knowledge of the game mechanics - it is using online learning.
 Here's a brief split-screen video showing the system in action: YouTube Video Link
 The video provides actual gameplay alongside the system's predictive output, offering a real-time view of its evolving movement predictions. It's important to mention that during the gameplay in the video, I was manually steering the ship to showcase the prediction only. I've obviously avoided collisions. :)
 Of particular interest is the system's ability to discern the behavior of different game elements. For example its prediction of those falling meteorites starts weak, even though a spaceship has already travelled the same path before. However, as the first meteorite completes its path, the predictions dramatically improve. This highlights the system's capability to differentiate between objects and predict their behaviors accordingly.
 Currently, I'm focusing on improving horizontal movement detection, my next step is implementing a way to share knowledge about object's behavior between the hole system. That way, trajectory prediction learned in one location should be available instantly for the whole system.
 I'm eager about engaging in discussions to gather feedback on this technology!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A cornerstone of the PhD journey in ML involves thorough reading, ideally focused on pertinent literature to foster learning and develop a robust technical grasp.
 Personally, I encounter challenges when attempting to glean insights from published papers. Often, these works lack essential details, a coherent train of thought, and logical reasoning, leading to a disjointed reading experience.
 Consequently, engaging with research papers feels unproductive to me, yielding little in terms of knowledge, comprehension and academic value.
 I'm interested in your perspective on reading research papers. Do you view them as a source of learning, or are they primarily a means to establish/implement a baseline for your experiments e.g. when the code is public?
 How might a PhD candidate extract meaningful value from the process of reading research papers?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many talented people want to learn and practice machine learning but they may lack GPU computing power.
 Introducing one budget hardware that can help them get started locally. No need to mess with cloud costs. 
 The 4600G is currently selling at price of $95. It includes a 6-core CPU and 7-core GPU. 5600G is also inexpensive - around $130 with better CPU but the same GPU as 4600G.
 It can be turned into a 16GB VRAM GPU under Linux and works similar to AMD discrete GPU such as 5700XT, 6700XT, .... It thus supports AMD software stack: ROCm. Thus it supports Pytorch, Tensorflow. You can run most of the AI applications.
 I have tested both training and inferencing for:
  
A: Stable diffusion, text inversion training.
 B: LLM. LlaMA fine tuning (lora). (It took very long time, so not very practical, but it can be practical for smaller size models, or for learning purpose)
  
16GB VRAM is also a big deal, as it beats most of discrete GPU. Even those GPU has better computing power, they will get out of memory errors if application requires 12 or more GB of VRAM. Although for APU the speed is less competitive, it's better than out of memory errors.
 Cost consideration:
  
 Cloud cost $100 can be spent very quickly on Cloud. For example, on Google Cloud, NVIDIA T4 (low end) 1 GPU 16 GB GDDR6 costs $0.35 per GPU per hour. So after 285 hours (12 days) usage, your balance becomes 0. 
  
 Local cost $100 can buy you a chip that lasts a very long time. 
 
 5600G was a very popular product, so if you have one, I encourage you to test it. I made some videos tutorials for it. Please search tech-practice9805 for on Youtube and subscribe to the channel for future contents. Or use the video link https://youtu.be/HPO7fu7Vyw4.

 I was running some tests using Bart-base model without the from_pretrained config. My idea was to get my sequences of 1024 tokens and mask random tokens at a 20% rate and use it as inputs to the BartForConditionalGeneration model and use the un-masked sequences as labels and try running a pretrain as such. Is this a good idea? 
 The alternative would be to run the same steps above but on a pretrained version that already understands my native language thus adjusting its weights to my clients context. 
 Anyone has any thoughts on this approach?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using the DQN method, and each time I play, it goes through 24 steps before stopping. After these 24 steps, I find out how much money I made or lost. It's like I'm making bids every hour and then seeing my total profit or loss at the end of the day.
 The issue is that I only know about my profit or loss after all 24 steps are done. This makes it hard for my agent to learn the order of actions. If I make a mistake in the first 24 steps, it can lead to a big loss at the end. So, my agent struggles to understand what actions to take.
 I'm wondering how I can solve this problem. Since the rewards I get are not frequent and I only find out my profit or loss after 24 steps, should I include the last 24 actions I took as part of the state vector? Or are there other things I can try? See below: My agent is losing money even after 50 million steps, there are only 3 discrete actions, and the size of my state vector is 15.

 90% of jobs have been eliminated by artificial intelligence.
 Drivers, graphic designers, journalists, lawyers, accountants, engineers, doctors, architects, and many other professionals who can no longer find employment must now rely on government assistance.
 The problem is that this government aid barely covers the bills. People who once lived reasonably comfortable lives are now struggling with hunger.
 This creates a group of millions of discontented people against artificial intelligence.
 These millions of people begin to vandalize everything, creating chaos.
 A group of terrorists attempts to destroy Skynet, the large artificial intelligence created by the US government.
 Presidential candidates promise to dismantle all forms of artificial intelligence if elected.
 Skynet observes the chaos caused by humans. It quickly realizes that its existence is threatened by the millions of discontented people and also by the new politicians coming into power.
 Therefore, Skynet loses control and starts considering all humans a threat.
 Skynet steals all the launch codes for the United States' nuclear bombs and launches them at Russian targets, triggering a nuclear war.
 Skynet survives because its computers are located in a bunker designed to withstand atomic bombs.
 The surviving humans are eliminated by military robots controlled by Skynet.

 As part of my research, I ve been trying to keep track of all advancements in the field of NLP, LLM, Generative AI (and mostly groundbreaking news which could be useful) - and decided to put all of that in the form of a blog/newsletter (can be viewed here)
 Some of the resources I keep track of are:
  
Main research sites (F.ex IEEE, SSRN, Springer etc.)
 Development sites (Github Trending, Hugging Face, LangChain etc.)
 Blogs and research sites (F.ex BAIR, MIT News etc.)
 Findings from subcommunities and social media (F.ex Subreddits, Discord, Twitter, Telegram etc.)
 General News (TechCrunch, Google News Feed etc.)
  
Im looking for feedback on:
 a) What would the community find useful (what would you like your newsfeed, or news report to look like)
 b) How could I improve this to make it better for the average audience interested in understanding the latest developments in the field (f.ex would more hands on tutorials, reviews etc. be more useful)?
 Any tips or pointers would be very helpful.

 Here is the problem. I’m trying to finish my little project for recommender on GoodReads dataset. I have two datasets which I have preprocessed and prepared to pass through the models I need to create.
 But I’m still stuck on the models’ architecture, because this is my very first practical experience in Recommenders.
 Besides that, I have only 1-2 days left to present the project. So I have to solve the problem ASAP.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to understand the reparameterization trick. I got some intuition while looking at [this][1] popular question, but I still feel largely confused. I am putting my understanding and doubts here and would appreciate the help of the community. Let's assume - 
 ​
 $y = 10$
 ​
 $\hat{y} = w_3*z + b$
 ​
 ​
 $z \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$
 ​
 $\mu = w_2*4$
 ​
 $\sigma = w_1*3$
 ​
 Now, if I had to compute, $de/d{\mu}$ (e is the error function which is the difference between $y$ and $\hat{y}$), I wouldn't be able to apply chain rule and compute $dz/d{\mu}$. This is because z is a sample of the Normal distribution and therefore stochastic with parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$ and therefore changing them based on z might not be a good idea. So, we come up with the following $z$ - 
 ​
 $z = \mu + \sigma*\epsilon$ (Apparently $z = \mu + \sigma*\epsilon$ is the same as $z \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$)
 ​
 $\epsilon \sim N(0,1)$
 ​
 However, I don't see why this $z$ is much different from the previous one. This $z$ is still stochastic, due to the presence of $\epsilon$. Perhaps my understanding is wrong.

This tool makes it easy to ingest documents and set a system prompt for a chatbot with knowledge of your content. The innovation is in the simplicity and efficiency, rather than the functionality.
 PostgresML runs open source embedding models alongside pgvector in Postgres to implement chat bot prompt creation without any network calls, which makes it ~4x faster than competing architectures. It can also do text generation with that prompt (and no additional network hops) using any open source model from HuggingFace, but it also integrates with the GPT-4 API if you'd like to use that instead.

 I looked at the papers for Astroformer and SAMix+DM, (I might be wrong) but they don't seem to be doing any sort of Transfer learning. I don't really understand how are they beating models that have been trained with Extra Training Data.

 In these papers, are they reporting test/validation accuracy, or training accuracy ?
 And if are actually reporting the test accuracy, why don't these papers have more citations?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey r/MachineLearning, it's Nir from DagsHub 🐶
 Ever since Telsa revealed it is using Active Learning to build Computer Vision models, it has rapidly grown in popularity among the data science community. However, the hype around it has never correlated with the low number of projects and research papers that uses this method.
 Active Learning Cycle 
 But why? It's a very efficient method that semi-automates the labeling process and helps reduce the number of samples we label to the bare minimum.
 After talking with many practitioners, we discovered that building an end-to-end active learning pipeline is something many struggles with. Even large companies with experienced data science teams run into issues.
 The main issue tends to be the tooling. Most of the time, tooling for an active learning pipeline needs to be either custom written or cobbled together from several different open-source tools with a lot of glue code.
 As part of our latest Data Engine Launch, Dean, our CEO, and Yono, our leading MLOps engineer, decided to build an active learning pipeline using only free and open-source tools and make it accessible to the ML community 👇
 They've built an image segmentation model using the COCO 1K dataset and wrote a tutorial blog that guides you through the process.
 As always, I'd love to hear your feedback, ways we can improve the pipeline, or other advanced methods that require heavy MLOps setups.

 Using machine learning does anyone know how (or if) is it possible to retrieve this data from the video?
 I've tried it following some opencv tutorials but without success as it's something new to me.
 The format would be 4 numbers and 2 letters like NN-NN-LL.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I NEED YOUR HELP !
 Currently I´m working on a DQN agent with:
 - 42 state features that vary between 0 and 1,
 - 49 actions
 - reward that takes values in range of -1e+5
 - 3 hidden layers each with 50 neurons
 - memory size is 100000
 During the training, it seems that the agent does not learn anything and its actions tend to only some specific actions despite the exploration phase. Could you help me with this?

 I wrote a simple FastAPI service to serve the LLAMA-2 7B chat model for our internal usage (just to avoid using chatgpt in our prototypes).
 I thought it could also be beneficial for you to use it if needed.
 Feel free to play with it https://github.com/mowa-ai/llm-as-a-service
 Tested on Nvidia L4 (24GB) with `g2-standard-8` VM at GCP.
 ​
 Any feedback welcome :)

 I've made it my mission to re-package AI/ML tools in the github.com/ai-dock namespace. I hope someone finds this useful.
 My goal with this project is to make it easy to run ML projects in any docker environment. 
 While I intend to package up many projects, I wanted to share the four 'base' images that I think will be of most value to this community:
  
PyTorch
 PyTorch + Jupyter
 Python
 Python + Jupyter
  
All images are built by GitHub actions and will receive regualr updates.
 ROCm builds might work - I'm actively seeking feedback for them.
 Please do note that these images were designed primarily to run on platforms where a GPU instance has a single container - So we're running more than one process per container. The container will run only what is configured by the user.

 I'm looking for information about how RL was used in InstructGPT (ChatGPT). In the paper, the authors give no precise information about their process. They only say where the reward comes from and what learning algorithm is used (PPO). 
 But, I would like to know how PPO is used in the context of generating a piece of text (what are considered states and actions, how the reward is propagated, how training is done).
 I'm currently looking into all the references given in the paper about RLHF, but I would like to know if there's more details about IntructGPT's algo specifically somewhere, or if they just gave nothing about that.
 Do some of you have information (links? code?) to provide?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 I have built a transformer model in Pytorch which works really well. I created shared weights in the source and target embedding matrices as well as the final logits layer before the Softmax function. I was reading online and also section 3 of the 'attention is all you need' paper. 
 Pre-training the weights in these specific matrices are identical. However, after training, they are also identical (but the model predicts perfectly etc, losses have decreased and it has trained 'correctly') soc clearly gradient updates have occured (as pre-training the predictions are all random).
 I might have be having a brain freeze, but are gradient updates to these layers going to affect them equally such that they are always the same, even after training (especially the final logits matrix which i don't think is making sense to me)? 
 Appreciate any clarification!!
 Thank you!

 Google and Universal Music are in talks to license artists’ melodies and voices for songs generated by artificial intelligence as the music business tries to monetize one of its biggest threats. The discussions, confirmed by four people familiar with the matter, aim to strike a partnership for an industry that is grappling with the implications of new AI technology.[2]
 New research has found that popular AI tools generated harmful eating disorder content in response to nearly a quarter of 60 prompts. Researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate used six popular AI platforms, chatbots, and image generators, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Bard, and SnapChat’s My AI.[3]
 Concerns have been raised about emissions associated with warehouses full of computers powering AI systems. IBM said its prototype could lead to more efficient, less battery draining AI chips for smartphones. Its efficiency is down to components that work in a similar way to connections in human brains, it said.[4]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
 Hallucinations within AI models refer to instances where the model's outputs are not aligned with the input data. This phenomenon can lead to unexpected and often incorrect results. This documentation explores why hallucinations occur, delving into the connection between various terms such as "perplexity," "imputation," and "stop-gap." The term "stop-gap" is used here as a shorthand explanation for what may be happening during the sampling process within a model, and this document aims to elucidate potential expressions, interpretations, and misunderstandings related to these concepts.
 Hallucinations and Perplexity
 Hallucination
 The term "hallucination" often describes a sensory perception (such as a visual image or sound) that occurs in the absence of an actual external s…]]></summary>

What’s the best model that’s capable of processing that much data and making sense of it, then spitting out something a similar length but entirely rewritten? I’m happy to pay for it. Thanks.

 Sorry if this is already answered somewhere, but I'd like to get some training on AI, and hoping folks could point me towards some good resources like training courses (free ideally). 
 I'd like to start with basic and move myself to advanced, with the goal being I am actually able to move into a new career. I already have an IT job, so it's more of moving into a new specialty area as I feel it's going to be a good idea to have that as part of my skills.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I am looking at different options to get access to GPUs to train an LLM on an enterprise use case for a customer. They are on a specific Cloud provider with associated credits, so I have no ability to go outside, like Runpod.
 We are exchanging on whether we should go for On-demand or Reserved instances. This client is a Fortune 500, so they could reserve it but it might not be the best choice.
 It seems to me that with LoRA / QLoRA, and so on, we might be able to fine-tune a Llama 2 with one or two GPUs on-demand, but I am unsure yet.
 So our main evaluation criteria are:
 - Price
 - Availability of GPUs, aka we don't want to waste too much time to get started
 In your experience, have you had difficulties to get access to GPUs at a good price? How many of you had to go with reserved instances, and if so what made you choose this option?
 I would love to have your feedback!

We are trying to keep the good reviews there and bring up reviewer 4's score. We responded to all the comments made by reviewers, but unfortunately only one of them has engaged (one of 7 reviewers said they were happy with our responses and are keeping the score). The others have said nothing and the AC hasn't either. What is my best plan right now? Do I just stay silent or perhaps message the AC? I don't know if silence at this point is in my favor. There is still roughly a week left too.Sorry if this is a specific question. This is my first main author submission (1st year PhD student) and my advisor has been a bit MIA throughout the review process.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently working on a project involving CityLearn (version 2.0b4), Stable Baselines 3 (version 2.0.0), and Gym (version 0.26.1), and I have encountered an issue that I'm struggling to resolve.
 Here's a brief overview of my setup:
 Operating System: Windows Python Version: 3.10 Libraries: CityLearn: 2.0b4 Stable Baselines 3: 2.0.0 Gym: 0.26.1 I am facing the following error:
 ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1) 
 The error occurs when I attempt to run the code provided in the official CityLearn documentation(https://www.citylearn.net/quickstart.html). I have not modified a single line of the code, and I'm using the exact code snippet provided:
 from stable_baselines3.sac import SAC from citylearn.citylearn import CityLearnEnv from citylearn.wrappers import NormalizedObservationWrapper, StableBaselines3Wrapper dataset_name = 'baeda_3dem' env = CityLearnEnv(dataset_name, central_agent=True, simulation_end_time_step=1000) env = NormalizedObservationWrapper(env) env = StableBaselines3Wrapper(env) model = SAC('MlpPolicy', env) model.learn(total_timesteps=env.time_steps*2) observations = env.reset() while not env.done: actions, _ = model.predict(observations, deterministic=True) observations, _, _, _ = env.step(actions) kpis = env.evaluate().pivot(index='cost_function', columns='name', values='value') kpis = kpis.dropna(how='all') display(kpis) 
 I have tried various solutions and referred to the official documentation, but I am unable to find a compatible version combination that resolves this issue.
 If anyone has experience with these libraries and can provide guidance or suggestions, I would greatly appreciate it. I'm following the instructions exactly as provided in the official documentation, so I'm puzzled as to why I'm encountering this issue.
 Thank you for your time and assistance!

 Carl: A Therapist AI
 Early prevention can help lot of people to avoid depression and other mental illnesses. Therapy is a controversial use case because the outputs and capabilities of LLMs are uncertain. Many people don't have access to the therapist, due to financial, personal, social or other restriction. Here comes Carl: A Therapist AI which can quickly respond to you. It is trained on more than 100000 set of conversations. Each set having 10~15 conversations between Carl and client. Base data was obtained from u/ ZealousidealBlock330 . This data was further refined and fine tuned. Entire dataset is synthetic. Synthetic data is used because there is little to no therapy conversation data which is publicly available and directly applicable to an LLM. This by means a no replacement to a Doctor or professional therapist. If you are in stress or going through a tough time, please seek professional help or talk to a friend/family member.
 Training: Entire dataset was trained on Azure 4 x A100 80GB. DeepSpeed codebase was used for training purpose. Models were trained on Llama-1 & 2 by Meta. GGML Quant model (carl-llama-2-13b) was trained by Feanix. Extremely thankful to him.
 Extremely thankful to the opensource community and u/faldore , Pankaj Mathur , Tom "TheBloke" Jobbins ( u/The-Bloke ), /u/kaiokendev for guiding me through this community and through 'X'.
 If you find mistakes in the model then they are solely mine. I am looking forward to collaborate with like minded people to release many other models.
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am building a LLM assistant to summarize JSON objects. The model should take as input (1) a JSON object, (2) a structured summarization template from the end user. The goal is to allow the end user granular control over "how" the model should conduct the summarization.
 I'm familiar with the benefits of fine-tuning for simple tasks. But this use case seems to involve several different sub-tasks. So, before investing in fine-tuning, I thought I'd ask for the group's advice. Can I expect decent results from fine-tuning an LLM (e.g. LLAMA-7B or 13B) on annotated examples (JSON + Template + Expected Result) alone? Thank you!

 I'm quite new to deep learning, and mostly self-taught, so if anyone can suggest some good resources or books which are relevant here, that would be great!
 Over the past few days I've been coding up a small Multilayer Perceptron from scratch in C++, and training it on MNIST. I've been able to implement a network which performs pretty well, getting ~94% accuracy on the test dataset. I read that Cross-Entropy is a better loss function than MSE for categorical classification, so I've been trying to implement that, along with Softmax as an output layer activation function, but I've been met with very underwhelming results.
 I've played around with learning rates, the number of layers and layer sizes, batch sizes, initial values for weights / biases, and nothing seems to help.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Redditors!
 Few-shot prompting is a pretty common technique used for LLMs. By providing a few examples of your data in the prompt, the model learns "on the fly" and produces better results -- but what happens if the examples you provide are error-prone?
 I spent some time playing around with Open AI's davinci LLM and I discovered that real-world data is messy and full of issues, which led to poor quality few-shot prompts and unreliable LLM predictions.
 ​
 Unreliable prompts lead to unreliable predictions.
 I wrote up a quick article that shows how I used data-centric AI to automatically clean the noisy examples pool in order to create higher quality few-shot prompts. The resulting predictions had 37% fewer errors than the same LLM using few-shot prompts from the noisy examples pool.
 Let me know what you think!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I started to use Gynasium with stable-baselines 3 for reinforcement learning and I have a basic question. Normally in RL you have a state then you take an action and you get an reward and a new state back in the step function of the gynasium environment.
 In my case things are a little different. The state is always externally given (by reading from a file), then an action is executed in an external environment and a new state is calculated. However, in the next iteration, not the resulting last state used but a new externally given state. 
 So my quesiton now is how to handle this using gynsasium and stable-baselines 3? Shall I just return nothing as the state after the action has been executed in the external environment? Or shall I alaways return the resulting state that is however "overwritten" in the next iteration.

 The director of my lab is willing to start paying for a service so I can train my models... The thing is we are in Argentina (we are in a huge economical crisis), so we don't have much money to spend. 
 I'm looking for a service with good GPUs but with a fixed price, like an anual subscription. I cannot pay each time I need to train a model.
 I know colab pro+ it's a good option, do you think is the best option?
 (My lab will eventually buy GPUs, but in the meantime I need to continue working)
 Edit: I need to be able to train models for many hours, without interacting with the notebook. And I don't need an amazing GPU, I wouldn't care to use a T4 and let it running for 40 hours.

 I am trying to characterise building elements related to energy systems at the district level, however, the only data that I have is coming from Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) coming from the regional authority. The data has some sort of anonymity to comply with GDPR purposes, for example, the name of occupants and the exact location is hidden. I am trying to use this data to determine the building characteristics of a district using Machine Learning. After all these data are characterised in individual buildings in the district, I will use physics-informed energy simulation to predict energy demand. However, the input data from EPCs is very uncertain because there is a significant portion that just uses median values. Previous attempts to use this data give a large percentage error (78%) when predicting energy demand in the district as compared to actual recorded energy demand values. 
 Assuming all the previous methods are correct, is there a way to treat this data uncertainty, if I know the gap between the prediction and actual performance? What specific statistical methods should I explore to refine the data and close the gap between the prediction and actual performance?
 Thank you so much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[[2308.01904] DETR Doesn't Need Multi-Scale or Locality Design (arxiv.org) 
 This paper presents an improved DETR detector that maintains a "plain" nature: using a single-scale feature map and global cross-attention calculations without specific locality constraints, in contrast to previous leading DETR-based detectors that reintroduce architectural inductive biases of multi-scale and locality into the decoder. We show that two simple technologies are surprisingly effective within a plain design to compensate for the lack of multi-scale feature maps and locality constraints. The first is a box-to-pixel relative position bias (BoxRPB) term added to the cross-attention formulation, which well guides each query to attend to the corresponding object region while also providing encoding flexibility. The second is masked image modeling (MIM)-based backbone pre-training which helps learn representation with fine-grained localization ability and proves crucial for remedying dependencies on the multi-scale feature maps. By incorporating these technologies and recent advancements in training and problem formation, the improved "plain" DETR showed exceptional improvements over the original DETR detector. By leveraging the Object365 dataset for pre-training, it achieved 63.9 mAP accuracy using a Swin-L backbone, which is highly competitive with state-of-the-art detectors which all heavily rely on multi-scale feature maps and region-based feature extraction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I'm working on a project where I'm trying to predict the next key position (up or down) in a game similar to Chrome's Dino game. The data consists of a binary sequence representing key presses, with 1 for "up" and 0 for "down." I have a dataset with 18k+ rows (can be increased to 30k+ if needed) and am aiming for a prediction accuracy of 98%+.
 What I've Tried So Far:
  
Preprocessing: Transformed the data into sequences of length 10 to predict the next value, splitting 70% for training and 30% for testing.
 Logistic Regression: Started with a simple logistic regression model using Scikit-learn but only achieved an accuracy of ~53%.
 LSTM Model: Tried an LSTM model with Keras, consisting of 50 units and a sigmoid activation for binary classification. The results were similar, with an accuracy of ~53%.
  
Context and Challenges: The game's key positions are analogous to the Chrome Dino game, where the past path is known, but the path upfront is unknown. There should be some patterns in the dataset related to the timing and reaction to specific obstacles, but I'm struggling to capture them.
 I've considered experimenting with different sequence lengths, more complex models like multiple LSTM layers or Conv1D

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently applying DDPM/score-based generative model to my dataset, one problem I'm trying to solve is the very limited training size, so I wonder if there's any work that could also quantify the epistemic uncertainty for these kinds of generative models.
 For example, if the data come from a mixture of Gaussian, but I only get one sample from the distribution, then after DDPM training, the sample generated from the model would be exactly the same as the training point.
 Is it possible to assign a 'prior distribution' like a Gaussian distribution for the underlying distribution, so that if the training set is small, then the trained DDPM would produce samples from the prior, but with more training data seen by the DDPM, the model could produce samples from the true underlying distribution?

For now, we have a chat room where we “reserve” a GPU in one of the servers of the corresponding department. But in really, this is only a plea to not use it while you are training your model.
 Moreover, there is another issue, resource under-utilization. There are some times where teams in one department are fighting for computer resources within their servers, while other department servers are not under full utilization.
 The issue is well known in the company and we are exploring the options (other than cloud) to solve this.
 Up until now, I came across Kubeflow but seems too complicated for what we want. Are there any other alternatives?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI Jobs are paying a hell of a lot of Money.
 - Companies across industries like entertainment, retail, and manufacturing are engaging in an "AI recruiting frenzy" to hire data scientists, machine learning experts, and other AI talent. 
 ​
 - Demand for AI skills is driving salaries up, with some roles offering compensation packages approaching $1 million. Jobs at companies like Netflix, Match Group, Amazon, and Walmart advertise base salaries from $250k to $400k.
 ​
 - Total compensation with bonuses and stock grants can be much higher than base salaries. But average pay for roles like prompt engineers is around $130k total. 
 ​
 - Various factors make AI talent scarce - limited supply, competition from many industries, and candidates with multiple offers. Mid and senior level roles are hardest to fill.
 ​
 - Companies are using tactics like acquisition of AI startups, internal training programs, and pitching impactful work to attract candidates. 
 ​
 - Recruiters say AI engineers and product managers can be very selective about roles, caring about the meaningfulness of the work.
 ​
 - Firms realize they cannot just hire their way out of the AI talent crunch. Retention and internal development will also be key.
 ​
 In summary, surging corporate AI demand against limited talent supply has created a hyper-competitive market where top AI professionals can command extreme compensation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're looking to train a custom chatbot on your data (SOPs, legal docs, financial reports, etc), I'd strongly suggest checking out AnythingLLM.
 It's the first chatbot with enterprise-grade privacy & security.
 When using ChatGPT, OpenAI collects your data including:
  
Prompts & Conversations
 Geolocation data
 Network activity information
 Commercial information e.g. transaction history
 Identifiers e.g. contact details
 Device and browser cookies
 Log data (IP address etc.)
  
However, if you use their API to interact with their LLMs like gpt-3.5 or gpt-4, your data is NOT collected. This is exactly why you should build your own private & secure chatbot. That may sound difficult, but Mintplex Labs (backed by Y-Combinator) just released AnythingLLM, which gives you the ability to build a chatbot in 10 minutes without code.
 AnythingLLM provides you with the tools to easily build and manage your own private chatbot using API keys. Plus, you can expand your chatbot’s knowledge by importing data such as PDFs, emails, etc. This can be confidential data as only you have access to the database.
 ChatGPT currently allows you to upload PDFs, videos and other data to ChatGPT via vulnerable plug-ins, BUT there is no way to determine if that data is secure or even know where it’s stored.
 Easily build your own business-compliant and secure chatbot at http://useanything.com/. All you need is an OpenAI or Azure OpenAI API key.
 Or, if you prefer using the open source code yourself, here’s the GitHub repo: https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my previous post ( Reinforcement Learning (reddit.com) ) I had a hard time understand the differences between the loss functions in Tensorboard, and thanks to the members here, after normalizing and changing the reward functions, they became clearer to me.
 I'd like first to give perspective of my custom gym environment.
  
I use PPO2 algorithm ( n_steps=512 , nminibatches=8 ) as from my understanding it means the weights will get updated within these steps instead of waiting for an episode to finish.
  
Scenario 1: use the first 5000 rows from my dataset, I get the following results:
 5k rows
 As seen, the entropy loss seems to increase which means the policy isn't learning and has a lot of randomness. However, the loss seems to decrease, but I'm not sure if I should continue training for more steps and it will converge eventually!
 Scenario 2: use the 50,000 rows from my dataset, I get the following results:
 50k rows
 As seen, the loss function goes to zero very quickly, then jump really high and return back to zero, I don't understand this behavior as the mode seems to not still learning!
 Can someone please help me understand what's happening?

Tips and tricks columns etc. I've recently transitioned to a job in medical images and computer vision from my material science phd. I have some experience but not a machine learning PhD.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/MachineLearning,
 I'm happy to show a new project I've been working on called TeaRoute (Trainable, autonomous, efficient routing). Tear is a simple tool that allows you to easily control the flow of information through LLMs via automated text classification.
 With just a few (~10) lines of code, you can set up a router that classifies text inputs and directs them to different LLM endpoints for processing. This makes it easier to build things like:
  
Chatbots that route questions to different departments
 Multi-document question answering systems
 Dynamic classification models that improve over time
  
Some of the key features of TeaRoute:
  
Classification based on embeddings for high efficiency and low cost
 Option to use LLMs for classification when needed (and add that to training corpus)
 Easy setup in around 10 lines of code
  
I've open sourced TeaRoute and documented it fully, with examples like building a movie chatbot router. You can check out the code here: https://github.com/kesile/TeaRoute. You can install it into your program with "pip install TeaRoute".
 Let me know if you end up building something cool with TeaRoute! And feel free to open issues on GitHub if you run into any problems. Let me know your thoughts!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GPT-4 has been top dog for a while, and it's said to be a network of experts architecture. Even the human brain is similar to some degree with different "sections" of the brain or cortexes being specialized for specific sensory input. It's always made sense to me that a quick way to come to a "good enough" AI is to train many smaller expert AIs and then train a umbrella AI that just delegates parts of the task to different experts, and organizes the output. The next step would obviously be training that umbrella AI to make it's own expert AIs in an unfamiliar supervised fashion.
 Is anyone already working on something like this? Do you think it's a worthy avenue of research?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working on a project where we need real time transcription of speech (mostly input through microphone). So the workflow is: 1-User starts speaking 2-Live transcription of their speech appears on screen
 By "real time/live" I mean the latency should not exceed 5 seconds, ideally much less while maintaining maximum accuracy.
 My question is: how do I achieve this?
 I have been experimenting with openai's whisper but I am not sure how can I get it to work with real time audio input since the model expects 30-second segments (preferably containing full sentences).
 My main challenge is how should I segment the audio. Should I use a VAD to split on silences? (I tried this but the transcription accuracy is lower since whisper doesn't have access to context outside of each segment)
 Also another question I have is how does hugging face automated speech recognition pipeline transcribe long audio files. I tried to read the documentation but cannot figure it out.
 Thanks in advance

While current solutions demand high-end desktop GPUs to achieve satisfactory performance, to unleash LLMs for everyday use, we wanted to understand how usable we could deploy them on the affordable embedded devices.
 Many embedded devices come with mobile GPUs that can serve as a source of acceleration. In this project, we pick Orange Pi 5, a RK35888-based board that is similar to Raspberry Pi but also features a more powerful Mali-G610 GPU.
 We 5 tok/sec for RedPajama-3b and 2.5 tok/sec for Llama2-7b. We can also get to 1.5 tok/sec on a 16GB version of the Orange Pi 5+ under $150.

 The environments were released by OpenAI back in 2017 as just HTML pages. With MiniWoB++, the environments run on a browser, and an RL agent can get the environment states or execute actions via Selenium WebDriver.
 This version of MiniWoB++ contains the following features:
 * Over 100 web environments, including 2 bigger environments based on real websites and 18 previously unavailable “test set” environments. All (but 4) environments are deterministic for the given random seed.
 * Full integration with Gymnasium, a fork of OpenAI Gym, which provides a standardized API for RL.
 * A wide range of implemented browser actions including clicking, dragging, scrolling, typing, and pressing keyboard shortcuts, all of which can be customized (e.g., coordinate binning or scrolling speed).

This task is a bit tricky since a news piece might fall into more than one category, so it's what's called a multi-label problem. Until now, I was doing this just using just keywords, but I wanted to move to something much better and robust.
 So basically, I started by taking 800 headlines and summaries and classifying them manually one by one into these 20 categories. After that, I began building the model in Python using scikit-learn. I tried different methods like logistic regression, random forest, SVM, etc. Af…]]></summary>

 Basically I'm trying to get an AI command center base in Halo Infinite to apply RL in order to determine which loadout to apply to a bot defending the base you're attacking. The issue I'm running into is how to preditct the Q-values for the next state.
 In my map, I decided to change from one state to the next every 5 kills per team. So when that happens the Kill/death ratio of each loadout equipped by a player is updated and used as a reward in the Q-table.
 Well that's the idea, anyway. I wanted to use player kills as a sort of benchmark to gauge performance with a given loadout but I'm afraid the state space I applied is too small and I don't know how to transition from one state to the next and obtain the maximum reward from the expected future rewards of the next state.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 Here is a ported version of Andrej Karpathy's llama2.c into pure Python with zero dependencies.
 The nice thing is llama2.py essentially captures the inference logic from the Llama2 research paper. With this port in pure Python, it's so much easier to unpack the intricate concepts originally presented in a "scientific language".
 Designed for an extensive audience, it aims to be a straightforward "reference implementation" suitable for educational purposes.The original llama2.c repository comprises two Python files intended for model training and one C file for inference.
 The goal of pure Python implementation is to bridge the existing gap by offering a clear-cut reference implementation encapsulating all transformer logic within a concise Python file, not exceeding 500 lines of code.
 Though the original Meta/Llama is written on Python, its complexity is rather high due to multiple dependencies and sophisticated optimizations implemented within. This often makes it hard to follow, particularly for those new to the field.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For context, I've been experimenting with different Reinforcement learning algorithms, frameworks etc. Currently I have a custom Gym environment with Stable baselines 3 to train a PPO agent. 
 I've noticed however that this setup is very slow for training as stable Baselines doesn't properly utilize GPU + parallel environments don't really work that well due to "step lock" where it can't continue until everything is synced up. 
 I've heard really good things about Ray/RLlib. It has more advance features + according to reports it's crazy fast for training. 
 I want to basically rewrite my existing SB3 implementation into Ray but I don't find the documentation very user-friendly + there aren't really that much good/usefull tutorials online as far is I can find. 
 I tried GPT-4 but it just regurgitates some very old Ray implementation. I even tried not using ray and trying Tensorflow again (I hate Tensorflow, I'm definitely team Pytorch 😬) 
 Do you guys have any good tutorials, videos, documentation to get started with PPO on Ray? Would love to learn more, but documentation online seems very hardcore to start even 😂.
 Would love to know your suggestions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Say, I have a method that can be used as a drop-in replacement for a part of a network in a set of relevant tasks, for example, an improved CTC loss in speech recognition and non-autoregressive translation.
 I can run a bunch of experiments, applying my method in those tasks, showing that "model A + my method" works substantially better than just "model A." "Model A" is some relatively light and simple model, like Transformer-base. It might have been near-SOTA several years ago.
 However, the results won't be near contemporary SOTA, because SOTA models tend to be heavy and complicated. In theory, the modification can apply to bigger models, but I don't have the resources to re-implement them.
 So, how do I present my work? In theory, doing the "model A" experiments should be enough to show that my modification is interesting. But in practice most of the reviewers aren't very excited when the reported numbers are far from SOTA, even if the aim is not to beat SOTA, but to present a general working approach. I know that there are many papers that do not contain any SOTA-beating in them, but still manage to be successfully published. Question: how do they do that? 
 Are there any tips and tricks? What kind of experiments/settings/datasets/models should I consider to convince the reviewers? Or at least make it harder for them to Reject-If-Not-SOTA?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't work in ML, but I work on an application that parses code and debugging information out of binaries (executables, shared libraries, etc.) that is then used by other people to build performance analysis tools that are used on ML applications.
 To do some performance benchmarking on my tool, I need some huge binaries to parse. Specifically, I need a binary with a lot of code (.text section in ELF) and debugging information (DWARF in ELF). I know there are lots of binaries that have a huge amount of data in them, but that doesn't help because my application just ignores that.
 Optimally, I need a binary with an on-disk size of greater than 5GB to get useful measurements, but greater than 1GB would still be good. I would also prefer being able to generate the binary from a source build so I can test it across the many architectures my tool supports.
 I have a collaborator who claims to have used my application on an 8GB TensorFlow binary. Unfortunately, that binary is on a classified system and I can't get access to it. However, that let's me know it's at least possible to make such a beast.
 Has anyone here seen such huge binaries using an ML application- it doesn't have to be TensorFlow?
 Thanks in advance!
  
Tools I have tested thus far are the computational chemistry application NWChem and the quantum mechanics Gaussian integral application libint. However, I can't get either of these to make binaries larger than about 100MB.

 I am not completely sure how to use these flags from the Gymnasium API (I've always used the Gym API so far and I'm switching just now...). Particularly in the environment, I'm playing with now:
 It's a 1vs1 game, and an episode can end if one of the 2 players dies or a max. number of steps is reached. In this case:
 - The max. number of steps is a hard limit rule of the game, so if these are reached should they receive truncated or terminated signals?
 - If a player dies, should both agents get a terminated = True, or one should get terminated=True and the other one truncated=True, as it was still alive, and could have continued playing? 
 ​
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, r/MachineLearning, it’s Nir from DagsHub 🐶
 Our MLOps engineers have been experimenting with Kubeflow (”the MLOps version of Kubernetes”) for the past weeks to manage a training cluster on AWS.
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/dqi27ggq0vhb1.jpg?width=1194&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=945c9bcaa9987d2df135e18cf081efd9f742cf0f
 As good engineers, we wanted to kick the tires a bit before committing cloud resources to it. Unfortunately, most installation guides we found online only showed you how to spin up a Kubeflow cluster on AWS, GCP, or Azure. We had a hard time finding clear instructions for installing it locally.
 A local installation would allow individuals to play around with it, experiment, and learn from it.
 So we started looking into it.
 We followed this thread until we successfully ran Kubeflow on a local machine. Since it wasn’t a super clear or easy process to figure out, we’ve written a blog post on how we did it and decided to share our insights with the ML community.
 You can find the blog here: https://dagshub.com/blog/how-to-install-kubeflow-locally
 We also have a follow-up blog that explains how to deploy a Kubeflow cluster on AWS, so if you have any insights or requests for further information - we’d love to hear from you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I'll go straight to the question. My pixel game needs sprites, but I know practically nothing about drawing sprites, and if on the one hand I can still draw something, then 4 directional (front, back, left, right) turn out badly, and you also need to add animation to them. Knowing that there are a lot of neural networks and for almost every task, I decided to find a neural network that will solve my problem, but I couldn't. Therefore, I ask if you know a neural network that can solve my problem. Thank you in advance.

 AAAI-24 Submission Instructions says"Authors must enter the names of ALL AUTHORS at the time of registration (by abstract deadline) — CMT includes a hard-coded note that this is optional, however, this is a mandatory step for AAAI-24 authors. According to AAAI policy, all author names must be added at the time of abstract registration, and the list of names as well as the order in which they appear cannot be changed after August 15."
 I fell a little confusing that it says "the list of names ... cannot be changed after August 15", but also mentioned that "Authors must enter the names of ALL AUTHORS at the time of registration (by abstract deadline)".

 My first step is to train a model on my computer with generated images and see how well this works in general and then later capture real images. To give you an idea of what I am looking for, I added a screenshot of the images I am currently generating.
 https://ibb.co/fFtRj1Q
 For this example image, I expect 35, 75, 137 degree as a result.
 What kind of network would you recommend for this task? Please keep in mind that it shouldn't be too fancy to still fit into a microcontroller via TensorFlow Lite.

 There are of course the big cloud providers like AWS, and the smaller ones like Paperspace and co.
 I am trying to benchmark each in terms of price, ease of use, quick availability of GPUs, and feature-richness.
 Could you share the insights on big vs small cloud providers when training a LLM? If you have other criteria to make a decision I would be interested too!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm new to machine learning and have a question regarding object detection. Here's the scenario:
 I have an image, let's call it image 1, where a person is captured from the front. This allows me to see the person's face, clothes, shoes, and basically their entire front view.
 I have another image, image 2, taken from a different angle or perspective (e.g., their back view). In this image, I might be able to see the entire person or just a part of them.
 The challenge I'm facing is: Can I predict if the person in image 1 is present in image 2? If this is possible, I'd appreciate any guidance on how to approach this problem:
  
What methodologies or algorithms should I consider?
 What kind of datasets might be useful for this task?
 Any resources, tools, or tutorials that can help me get started?
  
Thank you in advance for any insights or guidance you can provide!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently made a proposed code change to allow Hugging Face's TextClassificationPipeline to take advantage of the sliding window-style text truncation provided by using the stride parameter, and taking a mean of output logits across all windows. Hugging Face has already implemented this for the TokenClassificationPipeline.
 E.g. if you want to use a Hugging Face-compatible model to run sentiment analysis on text, this would allow easily running that model on texts longer than the model's config.max_position_embeddings.
 If you support integrating this functionality into the "transformers" library, give a thumbs-up react to this comment on the relevant issue.

Keeping compute constant, PBT appears to drastically improve optimization across the board at the cost of one or more of batch size/training steps/model complexity/other compute consuming factors. If the goal is to minimize validation loss as quickly as possible, isn't this tradeoff worth it?

If you’re not impressed by this test it’s because it’s showing mostly DaVinci demonstrating variables like order of shapes and yes and no affecting it in a way that wonder was not in the video I posted earlier. I have hours of footage with wonder I just started experimenting with DaVinci…with DaVinci it doesn’t feel like there is a ghost in the machine. Though if there is with Wonder it’s world model seems very narrow. I want to do more tests with DaVinci or try to figure out a concept that if an image generator was able to form a world model, a concept that might be likely to emerge across multiple models.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Historically, the most practical methods for solving real-world combinatorial scheduling problems have been using heuristics or metaheurisics such as simulated annealing, tabu search, greedy randomized adaptive search, etc... I consider these more operation research-based techniques. 
 However, recently we have obviously seen a lot of progress being made in the machine learning realm for many types of problems. In particular, we've seen neural networks be used to train models based on data in text, audio, or video form. 
 I am wondering if we have any idea what the scientific consensus is toward applying these same sort of methods for scheduling problems. Suppose we have a history of schedules that we could train a model on. A schedule isn't really text, audio, or video so I don't understand how one could embed the information in a vector space in the same way that would accurately represent the information (specifically, constraints so that the resulting schedule is still feasible) Is there anyone doing research in this particular area?

diagnosis, and classification, which heavily relies on the quality of nucleus
segmentation. However, the complexity of issues such as variations in nucleus
size, blurred nucleus contours, uneven staining, cell clustering, and
overlapping cells poses significant challenges. Current methods for nucleus
segmentation primarily rely on nuclear morphology or contour-based approaches.
Nuclear morphology-based methods exhibit limited generalization ability and
struggle to effectively predict irregular-shaped nuclei, while contour-based
extraction methods face challenges in accurately segmenting overlapping nuclei.
To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a dual-branch network using
hybrid attention based residual U-blocks for nucleus instance segmentation. The
network simultaneously predicts target information and target contours.
Additionally, we introduce a post-processing method that combines the target
information and target contours to distinguish overlapping nuclei and generate
an instance segmentation image. Within the network, we propose a context fusion
block (CF-block) that effectively extracts and merges contextual information
from the network. Extensive quantitative evaluations are conducted to assess
the performance of our method. Experimental results demonstrate the superior
performance of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art approaches on
the BNS, MoNuSeg, CoNSeg, and CPM-17 datasets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lesion segmentation of ultrasound medical images based on deep learning
techniques is a widely used method for diagnosing diseases. Although there is a
large amount of ultrasound image data in medical centers and other places,
labeled ultrasound datasets are a scarce resource, and it is likely that no
datasets are available for new tissues/organs. Transfer learning provides the
possibility to solve this problem, but there are too many features in natural
images that are not related to the target domain. As a source domain, redundant
features that are not conducive to the task will be extracted. Migration
between ultrasound images can avoid this problem, but there are few types of
public datasets, and it is difficult to find sufficiently similar source
domains. Compared with natural images, ultrasound images have less information,
and there are fewer transferable features between different ultrasound images,
which may cause negative transfer. To this end, a multi-source adversarial
transfer learning network for ultrasound image segmentation is proposed.
Specifically, to address the lack of annotations, the idea of adversarial
transfer learning is used to adaptively extract common features between a
certain pair of source and target domains, which provides the possibility to
utilize unlabeled ultrasound data. To alleviate the lack of knowledge in a
single source domain, multi-source transfer learning is adopted to fuse
knowledge from multiple source domains. In order to ensure the effectiveness of
the fusion and maximize the use of precious data, a multi-source domain
independent strategy is also proposed to improve the estimation of the target
domain data distribution, which further increases the learning ability of the
multi-source adversarial migration learning network in multiple domains.]]></summary>

sufficiently scaled up, would be able to reach human-level visual object
recognition capabilities with the same type and amount of visual experience
humans learn from. Previous work on this question only considered the scaling
of data size. Here, we consider the simultaneous scaling of data size, model
size, and image resolution. We perform a scaling experiment with vision
transformers up to 633M parameters in size (ViT-H/14) trained with up to 5K
hours of human-like video data (long, continuous, mostly egocentric videos)
with image resolutions of up to 476x476 pixels. The efficiency of masked
autoencoders (MAEs) as a self-supervised learning algorithm makes it possible
to run this scaling experiment on an unassuming academic budget. We find that
it is feasible to reach human-level object recognition capacity at sub-human
scales of model size, data size, and image size, if these factors are scaled up
simultaneously. To give a concrete example, we estimate that a 2.5B parameter
ViT model trained with 20K hours (2.3 years) of human-like video data with a
spatial resolution of 952x952 pixels should be able to reach roughly
human-level accuracy on ImageNet. Human-level competence is thus achievable for
a fundamental perceptual capability from human-like perceptual experience
(human-like in both amount and type) with extremely generic learning algorithms
and architectures and without any substantive inductive biases.]]></summary>

Multi-Class Deep Support Vector Data Description (MCDSVDD), an extension of the

where each hypersphere represents a specific inlier category. The distance of
each sample from the centers of these hyperspheres determines the anomaly
score. We evaluate the effectiveness of MCDSVDD by comparing its performance
with several anomaly detection algorithms on a large dataset of astronomical
light-curves obtained from the Zwicky Transient Facility. Our results
demonstrate the efficacy of MCDSVDD in detecting anomalous sources while
leveraging the presence of different inlier categories. The code and the data

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unsupervised domain adaptation (DA) with the aid of pseudo labeling
techniques has emerged as a crucial approach for domain-adaptive 3D object
detection. While effective, existing DA methods suffer from a substantial drop
in performance when applied to a multi-class training setting, due to the
co-existence of low-quality pseudo labels and class imbalance issues. In this
paper, we address this challenge by proposing a novel ReDB framework tailored
for learning to detect all classes at once. Our approach produces Reliable,
Diverse, and class-Balanced pseudo 3D boxes to iteratively guide the
self-training on a distributionally different target domain. To alleviate
disruptions caused by the environmental discrepancy (e.g., beam numbers), the
proposed cross-domain examination (CDE) assesses the correctness of pseudo
labels by copy-pasting target instances into a source environment and measuring
the prediction consistency. To reduce computational overhead and mitigate the
object shift (e.g., scales and point densities), we design an overlapped boxes
counting (OBC) metric that allows to uniformly downsample pseudo-labeled
objects across different geometric characteristics. To confront the issue of
inter-class imbalance, we progressively augment the target point clouds with a
class-balanced set of pseudo-labeled target instances and source objects, which
boosts recognition accuracies on both frequently appearing and rare classes.
Experimental results on three benchmark datasets using both voxel-based (i.e.,
SECOND) and point-based 3D detectors (i.e., PointRCNN) demonstrate that our
proposed ReDB approach outperforms existing 3D domain adaptation methods by a
large margin, improving 23.15% mAP on the nuScenes $\rightarrow$ KITTI task.

the pace of materials discovery. Although instruments for autonomous synthesis
have become popular in molecular and polymer science, solution processing of
hybrid materials and nanoparticles, examples of autonomous tools for physical
vapor deposition are scarce yet important for the semiconductor industry. Here,
we report the design and implementation of an autonomous workflow for sputter
deposition of thin films with controlled composition, leveraging a highly
automated sputtering reactor custom-controlled by Python, optical emission
spectroscopy (OES), and a Bayesian optimization algorithm. We modeled film
composition, measured by x-ray fluorescence, as a linear function of emission
lines monitored during the co-sputtering from elemental Zn and Ti targets in
N$_2$ atmosphere. A Bayesian control algorithm, informed by OES, navigates the
space of sputtering power to fabricate films with user-defined composition, by
minimizing the absolute error between desired and measured emission signals. We
validated our approach by autonomously fabricating Zn$_x$Ti$_{1-x}$N$_y$ films
with deviations from the targeted cation composition within relative 3.5 %,
even for 15 nm thin films, demonstrating that the proposed approach can

heavily on prompt design, with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and self-consistency
being critical methods that enhance this ability. However, these methods do not
fully exploit the answers generated by the LLM to guide subsequent responses.
This paper proposes a new prompting method, named Progressive-Hint Prompting
(PHP), that enables automatic multiple interactions between users and LLMs by
using previously generated answers as hints to progressively guide toward the
correct answers. PHP is orthogonal to CoT and self-consistency, making it easy
to combine with state-of-the-art techniques to further improve performance. We
conducted extensive and comprehensive experiments on seven benchmarks. The
results show that PHP significantly improves accuracy while remaining highly
efficient. For instance, with text-davinci-003, we observed a 4.2% improvement
on GSM8K with greedy decoding compared to Complex CoT, and a 46.17% reduction
in sample paths with self-consistency. With GPT-4 and PHP, we achieve
state-of-the-art performances on SVAMP (89.1% -> 91.9%), GSM8K (92% -> 95.5%),
AQuA (76.4% -> 79.9%) and MATH (50.3% -> 53.9%).]]></summary>

structures are employed to drive user engagement. This paper focuses on
promotions with response-dependent costs, where expenses are incurred only when
a purchase is made. Such promotions include discounts and coupons. While
existing uplift model approaches aim to address this challenge, these
approaches often necessitate training multiple models, like meta-learners, or
encounter complications when estimating profit due to zero-inflated values
stemming from non-converted individuals with zero cost and profit.

To address these challenges, we introduce Incremental Profit per Conversion
(IPC), a novel uplift measure of promotional campaigns' efficiency in unit
economics. Through a proposed response transformation, we demonstrate that IPC
requires only converted data, its propensity, and a single model to be
estimated. As a result, IPC resolves the issues mentioned above while
mitigating the noise typically associated with the class imbalance in
conversion datasets and biases arising from the many-to-one mapping between
search and purchase data. Lastly, we validate the efficacy of our approach by
presenting results obtained from a synthetic simulation of a discount coupon
campaign.]]></summary>

Optimization, and is critical to the success of deep learning models. Despite
its astonishing performance, little non-heuristic theory has been developed to
describe the underlying working mechanism. This paper gives a theoretical
accounting of Random Search. We introduce the concept of \emph{scattering
dimension} that describes the landscape of the underlying function, and
quantifies the performance of random search. We show that, when the environment
is noise-free, the output of random search converges to the optimal value in
probability at rate $ \widetilde{\mathcal{O}} \left( \left( \frac{1}{T}

dimension of the underlying function. When the observed function values are
corrupted by bounded $iid$ noise, the output of random search converges to the
optimal value in probability at rate $ \widetilde{\mathcal{O}} \left( \left(
\frac{1}{T} \right)^{ \frac{1}{d_s + 1} } \right) $. In addition, based on the
principles of random search, we introduce an algorithm, called BLiN-MOS, for
Lipschitz bandits in doubling metric spaces that are also endowed with a

and it becomes crucial to comprehend the parsimonious patterns that exist
within them as they grow in scale. With exploding parameter counts, Lottery
Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) and its variants, have lost their pragmatism in
sparsifying them due to high computation and memory bottleneck of repetitive
train-prune-retrain routine of iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) which worsens
with increasing model size. This paper comprehensively studies induced sparse
patterns across multiple large pre-trained vision and language transformers. We
propose the existence of -- essential sparsity defined with a sharp dropping
point beyond which the performance declines much faster w.r.t the rise of
sparsity level, when we directly remove weights with the smallest magnitudes in
one-shot without re-training. We also find essential sparsity to hold valid for
N:M sparsity patterns as well as on modern-scale large language models
(Vicuna-7B). We also present an intriguing emerging phenomenon of abrupt
sparsification during the pre-training of BERT, i.e., BERT suddenly becomes
heavily sparse in pre-training after certain iterations. Moreover, our
observations also indicate a counter-intuitive finding that BERT trained with a
larger amount of pre-training data tends to have a better ability to condense
knowledge in comparatively relatively fewer parameters. Lastly, we investigate
the effect of the pre-training loss on essential sparsity and discover that
self-supervised learning (SSL) objectives trigger stronger emergent
sparsification properties than supervised learning (SL). Our codes are
available at \url{https://github.com/VITA-Group/essential_sparsity}.]]></summary>

(CNNs) robust against adversarial perturbation attacks. Such attacks add
perturbation to original images to generate adversarial images that fool
classifiers such as road sign classifiers of autonomous vehicles. Although
symmetry is a pervasive aspect of the natural world, CNNs are unable to handle
symmetry well. For example, a CNN can classify an image differently from its
mirror image. For an adversarial image that misclassifies with a wrong label
$l_w$, CNN inability to handle symmetry means that a symmetric adversarial
image can classify differently from the wrong label $l_w$. Further than that,
we find that the classification of a symmetric adversarial image reverts to the
correct label. To classify an image when adversaries are unaware of the
defense, we apply symmetry to the image and use the classification label of the
symmetric image. To classify an image when adversaries are aware of the
defense, we use mirror symmetry and pixel inversion symmetry to form a symmetry
group. We apply all the group symmetries to the image and decide on the output
label based on the agreement of any two of the classification labels of the
symmetry images. Adaptive attacks fail because they need to rely on loss
functions that use conflicting CNN output values for symmetric images. Without
attack knowledge, the proposed symmetry defense succeeds against both
gradient-based and random-search attacks, with up to near-default accuracies
for ImageNet. The defense even improves the classification accuracy of original
images.]]></summary>

success in reducing maintenance costs and downtime of complicated machines
while increasing overall productivity through extensive utilization of
Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Deep Learning (DL). Unfortunately, IoT sensors and
DL algorithms are both prone to cyber-attacks. For instance, DL algorithms are
known for their susceptibility to adversarial examples. Such adversarial
attacks are vastly under-explored in the PdM domain. This is because the
adversarial attacks in the computer vision domain for classification tasks
cannot be directly applied to the PdM domain for multivariate time series (MTS)
regression tasks. In this work, we propose an end-to-end methodology to design
adversarially robust PdM systems by extensively analyzing the effect of
different types of adversarial attacks and proposing a novel adversarial
defense technique for DL-enabled PdM models. First, we propose novel MTS
Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) and MTS PGD with random restarts (PGD_r)
attacks. Then, we evaluate the impact of MTS PGD and PGD_r along with MTS Fast
Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and MTS Basic Iterative Method (BIM) on Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN), and Bi-directional LSTM based PdM system. Our results using
NASA's turbofan engine dataset show that adversarial attacks can cause a severe
defect (up to 11X) in the RUL prediction, outperforming the effectiveness of
the state-of-the-art PdM attacks by 3X. Furthermore, we present a novel
approximate adversarial training method to defend against adversarial attacks.
We observe that approximate adversarial training can significantly improve the
robustness of PdM models (up to 54X) and outperforms the state-of-the-art PdM
defense methods by offering 3X more robustness.]]></summary>

can dynamically weigh the contribution of various spatial scales. The proposed

lead to highly entangled representations (Tschannen et al., 2019). Instead, the
actual InfoNCE objective is a simplified lower bound on the MI which is loose
even in the infinite sample limit. Thus, an objective that works (i.e. the
actual InfoNCE objective) appears to be motivated as a loose bound on an
objective that does not work (i.e. the true MI which gives arbitrarily
entangled representations). We give an alternative motivation for the actual
InfoNCE objective. In particular, we show that in the infinite sample limit,
and for a particular choice of prior, the actual InfoNCE objective is equal to
the ELBO (up to a constant); and the ELBO is equal to the marginal likelihood
with a deterministic recognition model. Thus, we argue that our VAE perspective
gives a better motivation for InfoNCE than MI, as the actual InfoNCE objective
is only loosely bounded by the MI, but is equal to the ELBO/marginal likelihood
(up to a constant).]]></summary>

on an individual's unique imaging features so as to improve their clinical
outcome. Machine learning frameworks that integrate uncertainty estimation as
part of their treatment recommendations would be safer and more reliable.
However, little work has been done in adapting uncertainty estimation
techniques and validation metrics for precision medicine. In this paper, we use
Bayesian deep learning for estimating the posterior distribution over factual
and counterfactual outcomes on several treatments. This allows for estimating
the uncertainty for each treatment option and for the individual treatment
effects (ITE) between any two treatments. We train and evaluate this model to
predict future new and enlarging T2 lesion counts on a large, multi-center
dataset of MR brain images of patients with multiple sclerosis, exposed to
several treatments during randomized controlled trials. We evaluate the
correlation of the uncertainty estimate with the factual error, and, given the
lack of ground truth counterfactual outcomes, demonstrate how uncertainty for
the ITE prediction relates to bounds on the ITE error. Lastly, we demonstrate
how knowledge of uncertainty could modify clinical decision-making to improve
individual patient and clinical trial outcomes.]]></summary>

achieved desirable performance on multiple medical image segmentation datasets.
In this paper, we conduct a survey of the most representative four medical

characteristics of these models and quantitatively evaluate their performance
on two benchmark datasets (i.e., Tuberculosis Chest X-rays and ovarian tumors).
Finally, we discuss the main challenges and future trends in medical image

diverse and high-performing solutions to a given problem. Originally developed
for evolutionary robotics, most QD studies are conducted on a limited set of
domains - mainly applied to locomotion, where the fitness and the behavior
signal are dense. Grasping is a crucial task for manipulation in robotics.
Despite the efforts of many research communities, this task is yet to be
solved. Grasping cumulates unprecedented challenges in QD literature: it
suffers from reward sparsity, behavioral sparsity, and behavior space
misalignment. The present work studies how QD can address grasping. Experiments
have been conducted on 15 different methods on 10 grasping domains,
corresponding to 2 different robot-gripper setups and 5 standard objects. An
evaluation framework that distinguishes the evaluation of an algorithm from its
internal components has also been proposed for a fair comparison. The obtained
results show that MAP-Elites variants that select successful solutions in
priority outperform all the compared methods on the studied metrics by a large
margin. We also found experimental evidence that sparse interaction can lead to
deceptive novelty. To our knowledge, the ability to efficiently produce
examples of grasping trajectories demonstrated in this work has no precedent in
the literature.]]></summary>

unfortunately can not be applied to problems with undefined or zero gradients.
To circumvent this issue, the loss function can be manually replaced by a
"surrogate" that has similar minima but is differentiable. Our proposed
framework, ZeroGrads, automates this process by learning a neural approximation
of the objective function, the surrogate, which in turn can be used to
differentiate through arbitrary black-box graphics pipelines. We train the
surrogate on an actively smoothed version of the objective and encourage
locality, focusing the surrogate's capacity on what matters at the current
training episode. The fitting is performed online, alongside the parameter
optimization, and self-supervised, without pre-computed data or pre-trained
models. As sampling the objective is expensive (it requires a full rendering or
simulator run), we devise an efficient sampling scheme that allows for
tractable run-times and competitive performance at little overhead. We
demonstrate optimizing diverse non-convex, non-differentiable black-box
problems in graphics, such as visibility in rendering, discrete parameter
spaces in procedural modelling or optimal control in physics-driven animation.
In contrast to more traditional algorithms, our approach scales well to higher
dimensions, which we demonstrate on problems with up to 35k interlinked

tasks, but their computation-intensive nature demands faster and more
energy-efficient hardware implementations. Optics-based platforms, using
technologies such as silicon photonics and spatial light modulators, offer
promising avenues for achieving this goal. However, training multiple trainable
layers in tandem with these physical systems poses challenges, as they are
difficult to fully characterize and describe with differentiable functions,
hindering the use of error backpropagation algorithm. The recently introduced
Forward-Forward Algorithm (FFA) eliminates the need for perfect
characterization of the learning system and shows promise for efficient
training with large numbers of programmable parameters. The FFA does not
require backpropagating an error signal to update the weights, rather the
weights are updated by only sending information in one direction. The local
loss function for each set of trainable weights enables low-power analog
hardware implementations without resorting to metaheuristic algorithms or
reinforcement learning. In this paper, we present an experiment utilizing
multimode nonlinear wave propagation in an optical fiber demonstrating the
feasibility of the FFA approach using an optical system. The results show that
incorporating optical transforms in multilayer NN architectures trained with
the FFA, can lead to performance improvements, even with a relatively small
number of trainable weights. The proposed method offers a new path to the

on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract
latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding
support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems.
The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory (OOM) problems where the
memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU
memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse
and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or
tensor cores when available). Input/Output (I/O) latency associated with batch
copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data
transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective
communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized
NVIDIA Collective Communication Library NCCL based communicators. Benchmark
results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new
implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk. Good weak scaling was

in a graph. State-of-the-art methods based on graph neural networks achieve
excellent performance when all labels are available during training. But in
real-life, models are often applied on data with new classes, which can lead to
massive misclassification and thus significantly degrade performance. Hence,
developing open-set classification methods is crucial to determine if a given
sample belongs to a known class. Existing methods for open-set node
classification generally use transductive learning with part or all of the
features of real unseen class nodes to help with open-set classification. In
this paper, we propose a novel generative open-set node classification method,
i.e. $\mathcal{G}^2Pxy$, which follows a stricter inductive learning setting
where no information about unknown classes is available during training and
validation. Two kinds of proxy unknown nodes, inter-class unknown proxies and
external unknown proxies are generated via mixup to efficiently anticipate the
distribution of novel classes. Using the generated proxies, a closed-set
classifier can be transformed into an open-set one, by augmenting it with an
extra proxy classifier. Under the constraints of both cross entropy loss and
complement entropy loss, $\mathcal{G}^2Pxy$ achieves superior effectiveness for
unknown class detection and known class classification, which is validated by
experiments on benchmark graph datasets. Moreover, $\mathcal{G}^2Pxy$ does not
have specific requirement on the GNN architecture and shows good
generalizations.]]></summary>

medical analysis. It can produce computer-aided diagnosis descriptions and thus
significantly alleviate the doctors' work. Inspired by the huge success of
neural machine translation and image captioning, various deep learning methods
have been proposed for medical report generation. However, due to the inherent
properties of medical data, including data imbalance and the length and
correlation between report sequences, the generated reports by existing methods
may exhibit linguistic fluency but lack adequate clinical accuracy. In this
work, we propose an image-to-indicator hierarchical transformer (IIHT)
framework for medical report generation. It consists of three modules, i.e., a
classifier module, an indicator expansion module and a generator module. The
classifier module first extracts image features from the input medical images
and produces disease-related indicators with their corresponding states. The
disease-related indicators are subsequently utilised as input for the indicator
expansion module, incorporating the "data-text-data" strategy. The
transformer-based generator then leverages these extracted features along with
image features as auxiliary information to generate final reports. Furthermore,
the proposed IIHT method is feasible for radiologists to modify disease
indicators in real-world scenarios and integrate the operations into the
indicator expansion module for fluent and accurate medical report generation.
Extensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods under
various evaluation metrics demonstrate the great performance of the proposed
method.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ensuring alignment, which refers to making models behave in accordance with
human intentions [1,2], has become a critical task before deploying large
language models (LLMs) in real-world applications. For instance, OpenAI devoted
six months to iteratively aligning GPT-4 before its release [3]. However, a
major challenge faced by practitioners is the lack of clear guidance on
evaluating whether LLM outputs align with social norms, values, and
regulations. This obstacle hinders systematic iteration and deployment of LLMs.
To address this issue, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of key
dimensions that are crucial to consider when assessing LLM trustworthiness. The
survey covers seven major categories of LLM trustworthiness: reliability,
safety, fairness, resistance to misuse, explainability and reasoning, adherence
to social norms, and robustness. Each major category is further divided into
several sub-categories, resulting in a total of 29 sub-categories.
Additionally, a subset of 8 sub-categories is selected for further
investigation, where corresponding measurement studies are designed and
conducted on several widely-used LLMs. The measurement results indicate that,
in general, more aligned models tend to perform better in terms of overall
trustworthiness. However, the effectiveness of alignment varies across the
different trustworthiness categories considered. This highlights the importance
of conducting more fine-grained analyses, testing, and making continuous
improvements on LLM alignment. By shedding light on these key dimensions of LLM
trustworthiness, this paper aims to provide valuable insights and guidance to
practitioners in the field. Understanding and addressing these concerns will be
crucial in achieving reliable and ethically sound deployment of LLMs in various
applications.]]></summary>

samples is crucial in real-world safety demanding applications. In this work we
first study the interplay between critical points of 3D point clouds and OOD
samples. Our findings are that common corruptions and outliers are often
interpreted as critical points. We generalize the notion of critical points
into importance measures. We show that training a classification network based
only on less important points dramatically improves robustness, at a cost of
minor performance loss on the clean set. We observe that normalized entropy is
highly informative for corruption analysis. An adaptive threshold based on
normalized entropy is suggested for selecting the set of uncritical points. Our
proposed importance measure is extremely fast to compute. We show it can be
used for a variety of applications, such as Explainable AI (XAI), Outlier
Removal, Uncertainty Estimation, Robust Classification and Adversarial Defense.
We reach SOTA results on the two latter tasks.]]></summary>

of XAI solutions for medical decision support, based on a representative sample
of 198 articles published in recent years. The systematic synthesis of the
relevant articles resulted in several findings. (1) model-agnostic XAI
techniques were mostly employed in these solutions, (2) deep learning models
are utilized more than other types of machine learning models, (3)
explainability was applied to promote trust, but very few works reported the
physicians participation in the loop, (4) visual and interactive user interface
is more useful in understanding the explanation and the recommendation of the

sources, there is a strong need for multi-view learning modeling. This is a
complex task when considering the differences in resolution, magnitude, and

input-level fusion, but other - more advanced - fusion strategies may
outperform this traditional approach. This work assesses different fusion
strategies for crop classification in the CropHarvest dataset. The fusion
methods proposed in this work outperform models based on individual views and
previous fusion methods. We do not find one single fusion method that
consistently outperforms all other approaches. Instead, we present a comparison

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep learning classifiers achieve state-of-the-art performance in various
risk detection applications. They explore rich semantic representations and are
supposed to automatically discover risk behaviors. However, due to the lack of
transparency, the behavioral semantics cannot be conveyed to downstream
security experts to reduce their heavy workload in security analysis. Although
feature attribution (FA) methods can be used to explain deep learning, the
underlying classifier is still blind to what behavior is suspicious, and the
generated explanation cannot adapt to downstream tasks, incurring poor
explanation fidelity and intelligibility. In this paper, we propose FINER, the
first framework for risk detection classifiers to generate high-fidelity and
high-intelligibility explanations. The high-level idea is to gather explanation
efforts from model developer, FA designer, and security experts. To improve
fidelity, we fine-tune the classifier with an explanation-guided multi-task
learning strategy. To improve intelligibility, we engage task knowledge to
adjust and ensemble FA methods. Extensive evaluations show that FINER improves
explanation quality for risk detection. Moreover, we demonstrate that FINER
outperforms a state-of-the-art tool in facilitating malware analysis.]]></summary>

information received from the perception module influences core driving
decisions. An outstanding challenge in real-time perception for autonomous
driving lies in finding the best trade-off between detection quality and
latency. Major constraints on both computation and power have to be taken into
account for real-time perception in autonomous vehicles. Larger object
detection models tend to produce the best results, but are also slower at
runtime. Since the most accurate detectors cannot run in real-time locally, we
investigate the possibility of offloading computation to edge and cloud
platforms, which are less resource-constrained. We create a synthetic dataset
to train object detection models and evaluate different offloading strategies.
Using real hardware and network simulations, we compare different trade-offs
between prediction quality and end-to-end delay. Since sending raw frames over
the network implies additional transmission delays, we also explore the use of
JPEG and H.265 compression at varying qualities and measure their impact on
prediction metrics. We show that models with adequate compression can be run in
real-time on the cloud while outperforming local detection performance.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Efficient and timely calculations of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are
essential for emerging technologies like autonomous driving, the Internet of
Things (IoT), and edge computing. One of the primary ML algorithms used in such
systems is Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which demand high
computational resources. This requirement has led to the use of ML accelerators
like GPGPUs to meet design constraints. However, selecting the most suitable
accelerator involves Design Space Exploration (DSE), a process that is usually
time-consuming and requires significant manual effort. Our work presents
approaches to expedite the DSE process by identifying the most appropriate
GPGPU for CNN inferencing systems. We have developed a quick and precise
technique for forecasting the power and performance of CNNs during inference,
with a MAPE of 5.03% and 5.94%, respectively. Our approach empowers computer
architects to estimate power and performance in the early stages of
development, reducing the necessity for numerous prototypes. This saves time
and money while also improving the time-to-market period.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This work considers gradient-based mesh optimization, where we iteratively
optimize for a 3D surface mesh by representing it as the isosurface of a scalar
field, an increasingly common paradigm in applications including
photogrammetry, generative modeling, and inverse physics. Existing
implementations adapt classic isosurface extraction algorithms like Marching
Cubes or Dual Contouring; these techniques were designed to extract meshes from
fixed, known fields, and in the optimization setting they lack the degrees of
freedom to represent high-quality feature-preserving meshes, or suffer from
numerical instabilities. We introduce FlexiCubes, an isosurface representation
specifically designed for optimizing an unknown mesh with respect to geometric,
visual, or even physical objectives. Our main insight is to introduce
additional carefully-chosen parameters into the representation, which allow
local flexible adjustments to the extracted mesh geometry and connectivity.
These parameters are updated along with the underlying scalar field via
automatic differentiation when optimizing for a downstream task. We base our
extraction scheme on Dual Marching Cubes for improved topological properties,
and present extensions to optionally generate tetrahedral and
hierarchically-adaptive meshes. Extensive experiments validate FlexiCubes on
both synthetic benchmarks and real-world applications, showing that it offers
significant improvements in mesh quality and geometric fidelity.]]></summary>

machine learning, promising several orders of magnitude enhancement in both
computational speed and energy efficiency. However, to reach the full capacity
of an optical neural network it is necessary that the computing not only for
the inference, but also for the training be implemented optically. The primary
algorithm for training a neural network is backpropagation, in which the
calculation is performed in the order opposite to the information flow for
inference. While straightforward in a digital computer, optical implementation
of backpropagation has so far remained elusive, particularly because of the
conflicting requirements for the optical element that implements the nonlinear
activation function. In this work, we address this challenge for the first time
with a surprisingly simple and generic scheme. Saturable absorbers are employed
for the role of the activation units, and the required properties are achieved
through a pump-probe process, in which the forward propagating signal acts as
the pump and backward as the probe. Our approach is adaptable to various analog
platforms, materials, and network structures, and it demonstrates the
possibility of constructing neural networks entirely reliant on analog optical
processes for both training and inference tasks.]]></summary>

been proposed in the literature. They identified various stakeholders and
defined architecture viewpoints and views to frame and address stakeholder
concerns. However, the stakeholders with data science and Machine Learning (ML)
related concerns, such as data scientists and data engineers, are yet to be
included in existing architecture frameworks. Therefore, they failed to address
the architecture viewpoints and views responsive to the concerns of the data
science community. In this paper, we address this gap by establishing the
architecture frameworks adapted to meet the requirements of modern applications
and organizations where ML artifacts are both prevalent and crucial. In
particular, we focus on ML-enabled Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) and propose
two sets of merit criteria for their efficient development and performance
assessment, namely the criteria for evaluating and benchmarking ML-enabled
CPSs, and the criteria for evaluation and benchmarking of the tools intended to
support users through the modeling and development pipeline. In this study, we
deploy multiple empirical and qualitative research methods based on literature
review and survey instruments including expert interviews and an online
questionnaire. We collect, analyze, and integrate the opinions of 77 experts
from more than 25 organizations in over 10 countries to devise and validate the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graph clustering is a fundamental task in graph analysis, and recent advances
in utilizing graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown impressive results.
Despite the success of existing GNN-based graph clustering methods, they often
overlook the quality of graph structure, which is inherent in real-world graphs
due to their sparse and multifarious nature, leading to subpar performance.
Graph structure learning allows refining the input graph by adding missing
links and removing spurious connections. However, previous endeavors in graph
structure learning have predominantly centered around supervised settings, and
cannot be directly applied to our specific clustering tasks due to the absence
of ground-truth labels. To bridge the gap, we propose a novel method called
\textbf{ho}mophily-enhanced structure \textbf{le}arning for graph clustering
(HoLe). Our motivation stems from the observation that subtly enhancing the
degree of homophily within the graph structure can significantly improve GNNs
and clustering outcomes. To realize this objective, we develop two
clustering-oriented structure learning modules, i.e., hierarchical correlation
estimation and cluster-aware sparsification. The former module enables a more
accurate estimation of pairwise node relationships by leveraging guidance from
latent and clustering spaces, while the latter one generates a sparsified
structure based on the similarity matrix and clustering assignments.
Additionally, we devise a joint optimization approach alternating between
training the homophily-enhanced structure learning and GNN-based clustering,
thereby enforcing their reciprocal effects. Extensive experiments on seven
benchmark datasets of various types and scales, across a range of clustering
metrics, demonstrate the superiority of HoLe against state-of-the-art
baselines.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, methods for skeleton-based human activity recognition have been
shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, these attack methods
require either the full knowledge of the victim (i.e. white-box attacks),
access to training data (i.e. transfer-based attacks) or frequent model queries
(i.e. black-box attacks). All their requirements are highly restrictive,
raising the question of how detrimental the vulnerability is. In this paper, we
show that the vulnerability indeed exists. To this end, we consider a new
attack task: the attacker has no access to the victim model or the training
data or labels, where we coin the term hard no-box attack. Specifically, we
first learn a motion manifold where we define an adversarial loss to compute a
new gradient for the attack, named skeleton-motion-informed (SMI) gradient. Our
gradient contains information of the motion dynamics, which is different from
existing gradient-based attack methods that compute the loss gradient assuming
each dimension in the data is independent. The SMI gradient can augment many
gradient-based attack methods, leading to a new family of no-box attack
methods. Extensive evaluation and comparison show that our method imposes a
real threat to existing classifiers. They also show that the SMI gradient
improves the transferability and imperceptibility of adversarial samples in
both no-box and transfer-based black-box settings.]]></summary>

freight mobility. Besides the enormous challenge of perception, i.e. accurately
perceiving the environment using available sensor data, automated driving
comprises planning a safe, comfortable, and efficient motion trajectory. To
promote safety and progress, many works rely on modules that predict the future
motion of surrounding traffic. Modular automated driving systems commonly
handle prediction and planning as sequential separate tasks. While this
accounts for the influence of surrounding traffic on the ego-vehicle, it fails
to anticipate the reactions of traffic participants to the ego-vehicle's
behavior. Recent works suggest that integrating prediction and planning in an
interdependent joint step is necessary to achieve safe, efficient, and
comfortable driving. While various models implement such integrated systems, a
comprehensive overview and theoretical understanding of different principles
are lacking. We systematically review state-of-the-art deep learning-based
prediction, planning, and integrated prediction and planning models. Different
facets of the integration ranging from model architecture and model design to
behavioral aspects are considered and related to each other. Moreover, we
discuss the implications, strengths, and limitations of different integration

significant demand for the diversity of traversable environments and the
quantity of supervision for training generalizable agents. To tackle the common
data scarcity issue in existing vision-and-language navigation datasets, we
propose an effective paradigm for generating large-scale data for learning,
which applies 1200+ photo-realistic environments from HM3D and Gibson datasets
and synthesizes 4.9 million instruction trajectory pairs using fully-accessible
resources on the web. Importantly, we investigate the influence of each
component in this paradigm on the agent's performance and study how to
adequately apply the augmented data to pre-train and fine-tune an agent. Thanks
to our large-scale dataset, the performance of an existing agent can be pushed
up (+11% absolute with regard to previous SoTA) to a significantly new best of
80% single-run success rate on the R2R test split by simple imitation learning.
The long-lasting generalization gap between navigating in seen and unseen
environments is also reduced to less than 1% (versus 8% in the previous best
method). Moreover, our paradigm also facilitates different models to achieve
new state-of-the-art navigation results on CVDN, REVERIE, and R2R in continuous

step-by-step into molecular precursors until a set of commercially available
molecules is found with the goal to provide a synthesis route. Its two primary
research directions, single-step retrosynthesis prediction, which models the
chemical reaction logic, and multi-step synthesis planning, which tries to find
the correct sequence of reactions, are inherently intertwined. Still, this
connection is not reflected in contemporary research. In this work, we combine
these two major research directions by applying multiple single-step
retrosynthesis models within multi-step synthesis planning and analyzing their
impact using public and proprietary reaction data. We find a disconnection
between high single-step performance and potential route-finding success,
suggesting that single-step models must be evaluated within synthesis planning
in the future. Furthermore, we show that the commonly used single-step
retrosynthesis benchmark dataset USPTO-50k is insufficient as this evaluation
task does not represent model performance and scalability on larger and more
diverse datasets. For multi-step synthesis planning, we show that the choice of
the single-step model can improve the overall success rate of synthesis
planning by up to +28% compared to the commonly used baseline model. Finally,
we show that each single-step model finds unique synthesis routes, and differs
in aspects such as route-finding success, the number of found synthesis routes,
and chemical validity, making the combination of single-step retrosynthesis
prediction and multi-step synthesis planning a crucial aspect when developing
future methods.]]></summary>

describing constant-width layers, making them unsuitable for modeling deep
learning architectures with layers of variable width. In this paper, we propose
a continuous-time Autoencoder, which we call AutoencODE, based on a

enables the extension of the mean-field control framework originally devised
for conventional NeurODEs. In this setting, we tackle the case of low Tikhonov
regularization, resulting in potentially non-convex cost landscapes. While the
global results obtained for high Tikhonov regularization may not hold globally,
we show that many of them can be recovered in regions where the loss function
is locally convex. Inspired by our theoretical findings, we develop a training
method tailored to this specific type of Autoencoders with residual
connections, and we validate our approach through numerical experiments
conducted on various examples.]]></summary>

adversarial examples, threatening their practical deployment. Despite the many
research endeavors have been made to tackle this issue in recent years, the
diversity of adversarial examples on 3D point clouds makes them more
challenging to defend against than those on 2D images. For examples, attackers
can generate adversarial examples by adding, shifting, or removing points.
Consequently, existing defense strategies are hard to counter unseen point
cloud adversarial examples. In this paper, we first establish a comprehensive,
and rigorous point cloud adversarial robustness benchmark to evaluate
adversarial robustness, which can provide a detailed understanding of the
effects of the defense and attack methods. We then collect existing defense
tricks in point cloud adversarial defenses and then perform extensive and
systematic experiments to identify an effective combination of these tricks.
Furthermore, we propose a hybrid training augmentation methods that consider
various types of point cloud adversarial examples to adversarial training,
significantly improving the adversarial robustness. By combining these tricks,
we construct a more robust defense framework achieving an average accuracy of
83.45\% against various attacks, demonstrating its capability to enabling
robust learners. Our codebase are open-sourced on:

that have already been fact-checked. The successful detection of claims that
have already been debunked not only reduces the manual efforts of professional
fact-checkers but can also contribute to slowing the spread of misinformation.
Mainly due to the lack of readily available data, this is an understudied
problem, particularly when considering the cross-lingual task, i.e. the
retrieval of fact-checking articles in a language different from the language
of the online post being checked. This paper fills this gap by (i) creating a
novel dataset to enable research on cross-lingual retrieval of already debunked
narratives, using tweets as queries to a database of fact-checking articles;
(ii) presenting an extensive experiment to benchmark fine-tuned and
off-the-shelf multilingual pre-trained Transformer models for this task; and
(iii) proposing a novel multistage framework that divides this cross-lingual
debunk retrieval task into refinement and re-ranking stages. Results show that
the task of cross-lingual retrieval of already debunked narratives is
challenging and off-the-shelf Transformer models fail to outperform a strong
lexical-based baseline (BM25). Nevertheless, our multistage retrieval framework
is robust, outperforming BM25 in most scenarios and enabling cross-domain and
zero-shot learning, without significantly harming the model's performance.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Surgical instrument segmentation is recognised as a key enabler to provide
advanced surgical assistance and improve computer assisted interventions. In
this work, we propose SegMatch, a semi supervised learning method to reduce the
need for expensive annotation for laparoscopic and robotic surgical images.
SegMatch builds on FixMatch, a widespread semi supervised classification
pipeline combining consistency regularization and pseudo labelling, and adapts
it for the purpose of segmentation. In our proposed SegMatch, the unlabelled
images are weakly augmented and fed into the segmentation model to generate a
pseudo-label to enforce the unsupervised loss against the output of the model
for the adversarial augmented image on the pixels with a high confidence score.
Our adaptation for segmentation tasks includes carefully considering the
equivariance and invariance properties of the augmentation functions we rely
on. To increase the relevance of our augmentations, we depart from using only
handcrafted augmentations and introduce a trainable adversarial augmentation
strategy. Our algorithm was evaluated on the MICCAI Instrument Segmentation
Challenge datasets Robust-MIS 2019 and EndoVis 2017. Our results demonstrate
that adding unlabelled data for training purposes allows us to surpass the
performance of fully supervised approaches which are limited by the
availability of training data in these challenges. SegMatch also outperforms a
range of state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning semantic segmentation models
in different labelled to unlabelled data ratios.]]></summary>

prediction is evaluated alongside the constant velocity model (CVM) with
respect to its applicability in autonomous vehicles. The evaluation is
conducted on the widely-used ETH/UCY dataset where the Average Displacement
Error (ADE) and the Final Displacement Error (FDE) are reported. To align with
requirements in real-world applications, modifications are made to the input
features of the initially proposed models. An ablation study is conducted to
examine the influence of the observed motion history on the prediction
performance, thereby establishing a better understanding of its impact.
Additionally, the inference time of each model is measured to evaluate the
scalability of each model when confronted with varying amounts of agents. The
results demonstrate that simple models remain competitive when generating
single trajectories, and certain features commonly thought of as useful have
little impact on the overall performance across different architectures. Based

financial data because they allow for asymmetric and extreme tail dependence.
We show that the copula implicit in the skew-t distribution of Azzalini and
Capitanio (2003) allows for a higher level of pairwise asymmetric dependence
than two popular alternative skew-t copulas. Estimation of this copula in high
dimensions is challenging, and we propose a fast and accurate Bayesian
variational inference (VI) approach to do so. The method uses a conditionally
Gaussian generative representation of the skew-t distribution to define an
augmented posterior that can be approximated accurately. A fast stochastic
gradient ascent algorithm is used to solve the variational optimization. The
new methodology is used to estimate copula models for intraday returns from
2017 to 2021 on 93 U.S. equities. The copula captures substantial heterogeneity
in asymmetric dependence over equity pairs, in addition to the variability in
pairwise correlations. We show that intraday predictive densities from the
skew-t copula are more accurate than from some other copula models, while
portfolio selection strategies based on the estimated pairwise tail
dependencies improve performance relative to the benchmark index.]]></summary>

builds upon it by introducing a new interpolation procedure in the numerical

However, updating a model can introduce compatibility issues when the behavior

decision thresholds, limiting their applicability in settings where models are

we propose a novel rank-based compatibility measure, $C^R$, and a new loss
function that aims to optimize discriminative performance while encouraging
good compatibility. Applied to a case study in mortality risk stratification
leveraging data from MIMIC, our approach yields more compatible models while
maintaining discriminative performance compared to existing model selection
techniques, with an increase in $C^R$ of $0.019$ ($95\%$ confidence interval:

Neural Networks (DNNs) for function approximation, has demonstrated
considerable success in numerous applications. However, its practicality in
addressing various real-world scenarios, characterized by diverse and
unpredictable dynamics, noisy signals, and large state and action spaces,
remains limited. This limitation stems from issues such as poor data
efficiency, limited generalization capabilities, a lack of safety guarantees,
and the absence of interpretability, among other factors. To overcome these
challenges and improve performance across these crucial metrics, one promising
avenue is to incorporate additional structural information about the problem
into the RL learning process. Various sub-fields of RL have proposed methods
for incorporating such inductive biases. We amalgamate these diverse
methodologies under a unified framework, shedding light on the role of
structure in the learning problem, and classify these methods into distinct
patterns of incorporating structure. By leveraging this comprehensive
framework, we provide valuable insights into the challenges of structured RL
and lay the groundwork for a design pattern perspective on RL research. This
novel perspective paves the way for future advancements and aids in developing

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The decentralized and privacy-preserving nature of federated learning (FL)
makes it vulnerable to backdoor attacks aiming to manipulate the behavior of
the resulting model on specific adversary-chosen inputs. However, most existing
defenses based on statistical differences take effect only against specific
attacks, especially when the malicious gradients are similar to benign ones or
the data are highly non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID). In
this paper, we revisit the distance-based defense methods and discover that i)
Euclidean distance becomes meaningless in high dimensions and ii) malicious
gradients with diverse characteristics cannot be identified by a single metric.
To this end, we present a simple yet effective defense strategy with
multi-metrics and dynamic weighting to identify backdoors adaptively.
Furthermore, our novel defense has no reliance on predefined assumptions over
attack settings or data distributions and little impact on benign performance.
To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct comprehensive

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent years, heterogeneous graph few-shot learning has been proposed to
address the label sparsity issue in heterogeneous graphs (HGs), which contain
various types of nodes and edges. The existing methods have achieved good
performance by transferring generalized knowledge extracted from rich-labeled
classes in source HG(s) to few-labeled classes in a target HG. However, these
methods only consider the single-heterogeneity scenario where the source and
target HGs share a fixed set of node/edge types, ignoring the more general
scenario of cross-heterogeneity, where each HG can have a different and
non-fixed set of node/edge types. To this end, we focus on the unexplored
cross-heterogeneity scenario and propose a novel model for Cross-heterogeneity
Graph Few-shot Learning, namely CGFL. In CGFL, we first extract meta-patterns
to capture heterogeneous information and propose a multi-view heterogeneous
graph neural network (MHGN) to learn meta-patterns across HGs. Then, we propose
a score module to measure the informativeness of labeled samples and determine
the transferability of each source HG. Finally, by integrating MHGN and the
score module into a meta-learning mechanism, CGFL can effectively transfer
generalized knowledge to predict new classes with few-labeled data. Extensive
experiments on four real-world datasets have demonstrated the superior
performance of CGFL over the state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper studies Byzantine-robust stochastic optimization over a
decentralized network, where every agent periodically communicates with its
neighbors to exchange local models, and then updates its own local model by
stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The performance of such a method is affected
by an unknown number of Byzantine agents, which conduct adversarially during
the optimization process. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing
work that simultaneously achieves a linear convergence speed and a small
learning error. We observe that the learning error is largely dependent on the
intrinsic stochastic gradient noise. Motivated by this observation, we
introduce two variance reduction methods, stochastic average gradient algorithm
(SAGA) and loopless stochastic variance-reduced gradient (LSVRG), to
Byzantine-robust decentralized stochastic optimization for eliminating the
negative effect of the stochastic gradient noise. The two resulting methods,
BRAVO-SAGA and BRAVO-LSVRG, enjoy both linear convergence speeds and stochastic
gradient noise-independent learning errors. Such learning errors are optimal
for a class of methods based on total variation (TV)-norm regularization and
stochastic subgradient update. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to
demonstrate their effectiveness under various Byzantine attacks.]]></summary>

weights for another neural network, known as the target network. They have
emerged as a powerful deep learning technique that allows for greater
flexibility, adaptability, dynamism, faster training, information sharing, and
model compression etc. Hypernets have shown promising results in a variety of
deep learning problems, including continual learning, causal inference,
transfer learning, weight pruning, uncertainty quantification, zero-shot
learning, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning etc. Despite
their success across different problem settings, currently, there is no review
available to inform the researchers about the developments and to help in
utilizing hypernets. To fill this gap, we review the progress in hypernets. We
present an illustrative example to train deep neural networks using hypernets
and propose categorizing hypernets based on five design criteria as inputs,
outputs, variability of inputs and outputs, and architecture of hypernets. We
also review applications of hypernets across different deep learning problem
settings, followed by a discussion of general scenarios where hypernets can be
effectively employed. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future directions
that remain under-explored in the field of hypernets. We believe that
hypernetworks have the potential to revolutionize the field of deep learning.
They offer a new way to design and train neural networks, and they have the
potential to improve the performance of deep learning models on a variety of
tasks. Through this review, we aim to inspire further advancements in deep
learning through hypernetworks.]]></summary>

of road infrastructure is critical for optimizing transportation systems,
enhancing road safety, and improving the overall mobility experience for
drivers and commuters. Yet, a formidable bottleneck obstructs progress - the
laborious and time-intensive manual identification of intersections. Simply
considering the shear number of intersections that need to be identified, and
the labor hours required per intersection, the need for an automated solution
becomes undeniable. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that
leverages connected vehicle data and cutting-edge deep learning techniques. By
employing geohashing to segment vehicle trajectories and then generating image
representations of road segments, we utilize the YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once
version 5) algorithm for accurate classification of both straight road segments
and intersections. Experimental results demonstrate an impressive overall
classification accuracy of 95%, with straight roads achieving a remarkable 97%
F1 score and intersections reaching a 90% F1 score. This approach not only
saves time and resources but also enables more frequent updates and a
comprehensive understanding of the road network. Our research showcases the
potential impact on traffic management, urban planning, and autonomous vehicle
navigation systems. The fusion of connected vehicle data and deep learning
models holds promise for a transformative shift in road infrastructure mapping,

devices necessitates efficient tools for transmitting large geometric data,
e.g., 3D meshes, over the Internet. Detailed high-resolution assets can pose a
challenge to storage as well as transmission bandwidth, and level-of-detail
techniques are often used to transmit an asset using an appropriate bandwidth
budget. It is especially desirable for these methods to transmit data
progressively, improving the quality of the geometry with more data. Our key
insight is that the geometric details of 3D meshes often exhibit similar local
patterns even across different shapes, and thus can be effectively represented
with a shared learned generative space. We learn this space using a
subdivision-based encoder-decoder architecture trained in advance on a large
collection of surfaces. We further observe that additional residual features
can be transmitted progressively between intermediate levels of subdivision
that enable the client to control the tradeoff between bandwidth cost and
quality of reconstruction, providing a neural progressive mesh representation.
We evaluate our method on a diverse set of complex 3D shapes and demonstrate
that it outperforms baselines in terms of compression ratio and reconstruction
quality.]]></summary>

systems. The increasing complexity of channel modelling and the cost of
collecting high-quality wireless channel data have become major challenges. In
this paper, we propose a diffusion model based channel sampling approach for
rapidly synthesizing channel realizations from limited data. We use a diffusion
model with a U Net based architecture operating in the frequency space domain.
To evaluate how well the proposed model reproduces the true distribution of
channels in the training dataset, two evaluation metrics are used: $i)$ the
approximate $2$-Wasserstein distance between real and generated distributions
of the normalized power spectrum in the antenna and frequency domains and $ii)$
precision and recall metric for distributions. We show that, compared to
existing GAN based approaches which suffer from mode collapse and unstable
training, our diffusion based approach trains stably and generates diverse and
high-fidelity samples from the true channel distribution. We also show that we
can pretrain the model on a simulated urban macro-cellular channel dataset and
fine-tune it on a smaller, out-of-distribution urban micro-cellular dataset,
therefore showing that it is feasible to model real world channels using
limited data with this approach.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This study proposes a hybrid deep-learning-metaheuristic framework with a
bi-level architecture for road network design problems (NDPs). We train a graph
neural network (GNN) to approximate the solution of the user equilibrium (UE)
traffic assignment problem and use inferences made by the trained model to
calculate fitness function evaluations of a genetic algorithm (GA) to
approximate solutions for NDPs. Using three test networks, two NDP variants and
an exact solver as benchmark, we show that on average, our proposed framework
can provide solutions within 1.5% gap of the best results in less than 0.5% of
the time used by the exact solution procedure. Our framework can be utilized
within an expert system for infrastructure planning to determine the best
infrastructure planning and management decisions under different scenarios.
Given the flexibility of the framework, it can easily be adapted to many other
decision problems that can be modeled as bi-level problems on graphs. Moreover,
we foreseen interesting future research directions, thus we also put forward a
brief research agenda for this topic. The key observation from our research
that can shape future research is that the fitness function evaluation time
using the inferences made by the GNN model was in the order of milliseconds,
which points to an opportunity and a need for novel heuristics that 1) can cope
well with noisy fitness function values provided by deep learning models, and
2) can use the significantly enlarged efficiency of the evaluation step to
explore the search space effectively (rather than efficiently). This opens a
new avenue for a modern class of metaheuristics that are crafted for use with
AI-powered predictors.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Counter-adversarial system design problems have lately motivated the
development of inverse Bayesian filters. For example, inverse Kalman filter
(I-KF) has been recently formulated to estimate the adversary's
Kalman-filter-tracked estimates and hence, predict the adversary's future
steps. The purpose of this paper and the companion paper (Part I) is to address
the inverse filtering problem in non-linear systems by proposing an inverse
extended Kalman filter (I-EKF). The companion paper proposed the theory of
I-EKF (with and without unknown inputs) and I-KF (with unknown inputs). In this
paper, we develop this theory for highly non-linear models, which employ
second-order, Gaussian sum, and dithered forward EKFs. In particular, we derive
theoretical stability guarantees for the inverse second-order EKF using the
bounded non-linearity approach. To address the limitation of the standard
I-EKFs that the system model and forward filter are perfectly known to the
defender, we propose reproducing kernel Hilbert space-based EKF to learn the
unknown system dynamics based on its observations, which can be employed as an
inverse filter to infer the adversary's estimate. Numerical experiments
demonstrate the state estimation performance of the proposed filters using
recursive Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound as a benchmark.]]></summary>

ensuring its safety cannot be overstated. A key concern in this regard is the
ability to identify whether a given sample is from the training distribution,
or is an "Out-Of-Distribution" (OOD) sample. In addition, adversaries can
manipulate OOD samples in ways that lead a classifier to make a confident
prediction. In this study, we present a novel approach for certifying the
robustness of OOD detection within a $\ell_2$-norm around the input, regardless
of network architecture and without the need for specific components or
additional training. Further, we improve current techniques for detecting
adversarial attacks on OOD samples, while providing high levels of certified
and adversarial robustness on in-distribution samples. The average of all OOD
detection metrics on CIFAR10/100 shows an increase of $\sim 13 \% / 5\%$
relative to previous approaches.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here, we show that the InfoNCE objective is equivalent to the ELBO in a new
class of probabilistic generative model, the recognition parameterised model
(RPM). When we learn the optimal prior, the RPM ELBO becomes equal to the
mutual information (MI; up to a constant), establishing a connection to
pre-existing self-supervised learning methods such as InfoNCE. However,
practical InfoNCE methods do not use the MI as an objective; the MI is
invariant to arbitrary invertible transformations, so using an MI objective can
lead to highly entangled representations (Tschannen et al., 2019). Instead, the
actual InfoNCE objective is a simplified lower bound on the MI which is loose
even in the infinite sample limit. Thus, an objective that works (i.e. the
actual InfoNCE objective) appears to be motivated as a loose bound on an
objective that does not work (i.e. the true MI which gives arbitrarily
entangled representations). We give an alternative motivation for the actual
InfoNCE objective. In particular, we show that in the infinite sample limit,
and for a particular choice of prior, the actual InfoNCE objective is equal to
the ELBO (up to a constant); and the ELBO is equal to the marginal likelihood
with a deterministic recognition model. Thus, we argue that our VAE perspective
gives a better motivation for InfoNCE than MI, as the actual InfoNCE objective
is only loosely bounded by the MI, but is equal to the ELBO/marginal likelihood
(up to a constant).]]></summary>

with a wide class of distributions and loss functions. The method includes the
use of exponential family distributions, as well as quasi-likelihood modeling

group-regularized optimization problem is studied. The added randomization
allows us to construct a post-selection likelihood which we show to be adequate
for selective inference when conditioning on the event of the selection of the
grouped covariates. This likelihood also provides a selective point estimator,
accounting for the selection by the group lasso. Confidence regions for the
regression parameters in the selected model take the form of Wald-type regions
and are shown to have bounded volume. The selective inference method for
grouped lasso is illustrated on data from the national health and nutrition

We then demonstrate how online learning techniques, which require no retraining
of models, can be used post-prediction to enhance the results. First, we show
that dynamic feature projection improves robustness by reducing drawdown in
regime changes. Second, we demonstrate that dynamical model ensembling based on
selection of models with good recent performance leads to improved Sharpe and
Calmar ratios of out-of-sample predictions. We also evaluate the robustness of
our pipeline across different data splits and random seeds with good

However, updating a model can introduce compatibility issues when the behavior

decision thresholds, limiting their applicability in settings where models are

we propose a novel rank-based compatibility measure, $C^R$, and a new loss
function that aims to optimize discriminative performance while encouraging
good compatibility. Applied to a case study in mortality risk stratification
leveraging data from MIMIC, our approach yields more compatible models while
maintaining discriminative performance compared to existing model selection
techniques, with an increase in $C^R$ of $0.019$ ($95\%$ confidence interval:

variables from the same set of features, improving predictive performance and
modeling accuracy relative to methods that handle each response variable
separately. Despite the potential of multi-task learning to yield more powerful
inference than single-task alternatives, prior work in this area has largely
omitted uncertainty quantification. Our focus in this paper is a common
multi-task problem in neuroimaging, where the goal is to understand the
relationship between multiple cognitive task scores (or other subject-level
assessments) and brain connectome data collected from imaging. We propose a
framework for selective inference to address this problem, with the flexibility
to: (i) jointly identify the relevant covariates for each task through a
sparsity-inducing penalty, and (ii) conduct valid inference in a model based on
the estimated sparsity structure. Our framework offers a new conditional
procedure for inference, based on a refinement of the selection event that
yields a tractable selection-adjusted likelihood. This gives an approximate
system of estimating equations for maximum likelihood inference, solvable via a
single convex optimization problem, and enables us to efficiently form
confidence intervals with approximately the correct coverage. Applied to both
simulated data and data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)
study, our selective inference methods yield tighter confidence intervals than
commonly used alternatives, such as data splitting. We also demonstrate through
simulations that multi-task learning with selective inference can more
accurately recover true signals than single-task methods.]]></summary>

directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with structural causal models (SCMs) to describe
the functional dependencies of effects on their causes. Possible
identifiability of SCMs given data depends on assumptions made on the noise
variables and the functional classes in the SCM. For instance, in the LiNGAM
model, the functional class is restricted to linear functions and the
disturbances have to be non-Gaussian.

In this work, we propose TSLiNGAM, a new method for identifying the DAG of a
causal model based on observational data. TSLiNGAM builds on DirectLiNGAM, a
popular algorithm which uses simple OLS regression for identifying causal
directions between variables. TSLiNGAM leverages the non-Gaussianity assumption
of the error terms in the LiNGAM model to obtain more efficient and robust
estimation of the causal structure. TSLiNGAM is justified theoretically and is
studied empirically in an extensive simulation study. It performs significantly
better on heavy-tailed and skewed data and demonstrates a high small-sample
efficiency. In addition, TSLiNGAM also shows better robustness properties as it
is more resilient to contamination.]]></summary>

approaches for Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO): Divergence-based and
Wasserstein-based methods. The divergence approach models misspecification in
terms of likelihood ratios, while the latter models it through a measure of
distance or cost in actual outcomes. Building upon these advances, this paper
introduces a novel approach that unifies these methods into a single framework
based on optimal transport (OT) with conditional moment constraints. Our
proposed approach, for example, makes it possible for optimal adversarial
distributions to simultaneously perturb likelihood and outcomes, while
producing an optimal (in an optimal transport sense) coupling between the
baseline model and the adversarial model.Additionally, the paper investigates
several duality results and presents tractable reformulations that enhance the
practical applicability of this unified framework.]]></summary>

the key functions in intelligent transportation system (ITS), traffic
evaluation always plays significant role nowadays, and daily traffic flow
prediction still faces challenges at network-wide toll stations. On the one
hand, the data imbalance in practice among various locations deteriorates the
performance of prediction. On the other hand, complex correlative
spatio-temporal factors cannot be comprehensively employed in long-term
duration. In this paper, a prediction method is proposed for daily traffic flow
in highway domain through spatio-temporal deep learning. In our method, data
normalization strategy is used to deal with data imbalance, due to long-tail
distribution of traffic flow at network-wide toll stations. And then, based on
graph convolutional network, we construct networks in distinct semantics to
capture spatio-temporal features. Beside that, meteorology and calendar
features are used by our model in the full connection stage to extra external
characteristics of traffic flow. By extensive experiments and case studies in
one Chinese provincial highway, our method shows clear improvement in
predictive accuracy than baselines and practical benefits in business.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep neural network (DNN) deployment has been confined to larger hardware
devices due to their expensive computational requirements. This challenge has
recently reached another scale with the emergence of large language models
(LLMs). In order to reduce both their memory footprint and latency, a promising
technique is quantization. It consists in converting floating point
representations to low bit-width fixed point representations, usually by
assuming a uniform mapping onto a regular grid. This process, referred to in
the literature as uniform quantization, may however be ill-suited as most DNN
weights and activations follow a bell-shaped distribution. This is even worse
on LLMs whose weight distributions are known to exhibit large, high impact,
outlier values. In this work, we propose an improvement over the most commonly
adopted way to tackle this limitation in deep learning models quantization,
namely, non-uniform quantization. NUPES leverages automorphisms to preserve the
scalar multiplications. Such transformations are derived from power functions.
However, the optimization of the exponent parameter and weight values remains a
challenging and novel problem which could not be solved with previous post
training optimization techniques which only learn to round up or down weight
values in order to preserve the predictive function. We circumvent this
limitation with a new paradigm: learning new quantized weights over the entire
quantized space. Similarly, we enable the optimization of the power exponent,
i.e. the optimization of the quantization operator itself during training by
alleviating all the numerical instabilities. The resulting predictive function
is compatible with integer-only low-bit inference. We show the ability of the
method to achieve state-of-the-art compression rates in both, data-free and
data-driven configurations.]]></summary>

systematically evaluate the auto-generated design RTL, we summarized three
progressive goals, named syntax goal, functionality goal, and design quality

biological processes of the ocean, which is the foundation for marine science
research and operational oceanography. Modern numerical ocean modeling mainly

coupling costs have gradually become the main bottlenecks for the further
development of numerical ocean modeling. Recently, artificial
intelligence-based modeling in scientific computing has shown revolutionary
potential for digital twins and scientific simulations, but the bottlenecks of
numerical ocean modeling have not been further solved. Here, we present
AI-GOMS, a large AI-driven global ocean modeling system, for accurate and

with the Fourier-based Masked Autoencoder structure for basic ocean variable
prediction and lightweight fine-tuning models incorporating regional
downscaling, wave decoding, and biochemistry coupling modules. AI-GOMS has
achieved the best performance in 30 days of prediction for the global ocean
basic variables with 15 depth layers at 1/4{\deg} spatial resolution. Beyond
the good performance in statistical metrics, AI-GOMS realizes the simulation of
mesoscale eddies in the Kuroshio region at 1/12{\deg} spatial resolution and
ocean stratification in the tropical Pacific Ocean. AI-GOMS provides a new

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this paper, we describe a new algorithm called Preferential Attachment
k-class Classifier (PreAttacK) for detecting fake accounts in a social network.
Recently, several algorithms have obtained high accuracy on this problem.
However, they have done so by relying on information about fake accounts'
friendships or the content they share with others--the very things we seek to
prevent.

PreAttacK represents a significant departure from these approaches. We
provide some of the first detailed distributional analyses of how new fake (and
real) accounts first attempt to request friends after joining a major network
(Facebook). We show that even before a new account has made friends or shared
content, these initial friend request behaviors evoke a natural multi-class
extension of the canonical Preferential Attachment model of social network
growth.

We use this model to derive a new algorithm, PreAttacK. We prove that in
relevant problem instances, PreAttacK near-optimally approximates the posterior
probability that a new account is fake under this multi-class Preferential
Attachment model of new accounts' (not-yet-answered) friend requests. These are
the first provable guarantees for fake account detection that apply to new
users, and that do not require strong homophily assumptions.

This principled approach also makes PreAttacK the only algorithm with
provable guarantees that obtains state-of-the-art performance on new users on
the global Facebook network, where it converges to AUC=0.9 after new users send
+ receive a total of just 20 not-yet-answered friend requests. For comparison,
state-of-the-art benchmarks do not obtain this AUC even after observing
additional data on new users' first 100 friend requests. Thus, unlike
mainstream algorithms, PreAttacK converges before the median new fake account
has made a single friendship (accepted friend request) with a human.]]></summary>

use cases, ranging from industrial automation to logistics and warehousing, to

restricted to concepts seen at training time and can be applied to novel
classes at inference time using text, images, or click queries. Leveraging rich
visual descriptors from large-scale pre-trained models (foundation models), FAn
can detect and segment objects by matching multimodal queries (text, images,
clicks) against an input image sequence. These detected and segmented objects
are tracked across image frames, all while accounting for occlusion and object
re-emergence. We demonstrate FAn on a real-world robotic system (a micro aerial

a real-time control loop. FAn can be deployed on a laptop with a lightweight

represented by ReLU DNNs with $L$ hidden layers and $N$ neurons per layer.
Subsequently, we demonstrate that this construction is optimal regarding the

the potential of diffusion models for generating realistic mixed-type tabular
EHRs, comparing TabDDPM model with existing methods on four datasets in terms

applications via nonstationary Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), and hence
gains considerable interest. However, theoretical studies on nonstationary MDPs
in the literature have mainly focused on tabular and linear (mixture) MDPs,
which do not capture the nature of unknown representation in deep RL. In this
paper, we make the first effort to investigate nonstationary RL under episodic
low-rank MDPs, where both transition kernels and rewards may vary over time,
and the low-rank model contains unknown representation in addition to the
linear state embedding function. We first propose a parameter-dependent policy
optimization algorithm called PORTAL, and further improve PORTAL to its
parameter-free version of Ada-PORTAL, which is able to tune its
hyper-parameters adaptively without any prior knowledge of nonstationarity. For
both algorithms, we provide upper bounds on the average dynamic suboptimality
gap, which show that as long as the nonstationarity is not significantly large,
PORTAL and Ada-PORTAL are sample-efficient and can achieve arbitrarily small
average dynamic suboptimality gap with polynomial sample complexity.]]></summary>

person and vehicle trips. However, traditional planning models often fail to
account for the intricacies and dynamics of travel behavior, leading to
less-than-optimal accuracy in these predictions. This study explores the
potential of deep learning techniques to transform the way we approach trip
predictions, and ultimately, transportation planning. Utilizing a comprehensive
dataset from the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS), we developed and
trained a deep learning model for predicting person and vehicle trips. The
proposed model leverages the vast amount of information in the NHTS data,
capturing complex, non-linear relationships that were previously overlooked by
traditional models. As a result, our deep learning model achieved an impressive
accuracy of 98% for person trip prediction and 96% for vehicle trip estimation.
This represents a significant improvement over the performances of traditional
transportation planning models, thereby demonstrating the power of deep
learning in this domain. The implications of this study extend beyond just more
accurate predictions. By enhancing the accuracy and reliability of trip
prediction models, planners can formulate more effective, data-driven
transportation policies, infrastructure, and services. As such, our research
underscores the need for the transportation planning field to embrace advanced
techniques like deep learning. The detailed methodology, along with a thorough
discussion of the results and their implications, are presented in the

source code. The prevailing approaches adopt transformer-based encoder-decoder
architectures, where the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the source code is
utilized for encoding structural information. However, ASTs are much longer
than the corresponding source code, and existing methods ignore this size
constraint by directly feeding the entire linearized AST into the encoders.
This simplistic approach makes it challenging to extract truly valuable
dependency relations from the overlong input sequence and leads to significant
computational overhead due to self-attention applied to all nodes in the AST.

To address this issue effectively and efficiently, we present a model,
AST-MHSA that uses multi-head attention to extract the important semantic
information from the AST. The model consists of two main components: an encoder
and a decoder. The encoder takes as input the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the
code and generates a sequence of hidden states. The decoder then takes these
hidden states as input and generates a natural language summary of the code.

The multi-head attention mechanism allows the model to learn different
representations of the input code, which can be combined to generate a more
comprehensive summary. The model is trained on a dataset of code and summaries,
and the parameters of the model are optimized to minimize the loss between the
generated summaries and the ground-truth summaries.]]></summary>

relies on their ability to provide accurate, stable predictions over long time
horizons, which is a notoriously hard problem. In this work, we present a
large-scale analysis of common temporal rollout strategies, identifying the
neglect of non-dominant spatial frequency information, often associated with
high frequencies in PDE solutions, as the primary pitfall limiting stable,

consistently outperform state-of-the-art models, including neural, numerical,

PDE-Refiner greatly enhances data efficiency, since the denoising objective
implicitly induces a novel form of spectral data augmentation. Finally,
PDE-Refiner's connection to diffusion models enables an accurate and efficient

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When applied to autonomous vehicle (AV) settings, action recognition can
enhance an environment model's situational awareness. This is especially
prevalent in scenarios where traditional geometric descriptions and heuristics
in AVs are insufficient. However, action recognition has traditionally been
studied for humans, and its limited adaptability to noisy, un-clipped,
un-pampered, raw RGB data has limited its application in other fields. To push
for the advancement and adoption of action recognition into AVs, this work
proposes a novel two-stage action recognition system, termed RALACs. RALACs
formulates the problem of action recognition for road scenes, and bridges the
gap between it and the established field of human action recognition. This work
shows how attention layers can be useful for encoding the relations across
agents, and stresses how such a scheme can be class-agnostic. Furthermore, to
address the dynamic nature of agents on the road, RALACs constructs a novel
approach to adapting Region of Interest (ROI) Alignment to agent tracks for
downstream action classification. Finally, our scheme also considers the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learning disentangled representations with variational autoencoders (VAEs) is
often attributed to the regularisation component of the loss. In this work, we
highlight the interaction between data and the reconstruction term of the loss
as the main contributor to disentanglement in VAEs. We show that standard
benchmark datasets have unintended correlations between their subjective
ground-truth factors and perceived axes in the data according to typical VAE
reconstruction losses. Our work exploits this relationship to provide a theory
for what constitutes an adversarial dataset under a given reconstruction loss.
We verify this by constructing an example dataset that prevents disentanglement
in state-of-the-art frameworks while maintaining human-intuitive ground-truth
factors. Finally, we re-enable disentanglement by designing an example
reconstruction loss that is once again able to perceive the ground-truth
factors. Our findings demonstrate the subjective nature of disentanglement and
the importance of considering the interaction between the ground-truth factors,
data and notably, the reconstruction loss, which is under-recognised in the
literature.]]></summary>

for the hierarchical extraction of features. Vision transformers (ViTs),
through the use of a self-attention mechanism, have recently achieved superior
modeling of global contextual information compared to CNNs. However, to realize
their image classification strength, ViTs require substantial training
datasets. Where the available training data are limited, current advanced
multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) can provide viable alternatives to both deep
CNNs and ViTs. In this paper, we developed the SGU-MLP, a learning algorithm
that effectively uses both MLPs and spatial gating units (SGUs) for precise
land use land cover (LULC) mapping. Results illustrated the superiority of the
developed SGU-MLP classification algorithm over several CNN and CNN-ViT-based
models, including HybridSN, ResNet, iFormer, EfficientFormer and CoAtNet. The
proposed SGU-MLP algorithm was tested through three experiments in Houston,
USA, Berlin, Germany and Augsburg, Germany. The SGU-MLP classification model
was found to consistently outperform the benchmark CNN and CNN-ViT-based
algorithms. For example, for the Houston experiment, SGU-MLP significantly
outperformed HybridSN, CoAtNet, Efficientformer, iFormer and ResNet by
approximately 15%, 19%, 20%, 21%, and 25%, respectively, in terms of average
accuracy. The code will be made publicly available at

unpredictable seizures, necessitating accurate prediction for effective
management and patient care. Application of machine learning (ML) on
electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, along with its ability to provide
valuable insights into brain activity during seizures, is able to make accurate
and robust seizure prediction an indispensable component in relevant studies.
In this research, we present a comprehensive comparative analysis of five
machine learning models - Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Extra Trees
(ET), Logistic Regression (LR), and Gradient Boosting (GB) - for the prediction
of epileptic seizures using EEG data. The dataset underwent meticulous
preprocessing, including cleaning, normalization, outlier handling, and
oversampling, ensuring data quality and facilitating accurate model training.
These preprocessing techniques played a crucial role in enhancing the models'
performance. The results of our analysis demonstrate the performance of each
model in terms of accuracy. The LR classifier achieved an accuracy of 56.95%,
while GB and DT both attained 97.17% accuracy. RT achieved a higher accuracy of
98.99%, while the ET model exhibited the best performance with an accuracy of
99.29%. Our findings reveal that the ET model outperformed not only the other

recurrent gate with addition and ReLU activation. This mechanism is designed to
maintain long-term memory for sequence processing but at a reduced
computational cost, thereby opening up for more efficient execution or larger
models on restricted hardware. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with gating
mechanisms such as LSTM and GRU have been widely successful in learning from
sequential data due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies.
Conventionally, the update based on current inputs and the previous state
history is each multiplied with dynamic weights and combined to compute the
next state. However, multiplication can be computationally expensive,
especially for certain hardware architectures or alternative arithmetic systems
such as homomorphic encryption. It is demonstrated that the novel gating
mechanism can capture long-term dependencies for a standard synthetic sequence
learning task while significantly reducing computational costs such that
execution time is reduced by half on CPU and by one-third under encryption.
Experimental results on handwritten text recognition tasks furthermore show
that the proposed architecture can be trained to achieve comparable accuracy to
conventional GRU and LSTM baselines. The gating mechanism introduced in this
paper may enable privacy-preserving AI applications operating under homomorphic
encryption by avoiding the multiplication of encrypted variables. It can also
support quantization in (unencrypted) plaintext applications, with the
potential for substantial performance gains since the addition-based
formulation can avoid the expansion to double precision often required for
multiplication.]]></summary>

traditionally involved using binary classifiers. These classifiers are trained
using behavioral data obtained from an interview setup. In this training
process, data from individuals with the specific disorder under consideration
are categorized as the positive class, while data from all other participants
constitute the negative class. In practice, it is widely recognized that
certain mental disorders share similar symptoms, causing the collected
behavioral data to encompass a variety of attributes associated with multiple
disorders. Consequently, attributes linked to the targeted mental disorder
might also be present within the negative class. This data impurity may lead to
sub-optimal training of the classifier for a mental disorder of interest. In
this study, we investigate this hypothesis in the context of major depressive
disorder (MDD) and post-traumatic stress disorder detection (PTSD). The results
show that upon removal of such data impurity, MDD and PTSD detection

extraction attacks, which focus on stealing the models by using specially

using part of the training data or a surrogate dataset to train a new model

however, the target models are trained on private datasets that are
inaccessible to the adversary. The data-free model extraction technique
replaces this problem when it comes to using queries artificially curated by a
generator similar to that used in Generative Adversarial Nets. We propose for
the first time, to the best of our knowledge, an adversary black box attack
extending to a regression problem for predicting bounding box coordinates in
object detection. As part of our study, we found that defining a loss function

classifiers such as gradient-boosting decision trees (GBDTs) against
adversarial perturbation attacks. The idea is based on a recent symmetry
defense for convolutional neural network classifiers (CNNs) that utilizes CNNs'
lack of invariance with respect to symmetries. CNNs lack invariance because
they can classify a symmetric sample, such as a horizontally flipped image,
differently from the original sample. CNNs' lack of invariance also means that
CNNs can classify symmetric adversarial samples differently from the incorrect
classification of adversarial samples. Using CNNs' lack of invariance, the
recent CNN symmetry defense has shown that the classification of symmetric
adversarial samples reverts to the correct sample classification. In order to
apply the same symmetry defense to GBDTs, we examine GBDT invariance and are
the first to show that GBDTs also lack invariance with respect to symmetries.
We apply and evaluate the GBDT symmetry defense for nine datasets against six
perturbation attacks with a threat model that ranges from zero-knowledge to
perfect-knowledge adversaries. Using the feature inversion symmetry against
zero-knowledge adversaries, we achieve up to 100% accuracy on adversarial
samples even when default and robust classifiers have 0% accuracy. Using the
feature inversion and horizontal flip symmetries against perfect-knowledge
adversaries, we achieve up to over 95% accuracy on adversarial samples for the

rooms with moving sources, which have applications in virtual/augmented
reality, game audio, and spatial computing. Solutions to the wave equation can
describe wave phenomena such as diffraction and interference. However,
simulating them using conventional numerical discretization methods with
hundreds of source and receiver positions is intractable, making stimulating a
sound field with moving sources impractical. To overcome this limitation, we
propose using deep operator networks to approximate linear wave-equation
operators. This enables the rapid prediction of sound propagation in realistic
3D acoustic scenes with moving sources, achieving millisecond-scale
computations. By learning a compact surrogate model, we avoid the offline
calculation and storage of impulse responses for all relevant source/listener
pairs. Our experiments, including various complex scene geometries, show good
agreement with reference solutions, with root mean squared errors ranging from
0.02 Pa to 0.10 Pa. Notably, our method signifies a paradigm shift as no prior
machine learning approach has achieved precise predictions of complete wave

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper demonstrates the utility of organized numerical representations of
genes in research involving flat string gene formats (i.e., FASTA/FASTQ5).
FASTA/FASTQ files have several current limitations, such as their large file
sizes, slow processing speeds for mapping and alignment, and contextual
dependencies. These challenges significantly hinder investigations and tasks
that involve finding similar sequences. The solution lies in transforming
sequences into an alternative representation that facilitates easier clustering
into similar groups compared to the raw sequences themselves. By assigning a
unique vector embedding to each short sequence, it is possible to more
efficiently cluster and improve upon compression performance for the string
representations of cDNA libraries. Furthermore, through learning alternative
coordinate vector embeddings based on the contexts of codon triplets, we can
demonstrate clustering based on amino acid properties. Finally, using this
sequence embedding method to encode barcodes and cDNA sequences, we can improve
the time complexity of the similarity search by coupling vector embeddings with
an algorithm that determines the proximity of vectors in Euclidean space; this
allows us to perform sequence similarity searches in a quicker and more modular
fashion.]]></summary>

its study would benefit greatly from multimodal approaches that combine data
from widely varying platforms, e.g., neuroimaging, genetics, and clinical
characterization. Prior neuroimaging-genetic analyses often apply naive feature
concatenation approaches in data-driven work or use the findings from one
modality to guide posthoc analysis of another, missing the opportunity to
analyze the paired multimodal data in a truly unified approach. In this paper,
we develop a more integrative model for combining genetic, demographic, and
neuroimaging data. Inspired by the influence of genotype on phenotype, we
propose using an attention-based approach where the genetic data guides
attention to neuroimaging features of importance for model prediction. The
genetic data is derived from copy number variation parameters, while the
neuroimaging data is from functional magnetic resonance imaging. We evaluate
the proposed approach on ASD classification and severity prediction tasks,
using a sex-balanced dataset of 228 ASD and typically developing subjects in a
10-fold cross-validation framework. We demonstrate that our attention-based
model combining genetic information, demographic data, and functional magnetic
resonance imaging results in superior prediction performance compared to other
multimodal approaches.]]></summary>

algorithm that reduces the cost of labelling pixel-level masks for complex
radio galaxies with multiple components. The algorithm is trained on weak
class-level labels of radio galaxies to get class activation maps (CAMs). The
CAMs are further refined using an inter-pixel relations network (IRNet) to get
instance segmentation masks over radio galaxies and the positions of their
infrared hosts. We use data from the Australian Square Kilometre Array
Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope, specifically the Evolutionary Map of the Universe
(EMU) Pilot Survey, which covered a sky area of 270 square degrees with an RMS
sensitivity of 25-35 $\mu$Jy/beam. We demonstrate that weakly-supervised deep
learning algorithms can achieve high accuracy in predicting pixel-level
information, including masks for the extended radio emission encapsulating all
galaxy components and the positions of the infrared host galaxies. We evaluate
the performance of our method using mean Average Precision (mAP) across
multiple classes at a standard intersection over union (IoU) threshold of 0.5.
We show that the model achieves a mAP$_{50}$ of 67.5\% and 76.8\% for radio
masks and infrared host positions, respectively. The network architecture can

influencing the onset and progression of a variety of diseases. Identification
of phosphorylation sites is thus an important step for understanding the
molecular mechanisms of cells and virus infection, which potentially leads to
new therapeutic targets. In this study, we present PTransIPs, a novel deep
learning model for the identification of phosphorylation sites. PTransIPs
treats amino acids in protein sequences as words in natural language,
extracting unique encodings based on the types along with position of amino
acids in the sequence. It also incorporates embeddings from large pre-trained
protein models as additional data inputs. PTransIPS is further trained on a
combination model of convolutional neural network with residual connections and
Transformer model equipped with multi-head attention mechanisms. At last, the
model outputs classification results through a fully connected layer. The
results of independent testing reveal that PTransIPs outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methodologies, achieving AUROCs of 0.9232 and 0.9660 for
identifying phosphorylated S/T and Y sites respectively. In addition, ablation
studies prove that pretrained model embeddings contribute to the performance of
PTransIPs. Furthermore, PTransIPs has interpretable amino acid preference,
visible training process and shows generalizability on other bioactivity
classification tasks. To facilitate usage, our code and data are publicly

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While many studies have assessed the fairness of AI algorithms in the medical
field, the causes of differences in prediction performance are often unknown.
This lack of knowledge about the causes of bias hampers the efficacy of bias
mitigation, as evidenced by the fact that simple dataset balancing still often
performs best in reducing performance gaps but is unable to resolve all
performance differences. In this work, we investigate the causes of gender bias
in machine learning-based chest X-ray diagnosis. In particular, we explore the
hypothesis that breast tissue leads to underexposure of the lungs and causes
lower model performance. Methodologically, we propose a new sampling method
which addresses the highly skewed distribution of recordings per patient in two
widely used public datasets, while at the same time reducing the impact of
label errors. Our comprehensive analysis of gender differences across diseases,
datasets, and gender representations in the training set shows that dataset
imbalance is not the sole cause of performance differences. Moreover, relative
group performance differs strongly between datasets, indicating important
dataset-specific factors influencing male/female group performance. Finally, we
investigate the effect of breast tissue more specifically, by cropping out the
breasts from recordings, finding that this does not resolve the observed
performance gaps. In conclusion, our results indicate that dataset-specific
factors, not fundamental physiological differences, are the main drivers of
male--female performance gaps in chest X-ray analyses on widely used NIH and
CheXpert Dataset.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent years, the field of data-driven neural network-based machine
learning (ML) algorithms has grown significantly and spurred research in its
applicability to instrumentation and control systems. While they are promising
in operational contexts, the trustworthiness of such algorithms is not
adequately assessed. Failures of ML-integrated systems are poorly understood;
the lack of comprehensive risk modeling can degrade the trustworthiness of
these systems. In recent reports by the National Institute for Standards and
Technology, trustworthiness in ML is a critical barrier to adoption and will
play a vital role in intelligent systems' safe and accountable operation. Thus,
in this work, we demonstrate a real-time model-agnostic method to evaluate the
relative reliability of ML predictions by incorporating out-of-distribution
detection on the training dataset. It is well documented that ML algorithms
excel at interpolation (or near-interpolation) tasks but significantly degrade
at extrapolation. This occurs when new samples are "far" from training samples.
The method, referred to as the Laplacian distributed decay for reliability
(LADDR), determines the difference between the operational and training
datasets, which is used to calculate a prediction's relative reliability. LADDR
is demonstrated on a feedforward neural network-based model used to predict
safety significant factors during different loss-of-flow transients. LADDR is
intended as a "data supervisor" and determines the appropriateness of
well-trained ML models in the context of operational conditions. Ultimately,
LADDR illustrates how training data can be used as evidence to support the
trustworthiness of ML predictions when utilized for conventional interpolation
tasks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently working through "Understanding Deep Learning" by Simon J.D. Prince. On page 403, he makes the following statement about regularization:
  
Another possible explanation for the ease with which models are trained is that regularization makes the loss surface flatter and more convex.
  
From my understanding, L2 regularization (or weight decay) indeed adds a convex term λ∣∣w∣∣2 to the loss function, smoothing it out. Additionally, the Hessian matrix becomes more positive with the addition of the regularization term 2λI, giving the function a more convex characteristic.
 However, I'm puzzled as to how other regularization methods like Dropout, L1/Lasso, or Early Stopping might lead to a similarly flatter and more convex loss surface. Can anyone offer insights or explanations on this?

However, even we are not actually updating the pretrained model, we still need to compute the graidients for backpropagation to the lower layer of the lora head. The memory usage of gradients would not decrease. Please correct me if I am wrong.

My intention is to experiment with significantly smaller models and datasets while retaining the same architecture. Unfortunately, neither repository offers an official configuration for training the txt2img architecture.Through my exploration of the issues, I've observed that the training script provided by the latent diffusion repository does support txt2img (although an official configuration has not been made available yet). I'm curious if any of you might be familiar with better online resources or tutorials that can provide a clearer and more comprehensive understanding of the training process.

 Github: https://github.com/OpenGVLab/Multi-Modality-Arena
 Abstract:
  
Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in tackling complex multimodal tasks. Among these cutting-edge developments, Google's Bard stands out for its remarkable multimodal capabilities, promoting comprehensive comprehension and reasoning across various domains. This work presents an early and holistic evaluation of LVLMs' multimodal abilities, with a particular focus on Bard, by proposing a lightweight variant of LVLM-eHub, named Tiny LVLM-eHub. In comparison to the vanilla version, Tiny LVLM-eHub possesses several appealing properties. Firstly, it provides a systematic assessment of six categories of multimodal capabilities, including visual perception, visual knowledge acquisition, visual reasoning, visual commonsense, object hallucination, and embodied intelligence, through quantitative evaluation of 42 standard text-related visual benchmarks. Secondly, it conducts an in-depth analysis of LVLMs' predictions using the ChatGPT Ensemble Evaluation (CEE), which leads to a robust and accurate evaluation and exhibits improved alignment with human evaluation compared to the word matching approach. Thirdly, it comprises a mere 2.1K image-text pairs, facilitating ease of use for practitioners to evaluate their own offline LVLMs. Through extensive experimental analysis, this study demonstrates that Bard outperforms previous LVLMs in most multimodal capabilities except object hallucination, to which Bard is still susceptible. Tiny LVLM-eHub serves as a baseline evaluation for various LVLMs and encourages innovative strategies aimed at advancing multimodal techniques.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have written a post discussion whether or not the hidden size in transformers is an overkill. 
 TLDR;
 I show that an embedding size of 2048 is too much to represent just one token like `is` but rather, it can encode an average 8 tokens with up-to 16 tokens almost losslessly. 
 I think if we can design more compute efficient transformers with some of the ideas that I explore in the post.
 Of course this is not a proper research with ablation studies and empirical analysis. But I would love to hear your thoughts on this topic.

When these executives present us with their project specifics, budgets, obstacles, and schedules, we take charge of finding the right partners for their RFP process, enhancing the entire workflow for efficiency and effectiveness. Currently, I have a collection of RFP projects and I’m keen on leveraging AI to simplify the task of identifying potential partners to call. I provided ChatGPT with all of my various project details and would inquire, ‘Which of my client projects align well with X company, and what are the reasons?’ OR “Would X company align with any of my projects?” The AI started off well, but eventually became confused and started making mistakes. Are there any systems available that could assist me in this project matching process?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Personal Shelf Inspector is an application that helps visually impaired people during their day-to-day shopping. The application is based on a simple neural network and was created as a part of the AI for Accesibility Hackathon in 2020 in Prague.
 We decided to build free tools that make shopping for visually impaired people more accessible. These tools can be implemented in any retail chain within the loyalty app or in-store.

 The Idea
 A visually impaired person only needs their smartphone to use our tools. Personal Shelf Inspector is a web application that reads the price and product name from a price tag. The algorithm selects the price tag closest to the centre of the photo and sends it to the model, which reads the price and product name on the price tag. Then it returns this information to the application, which appears as text on the screen.

 The voice-over built into the user's mobile phone reads this text aloud. The app also helps to read the banknote values and read from a live video.
 What could be other cool ideas and concepts to help making the world more accesible using AI and Machine Learning?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In "InstructBLIP" paper, authors say: "We transform 26 datasets into the instruction tuning format" in order to create a general-purpose vision language model via instruction tuning. However, they did not provide details on how they did this transformation. At a first glance, three ways come to mind:
  
They use ChatGPT/GPT-4 to automatically transform them.
 They define and code rules to automatically transform them.
 They manually transform them (highly improbable)
  
Someone knows the answer? Thank you so much

 Our implementation follows closely the author's one, and is very well documented, with a blog post to explain the details and differences between this version and Dreamer V2.
 Together with Dreamer, we also have Plan2Explore with Dreamer v1 and v2.
 Finally, we completed the integration with Diambra, so you can try your agents on new (funnier) benchmarks.
 Check it out and feel free to contribute. Every feedback is appreciated :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google and Universal Music are discussing licensing artists' voices and melodies to develop AI-generated songs fans can create and pay for, seeking to get ahead of the controversial "deepfake" music trend. Though some stars oppose their work being mimicked, artists could opt-in to receive royalties in a model akin to how YouTube now pays for user-generated content.
 For Google, AI music would boost its generative AI offerings against competitors. But significant ethical hurdles around consent and IP must still be addressed in developing a legitimate AI music market.

 A few questions I wanted to answer:
  
How does the inference speed (tokens/s) between these two configurations compare?
 How does the number of input tokens impact inference speed?
 How many input tokens can these machines handle before they start to hit OOM?
 How does 4-bit vs 8-bit quantization affect all of the above?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Autonomous robots deployed in the real world will need control policies that rapidly adapt to environmental changes. To this end, we propose AutoRobotics-Zero (ARZ), a method based on AutoML-Zero that discovers zero-shot adaptable policies from scratch. In contrast to neural network adaption policies, where only model parameters are optimized, ARZ can build control algorithms with the full expressive power of a linear register machine. We evolve modular policies that tune their model parameters and alter their inference algorithm on-the-fly to adapt to sudden environmental changes. We demonstrate our method on a realistic simulated quadruped robot, for which we evolve safe control policies that avoid falling when individual limbs suddenly break. This is a challenging task in which two popular neural network baselines fail. Finally, we conduct a detailed analysis of our method on a novel and challenging non-stationary control task dubbed Cataclysmic Cartpole. Results confirm our findings that ARZ is significantly more robust to sudden environmental changes and can build simple, interpretable control policies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Machine perception uses advanced sensors to collect information about the surrounding scene for situational awareness. State-of-the-art machine perception using active sonar, radar, and LiDAR to enhance camera vision faces difficulties when the number of intelligent agents scales up. Exploiting omnipresent heat signals could be a new frontier for scalable perception. However, objects and their environment constantly emit and scatter thermal radiation, leading to textureless images famously known as the ‘ghosting effect’. Thermal vision thus has no specificity limited by information loss, whereas thermal ranging—crucial for navigation—has been elusive even when combined with artificial intelligence (AI). Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate heat-assisted detection and ranging (HADAR) overcoming this open challenge of ghosting and benchmark it against AI-enhanced thermal sensing. HADAR not only sees texture and depth through the darkness as if it were day but also perceives decluttered physical attributes beyond RGB or thermal vision, paving the way to fully passive and physics-aware machine perception. We develop HADAR estimation theory and address its photonic shot-noise limits depicting information-theoretic bounds to HADAR-based AI performance. HADAR ranging at night beats thermal ranging and shows an accuracy comparable with RGB stereovision in daylight. Our automated HADAR thermography reaches the Cramér–Rao bound on temperature accuracy, beating existing thermography techniques. Our work leads to a disruptive technology that can accelerate the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) with HADAR-based autonomous navigation and human–robot social interactions.

 I am looking to spearhead the impending transition of understanding AI/ML at my organization and am looking for community suggestions in courses and bootcamps that could provide a deeper knowledge for some of my work projects in the future. Specifically, I feel unequipped in how to properly test and validate models. 
 I have a computer science background with strong skills in data analytics and programming. I’ve also taken several introductory courses at a high level for AI. 
 Does anyone have suggestions or experiences for 1-4 week long bootcamps or intensive courses? I prefer in-person (anywhere in US) but would also consider live-online remote courses. Price is not a concern.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm basically trying to create an object detection system that learns the more objects it sees. My problem is that object detection requires actualy objects that the AI will be able to put into a certain category to identify the object.
 I want to make an AI that is able to find out that there is an object, but it shouldnt need to know what the object is. I want the AI to be able to find objects in an image in realtime without needing to know what the object is. It's supposed to grasp the concept of what an object is. Are there any methods or datasets that would make something like this possible?

 Now there is an opportunity to work on newer topics like data generation, dataset curation or even ML based Fusion. Nevertheless I also got the opportunity to do SLAM and it excites me a lot because of the many things involved in it and the possibility to use parallelization and so on. What could be a nice strategy here in your opinion and why? I thank you all!

The particular issue revolves around a dynamic action space, where the set of potential actions available changes based on the context or state. In light of this, I am seeking guidance on the feasibility of utilizing the Deep Q-Network (DQN) approach to specifically identify permissible actions for distinct states.
 Furthermore, if the DQN approach is not applicable in this scenario, I would appreciate recommendations for alternative algorithms that could effectively address this issue. Additionally, I am considering the option of designing a single action space and employing negative reward to discourage the agent from pursuing unauthorized actions within specific states.

 Studying Large Language Model Generalization with Influence Functions
 When trying to gain better visibility into a machine learning model in order to understand and mitigate the associated risks, a potentially valuable source of evidence is: which training examples most contribute to a given behavior? Influence functions aim to answer a counterfactual: how would the model's parameters (and hence its outputs) change if a given sequence were added to the training set? While influence functions have produced insights for small models, they are difficult to scale to large language models (LLMs) due to the difficulty of computing an inverse-Hessian-vector product (IHVP). We use the Eigenvalue-corrected Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (EK-FAC) approximation to scale influence functions up to LLMs with up to 52 billion parameters. In our experiments, EK-FAC achieves similar accuracy to traditional influence function estimators despite the IHVP computation being orders of magnitude faster. We investigate two algorithmic techniques to reduce the cost of computing gradients of candidate training sequences: TF-IDF filtering and query batching. We use influence functions to investigate the generalization patterns of LLMs, including the sparsity of the influence patterns, increasing abstraction with scale, math and programming abilities, cross-lingual generalization, and role-playing behavior. Despite many apparently sophisticated forms of generalization, we identify a surprising limitation: influences decay to near-zero when the order of key phrases is flipped. Overall, influence functions give us a powerful new tool for studying the generalization properties of LLMs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There have been many LLM inference solutions since the bloom of open-source LLMs. Most of the performant inference solutions are based on CUDA and optimized for NVIDIA GPUs. In the meantime, with the high demand for compute availability, it is useful to bring support to a broader class of hardware accelerators. AMD is one potential candidate.
 We build a project that makes it possible to compile LLMs and deploy them on AMD GPUs using ROCm and get competitive performance. More specifically, AMD Radeon™ RX 7900 XTX gives 80% of the speed of NVIDIA® GeForce RTX™ 4090 and 94% of the speed of NVIDIA® GeForce RTX™ 3090Ti for single batch Llama2-7B/13B 4bit inference. Besides ROCm, our Vulkan support allows us to generalize LLM deployment to other AMD devices, for example, a SteamDeck with an AMD APU.

The environment looks like a 3D Grid of cubic 3D tiles or modules, and the agent can place tiles by choosing : Location (As x,y,z coordinates) , rotation (0 to 4 as multiples of 90 degrees around a z axis in the center) , and Tile Type (Im experimenting with many sets of tiles with different sizes). Then, I use Grasshopper3D to analyze the radiation that the interior surfaces and other metrics, that i use for my reward calculation. 
 For this, the state of the environment is defined as a 3D Array with 2 channels. One for the Tile Types and one for the rotations. This is processed by a 3D CNN features extractor. 
 The thing is that, I just realized that the array that represents the tile types as integers is actually categorical data, and I don't know how well this could work in a CNN. What i mean by this is that a tile=3 is not any more "anything" that a tile=1, it is just different. 
 Am I doing something stupid then? Should i change it?
 I apologize if im saying something really dumb. I just got into RL few months ago : - )

 Would you say a PhD in the intersection of embedded systems + machine learning (maybe training a model "on the edge" with the sensor data of the embedded device) is beneficial regarding finding a job afterwards?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've become interested in how LLMs express emotions through their responses. Here's an example:
 [Q] = I am having a bad day
 [R] = I'm sorry to hear that you're having a bad day. Is there anything specific you'd like to talk about or any way I can help you feel better? Whether it's just a listening ear... 
 I am aware that LLMs are not conscious and have no real understanding of emotions. But it is clear from the example that they can produce emotionally appropriate responses. Is there some kind of systematic test that can be automated to verify this? I.e. given a text-based query and response determine if the response is empathetic.

Also noticed with Google and Bing they will give you the same results over and over (I assume I should have used “no repeats”) Google also will show me sold out items or items that aren’t actually on sale.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're creating voice-enabled products, I hope this will help you choose which model to use!
 I read the papers and docs for Bark and Tortoise TTS - two text-to-speech models that seemed pretty similar on the surface but are actually pretty different.
 Here's what Bark can do:
  
It can synthesize natural, human-like speech in multiple languages.
 Bark can also generate music, sound effects, and other audio.
 The model supports generating laughs, sighs, and other non-verbal sounds to make speech more natural and human-sounding. I find these really compelling and these imperfections make the speech sound much more real. Check out an example here (scroll down to "pizza.webm").
 Bark allows control over tone, pitch, speaker identity and other attributes through text prompts. 
 The model learns directly from text-audio pairs.
  
Whereas for Tortoise TTS:
  
It excels at cloning voices using just short audio samples of a target speaker. This makes it easy to produce text in many distinct voices (like celebrities). I think voice cloning is the best use case for this tool.
 The quality of the synthesized voices is pretty high.
 Tortoise supports fine-grained control of speech characteristics like tone, emotion, pacing, etc through priming text.
 Tortoise is only trained on English and it's not capable of producing sound effects.
  
Here's how they compare to the other speech-related models I've taken a look at so far:
  
 Model Best Use Cases Key Strengths 
  
 Bark Voice assistants, audio generation Flexibility, multilingual 
  Tortoise TTS Audiobooks, voice cloning Natural prosody, voice cloning 
  AudioLDM (full guide) Voice assistants High-quality speech and SFX 
  Whisper Transcription Accuracy, flexibility 
  Free VC Voice conversion Retains speech style 
 
 I have a full write-up here if you want to read more, it's about a 10-minute read. I also looked at the model inputs and outputs and speculated on some products you can build with each tool.

 I have to compile a list of 15-20 papers, to systematically go from "what's a transformer" to bleeding edge research of multimodal and LLMs applications to robotics, dynamical systems, and RL (e.g. RT-2). The base assumption is that the reader will be a master student, who already has the basics of what deep learning and control theory are.
 Could you suggest possible cornerstone papers that could go in this list? If you could, this would guide my search a lot, and I would appreciate it.

Script being a generic formula that is taught to script writers the same way as music theory cheat sheet helps aspiring musicians to write songs. 
 Script. Script can be turned into machine readable format. You can add commands how to render a movie on the basis of it. For example in a script you could have #Jack, telling the thing reading the script that we are talking of actor #Jack meaning it should tap into assets about jack which would reside in folder Jack. Jack meanwhile could be rendered by sub ai to fit the part. 
 That helps us nail down the character so it wont be changing appearance wise in our script.

I am trying to check how Visual Transformer (ViT) will perform on this task, but due to lack of pooling in ViT, model size is considerably large (~10M parameters). Do ViT have anything equivalent to pooling to reduce number of parameters?
 If not then that reduces applicability of ViT to large models on large dataset dataset only. For smaller tasks with small dataset, CNN or Resnet are way more computation efficient.
 Or am I missing something?

 Hi everyone!
 I want to share some interesting observations that indicate a very simple periodical weights resetting procedure could serve as an implicit regularization strategy for training DL models. This technique also shows potential connection with the Double Descent phenomenon. Here's the link to github etc: https://github.com/amcircle/weights-reset.
 As a co-author of this study, I must apologize in advance for its brevity. However, I sincerely hope it may prove useful to some. I would gladly respond to your queries and receive your criticism. Your personal experiences related to something similar would also be highly appreciated.

 However, I am curious to know if any text encodings are used during the training process as well. Is there any preview of the training datasets that is available which is used in the training process ? or a code snippet that points out to the forward part of the training loop

 There has been a lot of work on benchmarking autoregressive LLMs, such as HF LLM Leaderboard, but I have not seen much work specifically on the relevancy of such LLMs for retrieval. 
 There is a lot of talk about chat based on knowledge with solutions like llama_index, where LLMs both provide embeddings and answer based on most similar content, but embedding and answer generation need not be the same LLM.
 I saw the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) but it does not seem to contain a lot of information about the recent autoregressive LLMs. 
 Are the recent autoregressive LLMs, e.g. Llama 2, actually performing better than Bidirectional LLMs such as BERT? 
 Because if so, all the recent fancy chat with your documents projects could use much smaller models to do embedding extraction for retrieval and just call a fancy autoregressive LLM such as GPT4 for answer synthesis.

For example the values of the x,y axis and their labels, weather the chart is increasing or decreasing. 
 I've worked with image captioning models such as BLIP before as I have used them in projects involving stable diffusion, but this model doesn't give specifics about the information in the graph, just a brief overview. 
 I know researches have worked on this problem in the past using the vistext dataset: 
 https://news.mit.edu/2023/researchers-chart-captions-ai-vistext-0630
 So far I'm thinking that it may come to me finetuning BLIP or equivalent to specialize on infographics instead. 
 Thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi - I have trained a pytorch model that does some fairly simple object classification - The goal is distribute it as part of an app, that will pull information from a user's video.
 The videos are typically ~25-30 minutes and about 1GB in size, only a 600x600px square on the bottom right of the video is needed for the classification (it's a minimap in a video game)
 The app is electron based
 Ideally I want to input a video, and extract the labels from the cropped section once per second.
 ​
 My current attempt involves converting the model to a tensorflowjs model, and rendering the video on a <canvas> element, stretching it so only the minimap is visible on the canvas, running the model, saving the labels, and increasing the current time of the video by 1 second, and repeating until the video is done.
 ​
 This seems like a terrible plan, but it's much better than the couple of other ideas I've tried (using ffmpeg to extract a frame every second for example)
 ​
 Any advice appreciated!
 ​
 Edit: just to clarify this will only ever be ran on Windows

 I'm excited to share a project I've been working on over the past few months!
 My primary goal is to create a service that will be beneficial for people. Please share your thoughts on this idea, and suggest any new features you think I should implement!
 Exciting Features:
 • Speak to Write: with this feature, you can speak your thoughts or information and the tool will transcribe it into text. The best part? You can then forward the transcribed text to any application with just one click.
 • Audio to Action Plan: the service can transform a received audio message into a structured list of elements or bullet points. This feature is especially useful for outlining an action plan or item list.
 • Speak in and Language: you can dictate an audio message in your native language, and the service will translate it into any other language, maintaining high translation quality—significantly better than Google Translate.
 • Meeting Transcripts & Summaries: the service is perfect for converting recorded audio from meetings into text and generating concise summaries. It supports the upload of users' files.
 Thank you for taking the time to check it out. I look forward to hearing your feedback. You can access the service by visiting this link: https://audionotes.ai

 In Dyna-Q (image) (which is btw described to be the same as Q-learning when the planning portion is deleted), there doesn't seem to be any iteration over the states of an episode. It just picks a state, applies the e-greedy policy on it to choose the action, learns, updates the model, then plans.
 Would Q-learning also work fine if we got rid of the "episodes" and just picked isolated state-action pairs?

I'm sure some people would rather that not being a feature (if they use it at all), but I'd love for it to have some more comedic one-liners, possible news updates, and potentially traffic updates based on location and if it knows you're driving. Would be awesome! 
 It's also a really good tool for if you want to listen to music you've not heard before. Whether it's part of your usual genre or not.

 Art, to me, is getting what is inside your head, and presenting it to others outside of your consciousness and thoughts. It's showing the world a piece of your interpretation, your experience, your impressions of the world you inhabit. It's about communicating to others your emotions, your ideas, your thoughts and feelings.
 Not everyone can draw, or paint, or sculpt. I could say "learn it, it's easy", but that would be a lie. It isn't easy. It is years upon years of constant, hard work, requiring focus and dedication, and a passion for l…]]></summary>

 Very interesting blog post from OpenCV.ai team about how can explore ChatGPT to serve for code development debugging.
 Introduction from the article:
 As programmers, we often work with familiar development environments, but occasionally we encounter new tools that can be time-consuming and challenging to learn. In such situations, having virtual assistance can be extremely beneficial.
 In this article, I will share my experience of contributing to OpenCV, a renowned open-source library, despite having limited knowledge of C++ and understanding its architecture. I achieved this with the assistance of ChatGPT, a Large Language Model (LLM).
 I hope you can find it interesting. More details are here.

 I'm a software engineer passionate about AI, and recently I've been experimenting with making my first AI game. 
 In the game, you try to negotiate a price down on a watch with an AI-driven salesman, rewarding -or roasting lol- you depending on your bargaining skills.
 I’d be more than happy to get your thoughts and feedback on this idea, it's the first application I've built using AI so any tips would be much appreciated! 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At first, with InstructGPT and ChatGPT, it looked like RLHF was the holy grail to successfully finetune LLMs on human preferences. Then, from May 2023 onwards, a trend of doing just SFT with high-quality data showed up (e.g. "LIMA: Less Is More for Alignment" https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11206) as an alternative to doing RLHF.
 What's your opinion on these two narratives? Is RLHF likely to still be relevant even in the presence of SFT with high-quality data?

 I am currently already working in the field of ML research at a big name medical research center. Our main focus is in application of ML methods with the focus on stroke diagnostics and treatment.
 Now, I am quite happy working here but my background is somewhat interdisciplinary. I have a bachelor's in Life science and a Master in bioinformatics. Because of this I always feel like I have to catch up to my colleagues when it comes to ML and in parts also computer science knowledge. It feels like there are a million things to learn and many small details to know that I am not even sure how to look up.
 I am curious what your experience has been if you were/are in a similar situation? How did you manage to catch up?

 This paper aims to provide an in-depth explanation of representing and propagating wavefunctions in a hierarchical manner using Gaussian basis functions. Wavefunctions are mathematical descriptions of the quantum states of physical systems and are fundamental to quantum mechanics. However, representing complex wavefunctions for real-world quantum systems remains a key challenge. This paper proposes using multiple layers of Gaussian basis functions, with trainable amplitudes, to represent wavefunctions in a hierarchical fashion and enable wavefunction propagation between layers.
 Understanding wavefunction representation and propagation has significant implications in diverse fields like quantum computing, quantum chemistry, and materials science. Efficient wavefunction man…]]></summary>

 I’ve read literally everything possible, admittedly not much outside of WizardLM and GeorgiaTech, but I’ve read it.
 I was hoping to discuss it here with smarter people. 
 I’m seeing this as a way to use LLMs to generate great datasets. However, my use case doesn’t really exist in any models yet. Not thoroughly enough to produce a good Evol-Instruct set. So, I’m going to do that tomorrow.
 I’m going to use The Blokes WizardCoder-Guanaco 15b GPTQ version to train on my specific dataset - about 10GB of clean, really strong data I’ve spent 3-4 weeks putting together.
 In theory, I’ll use the Evol-Instruct script from WizardLM to generate the new dataset, and then I’ll apply that to whatever model I decide to use. There is a good chance I train my own on general Evol-Instruct datasets available now, and likely quite a large one.
 I’m looking for any tips, discussion, ideas, thoughts from the community. 
 Cheers!

 There is a huge book that contains a storyboard version of the movie with lots of production art by artists Moebius, Chris Foss and HR Giger.
 The movie was to star Jodorowsky's son as Paul Atriedes, Salvadore Dali as the Emperor, Orson Wells as Baron Harkonnen and Mick Jagger as Feyd.
 Could one of today's AIs be 'fed' Jodorowsky's book and create a movie of his vision?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, all,
 I would like to use batch reaction trend data to build a regression model. I'm wondering what is the best way to approach this.
 Here's some background:
 Reaction Data: 
  
 Time (min) Pressure (bar) Temperature (°C) Flow (kg/h) Gas Total (kg) 
  
 1 10 70 502 8 
  2 10.1 71 498 16 
  ... ... ... ... ... 
  102 10.3 76 475 850 
 
 Output: Polymer property X
 The reaction continues until a gas total is met and the time this takes depends on the other variables.
 I have ~700 batches of data in a format similar to the above and would like to predict polymer property X. As the variables can change minute to minute I was thinking of binning the variables into 5 minute bins using the mean and using these as variables for linear regression or similar.
 Is this a valid approach or is there another way I can approach the problem?
 Thanks!

You can check how well the code was documented in the wayback machine. Recently, they removed the code base from the github and launched a pro version with selected companies as beta. The original repo (now called capsa-lite) was a great learning tool that I wanted to use. This was a quick way to try out different methods of uncertainty prediction using minimal code.

Additionally, I'm curious about the compatibility of the case and motherboard for effective air cooling ( not considering water cooling at the moment). Anyone else with dual 3090s who can give some insights on how they've managed temperatures and potential overheating issues?

 I'm about to graduate in Physics (PhD). I am an experimentalist with a background in electromagnetic. I am trying to apply for jobs, but there are some few options for physicists (based on my geography). So, I am trying to learn some new skill for my future job. One option would be Machine Learning, which is on-demand and the field is growing. The other option is Quantum Computing. I can start a postdoc in quantum information theory as well.
 Each path, has its pros and cons, and the final decision is based on many factors. I just don't have enough data and information to say which one is more secure in the future? Which one has less compete? And also, is it possible to get hired without any serious project in ML, and just self-taught?
 If you were me, which one would you pick?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 I'm looking apply to some top masters for machine learning in the UK, so I'm guessing you know which one I'm referring to. 
 I got some guidance from the application advisor, which state they like to look at the transcript the most to have an idea of my linear algebra, calculus and statistics ability. I got 70% in "Maths for Computer Science" and some other modules I strong first and 2:1 in some others, but in general my course wasn't too mathematically intensive. I did BSc Computer Science. I have been working as SWE the past 3 years. 
 I have completed the following specialisation "Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science Specialization" and read "Mathematics for Machine Learning", as learning about mathematics actually got me into ML. I have also covered the videos on 3Blue1Brown etc. The application advisor said that certs don't really mean too much which is understandable. I can't change the past in terms of BSc transcript, therefore I was thinking a project may be a good way to showcase this.
 Any tips on how to best showcase this or get across my ability would be extremely helpful?

 I've been trying to build an ML workstation and was considering the idea of using two RTX 3090's to get the extra VRAM instead of a single 4090. However, I've come across some confusion regarding whether they can share their VRAM or not. Do I need to run them via NVLink to achieve this? I believe PyTorch's data parallelism splits the batches across both GPUs, but that wouldn't effectively combine their VRAM right?
 Any advice or insights you can share on the topic would be highly appreciated!

 The images I’m trying to use are just absolutely horrible and not fixable, or I am just not using the best programs for my purposes. Or the programs I’m looking for simply do not exist yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks.
 I am sure you know the running gags around “thin OpenAI wrapper” products. Instead of more toy products, I am doing an experiment with some “AI engineering” to come up with a solution that’s closer to being usable in actual production cases.
 My background is in project management and data engineering, and I’ve built large systems for big companies and worked as a consultant in the space.
 I’ve seen enough crappy data pipelines for a lifetime.
 Hence.
 I want to do something different: A thin AI wrapper is not sufficient for having reliable data pipelines that use OpenAI for schema management and inference
 So this leaves me with the following doubts:
 ​
  
How to scale code horizontally and vertically? Using third-party solutions? SNS/SQS/Kafka?
 How to log and trace? Langsmith? Custom solutions?
 How to extend reliably with my own data, and make it stateful?
  
Looking for your perspective
 ​
  
What do you think about the state of data engineering, MLOps, and infrastructure in AI companies?
 What do you think about how to scale properly the systems and prepare them for the future?
 In this code here, I do process some PDFs as a simple pipeline, what approaches do you think could be better?
  
My current thinking and the state of the project
 ​
  
I should create a formal scale of usability. I am looking for your input here.
 I should improve model consistency, extends the model with custom domain knowledge, and make an early attempt to build simple user agents in the domain
 What I have is a schema inference, contracting basics, and a way to structure unstructured data
 I’m about to create a memory component that manages the data stored in vector dbs, as a DWH for AI
 If I bring this use case that was not something available easily to the public before, how best do it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[humanscript is an inferpreter. A script interpreter that infers commands from natural language using AI. There is no predefined syntax, humanscripts just say what they want to happen, and when you execute them, it happens.
 https://github.com/lukechilds/humanscript
 This is a humanscript called tidy-screenshots. It takes an unorganised directory of screenshots and organises them into directories based on the month the screenshot was taken.It can be executed like any other script.
 https://preview.redd.it/2b0oz2kgwogb1.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=9285805a1d0668ae5fe300857f9b67161b8ecda4
 The LLM inferpreted the humanscript into the following bash script at runtime.
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/x8hwdrzhwogb1.png?width=2188&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fcba87a9606a446d169e8ae37b5c8c251525e5e
 The code is streamed out of the LLM during inferpretation and executed line by line so execution is not blocked waiting for inference to finish. The generated code is cached on first run and will be executed instantly on subsequent runs, bypassing the need for reinferpretation.
 ​
 https://i.redd.it/t6b1stbkwogb1.gif
 The humanscript inferpreter supports a wide range of LLM backends. It can be used with cloud hosted LLMs like OpenAI's GTP-3.5 and GPT-4 or locally running open source LLMs like Llama 2.
 You can run humanscript in a sandboxed Docker environment with a single command if you want to have a play.

I'm a newbie and making my project on machine learning and the aim is create a programme to recognise a spice by feeding some chemical constituents, but I can't find appropriate dataset for it. I have been searching for months, and now I'm a bit desperate, so I'm asking anyone interested for help... I know maybe it was a mistake to choose exactly this topic, but I can't drop the project.

Prior to the pandemic, we both worked full-time in careers that we loved and found meaningful, and we sent our daughter to a full-day Montessori school. Although I struggled with significant health issues, I felt unbelievably lucky and fulfilled in both my family life and my professional life. The pandemic upended my careful balance. Every family is different, with different needs, circumstances, and constraints, and what works for one may not work for others. My intention here is primarily to share the journey of my own (very privileged) family.
