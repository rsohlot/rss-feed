 My name is William and I’m one of the founders of Sweep.
 Sweep is an AI junior developer that writes and fixes code by mirroring how a developer works.
 While building Sweep, we used to use the Github API, but we ran into rate limits, so we changed this to clone your repository for the duration of the request.
 It's now coming full circle. Sweep can now write, run, and debug a failing unit test for the ClonedRepo class!

The chip uses a two-dimensional array of memory blocks and interconnected CPUs to process data quickly.
 
However, it can only run specialized AI processes and not training processes or large language models.
 
The researchers plan to test connecting multiple NorthPole chips together to overcome this limitation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So essentially what the title says. I want to truly understand whats happening behind Machine Learning in general and also behind each algorithm specifically (starting from the basics to more advanced things, like Logistic Regression, Decisions trees and random forests, Deep Learning, NLP, GANS...). 
 By structured I mean it contains all the pieces ordered and organized, from the same source, so you can can actually go from the building blocks up, not just a YouTune channel that uploads interesting videos about different machine learning related topics.
 Regarding the medium, I don't really mind but I would prefer audiovisual content (YT channel/playlists, Lectures, conferences...) but if you really recommend a specific book or series of books that's also okay.
 If it has some practical focus to it (to better grasp the theory) that would great. Also, I would prefer if it goes deep into the details, but not too deep into the specific maths involved, but if it's the case thats also okay. 
 Regarding price, obviously if it's free that would be awesome, but in the range of free to 40€ is fine.
 Thank you for your recommendations in advance!!

 Hello community!
 I have been messing around with open source LLM's running them locally using peft and AutoGPTQ in Transformers. I even trained a few QLora models (my favorite part)
 However my question is this, given the performance of a 4bit model why hasn't there been any research in this area? Is it possible to even create a new model using 4bit altogether? I am sure it's not as easy as it sounds but I haven't seen anyone try. Just curious cause it will open doors for many of us with consumer grade hardware. 
 Thanks!

 Why doesn't something like this already exist? I am learning how to do differential diagnosis now and it seems use extremely rudimentary understanding of probability to diagnose things. You use clusters of symptoms and then use tests to eliminate stuff in the differential. It just seems like low hanging fruit that a program could do using tech we already have (I imagine LLMs will make it easier)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Researchers from Yonsei University and UC Berkeley recently developed a new AI method for enabling autonomous robots to navigate unfamiliar environments filled with obstacles using only visual data as input.
 The key innovation is a customized diffusion model. Diffusion models can generate diverse motion plans by adding controlled noise. The researchers tailored the model to mimic how heat avoids insulation when dispersing through space. 
 Similar to heat navigating around insulators, this "collision-avoiding" diffusion model learns to predict robot motions that avoid collisions with obstacles. It generates reachable goals and viable motion plans to those goals simultaneously.
 In simulations, this approach achieved ~98% success rates in navigating to target destinations while avoiding randomly generated obstacles using only visual map images as input.
 While extensive real-world testing is still needed (only 2D, only simulation), these initial results showcase promising capabilities:
  
Enables navigation in unfamiliar environments without pre-mapping.
 Flexibly identifies and progresses toward reachable goals.
 Avoids unnecessary sensing systems for obstacle avoidance.
 Learns complex collision avoidance heuristics from visual data.
  
I like the thermo + AI + robotics combination here - takes me back to my days in aerospace engineering. Pretty interesting approach.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quick update on my self-learning software experiment:
 Thanks to your feedback, I decided to test my prediction system on a newer tower-defense game from the Apple App Store (simply called ‘The Tower’). What's crucial to remember is that this system is not pre-trained and only learns from the current game it encounters - it starts with zero knowledge and learns exclusively from the game it's currently playing, building from the ground up without the use of deep learning or neural networks.
 In this game (unlike Airstriker which I’ve previously used), players don't control a spaceship or fire weapons (you play the game by ‘upgrading’ your weapons, etc.). It's simpler because there's only one type of enemy that always approaches the center, so the system cannot demonstrate its capabilities for differentiation in this case. But this simplicity presents some other interesting challenges: Enemies approach from all 360-degree directions, pushing the boundaries of the path prediction software. They overlap during explosions, demanding the system to separate them. There's also more visual clutter, including static lines and a non-black background.
 The system's predictive performance has been remarkably strong. I’ve put together an overlay video to visually demonstrate how the system learns and adapts in this new game. Note: If things don’t align perfectly in there, it’s due to my poor video editing skills…
 Your feedback is appreciated as always!

        <updated>2023-10-22T08:14:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Researchers from Germany have developed DeepMB, a groundbreaking deep-learning framework enabling high-quality and real-time optoacoustic imaging via multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT). With potentially transformative implications for health care, this innovation might redefine medical imaging standards.
 To stay ahead of developments in AI, look here first.
 DeepMB breakthrough
  
DeepMB resolves the longstanding tradeoff between image quality and speed in medical imaging.
 The deep-learning framework uses a deep neural network for model-based reconstruction, allowing for fast, high-quality imaging.
 DeepMB can reconstruct images approximately 1000 times faster than conventional techniques, with virtually no loss in image quality.
  
Impressive metrics and implications
  
The researchers accomplished accurate optoacoustic image reconstruction in just 31 milliseconds per image by training the system to pairingly synthesize optoacoustic signals with ground-truth images.
 DeepMB promises to equip clinicians with immediate access to high-quality MSOT images, regardless of the patient's condition or scanned body area.
 The technology could extend to other imaging modalities, such as ultrasound, x-ray, and MRI, potentially changing how diseases are diagnosed and treated.
  
Exciting prospects
  
The development of DeepMB is a significant leap in optoacoustic imaging, promising to enhance healthcare outcomes.
 As DeepMB evolves, it could become integral to modern medical imaging, delivering high-quality results at previously unattainable speeds.

 I have already prepared a dataset of about 5000 songs of different genres, artists. It only contains the lyrics, the genre and the song itself
 Do I understand correctly that I should just encode the text and genre into one vector using CLIP and hope that the model will directly follow it (not skipping words and lines), or should I somehow make timestamps in the dataset (when, where and what text is sung)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The rise of generative AI in search engines like Google threatens the $68 billion search engine optimization (SEO) industry.
 
Generative AI tools like ChatGPT aim to provide direct answers to user queries, bypassing the need for users to click on search results.
 
This could render SEO efforts useless and impact the revenues of SEO consultants and search engines.
 
However, generative AI search engines still face challenges such as providing incorrect or plagiarized answers, and gaining user trust and loyalty.
 
Search engines have been quick to experiment with generative AI to improve search results, with Google's Bard, Microsoft's Bing AI, Baidu's ERNIE, and DuckDuckGo's DuckAssist being examples of this approach.
 
As the quality of AI-generated answers improves, users will have less incentive to browse through search result listings, impacting the revenues of SEO consultants and search engines.
 
The SEO industry generated $68.1 billion globally in 2022 and was expected to reach $129.6 billion by 2030, but the emergence of generative AI puts the industry at risk of obsolescence.
 
Generative AI search engines are still in their infancy and face challenges such as providing incorrect or plagiarized answers, limiting their trust and loyalty among users.
 
However, with the resources available to researchers, it is safe to assume that generative AI models will improve over time, leading to the potential death of the SEO industry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I recently undertook a personal project where I tried to automate the entire process of creating TikTok videos using various AI tools. The goal was to see how advanced we've come in terms of AI's capabilities in content creation and to explore the nuances of automating a traditionally 'human' task. 
 Here's a brief breakdown:
  
Scripting: Leveraged ChatGPT for generating video scripts.
 Voiceovers: Used ElevenLabs for lifelike voice narration.
 Video Creation: Employed a combination of StableDiffusion Animate & Replicate.
 Editing: Automated the editing process to sync with the AI-generated voiceovers.
  
After setting everything up, I ran the system for a month, generating 3 videos daily. The results were intriguing and a mix of expected and unexpected outcomes.
 Would love to hear thoughts, feedback, or similar experiences from the community. Are there other creative ways you've seen or used AI in content creation?

 I've been re-reading the "What matters in on-policy reinforcement learning" paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05990), and noticed that they suggest to recompute advantages at the beginning of each epoch (choice C5, see section 3.5 and appendix B.1). I was wondering:
  
if someone here had already tried this and seen a significant improvement (which is what the paper suggests) ?
 if it did not also suppose to recompute the value targets at the beginning of each epoch, which could lead to some sort of moving target issue ?
  
Best,

 If model for example, buys weapon A, and use the item's ability on opponent B, it should learn what damage it gives to opponent given the items opponent B is wearing. But we would have done a lot of other actions in between before being able to use that weapon to reward the model on what it does / how much damage it made.

A machine that explores the states space of an environment, learning how to traverse the state space, learning how to manipulate the environment, which when given a goal can manipulate the environment in accordance to the goal.
 In other words, it's an agent which learns not one policy, but all possible policies. Doing so, I believe requires a hierarchy: layers of the same structure which learn broader and broader contexts of the environment.
 I have recently attempted to design an extremely simple, and modularized version of this agent: The Encoder-Predictor-Actor circuit.
 I need feedback, do you think it would work? if it might work, how might I train the Actor model? I think I know how to train the Encoder and Predictor models, but the Actor model will be harder to train, so if you have any ideas I'd love to hear from you!
 ps. sorry for the typos in the image text.

 I need some suggestions from you experts. I am an aerospace engineer (both BSc and MSc), with a university minor in AI. It's pretty clear to me that I should have studied computer science given my passion for this world. In the last 4 years I worked as engineer in a major aerospace company, and I managed to get back on track with computer science and ML by working as a data scientist and doing ML projects applied to space, while also practicing with LLM agents. My dream is to enter the AGI world, maybe working as an "AI engineer", or working on creating true "autonomous" systems, leveraging multi-modal models maybe. What do you suggest I should focus on to reach this goal? Getting first some "credit" as an ML engineer though courses and certifications, open source projects, or maybe applying right now to some startups in the field?
 Thanks guys!

OpenAI's DALL-E 3 AI image generator integrated into ChatGPT revealed internal prompts shared between the image generator and the AI assistant.
 
The prompts included commands written in all-caps for emphasis.
 
This shows that programming and communicating with computers may become more human-like in the future.
 
Previously, programs used specialized data formats and APIs to communicate, but now large language models allow for cross-program interaction in conventional English.
 
OpenAI trained GPT-4, the AI model used in ChatGPT DALL-E interface, on hundreds of millions of documents scraped from the web, which included instances of polite language and reactions to it.
 
The use of all-caps in the DALL-E message is interpreted as emphasis, and the model pays more attention to capitalized sentences.
 
In the future, programming and communicating with computers may involve more emphasis and human-like communication techniques.

Is there any research that has shown on multiple datasets that encoder-only pretraining tasks produce more optimal results when finetuned for Token Classification tasks compared to decoder-only with same parameter sized models.
 Since a lot of LLM research is focused on text generation, most model are trained on decoder-only pretraining tasks, so what is the largest encoder-only pretrained model that is trained on >1T tokens.
 If encoder-only models do indeed produce more optimal results for Token Classification is there any empirical rule w.r.t. to parameter size that we can expect decoder-only to outperform encode-only models. (Eg. say 3B decoder-only is equivalent to 1B encoder-only with similar pretraining and finetuning data)

 Hi there!
 I'd like to share with you a project I recently developed. My inspiration came from a recent post about Set-of-Mark visual grounding in GPT-4V. Fascinatingly, my tests showed that GPT-4V, equipped with this capability, could inspect a UI screenshot and provide the precise pixel coordinates needed for steering a mouse/keyboard to perform a specified task.
 Motivated by this, I built a proof-of-concept web browser embedded with a co-pilot that can "view" the browser and interact with it. Currently, the demo is basic, utilizing web-scraping to morph ChatGPT Plus into an unofficial GPT-4V API at the backend.

 Generating a Wide Variety of Sounds
 I'm a non-technical person with very little knowledge to develop AI tools and intending to learn Python and based on that My question is as follows:
 ​
 Are there tools or chatgpt like platforms that can help people like me to generate couple of sounds like dog barks, cat meows. I want either something that can generate a variety of sounds or I want to work towards making something that cane help me generate audios like dog barks, such as fierce, aggressive ones but not just limited to dog barks but also sound focused on nature, other animals, vehicles, machinery(e.g., honks, engine sounds ), and possibly human sounds (though that's not my primary focus for now).
 The amount of technical Assistance Needed
 I also came across a tool like Teachable Machine and was wondering if it could be a solution as it does offer tools for audio. I am also aware that I would need datasets for such a task but apart from that I am not too sure about the nitty gritty or should I say the intricacies involved as well as the knowledge needed as I do assume it is likely not very easy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4GOmYPPqn8&t=1854s
 ​
 [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)
 ​
 Inspiration
 I was inspired by a project I found here: [https://x.com/TheAIAnonGuy/status/1684443155448360961?s=20] 
 ​
 ​
 Can anyone provide insights, guidance, or recommendations on how to accomplish this?
 To be fair, I'm not really sure if this is an audio-related or neural/machine learning (ML)/deep learning related learning question.
 But I would like more insight if this is possible on an individual scale either with teachable, code or AI or a combination of all approaches and if there are any beginner friendly ways to achieve this
 Thank you all for your assistance!

access to only a small subset of data (i.e., memory) from previous domains.
Various methods have been proposed for this problem, but it is still unclear
how they are related and when practitioners should choose one method over
another. In response, we propose a unified framework, dubbed Unified Domain
Incremental Learning (UDIL), for domain incremental learning with memory. Our
UDIL **unifies** various existing methods, and our theoretical analysis shows
that UDIL always achieves a tighter generalization error bound compared to
these methods. The key insight is that different existing methods correspond to
our bound with different **fixed** coefficients; based on insights from this
unification, our UDIL allows **adaptive** coefficients during training, thereby
always achieving the tightest bound. Empirical results show that our UDIL
outperforms the state-of-the-art domain incremental learning methods on both
synthetic and real-world datasets. Code will be available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Significant computational resources are required to train Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) at a large scale, and the process is highly data-intensive. One
of the most effective ways to reduce resource requirements is minibatch
training coupled with graph sampling. GNNs have the unique property that items
in a minibatch have overlapping data. However, the commonly implemented
Independent Minibatching approach assigns each Processing Element (PE) its own
minibatch to process, leading to duplicated computations and input data access
across PEs. This amplifies the Neighborhood Explosion Phenomenon (NEP), which
is the main bottleneck limiting scaling. To reduce the effects of NEP in the
multi-PE setting, we propose a new approach called Cooperative Minibatching.
Our approach capitalizes on the fact that the size of the sampled subgraph is a
concave function of the batch size, leading to significant reductions in the
amount of work per seed vertex as batch sizes increase. Hence, it is favorable
for processors equipped with a fast interconnect to work on a large minibatch
together as a single larger processor, instead of working on separate smaller
minibatches, even though global batch size is identical. We also show how to
take advantage of the same phenomenon in serial execution by generating
dependent consecutive minibatches. Our experimental evaluations show up to 4x
bandwidth savings for fetching vertex embeddings, by simply increasing this
dependency without harming model convergence. Combining our proposed

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pretrained transformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various natural language processing tasks. These models leverage the attention
mechanism to capture long- and short-range dependencies in the sequence.
However, the (full) attention mechanism incurs high computational cost -
quadratic in the sequence length, which is not affordable in tasks with long
sequences, e.g., inputs with 8k tokens. Although sparse attention can be used
to improve computational efficiency, as suggested in existing work, it has
limited modeling capacity and often fails to capture complicated dependencies
in long sequences. To tackle this challenge, we propose MASFormer, an
easy-to-implement transformer variant with Mixed Attention Spans. Specifically,
MASFormer is equipped with full attention to capture long-range dependencies,
but only at a small number of layers. For the remaining layers, MASformer only
employs sparse attention to capture short-range dependencies. Our experiments
on natural language modeling and generation tasks show that a decoder-only
MASFormer model of 1.3B parameters can achieve competitive performance to
vanilla transformers with full attention while significantly reducing
computational cost (up to 75%). Additionally, we investigate the effectiveness
of continual training with long sequence data and how sequence length impacts
downstream generation performance, which may be of independent interest.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In theoretical ML, the teacher-student paradigm is often employed as an
effective metaphor for real-life tuition. The above scheme proves particularly
relevant when the student network is overparameterized as compared to the
teacher network. Under these operating conditions, it is tempting to speculate
that the student ability to handle the given task could be eventually stored in
a sub-portion of the whole network. This latter should be to some extent
reminiscent of the frozen teacher structure, according to suitable metrics,
while being approximately invariant across different architectures of the
student candidate network. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art conventional
learning techniques could not help in identifying the existence of such an
invariant subnetwork, due to the inherent degree of non-convexity that
characterizes the examined problem. In this work, we take a leap forward by
proposing a radically different optimization scheme which builds on a spectral
representation of the linear transfer of information between layers. The
gradient is hence calculated with respect to both eigenvalues and eigenvectors
with negligible increase in terms of computational and complexity load, as
compared to standard training algorithms. Working in this framework, we could
isolate a stable student substructure, that mirrors the true complexity of the
teacher in terms of computing neurons, path distribution and topological
attributes. When pruning unimportant nodes of the trained student, as follows a
ranking that reflects the optimized eigenvalues, no degradation in the recorded
performance is seen above a threshold that corresponds to the effective teacher
size. The observed behavior can be pictured as a genuine second-order phase
transition that bears universality traits.]]></summary>

a new "word" to represent image style and appearance, allowing it to be
integrated into natural language sentences to generate novel synthesised
images. However, identifying and integrating multiple object-level concepts
within one scene poses significant challenges even when embeddings for
individual concepts are attainable. This is further confirmed by our empirical
tests. To address this challenge, we introduce a framework for Multi-Concept
Prompt Learning (MCPL), where multiple new "words" are simultaneously learned
from a single sentence-image pair. To enhance the accuracy of word-concept
correlation, we propose three regularisation techniques: Attention Masking
(AttnMask) to concentrate learning on relevant areas; Prompts Contrastive Loss
(PromptCL) to separate the embeddings of different concepts; and Bind adjective
(Bind adj.) to associate new "words" with known words. We evaluate via image
generation, editing, and attention visualisation with diverse images. Extensive
quantitative comparisons demonstrate that our method can learn more
semantically disentangled concepts with enhanced word-concept correlation.
Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset and evaluation protocol tailored for
this new task of learning object-level concepts.]]></summary>

between two strategic agents -- a seller and a buyer -- both of whom have a
private valuations for the item. We study the online version of the problem, in
which at each time step a new seller and buyer arrive. The learner's task is to
set a price for each agent, without any knowledge about their valuations. The
sequence of sellers and buyers is chosen by an oblivious adversary. In this
setting, known negative results rule out the possibility of designing
algorithms with sublinear regret when the learner has to guarantee budget
balance for each iteration. In this paper, we introduce the notion of global
budget balance, which requires the agent to be budget balance only over the
entire time horizon. By requiring global budget balance, we provide the first
no-regret algorithms for bilateral trade with adversarial inputs under various
feedback models. First, we show that in the full-feedback model the learner can
guarantee $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret against the best fixed prices in
hindsight, which is order-wise optimal. Then, in the case of partial feedback
models, we provide an algorithm guaranteeing a $\tilde{O}(T^{3/4})$ regret
upper bound with one-bit feedback, which we complement with a nearly-matching
lower bound. Finally, we investigate how these results vary when measuring
regret using an alternative benchmark.]]></summary>

with their inherent difficulty in debugging, has underscored the need for
effective and automated repair techniques applicable to such languages.
Researchers have recently explored various methods to automatically repair
declarative software specifications, such as template-based repair,
feedback-driven iterative repair, and bounded exhaustive approaches. The latest
developments in large language models provide new opportunities for the
automatic repair of declarative specifications. In this study, we assess the
effectiveness of utilizing OpenAI's ChatGPT to repair software specifications
written in the Alloy declarative language. Unlike imperative languages,
specifications in Alloy are not executed but rather translated into logical
formulas and evaluated using backend constraint solvers to identify
specification instances and counterexamples to assertions. Our evaluation
focuses on ChatGPT's ability to improve the correctness and completeness of
Alloy declarative specifications through automatic repairs. We analyze the
results produced by ChatGPT and compare them with those of leading automatic
Alloy repair methods. Our study revealed that while ChatGPT falls short in
comparison to existing techniques, it was able to successfully repair bugs that
no other technique could address. Our analysis also identified errors in
ChatGPT's generated repairs, including improper operator usage, type errors,
higher-order logic misuse, and relational arity mismatches. Additionally, we
observed instances of hallucinations in ChatGPT-generated repairs and
inconsistency in its results. Our study provides valuable insights for software
practitioners, researchers, and tool builders considering ChatGPT for

clutter environments using measurements from a radar sensor. Leveraging the
range-Doppler spectra information, we identify the measurement classes, which
serve as additional information to enhance clutter rejection and data
association, thus bolstering the robustness of target tracking. We first
introduce a novel neural enhanced message passing approach, where the beliefs
obtained by the unified message passing are fed into the neural network as
additional information. The output beliefs are then utilized to refine the
original beliefs. Then, we propose a classification-aided robust multiple
target tracking algorithm, employing the neural enhanced message passing
technique. This algorithm is comprised of three modules: a message-passing
module, a neural network module, and a Dempster-Shafer module. The
message-passing module is used to represent the statistical model by the factor
graph and infers target kinematic states, visibility states, and data
associations based on the spatial measurement information. The neural network
module is employed to extract features from range-Doppler spectra and derive
beliefs on whether a measurement is target-generated or clutter-generated. The
Dempster-Shafer module is used to fuse the beliefs obtained from both the
factor graph and the neural network. As a result, our proposed algorithm adopts
a model-and-data-driven framework, effectively enhancing clutter suppression
and data association, leading to significant improvements in multiple target
tracking performance. We validate the effectiveness of our approach using both
simulated and real data scenarios, demonstrating its capability to handle
challenging tracking scenarios in practical radar applications.]]></summary>

between the performance and safety of AI systems has never been more critical.
However, the inherent tension between the objectives of helpfulness and
harmlessness presents a significant challenge during LLM training. To address
this issue, we propose Safe Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (Safe
RLHF), a novel algorithm for human value alignment. Safe RLHF explicitly
decouples human preferences regarding helpfulness and harmlessness, effectively
avoiding the crowdworkers' confusion about the tension and allowing us to train
separate reward and cost models. We formalize the safety concern of LLMs as an
optimization task of maximizing the reward function while satisfying specified
cost constraints. Leveraging the Lagrangian method to solve this constrained
problem, Safe RLHF dynamically adjusts the balance between the two objectives
during fine-tuning. Through a three-round fine-tuning using Safe RLHF, we
demonstrate a superior ability to mitigate harmful responses while enhancing
model performance compared to existing value-aligned algorithms.
Experimentally, we fine-tuned the Alpaca-7B using Safe RLHF and aligned it with

the ethical dimension of fairness in these predictions, considering gender and
name biases. A link prediction task is also conducted to assess the model's
proficiency in anticipating connections between two specified nodes. By
harnessing the capabilities of graph neural networks and incorporating fairness
analyses, this research aims to contribute insights towards streamlining the
adjudication process, enhancing judicial efficiency, and fostering a more
equitable legal landscape, ultimately alleviating the strain imposed by
mounting case backlogs. Our best-performing model with XLNet pre-trained
embeddings as its features gives the macro F1 score of 75% for the LJP task.
For link prediction, the same set of features is the best performing giving ROC
of more than 80%]]></summary>

properties such as strength, extensibility and lightweightedness. Yet, to date,
limited models are available to fully explore sequence-property relationships

model to enable design of novel spider silk protein sequences to meet complex
combinations of target mechanical properties. The model, pretrained on a large
set of protein sequences, is fine-tuned on ~1,000 major ampullate spidroin
(MaSp) sequences for which associated fiber-level mechanical properties exist,
to yield an end-to-end forward and inverse generative strategy. Performance is
assessed through: (1), a novelty analysis and protein type classification for
generated spidroin sequences through BLAST searches, (2) property evaluation
and comparison with similar sequences, (3) comparison of molecular structures,
as well as, and (4) a detailed sequence motif analyses. We generate silk
sequences with property combinations that do not exist in nature, and develop a
deep understanding the mechanistic roles of sequence patterns in achieving
overarching key mechanical properties (elastic modulus, strength, toughness,
failure strain). The model provides an efficient approach to expand the silkome

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given the ubiquitous use of tabular data in industries and the growing
concerns in data privacy and security, tabular data synthesis emerges as a
critical research area. The recent state-of-the-art methods show that large
language models (LLMs) can be adopted to generate realistic tabular data. As
LLMs pre-process tabular data as full text, they have the advantage of avoiding
the curse of dimensionality associated with one-hot encoding high-dimensional
data. However, their long training time and limited re-usability on new tasks
prevent them from replacing exiting tabular generative models. In this paper,
we propose Tabula, a tabular data synthesizer based on the language model
structure. Through Tabula, we demonstrate the inherent limitation of employing
pre-trained language models designed for natural language processing (NLP) in
the context of tabular data synthesis. Our investigation delves into the
development of a dedicated foundational model tailored specifically for tabular
data synthesis. Additionally, we propose a token sequence compression strategy
to significantly reduce training time while preserving the quality of synthetic
data. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that using a language
model structure without loading the well-trained model weights yields a better
starting model for tabular data synthesis. Moreover, the Tabula model,
previously trained on other tabular data, serves as an excellent foundation
model for new tabular data synthesis tasks. Additionally, the token sequence
compression method substantially reduces the model's training time. Results
show that Tabula averagely reduces 46.2% training time per epoch comparing to
current LLMs-based state-of-the-art algorithm and consistently achieves even
higher synthetic data utility.]]></summary>

memory-constrained nodes in the gossip model: at each round, every node locally
adopts one of $m$ arms, observes a reward drawn from the arm's (adversarially
chosen) distribution, and then communicates with a randomly sampled neighbor,
exchanging information to determine its policy in the next round. We introduce
and analyze several families of dynamics for this task that are decentralized:
each node's decision is entirely local and depends only on its most recently
obtained reward and that of the neighbor it sampled. We show a connection
between the global evolution of these decentralized dynamics with a certain
class of "zero-sum" multiplicative weights update algorithms, and we develop a
general framework for analyzing the population-level regret of these natural
protocols. Using this framework, we derive sublinear regret bounds under a wide
range of parameter regimes (i.e., the size of the population and number of
arms) for both the stationary reward setting (where the mean of each arm's
distribution is fixed over time) and the adversarial reward setting (where
means can vary over time). Further, we show that these protocols can
approximately optimize convex functions over the simplex when the reward

applications in a variety of domains. Classically, hand-crafted heuristics were
used for this task. Heuristic measures are chosen such that they correlate well
with the underlying factors related to link formation. In recent years, a new
class of methods has emerged that combines the advantages of message-passing
neural networks (MPNN) and heuristics methods. These methods perform
predictions by using the output of an MPNN in conjunction with a "pairwise
encoding" that captures the relationship between nodes in the candidate link.
They have been shown to achieve strong performance on numerous datasets.
However, current pairwise encodings often contain a strong inductive bias,
using the same underlying factors to classify all links. This limits the
ability of existing methods to learn how to properly classify a variety of
different links that may form from different factors. To address this
limitation, we propose a new method, LPFormer, which attempts to adaptively
learn the pairwise encodings for each link. LPFormer models the link factors
via an attention module that learns the pairwise encoding that exists between
nodes by modeling multiple factors integral to link prediction. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that LPFormer can achieve SOTA performance on numerous

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Knowledge graph embedding models (KGEMs) have gained considerable traction in
recent years. These models learn a vector representation of knowledge graph
entities and relations, a.k.a. knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs). Learning
versatile KGEs is desirable as it makes them useful for a broad range of tasks.
However, KGEMs are usually trained for a specific task, which makes their
embeddings task-dependent. In parallel, the widespread assumption that KGEMs
actually create a semantic representation of the underlying entities and
relations (e.g., project similar entities closer than dissimilar ones) has been
challenged. In this work, we design heuristics for generating protographs --
small, modified versions of a KG that leverage RDF/S information. The learnt
protograph-based embeddings are meant to encapsulate the semantics of a KG, and
can be leveraged in learning KGEs that, in turn, also better capture semantics.
Extensive experiments on various evaluation benchmarks demonstrate the
soundness of this approach, which we call Modular and Agnostic SCHema-based
Integration of protograph Embeddings (MASCHInE). In particular, MASCHInE helps
produce more versatile KGEs that yield substantially better performance for
entity clustering and node classification tasks. For link prediction, using
MASCHinE substantially increases the number of semantically valid predictions
with equivalent rank-based performance.]]></summary>

using a minimal artificial neural network (ANN) in combination with

different levels of historical sensor data and, in combination, represent an
adequate state of previous sensor actuation. By training a three-layer ANN with
a total of 8 neurons, we manage to significantly improve the mapping between
sensor reading and actuation force. Our findings also show that our technique
translates to sensors of reasonably different composition in terms of material

modeling complex natural phenomena, scientific inquiry often involves
collecting observations and translating them into mathematical expressions.
Recently, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for extracting insights
from data. However, existing models typically specialize in either numeric or
symbolic domains, and are usually trained in a supervised manner tailored to
specific tasks. This approach neglects the substantial benefits that could
arise from a task-agnostic unified understanding between symbolic equations and
their numeric counterparts. To bridge the gap, we introduce SNIP, a
Symbolic-Numeric Integrated Pre-training, which employs joint contrastive
learning between symbolic and numeric domains, enhancing their mutual
similarities in the pre-trained embeddings. By performing latent space
analysis, we observe that SNIP provides cross-domain insights into the
representations, revealing that symbolic supervision enhances the embeddings of
numeric data and vice versa. We evaluate SNIP across diverse tasks, including
symbolic-to-numeric mathematical property prediction and numeric-to-symbolic
equation discovery, commonly known as symbolic regression. Results show that
SNIP effectively transfers to various tasks, consistently outperforming fully

problems, and have been shown to perform well in various real-world tasks.
However, most of the existing BO methods aim to learn the optimal solution,
which may become infeasible when the parameter space is extremely large or the
problem is time-sensitive. In these contexts, switching to a satisficing
solution that requires less information can result in better performance. In
this work, we focus on time-sensitive black-box optimization problems and
propose satisficing Thompson sampling-based parallel Bayesian optimization
(STS-PBO) approaches, including synchronous and asynchronous versions. We shift
the target from an optimal solution to a satisficing solution that is easier to
learn. The rate-distortion theory is introduced to construct a loss function
that balances the amount of information that needs to be learned with
sub-optimality, and the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm is adopted to compute the
target solution that reaches the minimum information rate under the distortion
limit at each step. Both discounted and undiscounted Bayesian cumulative regret
bounds are theoretically derived for the proposed STS-PBO approaches. The
effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated on a fast-charging design
problem of Lithium-ion batteries. The results are accordant with theoretical
analyses, and show that our STS-PBO methods outperform both sequential
counterparts and parallel BO with traditional Thompson sampling in both

allowing for subtle departures. The versatility of the framework is
demonstrated in the context of three disparate applications where data

approach for various biological tasks, such as protein function prediction and
sub-cellular location estimation. The existing methods highly rely on
experimental protein structure data and fail in scenarios where these data are

utilized as alternatives. However, we observed that current practices, which
simply employ accurately predicted structures during inference, suffer from
notable degradation in prediction accuracy. While similar phenomena have been
extensively studied in general fields (e.g., Computer Vision) as model
robustness, their impact on protein property prediction remains unexplored. In
this paper, we first investigate the reason behind the performance decrease
when utilizing predicted structures, attributing it to the structure embedding
bias from the perspective of structure representation learning. To study this
problem, we identify a Protein 3D Graph Structure Learning Problem for Robust
Protein Property Prediction (PGSL-RP3), collect benchmark datasets, and present
a protein Structure embedding Alignment Optimization framework (SAO) to

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Training a large and state-of-the-art machine learning model typically
necessitates the use of large-scale datasets, which, in turn, makes the
training and parameter-tuning process expensive and time-consuming. Some
researchers opt to distil information from real-world datasets into tiny and
compact synthetic datasets while maintaining their ability to train a
well-performing model, hence proposing a data-efficient method known as Dataset
Distillation (DD). Despite recent progress in this field, existing methods
still underperform and cannot effectively replace large datasets. In this
paper, unlike previous methods that focus solely on improving the efficacy of
student distillation, we are the first to recognize the important interplay
between expert and student. We argue the significant impact of expert
smoothness when employing more potent expert trajectories in subsequent dataset
distillation. Based on this, we introduce the integration of clipping loss and
gradient penalty to regulate the rate of parameter changes in expert
trajectories. Furthermore, in response to the sensitivity exhibited towards
randomly initialized variables during distillation, we propose representative
initialization for synthetic dataset and balanced inner-loop loss. Finally, we
present two enhancement strategies, namely intermediate matching loss and
weight perturbation, to mitigate the potential occurrence of cumulative errors.
We conduct extensive experiments on datasets of different scales, sizes, and
resolutions. The results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
outperforms prior methods.]]></summary>

on Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which enables the
generation of responses more aligned with human preferences. As universal AI
assistants, there's a growing expectation for them to perform consistently
across various domains. However, previous work shows that Reinforcement
Learning (RL) often exploits shortcuts to attain high rewards and overlooks
challenging samples. This focus on quick reward gains undermines both the
stability in training and the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen
data. In this work, we propose a novel approach that can learn a consistent
policy via RL across various data groups or domains. Given the challenges
associated with acquiring group annotations, our method automatically
classifies data into different groups, deliberately maximizing performance
variance. Then, we optimize the policy to perform well on challenging groups.
Lastly, leveraging the established groups, our approach adaptively adjusts the
exploration space, allocating more learning capacity to more challenging data
and preventing the model from over-optimizing on simpler data. Experimental
results indicate that our approach significantly enhances training stability
and model generalization.]]></summary>

time-series forecasting, where the goal is to model and forecast multivariate
time-series that have underlying hierarchical relations. Most methods focus on
point predictions and do not provide well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts
distributions. Recent state-of-art probabilistic forecasting methods also
impose hierarchical relations on point predictions and samples of distribution
which does not account for coherency of forecast distributions. Previous works
also silently assume that datasets are always consistent with given
hierarchical relations and do not adapt to real-world datasets that show
deviation from this assumption. We close both these gap and propose PROFHiT,
which is a fully probabilistic hierarchical forecasting model that jointly
models forecast distribution of entire hierarchy. PROFHiT uses a flexible
probabilistic Bayesian approach and introduces a novel Distributional Coherency
regularization to learn from hierarchical relations for entire forecast
distribution that enables robust and calibrated forecasts as well as adapt to
datasets of varying hierarchical consistency. On evaluating PROFHiT over wide
range of datasets, we observed 41-88% better performance in accuracy and
significantly better calibration. Due to modeling the coherency over full
distribution, we observed that PROFHiT can robustly provide reliable forecasts
even if up to 10% of input time-series data is missing where other methods'
performance severely degrade by over 70%.]]></summary>

exception in many real-world tasks. This paper investigates a federated
long-tailed learning (Fed-LT) task in which each client holds a locally
heterogeneous dataset; if the datasets can be globally aggregated, they jointly
exhibit a long-tailed distribution. Under such a setting, existing federated
optimization and/or centralized long-tailed learning methods hardly apply due
to challenges in (a) characterizing the global long-tailed distribution under
privacy constraints and (b) adjusting the local learning strategy to cope with
the head-tail imbalance. In response, we propose a method termed
$\texttt{Fed-GraB}$, comprised of a Self-adjusting Gradient Balancer (SGB)
module that re-weights clients' gradients in a closed-loop manner, based on the
feedback of global long-tailed distribution evaluated by a Direct Prior
Analyzer (DPA) module. Using $\texttt{Fed-GraB}$, clients can effectively
alleviate the distribution drift caused by data heterogeneity during the model
training process and obtain a global model with better performance on the
minority classes while maintaining the performance of the majority classes.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that $\texttt{Fed-GraB}$ achieves

generation in the context of the open-ended space of python programming

explicitly optimizing for diversity do so either in limited hand-coded
representation spaces or in uninterpretable learned embedding spaces that may

autotelic generation method that leverages semantic descriptors produced by a
large language model (LLM) to directly optimize for interesting diversity, as
well as few-shot-based generation. Each puzzle is labeled along 10 dimensions,
each capturing a programming skill required to solve it. ACES generates and
pursues novel and feasible goals to explore that abstract semantic space,
slowly discovering a diversity of solvable programming puzzles in any given
run. Across a set of experiments, we show that ACES discovers a richer
diversity of puzzles than existing diversity-maximizing algorithms as measured
across a range of diversity metrics. We further study whether and in which

pretrained models that can act as a valuable starting point when transferring
to new datasets. With the rising demand for reliable machine learning and
uncertainty quantification, there is a need for pretrained models that not only
provide embeddings but also transferable uncertainty estimates. To guide the
development of such models, we propose the Uncertainty-aware Representation
Learning (URL) benchmark. Besides the transferability of the representations,
it also measures the zero-shot transferability of the uncertainty estimate
using a novel metric. We apply URL to evaluate eleven uncertainty quantifiers
that are pretrained on ImageNet and transferred to eight downstream datasets.
We find that approaches that focus on the uncertainty of the representation
itself or estimate the prediction risk directly outperform those that are based
on the probabilities of upstream classes. Yet, achieving transferable
uncertainty quantification remains an open challenge. Our findings indicate
that it is not necessarily in conflict with traditional representation learning
goals. Code is provided under https://github.com/mkirchhof/url .]]></summary>

Networks (GNNs). We prove that for any GNN with piecewise polynomial
activations, whose architecture size does not grow with the graph input sizes,
there exists a pair of non-isomorphic rooted trees of depth two such that the
GNN cannot distinguish their root vertex up to an arbitrary number of
iterations. The proof relies on tools from the algebra of symmetric
polynomials. In contrast, it was already known that unbounded GNNs (those whose
size is allowed to change with the graph sizes) with piecewise polynomial
activations can distinguish these vertices in only two iterations. Our results
imply a strict separation between bounded and unbounded size GNNs, answering an
open question formulated by [Grohe, 2021]. We next prove that if one allows
activations that are not piecewise polynomial, then in two iterations a single
neuron perceptron can distinguish the root vertices of any pair of
nonisomorphic trees of depth two (our results hold for activations like the
sigmoid, hyperbolic tan and others). This shows how the power of graph neural
networks can change drastically if one changes the activation function of the
neural networks. The proof of this result utilizes the Lindemann-Weierstrauss
theorem from transcendental number theory.]]></summary>

document prefixes, enabling them to directly perform long-form generation and
prompting-style tasks which can be reduced to document completion. Existing
pretraining pipelines train LMs by concatenating random sets of short documents
to create input contexts but the prior documents provide no signal for
predicting the next document. We instead present In-Context Pretraining, a new
approach where language models are pretrained on a sequence of related
documents, thereby explicitly encouraging them to read and reason across
document boundaries. We can do In-Context Pretraining by simply changing the
document ordering so that each context contains related documents, and directly
applying existing pretraining pipelines. However, this document sorting problem
is challenging. There are billions of documents and we would like the sort to
maximize contextual similarity for every document without repeating any data.
To do this, we introduce approximate algorithms for finding related documents
with efficient nearest neighbor search and constructing coherent input contexts
with a graph traversal algorithm. Our experiments show In-Context Pretraining
offers a simple and scalable approach to significantly enhance LMs'performance:
we see notable improvements in tasks that require more complex contextual
reasoning, including in-context learning (+8%), reading comprehension (+15%),
faithfulness to previous contexts (+16%), long-context reasoning (+5%), and

and garnered increasing interest in graph learning. In this study, we aim to
explore the problem of generative SSL in the context of heterogeneous graph
learning (HGL). The previous SSL approaches for heterogeneous graphs have
primarily relied on contrastive learning, necessitating the design of complex
views to capture heterogeneity. However, existing generative SSL methods have
not fully leveraged the capabilities of generative models to address the
challenges of HGL. In this paper, we present HGCVAE, a novel contrastive
variational graph auto-encoder that liberates HGL from the burden of intricate
heterogeneity capturing. Instead of focusing on complicated heterogeneity,
HGCVAE harnesses the full potential of generative SSL. HGCVAE innovatively
consolidates contrastive learning with generative SSL, introducing several key
innovations. Firstly, we employ a progressive mechanism to generate
high-quality hard negative samples for contrastive learning, utilizing the
power of variational inference. Additionally, we present a dynamic mask
strategy to ensure effective and stable learning. Moreover, we propose an
enhanced scaled cosine error as the criterion for better attribute
reconstruction. As an initial step in combining generative and contrastive SSL,
HGCVAE achieves remarkable results compared to various state-of-the-art
baselines, confirming its superiority.]]></summary>

movements starting from a limited set of demonstrations. Previous works
proposed simple linear models that exhibited high sample efficiency and
generalization power by allowing temporal modulation of movements (reproducing
movements faster or slower), blending (merging two movements into one),
via-point conditioning (constraining a movement to meet some particular
via-points) and context conditioning (generation of movements based on an
observed variable, e.g., position of an object). Previous works have proposed
neural network-based motor primitive models, having demonstrated their capacity
to perform tasks with some forms of input conditioning or time-modulation
representations. However, there has not been a single unified deep motor
primitive's model proposed that is capable of all previous operations, limiting
neural motor primitive's potential applications. This paper proposes a deep
movement primitive architecture that encodes all the operations above and uses
a Bayesian context aggregator that allows a more sound context conditioning and

social norm in multilingual societies. Neural Language Models (NLMs) like
transformers have been effective on many NLP tasks. However, NLM for CM is an
under-explored area. Though transformers are capable and powerful, they cannot
always encode positional information since they are non-recurrent. Therefore,
to enrich word information and incorporate positional information, positional
encoding is defined. We hypothesize that Switching Points (SPs), i.e.,
junctions in the text where the language switches (L1 -> L2 or L2 -> L1), pose
a challenge for CM Language Models (LMs), and hence give special emphasis to
SPs in the modeling process. We experiment with several positional encoding
mechanisms and show that rotatory positional encodings along with switching
point information yield the best results.

We introduce CONFLATOR: a neural language modeling approach for code-mixed
languages. CONFLATOR tries to learn to emphasize switching points using smarter
positional encoding, both at unigram and bigram levels. CONFLATOR outperforms
the state-of-the-art on two tasks based on code-mixed Hindi and English

In this paper, we propose a framework for evaluating superhuman models via
consistency checks. Our premise is that while the correctness of superhuman
decisions may be impossible to evaluate, we can still surface mistakes if the
model's decisions fail to satisfy certain logical, human-interpretable rules.
We instantiate our framework on three tasks where correctness of decisions is
hard to evaluate due to either superhuman model abilities, or to otherwise
missing ground truth: evaluating chess positions, forecasting future events,
and making legal judgments. We show that regardless of a model's (possibly
superhuman) performance on these tasks, we can discover logical inconsistencies
in decision making. For example: a chess engine assigning opposing valuations
to semantically identical boards; GPT-4 forecasting that sports records will
evolve non-monotonically over time; or an AI judge assigning bail to a
defendant only after we add a felony to their criminal record.]]></summary>

alternative to the cross-entropy loss for classification. While prior studies
have demonstrated that both losses yield symmetric training representations
under balanced data, this symmetry breaks under class imbalances. This paper
presents an intriguing discovery: the introduction of a ReLU activation at the
final layer effectively restores the symmetry in SCL-learned representations.
We arrive at this finding analytically, by establishing that the global
minimizers of an unconstrained features model with SCL loss and entry-wise
non-negativity constraints form an orthogonal frame. Extensive experiments
conducted across various datasets, architectures, and imbalance scenarios
corroborate our finding. Importantly, our experiments reveal that the inclusion
of the ReLU activation restores symmetry without compromising test accuracy.
This constitutes the first geometry characterization of SCL under imbalances.
Additionally, our analysis and experiments underscore the pivotal role of batch
selection strategies in representation geometry. By proving necessary and
sufficient conditions for mini-batch choices that ensure invariant symmetric

minibatches of data to form natural language "gradients" that criticize the

the prompt in the opposite semantic direction of the gradient. These gradient
descent steps are guided by a beam search and bandit selection procedure which
significantly improves algorithmic efficiency. Preliminary results across three

that Automatic Prompt Optimization can outperform prior prompt editing

has emerged as a highly successful approach, with training only a small number
of parameters without sacrificing performance and becoming the de-facto
learning paradigm with the increasing size of PLMs. However, existing PEFT
methods are not memory-efficient, because they still require caching most of
the intermediate activations for the gradient calculation, akin to fine-tuning.
One effective way to reduce the activation memory is to apply a reversible
model, so the intermediate activations are not necessary to be cached and can
be recomputed. Nevertheless, modifying a PLM to its reversible variant is not
straightforward, since the reversible model has a distinct architecture from
the currently released PLMs. In this paper, we first investigate what is a key
factor for the success of existing PEFT methods, and realize that it's
essential to preserve the PLM's starting point when initializing a PEFT method.
With this finding, we propose memory-efficient fine-tuning (MEFT) that inserts
adapters into a PLM, preserving the PLM's starting point and making it
reversible without additional pre-training. We evaluate MEFT on the GLUE
benchmark and five question-answering tasks with various backbones, BERT,
RoBERTa, BART and OPT. MEFT significantly reduces the activation memory up to
84% of full fine-tuning with a negligible amount of trainable parameters.
Moreover, MEFT achieves the same score on GLUE and a comparable score on the
question-answering tasks as full fine-tuning. A similar finding is also
observed for the image classification task.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As generative AI becomes more prevalent, it is important to study how human
users interact with such models. In this work, we investigate how people use
text-to-image models to generate desired target images. To study this
interaction, we created ArtWhisperer, an online game where users are given a
target image and are tasked with iteratively finding a prompt that creates a
similar-looking image as the target. Through this game, we recorded over 50,000
human-AI interactions; each interaction corresponds to one text prompt created
by a user and the corresponding generated image. The majority of these are
repeated interactions where a user iterates to find the best prompt for their
target image, making this a unique sequential dataset for studying human-AI
collaborations. In an initial analysis of this dataset, we identify several
characteristics of prompt interactions and user strategies. People submit
diverse prompts and are able to discover a variety of text descriptions that
generate similar images. Interestingly, prompt diversity does not decrease as
users find better prompts. We further propose a new metric to quantify the
steerability of AI using our dataset. We define steerability as the expected
number of interactions required to adequately complete a task. We estimate this
value by fitting a Markov chain for each target task and calculating the
expected time to reach an adequate score in the Markov chain. We quantify and
compare AI steerability across different types of target images and two
different models, finding that images of cities and natural world images are
more steerable than artistic and fantasy images. These findings provide
insights into human-AI interaction behavior, present a concrete method of
assessing AI steerability, and demonstrate the general utility of the
ArtWhisperer dataset.]]></summary>

develop (1) a prediction model, which is treated as a black box, and (2) a
causal model for bias mitigation. In this paper, we focus on gender bias and
the problem of binary classification. We show that gender bias in the
prediction model is statistically significant at the 0.05 level. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the causal model in mitigating gender bias by
cross-validation. Furthermore, we show that the overall classification accuracy
is improved slightly. Our novel approach is intuitive, easy-to-use, and can be
implemented using existing statistical software tools such as "lavaan" in R.

periods where each period requires a multi-stage decision-making process. We
formulate the problem as an online allocation problem in an episodic
finite-horizon constrained Markov decision process with an unknown
non-stationary transition function and stochastic non-stationary reward and
resource consumption functions. We propose the observe-then-decide regime and
improve the existing decide-then-observe regime, while the two settings differ
in how the observations and feedback about the reward and resource consumption
functions are given to the decision-maker. We develop an online dual mirror
descent algorithm that achieves near-optimal regret bounds for both settings.
For the observe-then-decide regime, we prove that the expected regret against
the dynamic clairvoyant optimal policy is bounded by $\tilde
O(\rho^{-1}{H^{3/2}}S\sqrt{AT})$ where $\rho\in(0,1)$ is the budget parameter,
$H$ is the length of the horizon, $S$ and $A$ are the numbers of states and
actions, and $T$ is the number of episodes. For the decide-then-observe regime,
we show that the regret against the static optimal policy that has access to
the mean reward and mean resource consumption functions is bounded by $\tilde
O(\rho^{-1}{H^{3/2}}S\sqrt{AT})$ with high probability. We test the numerical
efficiency of our method for a variant of the resource-constrained inventory

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi-modal Contrastive Representation learning aims to encode different
modalities into a semantically aligned shared space. This paradigm shows
remarkable generalization ability on numerous downstream tasks across various
modalities. However, the reliance on massive high-quality data pairs limits its
further development on more modalities. This paper proposes a novel
training-efficient method for learning MCR without paired data called
Connecting Multi-modal Contrastive Representations (C-MCR). Specifically, given
two existing MCRs pre-trained on (A, B) and (B, C) modality pairs, we project
them to a new space and use the data from the overlapping modality B to
aligning the two MCRs in the new space. Meanwhile, since the modality pairs (A,
B) and (B, C) are already aligned within each MCR, the connection learned by
overlapping modality can also be transferred to non-overlapping modality pair
(A, C). To unleash the potential of C-MCR, we further introduce a
semantic-enhanced inter- and intra-MCR connection method. We first enhance the
semantic consistency and completion of embeddings across different modalities
for more robust alignment. Then we utilize the inter-MCR alignment to establish
the connection, and employ the intra-MCR alignment to better maintain the
connection for inputs from non-overlapping modalities. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of C-MCR, we connect CLIP and CLAP via texts to derive
audio-visual representations, and integrate CLIP and ULIP via images for
3D-language representations. Remarkably, without using any paired data, C-MCR
for audio-visual achieves state-of-the-art performance on audio-image
retrieval, audio-visual source localization, and counterfactual audio-image
recognition tasks. Furthermore, C-MCR for 3D-language also attains advanced
zero-shot 3D point cloud classification accuracy on ModelNet40.]]></summary>

perform multiple tasks without changing any network properties. Enabling
artificial neural networks (ANNs) to obtain certain multistabilities in order
to perform several tasks, where each task is related to a particular attractor
in the network's state space, naturally has many benefits from a machine
learning perspective. Given the association to multistability, in this paper we
explore how the relationship between different attractors influences the
ability of a reservoir computer (RC), which is a dynamical system in the form
of an ANN, to achieve multifunctionality. We construct the `seeing double'
problem to systematically study how a RC reconstructs a coexistence of
attractors when there is an overlap between them. As the amount of overlap
increases, we discover that for multifunctionality to occur, there is a
critical dependence on a suitable choice of the spectral radius for the RC's
internal network connections. A bifurcation analysis reveals how
multifunctionality emerges and is destroyed as the RC enters a chaotic regime
that can lead to chaotic itinerancy.]]></summary>

$\tau$-regression estimator for analyzing high-dimensional datasets subject to
gross contamination in the response variables and covariates (explanatory
variables). The resulting estimator, termed adaptive $\tau$-Lasso, is robust to
outliers and high-leverage points. It also incorporates an adaptive
$\ell_1$-norm penalty term, which enables the selection of relevant variables
and reduces the bias associated with large true regression coefficients. More
specifically, this adaptive $\ell_1$-norm penalty term assigns a weight to each
regression coefficient. For a fixed number of predictors $p$, we show that the
adaptive $\tau$-Lasso has the oracle property, ensuring both variable-selection
consistency and asymptotic normality. Asymptotic normality applies only to the
entries of the regression vector corresponding to the true support, assuming
knowledge of the true regression vector support. We characterize its robustness
via the finite-sample breakdown point and the influence function. We carry out
extensive simulations and observe that the class of $\tau$-Lasso estimators
exhibits robustness and reliable performance in both contaminated and
uncontaminated data settings. We also validate our theoretical findings on
robustness properties through simulation experiments. In the face of outliers
and high-leverage points, the adaptive $\tau$-Lasso and $\tau$-Lasso estimators
achieve the best performance or close-to-best performance in terms of
prediction and variable selection accuracy compared to other competing
regularized estimators for all scenarios considered in this study. Therefore,
the adaptive $\tau$-Lasso and $\tau$-Lasso estimators can be effectively
employed for a variety of sparse linear regression problems, particularly in
high-dimensional settings and when the data is contaminated by outliers and
high-leverage points.]]></summary>

ground and grasp objects based on natural language instructions. While robots
capable of recognizing personal objects like "my wallet" can interact more
naturally with non-expert users, current LCRG systems primarily limit robots to
understanding only generic expressions. To this end, we introduce a task
scenario GraspMine with a novel dataset that aims to locate and grasp personal
objects given personal indicators via learning from a single human-robot

(PGA), that learns personal objects by propagating user-given information
through a Reminiscence-a collection of raw images from the user's environment.
Specifically, PGA acquires personal object information by a user presenting a
personal object with its associated indicator, followed by PGA inspecting the
object by rotating it. Based on the acquired information, PGA pseudo-labels
objects in the Reminiscence by our proposed label propagation algorithm.
Harnessing the information acquired from the interactions and the
pseudo-labeled objects in the Reminiscence, PGA adapts the object grounding
model to grasp personal objects. Experiments on GraspMine show that PGA
significantly outperforms baseline methods both in offline and online settings,
signifying its effectiveness and personalization applicability on real-world
scenarios. Finally, qualitative analysis shows the effectiveness of PGA through

dYnamics, for sampling high dimensional data. With the growing efficacy and
potential of Energy-Based modeling, also known as non-normalized probabilistic
modeling, for modeling a generative process of different natures of high
dimensional data observations, we present an end-to-end learning algorithm for
Energy-Based models (EBM) with the purpose of improving the quality of the
resulting sampled data points. While the unknown normalizing constant of EBMs
makes the training procedure intractable, resorting to Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) is in general a viable option. Realizing what MCMC entails for the EBM
training, we propose in this paper, a novel high dimensional sampling method,
based on an anisotropic stepsize and a gradient-informed covariance matrix,
embedded into a discretized Langevin diffusion. We motivate the necessity for
an anisotropic update of the negative samples in the Markov Chain by the
nonlinearity of the backbone of the EBM, here a Convolutional Neural Network.
Our resulting method, namely STANLEY, is an optimization algorithm for training
Energy-Based models via our newly introduced MCMC method. We provide a
theoretical understanding of our sampling scheme by proving that the sampler
leads to a geometrically uniformly ergodic Markov Chain. Several image

useful for comparing against analytical bounds, or to empirically measure
privacy loss in settings where known analytical bounds are not tight. However,
existing privacy auditing techniques usually make strong assumptions on the
adversary (e.g., knowledge of intermediate model iterates or the training data
distribution), are tailored to specific tasks, model architectures, or DP
algorithm, and/or require retraining the model many times (typically on the
order of thousands). These shortcomings make deploying such techniques at scale
difficult in practice, especially in federated settings where model training
can take days or weeks. In this work, we present a novel ``one-shot'' approach
that can systematically address these challenges, allowing efficient auditing
or estimation of the privacy loss of a model during the same, single training
run used to fit model parameters, and without requiring any a priori knowledge
about the model architecture, task, or DP training algorithm. We show that our
method provides provably correct estimates for the privacy loss under the
Gaussian mechanism, and we demonstrate its performance on well-established FL
benchmark datasets under several adversarial threat models.]]></summary>

user's history of ratings for consumed items can create a filter bubble,
wherein the user does not get to experience items from novel, unseen
categories. One approach to mitigate this undesired behavior is to recommend
items with high potential for serendipity, namely surprising items that are
likely to be highly rated. In this paper, we propose a content-based
formulation of serendipity that is rooted in Bayesian surprise and use it to
measure the serendipity of items after they are consumed and rated by the user.
When coupled with a collaborative-filtering component that identifies similar
users, this enables recommending items with high potential for serendipity. To
facilitate the evaluation of topic-level models for surprise and serendipity,
we introduce a dataset of book reading histories extracted from Goodreads,
containing over 26 thousand users and close to 1.3 million books, where we
manually annotate 449 books read by 4 users in terms of their time-dependent,
topic-level surprise. Experimental evaluations show that models that use
Bayesian surprise correlate much better with the manual annotations of
topic-level surprise than distance-based heuristics, and also obtain better
serendipitous item recommendation performance.]]></summary>

here to solve complex forward and inverse problems in protein modeling, based
on an attention neural network that integrates transformer and graph
convolutional architectures in a causal multi-headed graph mechanism, to
realize a generative pretrained model. The model is applied to predict
secondary structure content (per-residue level and overall content), protein
solubility, and sequencing tasks. Further trained on inverse tasks, the model
is rendered capable of designing proteins with these properties as target
features. The model is formulated as a general framework, completely
prompt-based, and can be adapted for a variety of downstream tasks. We find
that adding additional tasks yields emergent synergies that the model exploits
in improving overall performance, beyond what would be possible by training a
model on each dataset alone. Case studies are presented to validate the method,
yielding protein designs specifically focused on structural proteins, but also
exploring the applicability in the design of soluble, antimicrobial
biomaterials. While our model is trained to ultimately perform 8 distinct
tasks, with available datasets it can be extended to solve additional problems.
In a broader sense, this work illustrates a form of multiscale modeling that
relates a set of ultimate building blocks (here, byte-level utf8 characters
that define the nature of the physical system at hand) to complex output. This
materiomic scheme captures complex emergent relationships between universal

then hooked into an approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) pipeline to
retrieve similar data points. To accurately capture tail queries and data
points, learned representations typically are rigid, high-dimensional vectors
that are generally used as-is in the entire ANNS pipeline and can lead to
computationally expensive retrieval. In this paper, we argue that instead of
rigid representations, different stages of ANNS can leverage adaptive
representations of varying capacities to achieve significantly better
accuracy-compute trade-offs, i.e., stages of ANNS that can get away with more
approximate computation should use a lower-capacity representation of the same
data point. To this end, we introduce AdANNS, a novel ANNS design framework
that explicitly leverages the flexibility of Matryoshka Representations. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy-compute trade-offs using novel
AdANNS-based key ANNS building blocks like search data structures (AdANNS-IVF)
and quantization (AdANNS-OPQ). For example on ImageNet retrieval, AdANNS-IVF is
up to 1.5% more accurate than the rigid representations-based IVF at the same
compute budget; and matches accuracy while being up to 90x faster in wall-clock
time. For Natural Questions, 32-byte AdANNS-OPQ matches the accuracy of the
64-byte OPQ baseline constructed using rigid representations -- same accuracy
at half the cost! We further show that the gains from AdANNS translate to
modern-day composite ANNS indices that combine search structures and
quantization. Finally, we demonstrate that AdANNS can enable inference-time
adaptivity for compute-aware search on ANNS indices built non-adaptively on
matryoshka representations. Code is open-sourced at

modern neural networks that are not only the most widely applicable path-norm
based ones, but also recover or beat the sharpest known bounds of this type.
These extended path-norms further enjoy the usual benefits of path-norms: ease
of computation, invariance under the symmetries of the network, and improved
sharpness on feedforward networks compared to the product of operators' norms,
another complexity measure most commonly used.

The versatility of the toolkit and its ease of implementation allow us to
challenge the concrete promises of path-norm-based generalization bounds, by
numerically evaluating the sharpest known bounds for ResNets on ImageNet.]]></summary>

has achieved great success in learning visual representations without data
annotations. However, most methods mainly focus on the instance level
information (\ie, the different augmented images of the same instance should
have the same feature or cluster into the same class), but there is a lack of
attention on the relationships between different instances. In this paper, we
introduce a novel SSL paradigm, which we term as relational self-supervised
learning (ReSSL) framework that learns representations by modeling the
relationship between different instances. Specifically, our proposed method
employs sharpened distribution of pairwise similarities among different
instances as \textit{relation} metric, which is thus utilized to match the
feature embeddings of different augmentations. To boost the performance, we
argue that weak augmentations matter to represent a more reliable relation, and
leverage momentum strategy for practical efficiency. The designed asymmetric
predictor head and an InfoNCE warm-up strategy enhance the robustness to
hyper-parameters and benefit the resulting performance. Experimental results
show that our proposed ReSSL substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods across different network architectures, including various lightweight

of the spatial symmetry group SE(3), the discrete-time translation group Z, and
the object permutation group Sn. EDGI follows the Diffuser framework (Janner et
al., 2022) in treating both learning a world model and planning in it as a
conditional generative modeling problem, training a diffusion model on an
offline trajectory dataset. We introduce a new SE(3)xZxSn-equivariant diffusion
model that supports multiple representations. We integrate this model in a

with fragmented literature reviews, nebulous methodological taxonomies,
inadequate evaluative measures, and a dearth of accessible, user-oriented

dissection of DA methodologies within the TSC realm. Our initial approach
involved an extensive literature review spanning a decade, revealing that
contemporary surveys scarcely capture the breadth of advancements in DA for
TSC, prompting us to meticulously analyze over 100 scholarly articles to
distill more than 60 unique DA techniques. This rigorous analysis precipitated
the formulation of a novel taxonomy, purpose-built for the intricacies of DA in
TSC, categorizing techniques into five principal echelons:
Transformation-Based, Pattern-Based, Generative, Decomposition-Based, and
Automated Data Augmentation. Our taxonomy promises to serve as a robust
navigational aid for scholars, offering clarity and direction in method
selection. Addressing the conspicuous absence of holistic evaluations for
prevalent DA techniques, we executed an all-encompassing empirical assessment,

we provide interpretations of the performance improvement: (1) feature
distribution shows the effectiveness of the alignment module for discovering

spatio-temporal transformer backbone, which generates realistic and
controllable traffic. We then harness a large language model (LLM) to convert a
user's query into a loss function, guiding the diffusion model towards
query-compliant generation. Through comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate

research community. These models not only generate high fidelity outputs, but
are also generalists which can solve tasks not explicitly taught. In contrast,
speech generative models are still primitive in terms of scale and task
generalization. In this paper, we present Voicebox, the most versatile
text-guided generative model for speech at scale. Voicebox is a
non-autoregressive flow-matching model trained to infill speech, given audio
context and text, trained on over 50K hours of speech that are not filtered or
enhanced. Similar to GPT, Voicebox can perform many different tasks through
in-context learning, but is more flexible as it can also condition on future
context. Voicebox can be used for mono or cross-lingual zero-shot
text-to-speech synthesis, noise removal, content editing, style conversion, and
diverse sample generation. In particular, Voicebox outperforms the
state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS model VALL-E on both intelligibility (5.9% vs
1.9% word error rates) and audio similarity (0.580 vs 0.681) while being up to
20 times faster. Audio samples can be found in

great number of practical application scenarios, where the goal is to find a
design over the whole space maximizing a black-box target function based on a
static offline dataset. In this work, we consider a more general but
challenging MBO setting, named constrained MBO (CoMBO), where only part of the
design space can be optimized while the rest is constrained by the environment.
A new challenge arising from CoMBO is that most observed designs that satisfy
the constraints are mediocre in evaluation. Therefore, we focus on optimizing
these mediocre designs in the offline dataset while maintaining the given
constraints rather than further boosting the best observed design in the
traditional MBO setting. We propose retrieval-enhanced offline model-based
optimization (ROMO), a new derivable forward approach that retrieves the
offline dataset and aggregates relevant samples to provide a trusted
prediction, and use it for gradient-based optimization. ROMO is simple to
implement and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in the CoMBO setting.
Empirically, we conduct experiments on a synthetic Hartmann (3D) function
dataset, an industrial CIO dataset, and a suite of modified tasks in the
Design-Bench benchmark. Results show that ROMO performs well in a wide range of
constrained optimization tasks.]]></summary>

reducing the memory footprint and compute costs of deep neural networks, but
they suffer from quality degradation due to the lack of freedom as activations

accuracy drop, we propose a novel BNN design called Binary Neural Network with
INSTAnce-aware threshold (INSTA-BNN), which controls the quantization threshold

observation, higher-order statistics can be a representative metric to estimate
the characteristics of the input distribution. INSTA-BNN is designed to adjust
the threshold dynamically considering various information, including
higher-order statistics, but it is also optimized judiciously to realize
minimal overhead on a real device. Our extensive study shows that INSTA-BNN
outperforms the baseline by 3.0% and 2.8% on the ImageNet classification task

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spectral clustering and its extensions usually consist of two steps: (1)
constructing a graph and computing the relaxed solution; (2) discretizing
relaxed solutions. Although the former has been extensively investigated, the
discretization techniques are mainly heuristic methods, e.g., k-means, spectral
rotation. Unfortunately, the goal of the existing methods is not to find a
discrete solution that minimizes the original objective. In other words, the
primary drawback is the neglect of the original objective when computing the
discrete solution. Inspired by the first-order optimization algorithms, we
propose to develop a first-order term to bridge the original problem and
discretization algorithm, which is the first non-heuristic to the best of our
knowledge. Since the non-heuristic method is aware of the original graph cut
problem, the final discrete solution is more reliable and achieves the
preferable loss value. We also theoretically show that the continuous optimum
is beneficial to discretization algorithms though simply finding its closest
discrete solution is an existing heuristic algorithm which is also unreliable.
Sufficient experiments significantly show the superiority of our method.]]></summary>

selecting a representative subset from a large-scale dataset. If datapoints
have sensitive attributes such as gender or race, it becomes important to

interest in developing fair machine learning algorithms. Recently, such
algorithms have been developed for monotone submodular maximization under a
cardinality constraint.

In this paper, we study the natural generalization of this problem to a
matroid constraint. We give streaming algorithms as well as impossibility
results that provide trade-offs between efficiency, quality and fairness. We

the considerable cost of fully finetuning large pretrained language models
(PLM). As different PEFT techniques proliferate, it is becoming difficult to
compare them, in particular in terms of (i) the structure and functionality
they add to the PLM, (ii) the different types and degrees of efficiency
improvements achieved, (iii) performance at different downstream tasks, and
(iv) how differences in structure and functionality relate to efficiency and
task performance. To facilitate such comparisons, this paper presents a
reference architecture which standardises aspects shared by different PEFT
techniques, while isolating differences to specific locations and interactions
with the standard components. Through this process of standardising and
isolating differences, a modular view of PEFT techniques emerges, supporting
not only direct comparison of different techniques and their efficiency and
task performance, but also systematic exploration of reusability and
composability of the different types of finetuned modules. We demonstrate how
the reference architecture can be applied to understand properties and relative
advantages of PEFT techniques, hence to inform selection of techniques for

computer science. Learning-based subgoal search methods have shown promise in
tackling these problems, but they often suffer from a lack of completeness
guarantees, meaning that they may fail to find a solution even if one exists.
In this paper, we propose an efficient approach to augment a subgoal search
method to achieve completeness in discrete action spaces. Specifically, we
augment the high-level search with low-level actions to execute a multi-level
(hybrid) search, which we call complete subgoal search. This solution achieves
the best of both worlds: the practical efficiency of high-level search and the
completeness of low-level search. We apply the proposed search method to a
recently proposed subgoal search algorithm and evaluate the algorithm trained
on offline data on complex planning problems. We demonstrate that our complete
subgoal search not only guarantees completeness but can even improve
performance in terms of search expansions for instances that the high-level
could solve without low-level augmentations. Our approach makes it possible to
apply subgoal-level planning for systems where completeness is a critical
requirement.]]></summary>

time-series forecasting, where the goal is to model and forecast multivariate
time-series that have underlying hierarchical relations. Most methods focus on
point predictions and do not provide well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts
distributions. Recent state-of-art probabilistic forecasting methods also
impose hierarchical relations on point predictions and samples of distribution
which does not account for coherency of forecast distributions. Previous works
also silently assume that datasets are always consistent with given
hierarchical relations and do not adapt to real-world datasets that show
deviation from this assumption. We close both these gap and propose PROFHiT,
which is a fully probabilistic hierarchical forecasting model that jointly
models forecast distribution of entire hierarchy. PROFHiT uses a flexible
probabilistic Bayesian approach and introduces a novel Distributional Coherency
regularization to learn from hierarchical relations for entire forecast
distribution that enables robust and calibrated forecasts as well as adapt to
datasets of varying hierarchical consistency. On evaluating PROFHiT over wide
range of datasets, we observed 41-88% better performance in accuracy and
significantly better calibration. Due to modeling the coherency over full

language models (LLM), enabling few-shot or even zero-shot learning. Black-box
prompt search has received growing interest recently for its distinctive
properties of gradient-free optimization, proven particularly useful and
powerful for model-as-a-service usage. However, the discrete nature and the
complexity of combinatorial optimization hinder the efficiency of modern
black-box approaches. Despite extensive research on search algorithms, the
crucial aspect of search space design and optimization has been largely
overlooked. In this paper, we first conduct a sensitivity analysis by prompting
LLM, revealing that only a small number of tokens exert a disproportionate
amount of influence on LLM predictions. Leveraging this insight, we propose the
Clustering and Pruning for Efficient Black-box Prompt Search (ClaPS), a simple
black-box search method that first clusters and prunes the search space to
focus exclusively on influential prompt tokens. By employing even simple search
methods within the pruned search space, ClaPS achieves state-of-the-art
performance across various tasks and LLMs, surpassing the performance of
complex approaches while significantly reducing search costs. Our findings
underscore the critical role of search space design and optimization in
enhancing both the usefulness and the efficiency of black-box prompt-based

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The reliance of text classifiers on spurious correlations can lead to poor
generalization at deployment, raising concerns about their use in
safety-critical domains such as healthcare. In this work, we propose to use
counterfactual data augmentation, guided by knowledge of the causal structure
of the data, to simulate interventions on spurious features and to learn more
robust text classifiers. We show that this strategy is appropriate in
prediction problems where the label is spuriously correlated with an attribute.
Under the assumptions of such problems, we discuss the favorable sample
complexity of counterfactual data augmentation, compared to importance
re-weighting. Pragmatically, we match examples using auxiliary data, based on
diff-in-diff methodology, and use a large language model (LLM) to represent a
conditional probability of text. Through extensive experimentation on learning
caregiver-invariant predictors of clinical diagnoses from medical narratives
and on semi-synthetic data, we demonstrate that our method for simulating
interventions improves out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracy compared to baseline
invariant learning algorithms.]]></summary>

learning systems. However, identifying problems within large-scale datasets
with real-world distributions is challenging due to the presence of complex

we propose a unified approach for identifying the problematic data by utilizing

algorithms for detecting label errors and outlier data based on the relational
graph structure of data. We further introduce a visualization tool that
provides contextual information of a data point in the feature-embedded space,
serving as an effective tool for interactively diagnosing data. We evaluate the
label error and outlier/out-of-distribution (OOD) detection performances of our
approach on the large-scale image, speech, and language domain tasks, including
ImageNet, ESC-50, and SST2. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art detection

optimizes differentiable predictors to improve both insertion and deletion

extend the metrics to be differentiable and use them to formalize insertion and

This paper addresses the issue of multi-source adaptation for unfamiliar

unknown target domains at training. Our innovative framework employs
example-based Hypernetwork adaptation: a T5 encoder-decoder initially generates
a unique signature from an input example, embedding it within the source
domains' semantic space. This signature is subsequently utilized by a
Hypernetwork to generate the task classifier's weights. We evaluated our method
across two tasks - sentiment classification and natural language inference - in
29 adaptation scenarios, where it outpaced established algorithms. In an
advanced version, the signature also enriches the input example's
representation. We also compare our finetuned architecture to few-shot GPT-3,
demonstrating its effectiveness in essential use cases. To our knowledge, this

continuous-time Gaussian policy whose mean is linear in the state variable and
whose covariance is state-independent. Contrary to discrete-time problems, the
cost is noncoercive in the policy and not all descent directions lead to
bounded iterates. We propose geometry-aware gradient descents for the mean and
covariance of the policy using the Fisher geometry and the Bures-Wasserstein
geometry, respectively. The policy iterates are shown to satisfy an a-priori
bound, and converge globally to the optimal policy with a linear rate. We
further propose a novel PG method with discrete-time policies. The algorithm
leverages the continuous-time analysis, and achieves a robust linear
convergence across different action frequencies. A numerical experiment

an upper bound on the minimal information-theoretically achievable expected

computation that minimize this bound. We present empirical results which
suggest that this approximation correctly identifies an asymptotic linear
compute-optimal scaling. This approximation also generates new insights. Among
other things, it suggests that, as the input dimension or latent space

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep discriminative approaches like random forests and deep neural networks
have recently found applications in many important real-world scenarios.
However, deploying these learning algorithms in safety-critical applications
raises concerns, particularly when it comes to ensuring confidence calibration
for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data points. Many popular
methods for in-distribution (ID) calibration, such as isotonic regression and
Platt's sigmoidal regression, exhibit excellent ID calibration performance but
often at the cost of classification accuracy. Moreover, these methods are not
calibrated for the entire feature space, leading to overconfidence in the case
of out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. In this paper, we leveraged the fact that
deep models, including both random forests and deep-nets, learn internal
representations which are unions of polytopes with affine activation functions
to conceptualize them both as partitioning rules of the feature space. We
replace the affine function in each polytope populated by the training data
with a Gaussian kernel. We propose sufficient conditions for our proposed
methods to be consistent estimators of the corresponding class conditional
densities. Moreover, our experiments on both tabular and vision benchmarks show
that the proposed approaches obtain well-calibrated posteriors while mostly
preserving or improving the classification accuracy of the original algorithm
for in-distribution region, and extrapolates beyond the training data to handle
out-of-distribution inputs appropriately.]]></summary>

classification tasks on graphs. While these improvements have been largely
demonstrated in a multi-class classification scenario, a more general and
realistic scenario in which each node could have multiple labels has so far
received little attention. The first challenge in conducting focused studies on
multi-label node classification is the limited number of publicly available
multi-label graph datasets. Therefore, as our first contribution, we collect
and release three real-world biological datasets and develop a multi-label
graph generator to generate datasets with tunable properties. While high label
similarity (high homophily) is usually attributed to the success of GNNs, we
argue that a multi-label scenario does not follow the usual semantics of
homophily and heterophily so far defined for a multi-class scenario. As our
second contribution, we define homophily and Cross-Class Neighborhood
Similarity for the multi-label scenario and provide a thorough analyses of the
collected $9$ multi-label datasets. Finally, we perform a large-scale
comparative study with $8$ methods and $9$ datasets and analyse the
performances of the methods to assess the progress made by current state of the
art in the multi-label node classification scenario. We release our benchmark

most existing loss functions are applied for each node independently, even if
node embeddings and their labels are non-i.i.d. because of their graph
structures. To eliminate such inconsistency, in this study we propose a novel
Quasi-Wasserstein (QW) loss with the help of the optimal transport defined on
graphs, leading to new learning and prediction paradigms of GNNs. In
particular, we design a "Quasi-Wasserstein" distance between the observed
multi-dimensional node labels and their estimations, optimizing the label
transport defined on graph edges. The estimations are parameterized by a GNN in
which the optimal label transport may determine the graph edge weights
optionally. By reformulating the strict constraint of the label transport to a
Bregman divergence-based regularizer, we obtain the proposed Quasi-Wasserstein
loss associated with two efficient solvers learning the GNN together with
optimal label transport. When predicting node labels, our model combines the
output of the GNN with the residual component provided by the optimal label
transport, leading to a new transductive prediction paradigm. Experiments show
that the proposed QW loss applies to various GNNs and helps to improve their

variety of real-world applications called LLM-Integrated Applications. Multiple
recent works showed that LLM-Integrated Applications are vulnerable to prompt
injection attacks, in which an attacker injects malicious instruction/data into
the input of those applications such that they produce results as the attacker
desires. However, existing works are limited to case studies. As a result, the
literature lacks a systematic understanding of prompt injection attacks and
their defenses. We aim to bridge the gap in this work. In particular, we
propose a general framework to formalize prompt injection attacks. Existing
attacks, which are discussed in research papers and blog posts, are special
cases in our framework. Our framework enables us to design a new attack by
combining existing attacks. Moreover, we also propose a framework to
systematize defenses against prompt injection attacks. Using our frameworks, we
conduct a systematic evaluation on prompt injection attacks and their defenses
with 10 LLMs and 7 tasks. We hope our frameworks can inspire future research in
this field. Our code is available at

federated learning (FL), particularly when the model size is large. Moreover,
user-generated data samples are likely to become non-IID across devices, which
commonly degrades the performance compared to the case with an IID dataset. To
cope with this, we propose federated augmentation (FAug), where each device
collectively trains a generative model, and thereby augments its local data
towards yielding an IID dataset. Empirical studies demonstrate that FD with

be obtained and that these methods can be used to measure the impact of
features on both the entropy of the predictive distribution and the

representability investigations for neural networks using other popular

previous polynomial time globally optimal algorithms work only for very

making settings, it has become increasingly important to have tools to
understand how models arrive at decisions. Assuming a trained Supervised
Classification model, explanations can be obtained via counterfactual analysis:
a counterfactual explanation of an instance indicates how this instance should
be minimally modified so that the perturbed instance is classified in the
desired class by the Machine Learning classification model. Most of the
Counterfactual Analysis literature focuses on the single-instance
single-counterfactual setting, in which the analysis is done for one single
instance to provide one single explanation. Taking a stakeholder's perspective,
in this paper we introduce the so-called collective counterfactual
explanations. By means of novel Mathematical Optimization models, we provide a
counterfactual explanation for each instance in a group of interest, so that
the total cost of the perturbations is minimized under some linking
constraints. Making the process of constructing counterfactuals collective
instead of individual enables us to detect the features that are critical to
the entire dataset to have the individuals classified in the desired class. Our
methodology allows for some instances to be treated individually, performing
the collective counterfactual analysis for a fraction of records of the group
of interest. This way, outliers are identified and handled appropriately. Under
some assumptions on the classifier and the space in which counterfactuals are
sought, finding collective counterfactuals is reduced to solving a convex
quadratic linearly constrained mixed integer optimization problem, which, for
datasets of moderate size, can be solved to optimality using existing solvers.
The performance of our approach is illustrated on real-world datasets,
demonstrating its usefulness.]]></summary>

hierarchical forecasting techniques reduces the computational cost of the
prediction phase in the forecasting pipeline. On the public M5 dataset, our
sparse hierarchical loss function performs up to 10% (RMSE) better compared to
the baseline loss function. We implement our sparse hierarchical loss function
within an existing forecasting model at bol, a large European e-commerce
platform, resulting in an improved forecasting performance of 2% at the product
level. Finally, we found an increase in forecasting performance of about 5-10%
when evaluating the forecasting performance across the cross-sectional
hierarchies that we defined. These results demonstrate the usefulness of our
sparse hierarchical loss applied to a production forecasting system at a major
e-commerce platform.]]></summary>

literature of fair machine learning, rigorous theoretical analyses have been
scarce. To demystify this long-standing challenge, this work seeks to develop a
theoretical framework by characterizing the shape of the accuracy-fairness
trade-off Pareto frontier (FairFrontier), determined by a set of all optimal
Pareto classifiers that no other classifiers can dominate. Specifically, we
first demonstrate the existence of the trade-off in real-world scenarios and
then propose four potential categories to characterize the important properties
of the accuracy-fairness Pareto frontier. For each category, we identify the
necessary conditions that lead to corresponding trade-offs. Experimental
results on synthetic data suggest insightful findings of the proposed
framework: (1) When sensitive attributes can be fully interpreted by
non-sensitive attributes, FairFrontier is mostly continuous. (2) Accuracy can
suffer a \textit{sharp} decline when over-pursuing fairness. (3) Eliminate the
trade-off via a two-step streamlined approach. The proposed research enables an
in-depth understanding of the accuracy-fairness trade-off, pushing current fair
machine-learning research to a new frontier.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During Automated Program Repair (APR), it can be challenging to synthesize
correct patches for real-world systems in general-purpose programming
languages. Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be helpful
"copilots" in assisting developers with various coding tasks, and have also
been directly applied for patch synthesis. However, most LLMs treat programs as
sequences of tokens, meaning that they are ignorant of the underlying semantics
constraints of the target programming language. This results in plenty of
statically invalid generated patches, impeding the practicality of the
technique. Therefore, we propose Repilot, a framework to further copilot the AI
"copilots" (i.e., LLMs) by synthesizing more valid patches during the repair
process. Our key insight is that many LLMs produce outputs autoregressively
(i.e., token by token), resembling human writing programs, which can be
significantly boosted and guided through a Completion Engine. Repilot
synergistically synthesizes a candidate patch through the interaction between
an LLM and a Completion Engine, which 1) prunes away infeasible tokens
suggested by the LLM and 2) proactively completes the token based on the
suggestions provided by the Completion Engine. Our evaluation on a subset of
the widely-used Defects4j 1.2 and 2.0 datasets shows that Repilot fixes 66 and
50 bugs, respectively, surpassing the best-performing baseline by 14 and 16
bugs fixed. More importantly, Repilot is capable of producing more valid and
correct patches than the base LLM when given the same generation budget.]]></summary>

two fundamental challenges: accurate representation of prior information and
efficient evaluation of likelihoods. Principal component analysis (PCA) and
related techniques can in some cases facilitate the definition and sampling of
the prior distribution, as well as the training of accurate surrogate models,
using for instance, polynomial chaos expansion (PCE). However, complex
geological priors with sharp contrasts necessitate more complex
dimensionality-reduction techniques, such as, deep generative models (DGMs). By
sampling a low-dimensional prior probability distribution defined in the
low-dimensional latent space of such a model, it becomes possible to
efficiently sample the physical domain at the price of a generator that is
typically highly non-linear. Training a surrogate that is capable of capturing
intricate non-linear relationships between latent parameters and outputs of
forward modeling presents a notable challenge. Indeed, while PCE models provide
high accuracy when the input-output relationship can be effectively
approximated by relatively low-degree multivariate polynomials, this condition
is typically not met when employing latent variables derived from DGMs. In this
contribution, we present a strategy combining the excellent reconstruction
performances of a variational autoencoder (VAE) with the accuracy of PCA-PCE
surrogate modeling in the context of Bayesian ground penetrating radar (GPR)
traveltime tomography. Within the MCMC process, the parametrization of the VAE
is leveraged for prior exploration and sample proposals. Concurrently,
surrogate modeling is conducted using PCE, which operates on either globally or
locally defined principal components of the VAE samples under examination.]]></summary>

us to precisely characterize their abilities and limitations. Previous work has

However, LMs do not describe unweighted formal languages -- rather, they define
probability distributions over strings. In this work, we study what classes of
such probability distributions RNN LMs can represent, which allows us to make
more direct statements about their capabilities. We show that simple RNNs are
equivalent to a subclass of probabilistic finite-state automata, and can thus
model a strict subset of probability distributions expressible by finite-state
models. Furthermore, we study the space complexity of representing finite-state
LMs with RNNs. We show that, to represent an arbitrary deterministic
finite-state LM with $N$ states over an alphabet $\Sigma$, an RNN requires
$\Omega\left(N |\Sigma|\right)$ neurons. These results present a first step

The central insight behind Cosmos is the use of a novel form of neurosymbolic

neurosymbolic scene encodings, which represent each entity in a scene using a
real vector computed using a neural encoder, as well as a vector of composable
symbols describing attributes of the entity, and (ii) a neurosymbolic attention
mechanism that binds these entities to learned rules of interaction. Cosmos is
end-to-end differentiable; also, unlike traditional neurosymbolic methods that
require representations to be manually mapped to symbols, it computes an

an evaluation that considers two different forms of CG on an established

a list of bounding boxes, sort them by their classification confidence scores,
and select the top-ranked predictions as the final detection results for the
given input image. A highly performant object detector requires accurate
ranking for the bounding box predictions. For DETR-based detectors, the
top-ranked bounding boxes suffer from less accurate localization quality due to
the misalignment between classification scores and localization accuracy, thus
impeding the construction of high-quality detectors. In this work, we introduce
a simple and highly performant DETR-based object detector by proposing a series
of rank-oriented designs, combinedly called Rank-DETR. Our key contributions
include: (i) a rank-oriented architecture design that can prompt positive
predictions and suppress the negative ones to ensure lower false positive
rates, as well as (ii) a rank-oriented loss function and matching cost design
that prioritizes predictions of more accurate localization accuracy during
ranking to boost the AP under high IoU thresholds. We apply our method to
improve the recent SOTA methods (e.g., H-DETR and DINO-DETR) and report strong
COCO object detection results when using different backbones such as
ResNet-$50$, Swin-T, and Swin-L, demonstrating the effectiveness of our

multiple and decentralized clients to collaboratively train a model under the
orchestration of a central aggregator. Traditional FL solutions rely on the
trust assumption of the centralized aggregator, which forms cohorts of clients
in a fair and honest manner. However, a malicious aggregator, in reality, could
abandon and replace the client's training models, or launch Sybil attacks to
insert fake clients. Such malicious behaviors give the aggregator more power to
control clients in the FL setting and determine the final training results. In
this work, we introduce zkFL, which leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to
tackle the issue of a malicious aggregator during the training model
aggregation process. To guarantee the correct aggregation results, the
aggregator needs to provide a proof per round. The proof can demonstrate to the
clients that the aggregator executes the intended behavior faithfully. To
further reduce the verification cost of clients, we employ a blockchain to
handle the proof in a zero-knowledge way, where miners (i.e., the nodes
validating and maintaining the blockchain data) can verify the proof without
knowing the clients' local and aggregated models. The theoretical analysis and
empirical results show that zkFL can achieve better security and privacy than
traditional FL, without modifying the underlying FL network structure or
heavily compromising the training speed.]]></summary>

artificial neural networks is an endeavor with broader implications for
physics, machine learning, neuroscience and society. Here we introduce a
minimal model that condenses several recent decentralized algorithms by
considering a competition between two terms: the local learning dynamics in the
parameters of each neural network unit, and a diffusive coupling among units
that tends to homogenize the parameters of the ensemble. We derive the
coarse-grained behavior of our model via an effective theory for linear
networks that we show is analogous to a deformed Ginzburg-Landau model with
quenched disorder. This framework predicts (depth-dependent)
disorder-order-disorder phase transitions in the parameters' solutions that
reveal the onset of a collective learning phase, along with a depth-induced
delay of the critical point and a robust shape of the microscopic learning
path. We validate our theory in realistic ensembles of coupled nonlinear
networks trained in the MNIST dataset under privacy constraints. Interestingly,
experiments confirm that individual networks -- trained only with private data
-- can fully generalize to unseen data classes when the collective learning
phase emerges. Our work elucidates the physics of collective learning and
contributes to the mechanistic interpretability of deep learning in
decentralized settings.]]></summary>

within the physical and biological sciences. These models are necessary for
capturing the dynamics of small systems where the individual nature of the
populations cannot be ignored and stochastic effects are important. The
inference of the parameters of such models, from time series data, is difficult
due to intractability of the likelihood; current methods, based on simulations
of the underlying model, can be so computationally expensive as to be
prohibitive. In this paper we construct a neural likelihood approximation for
integer valued time series data using causal convolutions, which allows us to
evaluate the likelihood of the whole time series in parallel. We demonstrate
our method by performing inference on a number of ecological and
epidemiological models, showing that we can accurately approximate the true
posterior while achieving significant computational speed ups in situations
where current methods struggle.]]></summary>

strategies, as well as user- and system-level decision making in the
transportation network. While traffic forecasting has been approached with a
variety of techniques over the last couple of decades, most approaches simply
rely on endogenous traffic variables for state prediction, despite the evidence
that exogenous factors can significantly impact traffic conditions. This paper
proposes a multi-dimensional spatio-temporal graph attention-based traffic
prediction approach (M-STGAT), which predicts traffic based on past
observations of speed, along with lane closure events, temperature, and
visibility across the transportation network. The approach is based on a graph
attention network architecture, which also learns based on the structure of the
transportation network on which these variables are observed. Numerical
experiments are performed using traffic speed and lane closure data from the
California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) Performance Measurement
System (PeMS). The corresponding weather data were downloaded from the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOOA) Automated Surface Observing
Systems (ASOS). For comparison, the numerical experiments implement three
alternative models which do not allow for the multi-dimensional input. The
M-STGAT is shown to outperform the three alternative models, when performing
tests using our primary data set for prediction with a 30-, 45-, and 60-minute
prediction horizon, in terms of three error measures: Mean Absolute Error
(MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
However, the model's transferability can vary for different transfer data sets
and this aspect may require further investigation.]]></summary>

problem, such as an undesirable business situation or unintended harm to the
individual(s). This implies that we can identify how the problems are
inherited, rank the causes to help prioritize fixes, simplify a complex problem
and visualize them. In the context of machine learning (ML), one can use
cause-to-effect analysis to understand the reason for the biased behavior of
the system. For example, we can examine the root causes of biases by checking
each feature for a potential cause of bias in the model. To approach this, one
can apply small changes to a given feature or a pair of features in the data,
following some guidelines and observing how it impacts the decision made by the
model (i.e., model prediction). Therefore, we can use cause-to-effect analysis
to identify the potential bias-inducing features, even when these features are
originally are unknown. This is important since most current methods require a
pre-identification of sensitive features for bias assessment and can actually
miss other relevant bias-inducing features, which is why systematic
identification of such features is necessary. Moreover, it often occurs that to
achieve an equitable outcome, one has to take into account sensitive features
in the model decision. Therefore, it should be up to the domain experts to
decide based on their knowledge of the context of a decision whether bias
induced by specific features is acceptable or not. In this study, we propose an
approach for systematically identifying all bias-inducing features of a model
to help support the decision-making of domain experts. We evaluated our
technique using four well-known datasets to showcase how our contribution can
help spearhead the standard procedure when developing, testing, maintaining,

orthogonal elements are known to be hard to learn by the Statistical Query
algorithms. Recently this classical fact re-emerged in a theory of
gradient-based optimization of neural networks. In the novel framework, the
hardness of a class is usually quantified by the variance of the gradient with
respect to a random choice of a target function.

A set of functions of the form $x\to ax \bmod p$, where $a$ is taken from
${\mathbb Z}_p$, has attracted some attention from deep learning theorists and
cryptographers recently. This class can be understood as a subset of
$p$-periodic functions on ${\mathbb Z}$ and is tightly connected with a class
of high-frequency periodic functions on the real line.

We present a mathematical analysis of limitations and challenges associated
with using gradient-based learning techniques to train a high-frequency
periodic function or modular multiplication from examples. We highlight that
the variance of the gradient is negligibly small in both cases when either a
frequency or the prime base $p$ is large. This in turn prevents such a learning

automatically searching for an instructional prompt to alter the writing style

possible for many downstream applications to be carried out efficiently and
accurately by simply taking the dot product between image and text
representations. One of the most representative approaches proposed recently
known as CLIP has garnered widespread adoption due to its effectiveness. CLIP
is trained with an InfoNCE loss that takes into account both positive and
negative samples to help learn a much more robust representation space. This
paper reveals that the common downstream practice of taking a dot product is
only a zeroth-order approximation of the optimization goal, resulting in a loss
of information during test-time. Intuitively, since the model has been
optimized based on the InfoNCE loss, test-time procedures should also be in
alignment. The question lies in how one can retrieve any semblance of negative
samples information during inference in a computationally efficient way. To
this end, we propose Distribution Normalization (DN), where we approximate the
mean representation of a batch of test samples and use such a mean to represent
what would be analogous to negative samples in the InfoNCE loss. DN requires no
retraining or fine-tuning and can be effortlessly applied during inference.
Extensive experiments on a wide variety of downstream tasks exhibit a clear
advantage of DN over the dot product on top of other existing test-time
augmentation methods.]]></summary>

building predictive models that combine statistical patterns with domain
knowledge. The underlying notion is to enrich the optimization loss function
with known relationships to constrain the space of possible solutions.
Hydrodynamic simulations are a core constituent of modern cosmology, while the
required computations are both expensive and time-consuming. At the same time,
the comparatively fast simulation of dark matter requires fewer resources,
which has led to the emergence of machine learning algorithms for baryon
inpainting as an active area of research; here, recreating the scatter found in
hydrodynamic simulations is an ongoing challenge. This paper presents the first
application of physics-informed neural networks to baryon inpainting by
combining advances in neural network architectures with physical constraints,
injecting theory on baryon conversion efficiency into the model loss function.
We also introduce a punitive prediction comparison based on the
Kullback-Leibler divergence, which enforces scatter reproduction. By
simultaneously extracting the complete set of baryonic properties for the Simba
suite of cosmological simulations, our results demonstrate improved accuracy of
baryonic predictions based on dark matter halo properties, successful recovery
of the fundamental metallicity relation, and retrieve scatter that traces the
target simulation's distribution.]]></summary>

for machine learning-assisted quality assurance. A widely used manufacturing
process that can strongly benefit from data-driven solutions is \ac{GMAW}. The
welding process is characterized by complex cause-effect relationships between
material properties, process conditions and weld quality. In non-laboratory
environments with frequently changing process parameters, accurate
determination of weld quality by destructive testing is economically
unfeasible. Deep learning offers the potential to identify the relationships in
available process data and predict the weld quality from process observations.
In this paper, we present a concept for a deep learning based predictive
quality system in \ac{GMAW}. At its core, the concept involves a pipeline
consisting of four major phases: collection and management of multi-sensor data
(e.g. current and voltage), real-time processing and feature engineering of the
time series data by means of autoencoders, training and deployment of suitable
recurrent deep learning models for quality predictions, and model evolutions
under changing process conditions using continual learning. The concept
provides the foundation for future research activities in which we will realize
an online predictive quality system for running production.]]></summary>

perplexity by retrieval (e.g., RETRO), but its impact on text generation
quality and downstream task accuracy is unclear. Thus, it is still an open
question: shall we pretrain large autoregressive LMs with retrieval? To answer
it, we perform a comprehensive study on a scalable pre-trained
retrieval-augmented LM (i.e., RETRO) compared with standard GPT and
retrieval-augmented GPT incorporated at fine-tuning or inference stages. We
first provide the recipe to reproduce RETRO up to 9.5B parameters while
retrieving a text corpus with 330B tokens. Based on that, we have the following
novel findings: i) RETRO outperforms GPT on text generation with much less
degeneration (i.e., repetition), moderately higher factual accuracy, and
slightly lower toxicity with a nontoxic retrieval database. ii) On the LM
Evaluation Harness benchmark, RETRO largely outperforms GPT on
knowledge-intensive tasks, but is on par with GPT on other tasks. Furthermore,
we introduce a simple variant of the model, RETRO++, which largely improves
open-domain QA results of original RETRO (e.g., EM score +8.6 on Natural
Question) and significantly outperforms retrieval-augmented GPT in both
fine-tuning and zero-shot evaluation settings. Our findings highlight the
promising direction of pretraining autoregressive LMs with retrieval as future
foundation models. We release our implementation at:

successfully transferring these attacks from the digital realm to the physical

an adversarial texture on a chosen object while having control over various
scene parameters. The audience will choose a scene, an object to attack, the
desired attack class, and the number of camera positions to use. Then, in real

present a method that, during inference time, simultaneously generates only
reachable goals and plans motions that avoid obstacles, all from a single

based on their historical sequences; (2) a patching technique that divides each
sequence into multiple patches and feeds them to Transformer, allowing the

neural networks, gradient backpropagation is still the most widely used
algorithm for training such networks. On the one hand, we have deterministic or
full gradient (FG) approaches that have a cost proportional to the amount of
training data used but have a linear convergence rate, and on the other hand,
stochastic gradient (SG) methods that have a cost independent of the size of
the dataset, but have a less optimal convergence rate than the determinist
approaches. To combine the cost of the stochastic approach with the convergence
rate of the deterministic approach, a stochastic average gradient (SAG) has
been proposed. SAG is a method for optimizing the sum of a finite number of
smooth convex functions. Like SG methods, the SAG method's iteration cost is
independent of the number of terms in the sum. In this work, we propose to
compare SAG to some standard optimizers used in machine learning. SAG converges
faster than other optimizers on simple toy problems and performs better than
many other optimizers on simple machine learning problems. We also propose a
combination of SAG with the momentum algorithm and Adam. These combinations
allow empirically higher speed and obtain better performance than the other

principles for modeling the dynamics of various physical systems. Notable
examples include modeling decision-making within the brain using the
free-energy principle, optimizing the accuracy-complexity trade-off when
accessing hidden variables with the information bottleneck principle (Tishby et
al., 2000), and navigation in random environments using information
maximization (Vergassola et al., 2007). Built on this principle, we propose a
new class of bandit algorithms that maximize an approximation to the
information of a key variable within the system. To this end, we develop an
approximated analytical physics-based representation of an entropy to forecast
the information gain of each action and greedily choose the one with the
largest information gain. This method yields strong performances in classical
bandit settings. Motivated by its empirical success, we prove its asymptotic
optimality for the two-armed bandit problem with Gaussian rewards. Owing to its
ability to encompass the system's properties in a global physical functional,
this approach can be efficiently adapted to more complex bandit settings,
calling for further investigation of information maximization approaches for

applications spanning various scientific domains. Whether scientists are
conducting fundamental research or refining practical applications, they
typically assess and rank classification techniques based on performance
metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. However, reported
performance scores may not always serve as a reliable basis for research
ranking. This can be attributed to undisclosed or unconventional practices
related to cross-validation, typographical errors, and other factors. In a
given experimental setup, with a specific number of positive and negative test
items, most performance scores can assume specific, interrelated values. In
this paper, we introduce numerical techniques to assess the consistency of
reported performance scores and the assumed experimental setup. Importantly,
the proposed approach does not rely on statistical inference but uses numerical
methods to identify inconsistencies with certainty. Through three different
applications related to medicine, we demonstrate how the proposed techniques
can effectively detect inconsistencies, thereby safeguarding the integrity of
research fields. To benefit the scientific community, we have made the
consistency tests available in an open-source Python package.]]></summary>

optimization performance on a task of interest by exploiting the knowledge
captured from several previously-solved optimization tasks stored in a
database, has been gaining increasing research attention over the years.
However, despite the remarkable advances in algorithm design, the development
of a systematic benchmark suite for comprehensive comparisons of STO algorithms
received far less attention. Existing test problems are either simply generated
by assembling other benchmark functions or extended from specific practical
problems with limited scalability. The relationships between the optimal
solutions of the source and target tasks in these problems are also often
manually configured, limiting their ability to model different similarity
relationships presented in real-world problems. Consequently, the good
performance achieved by an algorithm on these problems might be biased and hard
to be generalized to other problems. In light of the above, in this study, we
first introduce four concepts for characterizing STO problems and present an
important problem feature, namely similarity distribution, which quantitatively
delineates the relationship between the optima of the source and target tasks.
Then, we present the general design guidelines of STO problems and a particular
STO problem generator with good scalability. Specifically, the similarity
distribution of a problem can be easily customized, enabling a continuous
spectrum of representation of the diverse similarity relationships of
real-world problems. Lastly, a benchmark suite with 12 STO problems featured by
a variety of customized similarity relationships is developed using the
proposed generator. The source code of the problem generator is available at

model (LLM) hallucinations using instruction tuning and retrieval augmentation,
it remains challenging to measure the reliability of LLMs using human-crafted
evaluation data which is not available for many tasks and domains and could
suffer from data leakage. Inspired by adversarial machine learning, this paper
aims to develop a method of automatically generating evaluation data by
appropriately modifying existing data on which LLMs behave faithfully.
Specifically, this paper presents AutoDebug, an LLM-based framework to use
prompting chaining to generate transferable adversarial attacks in the form of
question-answering examples. We seek to understand the extent to which these
examples trigger the hallucination behaviors of LLMs.

We implement AutoDebug using ChatGPT and evaluate the resulting two variants
of a popular open-domain question-answering dataset, Natural Questions (NQ), on
a collection of open-source and proprietary LLMs under various prompting
settings. Our generated evaluation data is human-readable and, as we show,
humans can answer these modified questions well. Nevertheless, we observe
pronounced accuracy drops across multiple LLMs including GPT-4. Our
experimental results show that LLMs are likely to hallucinate in two categories
of question-answering scenarios where (1) there are conflicts between knowledge
given in the prompt and their parametric knowledge, or (2) the knowledge
expressed in the prompt is complex. Finally, we find that the adversarial
examples generated by our method are transferable across all considered LLMs.
The examples generated by a small model can be used to debug a much larger
model, making our approach cost-effective.]]></summary>

that the proposed neighborhood aggregation method for OOD scores outperforms

Furthermore, we demonstrate that our Open-WRF method is more robust to

categories. Specifically, we employ a neural process-based meta-learning
approach to train an encoder to capture texture and geometry of an object in a
latent representation, based on very few RGB-D images and ground-truth
keypoints. The latent representation is then used by a simultaneously
meta-trained decoder to predict the 6D pose of the object in new images.
Furthermore, we propose a novel geometry-aware decoder for the keypoint
prediction using a Graph Neural Network (GNN), which explicitly takes geometric
constraints specific to each object into consideration. To evaluate our
algorithm, extensive experiments are conducted on the \linemod dataset, and on
our new fully-annotated synthetic datasets generated from Multiple Categories
in Multiple Scenes (MCMS). Experimental results demonstrate that our model
performs well on unseen objects with very different shapes and appearances.
Remarkably, our model also shows robust performance on occluded scenes although
trained fully on data without occlusion. To our knowledge, this is the first
work exploring \textbf{cross-category level} 6D pose estimation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The fast-paced development of machine learning (ML) methods coupled with its
increasing adoption in research poses challenges for researchers without
extensive training in ML. In neuroscience, for example, ML can help understand
brain-behavior relationships, diagnose diseases, and develop biomarkers using
various data sources like magnetic resonance imaging and
electroencephalography. The primary objective of ML is to build models that can
make accurate predictions on unseen data. Researchers aim to prove the
existence of such generalizable models by evaluating performance using
techniques such as cross-validation (CV), which uses systematic subsampling to
estimate the generalization performance. Choosing a CV scheme and evaluating an
ML pipeline can be challenging and, if used improperly, can lead to
overestimated results and incorrect interpretations.

We created julearn, an open-source Python library, that allow researchers to
design and evaluate complex ML pipelines without encountering in common
pitfalls. In this manuscript, we present the rationale behind julearn's design,
its core features, and showcase three examples of previously-published research
projects that can be easily implemented using this novel library. Julearn aims
to simplify the entry into the ML world by providing an easy-to-use environment
with built in guards against some of the most common ML pitfalls. With its
design, unique features and simple interface, it poses as a useful Python-based
library for research projects.]]></summary>

unrealistic assumption of an extremely small learning rate. This lies in stark
contrast to practical wisdom and empirical studies, such as the work of J.
Cohen et al. (ICLR 2021), which exhibit startling new phenomena (the "edge of
stability" or "unstable convergence") and potential benefits for generalization
in the large learning rate regime. Despite a flurry of recent works on this
topic, however, the latter effect is still poorly understood. In this paper, we
take a step towards understanding genuinely non-convex training dynamics with
large learning rates by performing a detailed analysis of gradient descent for
simplified models of two-layer neural networks. For these models, we provably
establish the edge of stability phenomenon and discover a sharp phase
transition for the step size below which the neural network fails to learn
"threshold-like" neurons (i.e., neurons with a non-zero first-layer bias). This
elucidates one possible mechanism by which the edge of stability can in fact
lead to better generalization, as threshold neurons are basic building blocks
with useful inductive bias for many tasks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Great progress has been made in automatic medical image segmentation due to
powerful deep representation learning. The influence of transformer has led to
research into its variants, and large-scale replacement of traditional CNN
modules. However, such trend often overlooks the intrinsic feature extraction
capabilities of the transformer and potential refinements to both the model and
the transformer module through minor adjustments. This study proposes a novel
deep medical image segmentation framework, called DA-TransUNet, aiming to
introduce the Transformer and dual attention block into the encoder and decoder
of the traditional U-shaped architecture. Unlike prior transformer-based
solutions, our DA-TransUNet utilizes attention mechanism of transformer and
multifaceted feature extraction of DA-Block, which can efficiently combine
global, local, and multi-scale features to enhance medical image segmentation.
Meanwhile, experimental results show that a dual attention block is added
before the Transformer layer to facilitate feature extraction in the U-net
structure. Furthermore, incorporating dual attention blocks in skip connections
can enhance feature transfer to the decoder, thereby improving image
segmentation performance. Experimental results across various benchmark of
medical image segmentation reveal that DA-TransUNet significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods. The codes and parameters of our model will be
publicly available at https://github.com/SUN-1024/DA-TransUnet.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Manifold learning flows are a class of generative modelling techniques that
assume a low-dimensional manifold description of the data. The embedding of
such manifold into the high-dimensional space of the data is achieved via
learnable invertible transformations. Therefore, once the manifold is properly
aligned via a reconstruction loss, the probability density is tractable on the
manifold and maximum likelihood can be used optimize the network parameters.
Naturally, the lower-dimensional representation of the data requires an
injective-mapping. Recent approaches were able to enforce that density aligns
with the modelled manifold, while efficiently calculating the density
volume-change term when embedding to the higher-dimensional space. However,
unless the injective-mapping is analytically predefined, the learned manifold
is not necessarily an efficient representation of the data. Namely, the latent
dimensions of such models frequently learn an entangled intrinsic basis with
degenerate information being stored in each dimension. Alternatively, if a
locally orthogonal and/or sparse basis is to be learned, here coined canonical
intrinsic basis, it can serve in learning a more compact latent space
representation. Towards this end, we propose a canonical manifold learning flow
method, where a novel optimization objective enforces the transformation matrix
to have few prominent and orthogonal basis functions. Canonical manifold flow
yields a more efficient use of the latent space, automatically generating fewer
prominent and distinct dimensions to represent data, and consequently a better
approximation of target distributions than other manifold flow methods in most
experiments we conducted, resulting in lower FID scores.]]></summary>

context of cybersecurity, with a particular emphasis on its possible risk
factors with awareness, which can be managed by incorporating human experts in
the loop, i.e., "Human-AI" teaming. As artificial intelligence (AI)
technologies advance, they will provide unparalleled opportunities for attack
identification, incident response, and recovery. However, the successful
deployment of AI into cybersecurity measures necessitates an in-depth
understanding of its capabilities, challenges, and ethical and legal
implications to handle associated risk factors in real-world application areas.
Towards this, we emphasize the importance of a balanced approach that
incorporates AI's computational power with human expertise. AI systems may
proactively discover vulnerabilities and detect anomalies through pattern
recognition, and predictive modeling, significantly enhancing speed and
accuracy. Human experts can explain AI-generated decisions to stakeholders,
regulators, and end-users in critical situations, ensuring responsibility and
accountability, which helps establish trust in AI-driven security solutions.
Therefore, in this position paper, we argue that human-AI teaming is worthwhile
in cybersecurity, in which human expertise such as intuition, critical

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This work reveals an evidential signal that emerges from the uncertainty
value in Evidential Deep Learning (EDL). EDL is one example of a class of
uncertainty-aware deep learning approaches designed to provide confidence (or
epistemic uncertainty) about the current test sample. In particular for
computer vision and bidirectional encoder large language models, the
`evidential signal' arising from the Dirichlet strength in EDL can, in some
cases, discriminate between classes, which is particularly strong when using
large language models. We hypothesise that the KL regularisation term causes
EDL to couple aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. In this paper, we
empirically investigate the correlations between misclassification and
evaluated uncertainty, and show that EDL's `evidential signal' is due to
misclassification bias. We critically evaluate EDL with other Dirichlet-based
approaches, namely Generative Evidential Neural Networks (EDL-GEN) and Prior
Networks, and show theoretically and empirically the differences between these
loss functions. We conclude that EDL's coupling of uncertainty arises from
these differences due to the use (or lack) of out-of-distribution samples
during training.]]></summary>

observed information to predict the missing one. Particularly, answering
complex queries based on first-order logic is one of the crucial tasks to
verify learning to reason abilities for generalization and composition.
Recently, the prevailing method is query embedding which learns the embedding
of a set of entities and treats logic operations as set operations and has
shown great empirical success. Though there has been much research following
the same formulation, many of its claims lack a formal and systematic
inspection. In this paper, we rethink this formulation and justify many of the
previous claims by characterizing the scope of queries investigated previously
and precisely identifying the gap between its formulation and its goal, as well
as providing complexity analysis for the currently investigated queries.
Moreover, we develop a new dataset containing ten new types of queries with
features that have never been considered and therefore can provide a thorough
investigation of complex queries. Finally, we propose a new neural-symbolic
method, Fuzzy Inference with Truth value (FIT), where we equip the neural link
predictors with fuzzy logic theory to support end-to-end learning using complex
queries with provable reasoning capability. Empirical results show that our
method outperforms previous methods significantly in the new dataset and also
surpasses previous methods in the existing dataset at the same time.]]></summary>

2D and 3D data for weakly supervised point cloud segmentation. Research studies
have shown that 2D and 3D features are complementary for point cloud
segmentation. However, existing methods require extra 2D annotations to achieve
2D-3D information fusion. Considering the high annotation cost of point clouds,
effective 2D and 3D feature fusion based on weakly supervised learning is in
great demand. To this end, we propose a transformer model with two encoders and
one decoder for weakly supervised point cloud segmentation using only
scene-level class tags. Specifically, the two encoders compute the
self-attended features for 3D point clouds and 2D multi-view images,
respectively. The decoder implements interlaced 2D-3D cross-attention and
carries out implicit 2D and 3D feature fusion. We alternately switch the roles
of queries and key-value pairs in the decoder layers. It turns out that the 2D
and 3D features are iteratively enriched by each other. Experiments show that
it performs favorably against existing weakly supervised point cloud
segmentation methods by a large margin on the S3DIS and ScanNet benchmarks. The

texts with the knowledge internalized in parameters. Yet, LMs often generate
the factually incorrect responses to the given queries, since their knowledge
may be inaccurate, incomplete, and outdated. To address this problem, previous
works propose to augment LMs with the knowledge retrieved from an external
knowledge source. However, such approaches often show suboptimal text
generation performance due to two reasons: 1) the model may fail to retrieve
the knowledge relevant to the given query, or 2) the model may not faithfully
reflect the retrieved knowledge in the generated text. To overcome these, we
propose to verify the output and the knowledge of the knowledge-augmented LMs
with a separate verifier, which is a small LM that is trained to detect those
two types of errors through instruction-finetuning. Then, when the verifier
recognizes an error, we can rectify it by either retrieving new knowledge or
generating new text. Further, we use an ensemble of the outputs from different
instructions with a single verifier to enhance the reliability of the
verification processes. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed
verification steps on multiple question answering benchmarks, whose results
show that the proposed verifier effectively identifies retrieval and generation
errors, allowing LMs to provide more factually correct outputs. Our code is

have significantly advanced the development of LLMs. However, they are far
inferior to commercial models such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 when acting as agents
to tackle complex tasks in the real world. These agent tasks employ LLMs as the
central controller responsible for planning, memorization, and tool
utilization, necessitating both fine-grained prompting methods and robust LLMs
to achieve satisfactory performance. Though many prompting methods have been
proposed to complete particular agent tasks, there is lack of research focusing
on improving the agent capabilities of LLMs themselves without compromising
their general abilities. In this work, we present AgentTuning, a simple and
general method to enhance the agent abilities of LLMs while maintaining their
general LLM capabilities. We construct AgentInstruct, a lightweight
instruction-tuning dataset containing high-quality interaction trajectories. We
employ a hybrid instruction-tuning strategy by combining AgentInstruct with
open-source instructions from general domains. AgentTuning is used to
instruction-tune the Llama 2 series, resulting in AgentLM. Our evaluations show
that AgentTuning enables LLMs' agent capabilities without compromising general
abilities. The AgentLM-70B is comparable to GPT-3.5-turbo on unseen agent
tasks, demonstrating generalized agent capabilities. We open source the

and the ensuing security issues, a range of methods, including Adversarial
Training (AT) as a prominent representative, aimed at enhancing model
robustness against various adversarial attacks, have seen rapid development.
However, existing methods essentially assist the current state of target model
to defend against parameter-oriented adversarial attacks with explicit or
implicit computation burdens, which also suffers from unstable convergence
behavior due to inconsistency of optimization trajectories. Diverging from
previous work, this paper reconsiders the update rule of target model and
corresponding deficiency to defend based on its current state. By introducing
the historical state of the target model as a proxy, which is endowed with much
prior information for defense, we formulate a two-stage update rule, resulting
in a general adversarial defense framework, which we refer to as `LAST' ({\bf
L}earn from the P{\bf ast}). Besides, we devise a Self Distillation (SD) based
defense objective to constrain the update process of the proxy model without
the introduction of larger teacher models. Experimentally, we demonstrate
consistent and significant performance enhancements by refining a series of
single-step and multi-step AT methods (e.g., up to $\bf 9.2\%$ and $\bf 20.5\%$
improvement of Robust Accuracy (RA) on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets,
respectively) across various datasets, backbones and attack modalities, and
validate its ability to enhance training stability and ameliorate catastrophic
overfitting issues meanwhile.]]></summary>

current LLMs often fall short in catering to the needs of domain experts like
oceanographers, and the potential of LLMs for ocean science is under-explored.

This work studies generalisation for datasets consisting of related tasks that
may differ in causal mechanisms. For example, observational medical data for
complex diseases suffers from heterogeneity in causal mechanisms of disease
across patients, creating challenges for machine learning algorithms that need
to generalise to new patients outside of the training dataset. Common
approaches for learning supervised models with heterogeneous datasets include
learning a global model for the entire dataset, learning local models for each
tasks' data, or utilising hierarchical, meta-learning and multi-task learning
approaches to learn how to generalise from data pooled across multiple tasks.
In this paper we propose causal similarity-based hierarchical Bayesian models
to improve generalisation to new tasks by learning how to pool data from
training tasks with similar causal mechanisms. We apply this general modelling
principle to Bayesian neural networks and compare a variety of methods for
estimating causal task similarity (for both known and unknown causal models).
We demonstrate the benefits of our approach and applicability to real world

minimizing the loss function $L(X)$. This loss function captures the
discrepancy between the expected output and the actual output of the

training models on sensitive user data. Differential privacy provides a formal

access to only the privatized data during statistical analysis makes it
computationally challenging to perform valid inferences on parameters

successful approach in resource-constrained environments, enabling substantial
reductions in model storage and memory costs without significant performance
compromise. However, it is important to note that parameter sharing does not
alleviate computational burdens associated with inference, thus impeding its
practicality in situations characterized by limited stringent latency
requirements or computational resources. Building upon neural ordinary
differential equations (ODEs), we introduce a straightforward technique to
enhance the inference efficiency of parameter-shared PLMs. Additionally, we
propose a simple pre-training technique that leads to fully or partially shared
models capable of achieving even greater inference acceleration. The
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on both
autoregressive and autoencoding PLMs, providing novel insights into more
efficient utilization of parameter-shared models in resource-constrained
settings.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent discoveries have revealed that deep neural networks might behave in a
biased manner in many real-world scenarios. For instance, deep networks trained
on a large-scale face recognition dataset CelebA tend to predict blonde hair
for females and black hair for males. Such biases not only jeopardize the
robustness of models but also perpetuate and amplify social biases, which is
especially concerning for automated decision-making processes in healthcare,
recruitment, etc., as they could exacerbate unfair economic and social
inequalities among different groups. Existing debiasing methods suffer from
high costs in bias labeling or model re-training, while also exhibiting a
deficiency in terms of elucidating the origins of biases within the model. To
this respect, we propose a fast model debiasing framework (FMD) which offers an
efficient approach to identify, evaluate and remove biases inherent in trained
models. The FMD identifies biased attributes through an explicit counterfactual
concept and quantifies the influence of data samples with influence functions.
Moreover, we design a machine unlearning-based strategy to efficiently and
effectively remove the bias in a trained model with a small counterfactual
dataset. Experiments on the Colored MNIST, CelebA, and Adult Income datasets
along with experiments with large language models demonstrate that our method
achieves superior or competing accuracies compared with state-of-the-art
methods while attaining significantly fewer biases and requiring much less
debiasing cost. Notably, our method requires only a small external dataset and
updating a minimal amount of model parameters, without the requirement of
access to training data that may be too large or unavailable in practice.]]></summary>

selected words when conditioned on the chosen language model. Therefore, we
propose Label-Aware Automatic Verbalizer (LAAV), effectively augmenting the
manual labels to achieve better few-shot classification results. Specifically,
we use the manual labels along with the conjunction "and" to induce the model
to generate more effective words for the verbalizer. The experimental results
on five datasets across five languages demonstrate that LAAV significantly
outperforms existing verbalizers. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that LAAV

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Medical time series data are indispensable in healthcare, providing critical
insights for disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient management. The
exponential growth in data complexity, driven by advanced sensor technologies,
has presented challenges related to data labeling. Self-supervised learning
(SSL) has emerged as a transformative approach to address these challenges,
eliminating the need for extensive human annotation. In this study, we
introduce a novel framework for Medical Time Series Representation Learning,
known as MTS-LOF. MTS-LOF leverages the strengths of contrastive learning and
Masked Autoencoder (MAE) methods, offering a unique approach to representation
learning for medical time series data. By combining these techniques, MTS-LOF
enhances the potential of healthcare applications by providing more
sophisticated, context-rich representations. Additionally, MTS-LOF employs a
multi-masking strategy to facilitate occlusion-invariant feature learning. This
approach allows the model to create multiple views of the data by masking
portions of it. By minimizing the discrepancy between the representations of
these masked patches and the fully visible patches, MTS-LOF learns to capture
rich contextual information within medical time series datasets. The results of
experiments conducted on diverse medical time series datasets demonstrate the
superiority of MTS-LOF over other methods. These findings hold promise for
significantly enhancing healthcare applications by improving representation
learning. Furthermore, our work delves into the integration of joint-embedding
SSL and MAE techniques, shedding light on the intricate interplay between
temporal and structural dependencies in healthcare data. This understanding is
crucial, as it allows us to grasp the complexities of healthcare data analysis.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Existing works have made great progress in improving adversarial robustness,
but typically test their method only on data from the same distribution as the
training data, i.e. in-distribution (ID) testing. As a result, it is unclear
how such robustness generalizes under input distribution shifts, i.e.
out-of-distribution (OOD) testing. This is a concerning omission as such
distribution shifts are unavoidable when methods are deployed in the wild. To
address this issue we propose a benchmark named OODRobustBench to
comprehensively assess OOD adversarial robustness using 23 dataset-wise shifts
(i.e. naturalistic shifts in input distribution) and 6 threat-wise shifts
(i.e., unforeseen adversarial threat models). OODRobustBench is used to assess
706 robust models using 60.7K adversarial evaluations. This large-scale
analysis shows that: 1) adversarial robustness suffers from a severe OOD
generalization issue; 2) ID robustness correlates strongly with OOD robustness,
in a positive linear way, under many distribution shifts. The latter enables
the prediction of OOD robustness from ID robustness. Based on this, we are able
to predict the upper limit of OOD robustness for existing robust training
schemes. The results suggest that achieving OOD robustness requires designing
novel methods beyond the conventional ones. Last, we discover that extra data,
data augmentation, advanced model architectures and particular regularization
approaches can improve OOD robustness. Noticeably, the discovered training
schemes, compared to the baseline, exhibit dramatically higher robustness under
threat shift while keeping high ID robustness, demonstrating new promising
solutions for robustness against both multi-attack and unforeseen attacks.]]></summary>

operate on the sentence-level. One reason for this is, that most parallel
training data is only sentence-level aligned, without document-level meta
information available. In this work, we set out to build context-aware
translation systems utilizing document-level monolingual data instead. This can
be achieved by combining any existing sentence-level translation model with a
document-level language model. We improve existing approaches by leveraging
recent advancements in model combination. Additionally, we propose novel
weighting techniques that make the system combination more flexible and
significantly reduce computational overhead. In a comprehensive evaluation on
four diverse translation tasks, we show that our extensions improve
document-targeted scores substantially and are also computationally more
efficient. However, we also find that in most scenarios, back-translation gives
even better results, at the cost of having to re-train the translation system.
Finally, we explore language model fusion in the light of recent advancements
in large language models. Our findings suggest that there might be strong
potential in utilizing large language models via model combination.]]></summary>

manage and mitigate their investment risks within the securities market.
Precisely predicting the present price of an option enables investors to make
informed and efficient decisions. In this paper, we propose a machine learning
method for forecasting the prices of SPY (ETF) option based on gated recurrent
unit (GRU) and self-attention mechanism. We first partitioned the raw dataset
into 15 subsets according to moneyness and days to maturity criteria. For each
subset, we matched the corresponding U.S. government bond rates and Implied
Volatility Indices. This segmentation allows for a more insightful exploration
of the impacts of risk-free rates and underlying volatility on option pricing.
Next, we built four different machine learning models, including multilayer
perceptron (MLP), long short-term memory (LSTM), self-attention LSTM, and
self-attention GRU in comparison to the traditional binomial model. The
empirical result shows that self-attention GRU with historical data outperforms
other models due to its ability to capture complex temporal dependencies and
leverage the contextual information embedded in the historical data. Finally,
in order to unveil the "black box" of artificial intelligence, we employed the
SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to interpret and analyze the
prediction results of the self-attention GRU model with historical data. This
provides insights into the significance and contributions of different input

could provide useful empirical evidence in instructors' decision-making.
However, traditional experiments do not have a clear and simple pathway to
using data rapidly to try to increase the chances that students in an

learning and experimentation in product development at leading technology
companies, we explore how adaptive experimentation might help in continuous

deployed to students, data is analyzed and used to change the experience for
future students. This can be done using machine learning algorithms to identify
which actions are more promising for improving student experience or outcomes.
This algorithm can then dynamically deploy the most effective conditions to
future students, resulting in better support for students' needs. We illustrate
the approach with a case study providing a side-by-side comparison of

undesirable for solving matching problems. WeaveNet avoids it by preserving
edge-wise information while passing messages densely to reach a better

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable merit in performing
various learning-based tasks in complex networks. The superior performance of
GNNs often correlates with the availability and quality of node-level features
in the input networks. However, for many network applications, such node-level
information may be missing or unreliable, thereby limiting the applicability
and efficacy of GNNs. To address this limitation, we present a novel approach
denoted as Ego-centric Spectral subGraph Embedding Augmentation (ESGEA), which
aims to enhance and design node features, particularly in scenarios where
information is lacking. Our method leverages the topological structure of the
local subgraph to create topology-aware node features. The subgraph features
are generated using an efficient spectral graph embedding technique, and they
serve as node features that capture the local topological organization of the
network. The explicit node features, if present, are then enhanced with the
subgraph embeddings in order to improve the overall performance. ESGEA is
compatible with any GNN-based architecture and is effective even in the absence
of node features. We evaluate the proposed method in a social network graph
classification task where node attributes are unavailable, as well as in a node
classification task where node features are corrupted or even absent. The
evaluation results on seven datasets and eight baseline models indicate up to a
10% improvement in AUC and a 7% improvement in accuracy for graph and node
classification tasks, respectively.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for various types of graph
data processing and analytical tasks in different domains. Training GNNs over
centralized graph data can be infeasible due to privacy concerns and regulatory
restrictions. Thus, federated learning (FL) becomes a trending solution to
address this challenge in a distributed learning paradigm. However, as GNNs may
inherit historical bias from training data and lead to discriminatory
predictions, the bias of local models can be easily propagated to the global
model in distributed settings. This poses a new challenge in mitigating bias in
federated GNNs. To address this challenge, we propose $\text{F}^2$GNN, a Fair
Federated Graph Neural Network, that enhances group fairness of federated GNNs.
As bias can be sourced from both data and learning algorithms, $\text{F}^2$GNN
aims to mitigate both types of bias under federated settings. First, we provide
theoretical insights on the connection between data bias in a training graph
and statistical fairness metrics of the trained GNN models. Based on the
theoretical analysis, we design $\text{F}^2$GNN which contains two key
components: a fairness-aware local model update scheme that enhances group
fairness of the local models on the client side, and a fairness-weighted global
model update scheme that takes both data bias and fairness metrics of local
models into consideration in the aggregation process. We evaluate
$\text{F}^2$GNN empirically versus a number of baseline methods, and
demonstrate that $\text{F}^2$GNN outperforms these baselines in terms of both
fairness and model accuracy.]]></summary>

few different objects, how can a robot learn to perform that same task on new,

objects within a class makes it difficult to infer the task-relevant
relationship between the new objects and the objects in the demonstrations. We
address this by formulating imitation learning as a conditional alignment
problem between graph representations of objects. Consequently, we show that
this conditioning allows for in-context learning, where a robot can perform a
task on a set of new objects immediately after the demonstrations, without any
prior knowledge about the object class or any further training. In our
experiments, we explore and validate our design choices, and we show that our
method is highly effective for few-shot learning of several real-world,

traction as a rapidly growing phenomenon in online learning. Unlike traditional
classrooms, MOOCs offer a unique opportunity to cater to a diverse audience
from different backgrounds and geographical locations. Renowned universities
and MOOC-specific providers, such as Coursera, offer MOOC courses on various
subjects. Automated assessment tasks like grade and early dropout predictions
are necessary due to the high enrollment and limited direct interaction between
teachers and learners. However, current automated assessment approaches
overlook the structural links between different entities involved in the
downstream tasks, such as the students and courses. Our hypothesis suggests
that these structural relationships, manifested through an interaction graph,
contain valuable information that can enhance the performance of the task at
hand. To validate this, we construct a unique knowledge graph for a large MOOC
dataset, which will be publicly available to the research community.
Furthermore, we utilize graph embedding techniques to extract latent structural
information encoded in the interactions between entities in the dataset. These
techniques do not require ground truth labels and can be utilized for various
tasks. Finally, by combining entity-specific features, behavioral features, and
extracted structural features, we enhance the performance of predictive machine
learning models in student assignment grade prediction. Our experiments
demonstrate that structural features can significantly improve the predictive
performance of downstream assessment tasks. The code and data are available in

for enhancing safety and mobility. This work introduces MARVEL, a multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for implementing large-scale VSL
control on freeway corridors using only commonly available data. The agents
learn through a reward structure that incorporates adaptability to traffic
conditions, safety, and mobility; enabling coordination among the agents. The
proposed framework scales to cover corridors with many gantries thanks to a
parameter sharing among all VSL agents. The agents are trained in a
microsimulation environment based on a short freeway stretch with 8 gantries
spanning 7 miles and tested with 34 gantries spanning 17 miles of I-24 near
Nashville, TN. MARVEL improves traffic safety by 63.4% compared to the no
control scenario and enhances traffic mobility by 14.6% compared to a
state-of-the-practice algorithm that has been deployed on I-24. An
explainability analysis is undertaken to explore the learned policy under
different traffic conditions and the results provide insights into the
decision-making process of agents. Finally, we test the policy learned from the
simulation-based experiments on real input data from I-24 to illustrate the
potential deployment capability of the learned policy.]]></summary>

model-centric to data-centric. The advancements in diverse learning tasks have
been propelled by the accumulation of more extensive datasets, subsequently
facilitating the training of larger models on these datasets. However, these
datasets remain relatively under-explored. To this end, we introduce a
pioneering approach known as RK-core, to empower gaining a deeper understanding
of the intricate hierarchical structure within datasets. Across several
benchmark datasets, we find that samples with low coreness values appear less
representative of their respective categories, and conversely, those with high
coreness values exhibit greater representativeness. Correspondingly, samples
with high coreness values make a more substantial contribution to the
performance in comparison to those with low coreness values. Building upon
this, we further employ RK-core to analyze the hierarchical structure of
samples with different coreset selection methods. Remarkably, we find that a
high-quality coreset should exhibit hierarchical diversity instead of solely
opting for representative samples. The code is available at

emerged in recent years. Most existing methods are unsupervised and assume the
availability of normal training samples only, while few supervised methods have
shown superior performance by incorporating labeled anomalous samples in the
training phase. However, certain anomaly types are inherently challenging for
unsupervised methods to differentiate from normal data, while supervised
methods are constrained to detecting anomalies resembling those present during
training, failing to generalize to unseen anomaly classes. This paper is the
first attempt in providing a novel approach for the open-set TSAD problem, in
which a small number of labeled anomalies from a limited class of anomalies are
visible in the training phase, with the objective of detecting both seen and
unseen anomaly classes in the test phase. The proposed method, called
Multivariate Open-Set timeseries Anomaly Detection (MOSAD) consists of three
primary modules: a Feature Extractor to extract meaningful time-series
features; a Multi-head Network consisting of Generative-, Deviation-, and
Contrastive heads for capturing both seen and unseen anomaly classes; and an
Anomaly Scoring module leveraging the insights of the three heads to detect
anomalies. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets consistently show
that our approach surpasses existing methods under various experimental
settings, thus establishing a new state-of-the-art performance in the TSAD
field.]]></summary>

important tool for fostering trust and safety in today's AI models. However,
existing MU methods focusing on data and/or weight perspectives often grapple
with limitations in unlearning accuracy, stability, and cross-domain
applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of 'weight
saliency' in MU, drawing parallels with input saliency in model explanation.
This innovation directs MU's attention toward specific model weights rather
than the entire model, improving effectiveness and efficiency. The resultant
method that we call saliency unlearning (SalUn) narrows the performance gap
with 'exact' unlearning (model retraining from scratch after removing the
forgetting dataset). To the best of our knowledge, SalUn is the first
principled MU approach adaptable enough to effectively erase the influence of
forgetting data, classes, or concepts in both image classification and
generation. For example, SalUn yields a stability advantage in high-variance
random data forgetting, e.g., with a 0.2% gap compared to exact unlearning on
the CIFAR-10 dataset. Moreover, in preventing conditional diffusion models from
generating harmful images, SalUn achieves nearly 100% unlearning accuracy,
outperforming current state-of-the-art baselines like Erased Stable Diffusion

vital to achieving responsible AI. Traditional evaluation strategies often fall
short due to the complex, adaptive and dynamic nature of society. While
reinforcement learning (RL) can be a powerful approach for optimizing decisions
in dynamic settings, the difficulty of realistic environment design remains a
barrier to building robust agents that perform well in practical settings. To
address this issue we tap into the field of system dynamics (SD) as a
complementary method that incorporates collaborative simulation model
specification practices. We introduce SDGym, a low-code library built on the
OpenAI Gym framework which enables the generation of custom RL environments
based on SD simulation models. Through a feasibility study we validate that
well specified, rich RL environments can be generated from preexisting SD
models and a few lines of configuration code. We demonstrate the capabilities
of the SDGym environment using an SD model of the electric vehicle adoption
problem. We compare two SD simulators, PySD and BPTK-Py for parity, and train a
D4PG agent using the Acme framework to showcase learning and environment
interaction. Our preliminary findings underscore the dual potential of SD to
improve RL environment design and for RL to improve dynamic policy discovery
within SD models. By open-sourcing SDGym, the intent is to galvanize further
research and promote adoption across the SD and RL communities, thereby

to determine Jorge's hyperparameters directly from a well-tuned SGD baseline,
thereby significantly minimizing tuning efforts. Our empirical evaluations

work handling accident-prone traffic events by algorithm designs at the policy
level, we investigate a Closed-loop Adversarial Training (CAT) framework for
safe end-to-end driving in this paper through the lens of environment
augmentation. CAT aims to continuously improve the safety of driving agents by
training the agent on safety-critical scenarios that are dynamically generated
over time. A novel resampling technique is developed to turn log-replay
real-world driving scenarios into safety-critical ones via probabilistic
factorization, where the adversarial traffic generation is modeled as the
multiplication of standard motion prediction sub-problems. Consequently, CAT
can launch more efficient physical attacks compared to existing safety-critical
scenario generation methods and yields a significantly less computational cost
in the iterative learning pipeline. We incorporate CAT into the MetaDrive
simulator and validate our approach on hundreds of driving scenarios imported
from real-world driving datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that CAT can
effectively generate adversarial scenarios countering the agent being trained.
After training, the agent can achieve superior driving safety in both
log-replay and safety-critical traffic scenarios on the held-out test set. Code

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Supervised contrastive loss (SCL) is a competitive and often superior
alternative to the cross-entropy loss for classification. While prior studies
have demonstrated that both losses yield symmetric training representations
under balanced data, this symmetry breaks under class imbalances. This paper
presents an intriguing discovery: the introduction of a ReLU activation at the
final layer effectively restores the symmetry in SCL-learned representations.
We arrive at this finding analytically, by establishing that the global
minimizers of an unconstrained features model with SCL loss and entry-wise
non-negativity constraints form an orthogonal frame. Extensive experiments
conducted across various datasets, architectures, and imbalance scenarios
corroborate our finding. Importantly, our experiments reveal that the inclusion
of the ReLU activation restores symmetry without compromising test accuracy.
This constitutes the first geometry characterization of SCL under imbalances.
Additionally, our analysis and experiments underscore the pivotal role of batch
selection strategies in representation geometry. By proving necessary and
sufficient conditions for mini-batch choices that ensure invariant symmetric
representations, we introduce batch-binding as an efficient strategy that
guarantees these conditions hold.]]></summary>

various choices of the underlying geometry ($\textit{kinetic energy}$), and the
regularization of density paths ($\textit{potential energy}$). These
combinations yield different variational problems ($\textit{Lagrangians}$),
encompassing many variations of the optimal transport problem such as the
Schr\"odinger bridge, unbalanced optimal transport, and optimal transport with
physical constraints, among others. In general, the optimal density path is
unknown, and solving these variational problems can be computationally
challenging. Leveraging the dual formulation of the Lagrangians, we propose a
novel deep learning based framework approaching all of these problems from a
unified perspective. Our method does not require simulating or backpropagating
through the trajectories of the learned dynamics, and does not need access to
optimal couplings. We showcase the versatility of the proposed framework by
outperforming previous approaches for the single-cell trajectory inference,
where incorporating prior knowledge into the dynamics is crucial for correct
predictions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide a flexible
representation for real-world decision and control problems. However, POMDPs
are notoriously difficult to solve, especially when the state and observation
spaces are continuous or hybrid, which is often the case for physical systems.
While recent online sampling-based POMDP algorithms that plan with observation
likelihood weighting have shown practical effectiveness, a general theory
characterizing the approximation error of the particle filtering techniques
that these algorithms use has not previously been proposed. Our main
contribution is bounding the error between any POMDP and its corresponding
finite sample particle belief MDP (PB-MDP) approximation. This fundamental
bridge between PB-MDPs and POMDPs allows us to adapt any sampling-based MDP
algorithm to a POMDP by solving the corresponding particle belief MDP, thereby
extending the convergence guarantees of the MDP algorithm to the POMDP.
Practically, this is implemented by using the particle filter belief transition
model as the generative model for the MDP solver. While this requires access to
the observation density model from the POMDP, it only increases the transition
sampling complexity of the MDP solver by a factor of $\mathcal{O}(C)$, where
$C$ is the number of particles. Thus, when combined with sparse sampling MDP
algorithms, this approach can yield algorithms for POMDPs that have no direct
theoretical dependence on the size of the state and observation spaces. In
addition to our theoretical contribution, we perform five numerical experiments
on benchmark POMDPs to demonstrate that a simple MDP algorithm adapted using
PB-MDP approximation, Sparse-PFT, achieves performance competitive with other
leading continuous observation POMDP solvers.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We present a novel variational framework for performing inference in (neural)
stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by Markov-approximate
fractional Brownian motion (fBM). SDEs offer a versatile tool for modeling
real-world continuous-time dynamic systems with inherent noise and randomness.
Combining SDEs with the powerful inference capabilities of variational methods,
enables the learning of representative function distributions through
stochastic gradient descent. However, conventional SDEs typically assume the
underlying noise to follow a Brownian motion (BM), which hinders their ability
to capture long-term dependencies. In contrast, fractional Brownian motion
(fBM) extends BM to encompass non-Markovian dynamics, but existing methods for
inferring fBM parameters are either computationally demanding or statistically
inefficient. In this paper, building upon the Markov approximation of fBM, we
derive the evidence lower bound essential for efficient variational inference
of posterior path measures, drawing from the well-established field of
stochastic analysis. Additionally, we provide a closed-form expression to
determine optimal approximation coefficients. Furthermore, we propose the use
of neural networks to learn the drift, diffusion and control terms within our
variational posterior, leading to the variational training of neural-SDEs. In
this framework, we also optimize the Hurst index, governing the nature of our
fractional noise. Beyond validation on synthetic data, we contribute a novel
architecture for variational latent video prediction,-an approach that, to the
best of our knowledge, enables the first variational neural-SDE application to
video perception.]]></summary>

$\tau$-regression estimator for analyzing high-dimensional datasets subject to
gross contamination in the response variables and covariates (explanatory
variables). The resulting estimator, termed adaptive $\tau$-Lasso, is robust to
outliers and high-leverage points. It also incorporates an adaptive
$\ell_1$-norm penalty term, which enables the selection of relevant variables
and reduces the bias associated with large true regression coefficients. More
specifically, this adaptive $\ell_1$-norm penalty term assigns a weight to each
regression coefficient. For a fixed number of predictors $p$, we show that the
adaptive $\tau$-Lasso has the oracle property, ensuring both variable-selection
consistency and asymptotic normality. Asymptotic normality applies only to the
entries of the regression vector corresponding to the true support, assuming
knowledge of the true regression vector support. We characterize its robustness
via the finite-sample breakdown point and the influence function. We carry out
extensive simulations and observe that the class of $\tau$-Lasso estimators
exhibits robustness and reliable performance in both contaminated and
uncontaminated data settings. We also validate our theoretical findings on
robustness properties through simulation experiments. In the face of outliers
and high-leverage points, the adaptive $\tau$-Lasso and $\tau$-Lasso estimators
achieve the best performance or close-to-best performance in terms of
prediction and variable selection accuracy compared to other competing
regularized estimators for all scenarios considered in this study. Therefore,
the adaptive $\tau$-Lasso and $\tau$-Lasso estimators can be effectively
employed for a variety of sparse linear regression problems, particularly in

modern neural networks that are not only the most widely applicable path-norm
based ones, but also recover or beat the sharpest known bounds of this type.
These extended path-norms further enjoy the usual benefits of path-norms: ease
of computation, invariance under the symmetries of the network, and improved
sharpness on feedforward networks compared to the product of operators' norms,
another complexity measure most commonly used.

The versatility of the toolkit and its ease of implementation allow us to
challenge the concrete promises of path-norm-based generalization bounds, by
numerically evaluating the sharpest known bounds for ResNets on ImageNet.]]></summary>

reasoning or decision-making tasks, how would we go about evaluating such

In this paper, we propose a framework for evaluating superhuman models via
consistency checks. Our premise is that while the correctness of superhuman
decisions may be impossible to evaluate, we can still surface mistakes if the
model's decisions fail to satisfy certain logical, human-interpretable rules.
We instantiate our framework on three tasks where correctness of decisions is
hard to evaluate due to either superhuman model abilities, or to otherwise
missing ground truth: evaluating chess positions, forecasting future events,
and making legal judgments. We show that regardless of a model's (possibly
superhuman) performance on these tasks, we can discover logical inconsistencies
in decision making. For example: a chess engine assigning opposing valuations
to semantically identical boards; GPT-4 forecasting that sports records will
evolve non-monotonically over time; or an AI judge assigning bail to a
defendant only after we add a felony to their criminal record.]]></summary>

generalize the Fisher information matrix by measuring the joint information
content and dependence structure of both a random variable and the parameters

tensors may be constructed not only from the observation likelihoods as is
current practice, but also from arbitrarily complicated non-linear prior/latent
variable structures, provided the LGC may be derived for each conditional
distribution used to construct said structures. The proposed methodology is
highly automatic and allows for exploitation of any sparsity associated with
the model in question. When implemented in conjunction with a Riemann manifold

Monte Carlo processes, the proposed methodology is highly competitive, in

building predictive models that combine statistical patterns with domain
knowledge. The underlying notion is to enrich the optimization loss function
with known relationships to constrain the space of possible solutions.
Hydrodynamic simulations are a core constituent of modern cosmology, while the
required computations are both expensive and time-consuming. At the same time,
the comparatively fast simulation of dark matter requires fewer resources,
which has led to the emergence of machine learning algorithms for baryon
inpainting as an active area of research; here, recreating the scatter found in
hydrodynamic simulations is an ongoing challenge. This paper presents the first
application of physics-informed neural networks to baryon inpainting by
combining advances in neural network architectures with physical constraints,
injecting theory on baryon conversion efficiency into the model loss function.
We also introduce a punitive prediction comparison based on the
Kullback-Leibler divergence, which enforces scatter reproduction. By
simultaneously extracting the complete set of baryonic properties for the Simba
suite of cosmological simulations, our results demonstrate improved accuracy of
baryonic predictions based on dark matter halo properties, successful recovery
of the fundamental metallicity relation, and retrieve scatter that traces the
target simulation's distribution.]]></summary>

algorithm for MBRL and planning that is equivariant with respect to the product
of the spatial symmetry group SE(3), the discrete-time translation group Z, and
the object permutation group Sn. EDGI follows the Diffuser framework (Janner et
al., 2022) in treating both learning a world model and planning in it as a
conditional generative modeling problem, training a diffusion model on an
offline trajectory dataset. We introduce a new SE(3)xZxSn-equivariant diffusion
model that supports multiple representations. We integrate this model in a
planning loop, where conditioning and classifier guidance let us softly break
the symmetry for specific tasks as needed. On object manipulation and
navigation tasks, EDGI is substantially more sample efficient and generalizes
better across the symmetry group than non-equivariant models.]]></summary>

have recently found applications in many important real-world scenarios.
However, deploying these learning algorithms in safety-critical applications
raises concerns, particularly when it comes to ensuring confidence calibration
for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data points. Many popular
methods for in-distribution (ID) calibration, such as isotonic regression and
Platt's sigmoidal regression, exhibit excellent ID calibration performance but
often at the cost of classification accuracy. Moreover, these methods are not
calibrated for the entire feature space, leading to overconfidence in the case
of out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. In this paper, we leveraged the fact that
deep models, including both random forests and deep-nets, learn internal
representations which are unions of polytopes with affine activation functions
to conceptualize them both as partitioning rules of the feature space. We
replace the affine function in each polytope populated by the training data
with a Gaussian kernel. We propose sufficient conditions for our proposed
methods to be consistent estimators of the corresponding class conditional
densities. Moreover, our experiments on both tabular and vision benchmarks show
that the proposed approaches obtain well-calibrated posteriors while mostly
preserving or improving the classification accuracy of the original algorithm
for in-distribution region, and extrapolates beyond the training data to handle
out-of-distribution inputs appropriately.]]></summary>

end-to-end differentiable; also, unlike traditional neurosymbolic methods that
require representations to be manually mapped to symbols, it computes an

DCSI correlates strongly with the performance of DBSCAN measured via the

training models on sensitive user data. Differential privacy provides a formal
guarantee that individual-level information about users does not leak. In this
framework, randomized algorithms inject calibrated noise into the confidential

access to only the privatized data during statistical analysis makes it
computationally challenging to perform valid inferences on parameters
underlying the confidential data. In this work, we propose simulation-based

conditional density estimators as a flexible family of distributions to
approximate the posterior distribution of model parameters given the observed
private query results. We illustrate our methods on discrete time-series data
under an infectious disease model and on ordinary linear regression models.

This work studies generalisation for datasets consisting of related tasks that
may differ in causal mechanisms. For example, observational medical data for
complex diseases suffers from heterogeneity in causal mechanisms of disease
across patients, creating challenges for machine learning algorithms that need
to generalise to new patients outside of the training dataset. Common
approaches for learning supervised models with heterogeneous datasets include
learning a global model for the entire dataset, learning local models for each
tasks' data, or utilising hierarchical, meta-learning and multi-task learning
approaches to learn how to generalise from data pooled across multiple tasks.
In this paper we propose causal similarity-based hierarchical Bayesian models
to improve generalisation to new tasks by learning how to pool data from
training tasks with similar causal mechanisms. We apply this general modelling
principle to Bayesian neural networks and compare a variety of methods for
estimating causal task similarity (for both known and unknown causal models).
We demonstrate the benefits of our approach and applicability to real world
problems through a range of experiments on simulated and real data.]]></summary>

dYnamics, for sampling high dimensional data. With the growing efficacy and
potential of Energy-Based modeling, also known as non-normalized probabilistic
modeling, for modeling a generative process of different natures of high
dimensional data observations, we present an end-to-end learning algorithm for
Energy-Based models (EBM) with the purpose of improving the quality of the
resulting sampled data points. While the unknown normalizing constant of EBMs
makes the training procedure intractable, resorting to Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) is in general a viable option. Realizing what MCMC entails for the EBM
training, we propose in this paper, a novel high dimensional sampling method,
based on an anisotropic stepsize and a gradient-informed covariance matrix,
embedded into a discretized Langevin diffusion. We motivate the necessity for
an anisotropic update of the negative samples in the Markov Chain by the
nonlinearity of the backbone of the EBM, here a Convolutional Neural Network.
Our resulting method, namely STANLEY, is an optimization algorithm for training
Energy-Based models via our newly introduced MCMC method. We provide a
theoretical understanding of our sampling scheme by proving that the sampler
leads to a geometrically uniformly ergodic Markov Chain. Several image
generation experiments are provided in our paper to show the effectiveness of
our method.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Due to the increasing use of Machine Learning models in high stakes decision
making settings, it has become increasingly important to have tools to
understand how models arrive at decisions. Assuming a trained Supervised
Classification model, explanations can be obtained via counterfactual analysis:
a counterfactual explanation of an instance indicates how this instance should
be minimally modified so that the perturbed instance is classified in the
desired class by the Machine Learning classification model. Most of the
Counterfactual Analysis literature focuses on the single-instance
single-counterfactual setting, in which the analysis is done for one single
instance to provide one single explanation. Taking a stakeholder's perspective,
in this paper we introduce the so-called collective counterfactual
explanations. By means of novel Mathematical Optimization models, we provide a
counterfactual explanation for each instance in a group of interest, so that
the total cost of the perturbations is minimized under some linking
constraints. Making the process of constructing counterfactuals collective
instead of individual enables us to detect the features that are critical to
the entire dataset to have the individuals classified in the desired class. Our
methodology allows for some instances to be treated individually, performing
the collective counterfactual analysis for a fraction of records of the group
of interest. This way, outliers are identified and handled appropriately. Under
some assumptions on the classifier and the space in which counterfactuals are
sought, finding collective counterfactuals is reduced to solving a convex
quadratic linearly constrained mixed integer optimization problem, which, for
datasets of moderate size, can be solved to optimality using existing solvers.
The performance of our approach is illustrated on real-world datasets,
demonstrating its usefulness.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In theoretical ML, the teacher-student paradigm is often employed as an
effective metaphor for real-life tuition. The above scheme proves particularly
relevant when the student network is overparameterized as compared to the
teacher network. Under these operating conditions, it is tempting to speculate
that the student ability to handle the given task could be eventually stored in
a sub-portion of the whole network. This latter should be to some extent
reminiscent of the frozen teacher structure, according to suitable metrics,
while being approximately invariant across different architectures of the
student candidate network. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art conventional
learning techniques could not help in identifying the existence of such an
invariant subnetwork, due to the inherent degree of non-convexity that
characterizes the examined problem. In this work, we take a leap forward by
proposing a radically different optimization scheme which builds on a spectral
representation of the linear transfer of information between layers. The
gradient is hence calculated with respect to both eigenvalues and eigenvectors
with negligible increase in terms of computational and complexity load, as
compared to standard training algorithms. Working in this framework, we could
isolate a stable student substructure, that mirrors the true complexity of the
teacher in terms of computing neurons, path distribution and topological
attributes. When pruning unimportant nodes of the trained student, as follows a
ranking that reflects the optimized eigenvalues, no degradation in the recorded
performance is seen above a threshold that corresponds to the effective teacher
size. The observed behavior can be pictured as a genuine second-order phase
transition that bears universality traits.]]></summary>

version of the empirical distribution of observed data, adhering to predefined

enhance the flexibility of such methodology by introducing a nonparametrically
imbued distributional constraints on the weights, and developing a general
framework leveraging the maximum entropy principle and tools from optimal
transport. The key idea is to ensure that the maximum entropy weight adjusted
empirical distribution of the observed data is close to a pre-specified
probability distribution in terms of the optimal transport metric while
allowing for subtle departures. The versatility of the framework is
demonstrated in the context of three disparate applications where data
re-weighting is warranted to satisfy side constraints on the optimization
problem at the heart of the statistical task: namely, portfolio allocation,
semi-parametric inference for complex surveys, and ensuring algorithmic
fairness in machine learning algorithms.]]></summary>

assume a low-dimensional manifold description of the data. The embedding of
such manifold into the high-dimensional space of the data is achieved via
learnable invertible transformations. Therefore, once the manifold is properly
aligned via a reconstruction loss, the probability density is tractable on the
manifold and maximum likelihood can be used optimize the network parameters.
Naturally, the lower-dimensional representation of the data requires an
injective-mapping. Recent approaches were able to enforce that density aligns
with the modelled manifold, while efficiently calculating the density
volume-change term when embedding to the higher-dimensional space. However,
unless the injective-mapping is analytically predefined, the learned manifold
is not necessarily an efficient representation of the data. Namely, the latent
dimensions of such models frequently learn an entangled intrinsic basis with
degenerate information being stored in each dimension. Alternatively, if a
locally orthogonal and/or sparse basis is to be learned, here coined canonical
intrinsic basis, it can serve in learning a more compact latent space
representation. Towards this end, we propose a canonical manifold learning flow
method, where a novel optimization objective enforces the transformation matrix
to have few prominent and orthogonal basis functions. Canonical manifold flow
yields a more efficient use of the latent space, automatically generating fewer
prominent and distinct dimensions to represent data, and consequently a better
approximation of target distributions than other manifold flow methods in most
experiments we conducted, resulting in lower FID scores.]]></summary>

principles for modeling the dynamics of various physical systems. Notable
examples include modeling decision-making within the brain using the

al., 2000), and navigation in random environments using information
maximization (Vergassola et al., 2007). Built on this principle, we propose a
new class of bandit algorithms that maximize an approximation to the

approximated analytical physics-based representation of an entropy to forecast
the information gain of each action and greedily choose the one with the
largest information gain. This method yields strong performances in classical
bandit settings. Motivated by its empirical success, we prove its asymptotic
optimality for the two-armed bandit problem with Gaussian rewards. Owing to its

this approach can be efficiently adapted to more complex bandit settings,

discrepancy between the expected output and the actual output of the

inference of the parameters of such models, from time series data, is difficult
due to intractability of the likelihood; current methods, based on simulations
of the underlying model, can be so computationally expensive as to be
prohibitive. In this paper we construct a neural likelihood approximation for
integer valued time series data using causal convolutions, which allows us to
evaluate the likelihood of the whole time series in parallel. We demonstrate

iteratively transforming noise using the score function of the perturbed
target. For any finite training set, this score function can be evaluated in
closed form, but the resulting SGM memorizes its training data and does not
generate novel samples. In practice, one approximates the score by training a
neural network via score-matching. The error in this approximation promotes
generalization, but neural SGMs are costly to train and sample, and the
effective regularization this error provides is not well-understood
theoretically. In this work, we instead explicitly smooth the closed-form score
to obtain an SGM that generates novel samples without training. We analyze our
model and propose an efficient nearest-neighbor-based estimator of its score
function. Using this estimator, our method achieves sampling times competitive
with neural SGMs while running on consumer-grade CPUs.]]></summary>

random forest (RF) models by exploiting the fact that any RF can be formulated
as an adaptive weighted K nearest-neighbors model. Specifically, we use the
proximity between points in the feature space learned by the RF to re-write
random forest predictions exactly as a weighted average of the target labels of
training data points. This linearity facilitates a local notion of
explainability of RF predictions that generates attributions for any model
prediction across observations in the training set, and thereby complements
established methods like SHAP, which instead generates attributions for a model
prediction across dimensions of the feature space. We demonstrate this approach
in the context of a bond pricing model trained on US corporate bond trades, and
compare our approach to various existing approaches to model explainability.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[High-dimensional longitudinal data is increasingly used in a wide range of
scientific studies. However, there are few statistical methods for
high-dimensional linear mixed models (LMMs), as most Bayesian variable
selection or penalization methods are designed for independent observations.
Additionally, the few available software packages for high-dimensional LMMs
suffer from scalability issues. This work presents an efficient and accurate
Bayesian framework for high-dimensional LMMs. We use empirical Bayes estimators
of hyperparameters for increased flexibility and an
Expectation-Conditional-Minimization (ECM) algorithm for computationally
efficient maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimation of parameters. The
novelty of the approach lies in its partitioning and parameter expansion as
well as its fast and scalable computation. We illustrate Linear Mixed Modeling
with PaRtitiOned empirical Bayes ECM (LMM-PROBE) in simulation studies
evaluating fixed and random effects estimation along with computation time. A
real-world example is provided using data from a study of lupus in children,
where we identify genes and clinical factors associated with a new lupus
biomarker and predict the biomarker over time.]]></summary>

 I am a mac user. I am trying to use whisper.cpp downloaded from its github file. I don't know much about phyton or coding so I basically followed this guide to install and use it. I downloaded the large model to try it. I am using it for non-English languages and I want to use it for language learning purposes so I can understand what is being said in an Instagram story or a Youtube video (without subtitles) or a tv series or an extract of movie etc. I was using Macwhisper but I wanted to try the pro features and I don't want to pay for it (for now) and try the pro models for non-English languages.
 My question is: all of my files that I want to transcribe are video files with .mp4 extension. Can I also transcribe those with whisper?
 If not, and if I can only transcribe audio files, can it be .mp3? I understand that I need to install and use ffmpeg. Does it support mp3?
 Also, as I understand, the transcripted text will appear in the terminal. Can I export it in -srt or pdf?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've watched an interesting video: Deriving the Ultimate Neural Network Architecture from Scratch. It's about how to come up to the transformer architecture when you have an understanding of CNNs.
 The crux of it is an idea of pairwise convolutional layers. The first layer applies not to the sequence of words itself, but to all pairs of words in the sentence. This ensures that each relation of words that are far from each other is taken into account.
 The next convolutional layer applies to all pairs of results of the previous one. This way longer subsequences of words are factored in.
 pairs of words
 My question is: are there any articles on how transformers were invented? I see a lot of explanations of the original paper, but at best they all answer the question how transformers work. But why is the architecture the way it is? Was it discovered like the video describes? Or the path was more convoluted? I'd like to know more about this connection.
 Anyway, it would be great to figure out in all details how these pairwise layers are related to the concepts of query, key, and value. Here's what the author of the video wrote in comments:
  
Yeah it's a term I made up so you won't find it in any sources, sorry about that. Usually sources will just talk about self attention in terms of key, query and value lookups, so you can look at those to get a more detailed understanding of the transformer. The value transform is equivalent to the linear representation function I use in the pairwise convolution, the key and query attention scores are equivalent to the bi-linear form scoring function I use (with the bi-linear form weight matrix given by Q^TK). I chose to use this unusual terminology because, personally, I feel the key, query and value terminology comes out of nowhere, and I wanted to connect the transformer more directly to its predecessor (the CNN).

 I'm learning ML but i'm barely scratching the terminologies. 2 years ago I couldn't code anything but with school (python,sql and R) I learned fundamentals. I also have access to code academy. My current program is very machine learning/deep learning focused.
 On the side I DM a d&d game. Within the context of the world (eberron) robots are common. With my ADHD and being a new DM I want to outsource lore questions might have (that I would have to look up and slow down the game).
 The concept is to have a GUI and have the player interact with the chat bot. I've gotten to a proof of concept workflow. On Google colab. Thanks to langchain I managed to ingest pdfs and a url. Make then a directory, Embedded the text, bring it into a vector dB. Have the llm pull from the vector. Answer the question.
 Now I don't know what to do. I tried to bring the colab notebook onto Google cloud. But now cloud is becoming a rabbit home with vertex and docAI...and I don't want to deep dive into that, if it's a outside the scope of this "project"
 I'd appreciate any advice, links...etc. 
 I got a limited success in botpress using a single pdf. It works but feel unsatisfying. N8N looks promising but if it's not intuitive then I don't want to go down that road.
 If I posted in the wrong group please direct me to the correct one.

 "Large language models (LMs) are currently trained to predict tokens given document prefixes, enabling them to directly perform long-form generation and prompting-style tasks which can be reduced to document completion. Existing pretraining pipelines train LMs by concatenating random sets of short documents to create input contexts but the prior documents provide no signal for predicting the next document. We instead present In-Context Pretraining, a new approach where language models are pretrained on a sequence of related documents, thereby explicitly encouraging them to read and reason across document boundaries. We can do In-Context Pretraining by simply changing the document ordering so that each context contains related documents, and directly applying existing pretraining pipelines. However, this document sorting problem is challenging. There are billions of documents and we would like the sort to maximize contextual similarity for every document without repeating any data. To do this, we introduce approximate algorithms for finding related documents with efficient nearest neighbor search and constructing coherent input contexts with a graph traversal algorithm. Our experiments show In-Context Pretraining offers a simple and scalable approach to significantly enhance LMs'performance: we see notable improvements in tasks that require more complex contextual reasoning, including in-context learning (+8%), reading comprehension (+15%), faithfulness to previous contexts (+16%), long-context reasoning (+5%), and retrieval augmentation (+9%)."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings,
 I'm on my 2nd year of College (Artificial Intelligence bachelors degree), and currently making a group project that will require machine learning. The project consists of managing and regulating the conditions (temperature, humidity, lightning, etc.) of the environment that surrounds important products (vaccines, human organs, etc.) during their transportation, using sensors implemented in their transportation box. For that being possible, our group was planning to use a predictive model using machine learning, to prevent cases such as the exposure of inappropriate temperature levels, that could damage the product, and subsequently taking the appropriate measures to improve the environment, before it reaches such dangerous scenarios.
 Therefore, I would like to know which tools and skills will be needed and helpful in order to achieve such goal. If you have any advice, that'll be very much appreciated. :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reddit is considering implementing a soft paywall on its content if generative AI companies do not agree to pay for using its data.
 
This move comes as tensions rise between tech giants and content publishers over the financial stakes in the generative AI market.
 
Reddit believes that its vast range of user-generated text makes it a goldmine for AI training data, but critics argue that much of the content is copied from other sources or links to third-party resources.
 
Enforcing a soft paywall could provide leverage in negotiations with AI companies, but it may also alienate the Reddit community and impede the discovery of new content.
 
Major newspapers like The New York Times and The Washington Post have also blocked AI companies from scraping their websites for training data.
 
Enforcing a soft paywall is a double-edged sword for Reddit, as it could provide leverage in negotiations but also alienate the community and impede content discovery.
 
Reddit's broken search engine is a major concern, and implementing a paywall could result in a significant loss of search traffic.
 
If Reddit and other content giants implement paywalls, it could impact how generative AI models are trained and lead to increased expenses and a slower rate of innovation.
 
This move by Reddit may pave the way for more publishers and platforms to implement paywalls, potentially reshuffling the industry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Researchers propose a new AI system called 3D-GPT that creates 3D models by combining natural language instructions and agents specialized for working with existing 3D modeling tools.
 3D-GPT has predefined functions that make 3D shapes, and it tweaks parameters to build scenes. The key is getting the AI to understand instructions and pick the right tools.
 It has three main agents:
  
A dispatcher that parses the text and picks generation functions
 A conceptualizer that adds details missing from the description
 A modeler that sets parameters and outputs code to drive 3D software
  
By breaking modeling work down into steps, the agents can collab to match the descriptions. This is sort of like how a 3D modeling team of humans would work.
 The paper authors show it making simple scenes like "lush meadow with flowers" that fit the text. It also modifies scenes appropriately when given new instructions. I include some gifs of example outputs in my full summary. They look pretty good - I would say 2005-quality graphics.
 There are limits. It fully relies on existing generators, so quality is capped. Details and curves are iffy. It resorts to default shapes often instead of true understanding. And I doubt the verts and textures are well-optimized.
 The agent architecture seems to be really popular right now. This one shows some planning skills, which could extend to more creative tasks someday.
 TLDR: AI agents can team up to generate 3D models from text instructions. Works to some degree but limitations remain.
 Full summary. Paper here.

 Abstract: We study the combinatorial assignment domain, which includes combinatorial auctions and course allocation. The main challenge in this domain is that the bundle space grows exponentially in the number of items. To address this, several papers have recently proposed machine learning-based preference elicitation algorithms that aim to elicit only the most important information from agents. However, the main shortcoming of this prior work is that it does not model a mechanism's uncertainty over values for not yet elicited bundles. In this paper, we address this shortcoming by presenting a Bayesian optimization-based combinatorial assignment (BOCA) mechanism. Our key technical contribution is to integrate a method for capturing model uncertainty into an iterative combinatorial auction mechanism. Concretely, we design a new method for estimating an upper uncertainty bound that can be used to define an acquisition function to determine the next query to the agents. This enables the mechanism to properly explore (and not just exploit) the bundle space during its preference elicitation phase. We run computational experiments in several spectrum auction domains to evaluate BOCA's performance. Our results show that BOCA achieves higher allocative efficiency than state-of-the-art approaches.

 This makes sense for the input, but how would output work?
 Normally you use a layer to convert the embedding to a SoftMax of probabilities of possible output tokens. This makes sense for discrete outputs like tokens but not for continuous outputs like images or audio.

 I just started an open-source repo for RL explanations. https://github.com/DenseLayers/densewiki
 Many people, especially beginners struggle to develop the intuition around concepts (like actor-critic vs advantage actor-critic, GAE, PPO, etc).
 Often it's nice to see what's happening at a high level first, before we dive deeper into the math. That's what I'm trying to do here.
 But I can't do it alone, so I'm posting here to get help from others in the community to make sure the explanations are clear, extremely approachable, and accurate.
 If you'd like to work with me on this (whether you're a complete beginner or very knowledgeable), please reach out!

The chip eliminates the need to frequently access external memory, allowing it to perform tasks such as image recognition faster and consume less power.
 
NorthPole runs neural networks and is made up of 256 computing units, each with its own memory.
 
It beats existing AI machines in benchmark tests and uses one-fifth of the energy of state-of-the-art AI chips.
 
However, it is not suitable for large language models and can only run pre-programmed neural networks.

And the strangest thing of all, ChatGPT is used as oracle to evaluate models in research papers. Consistency models are extremely meh and if it did not come out of openAI, people would’ve forgotten them a long time ago!

 Abstract:
  
Open large language models (LLMs) with great performance in various tasks have significantly advanced the development of LLMs. However, they are far inferior to commercial models such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 when acting as agents to tackle complex tasks in the real world. These agent tasks employ LLMs as the central controller responsible for planning, memorization, and tool utilization, necessitating both fine-grained prompting methods and robust LLMs to achieve satisfactory performance. Though many prompting methods have been proposed to complete particular agent tasks, there is lack of research focusing on improving the agent capabilities of L…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm wondering whether LLMs within your organisation are widely used (including non-programmers), and in an (official) capacity that prevents OpenAI/Microsoft or another third party from using the input. Here, I'm talking about access by a wide variety of employees, not including as part of a data pipeline that doesn't have a user interface and only performs one job.
  
Does your organization have a custom-built interface with enterprise access to an LLM? Use one of the open-source interfaces, or does your organisation provide access through i.e. Microsoft copilot? What about access to Github copilot (for programmers)? Or does your organisation have some kind of SAAS solution?
 If you have some kind of RAG within the organisation that isn't built-in into a product. What sort of stack do you use? Do you use OpenAI plugins to access this?

 I've got a really simple question, i'm training a PPO algorithm and I wanna know what is the best way to train my model?
 Sorry, I'll try to be clear!
 So right now what i'm doing is :
  
I'm loading a previously trained PPO model
 Train the model on 20000 timesteps
 Evaluate the reward of the newly trained PPO model at the end of the timesteps and compare it to the reward from the model loaded in 1
 If the reward is greater then i'm going back to step 1 and using the new model
  
If not then i'm going back to step 1.
 Is it a correct way to do so? 
 Thanks a lot and have a great day!

 "Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for language models demonstrates impressive performance across reasoning tasks, but typically needs labeled exemplars of the reasoning process. In this work, we introduce a new prompting approach, Analogical Prompting, designed to automatically guide the reasoning process of large language models. Inspired by analogical reasoning, a cognitive process in which humans draw from relevant past experiences to tackle new problems, our approach prompts language models to self-generate relevant exemplars or knowledge in the context, before proceeding to solve the given problem. This method presents several advantages: it obviates the need for labeling or retrieving exemplars, offering generality and convenience; it can also tailor the generated exemplars and knowledge to each problem, offering adaptability. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms 0-shot CoT and manual few-shot CoT in a variety of reasoning tasks, including math problem solving in GSM8K and MATH, code generation in Codeforces, and other reasoning tasks in BIG-Bench."

 "Optimization is ubiquitous. While derivative-based algorithms have been powerful tools for various problems, the absence of gradient imposes challenges on many real-world applications. In this work, we propose Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), a simple and effective approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as optimizers, where the optimization task is described in natural language. In each optimization step, the LLM generates new solutions from the prompt that contains previously generated solutions with their values, then the new solutions are evaluated and added to the prompt for the next optimization step. We first showcase OPRO on linear regression and traveling salesman problems, then move on to prompt optimization where the goal is to find instructions that maximize the task accuracy. With a variety of LLMs, we demonstrate that the best prompts optimized by OPRO outperform human-designed prompts by up to 8% on GSM8K, and by up to 50% on Big-Bench Hard tasks."

Diagnosing and cleaning data is a crucial step for building robust machine learning systems. However, identifying problems within large-scale datasets with real-world distributions is challenging due to the presence of complex issues such as label errors, under-representation, and outliers. In this paper, we propose a unified approach for identifying the problematic data by utilizing a largely ignored source of information: a relational structure of data in the feature-embedded space. To this end, we present scalable and effective algorithms for detecting label errors and outlier data based on the relational graph structure of data. We further introduce a visualization tool that provides contextual information of a data point in the feature-embedded space, serving as an effective tool for interactively diagnosing data. We evaluate the label error and outlier/out-of-distribution (OOD) detection performances of our approach on the large-scale image, speech, and language domain tasks, including ImageNet, ESC-50, and SST2. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art detection performance on all tasks considered and demonstrates its effectiveness in debugging large-scale real-world datasets across various domains.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, greeting from south america..
 Basically I'm looking for an program to learn and improve my job opportunities in the MLOps field and at some point getting higher responsability positions. I recently got admitted for both OMSA and OMSCS from Gatech, but I feel those programs are more focused on the data science side of things.
 Is there any other alternative without GRE requeriment that you would recommend with a similar cost?
 Maybe I'm wrong about the aforementioned programs, if you think so, please let me know why.
 Thanks!

 i have very little knowledge on machine learning but it is required to be implemented in the project, my lecturer is pressuring me to have final pick of what software and microcontroller iw will be using for this project, everyone else in the class are using Edge Impulse which the lecturer said wouldn't be applicable to me as it uses accelerometers and voice. and are using CY8CKIT-042 PSoC 4 PIONEER KITS which apperently arent suited for me either.
 any help would be much appreciated and i do apologise if this is too rambly.

 Github: https://github.com/xlang-ai/OpenAgents
 Abstract:
  
Language agents show potential in being capable of utilizing natural language for varied and intricate tasks in diverse environments, particularly when built upon large language models (LLMs). Current language agent frameworks aim to facilitate the construction of proof-of-concept language agents while neglecting the non-expert user access to agents and paying little attention to application-level designs. We present OpenAgents, an open platform for using and hosting language agents in the wild of everyday life. OpenAgents includes three agents: (1) Data Agent for data analysis with Python/SQL and data tools; (2) Plugins Agent with 200+ daily API tools; (3) Web Agent for autonomous web browsing. OpenAgents enables general users to interact with agent functionalities through a web user interface optimized for swift responses and common failures while offering developers and researchers a seamless deployment experience on local setups, providing a foundation for crafting innovative language agents and facilitating real-world evaluations. We elucidate the challenges and opportunities, aspiring to set a foundation for future research and development of real-world language agents.

A new approach measures how well these models understand subtype relations between concepts. Researchers from Yandex proposed two metrics that combine well-known tools like the WordNet database and ImageNet classifiers in a novel way, allowing them to analyze models like Stable Diffusion in more detail.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have demonstrated superior performance on a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks including sentiment analysis, mathematical reasoning and summarization. Furthermore, since these models are instruction-tuned on human conversations to produce "helpful" responses, they can and often will produce explanations along with the response, which we call self-explanations. For example, when analyzing the sentiment of a movie review, the model may output not only the positivity of the sentiment, but also an explanation (e.g., by listing the sentiment-laden words such as "fantastic" and "memorable" in the review). How good are these automatically generated self-explanations? In this paper, we investigate this question on the task of sentiment analysis and for feature attribution explanation, one of the most commonly studied settings in the interpretability literature (for pre-ChatGPT models). Specifically, we study different ways to elicit the self-explanations, evaluate their faithfulness on a set of evaluation metrics, and compare them to traditional explanation methods such as occlusion or LIME saliency maps. Through an extensive set of experiments, we find that ChatGPT's self-explanations perform on par with traditional ones, but are quite different from them according to various agreement metrics, meanwhile being much cheaper to produce (as they are generated along with the prediction). In addition, we identified several interesting characteristics of them, which prompt us to rethink many current model interpretability practices in the era of ChatGPT(-like) LLMs.

 What if we are already in the Basilisk's simulation? WHat if LessWrong never pulled the plug?

Has anyone tried it? I would expect it to be better than chatgpt + plugins, as it says it was trained with medical language. This also makes me wonder if there are opensource LLMs specifically trained for the medical field. Does anyone have experience with this?

 The recent development of MLC LLM project makes it possible to compile and deploy large-scale language models running on multi-GPU systems with support for NVIDIA and AMD GPUs with high performance. Specifically, it can run 4-bit quantized Llama2-70B at 34.5 tok/sec on two NVIDIA RTX 4090 and 29.9 tok/sec on two AMD Radeon 7900XTX. 
 This is a first solution that helps us to scale 70B models with multiple GPUs, bringing the potential to run even larger open LLMs under reasonable budget (the two AMD GPUs cost 2k)

 I am implementing the code for the paper DreamerV2, and there are some things that look a bit strange to me.
 The predictors and, in particular, the image and the reward predictors are stochastic and they output Normal distributions. Both the normal distributions have the mean, which is the output of the respective models, and the variance is 1. 
 Usually, in RL we normalize observations and rewards to be between 0 and 1, and in such a case I don't know if it's reasonable to sample from a Gaussian with variance one.
 I don't know about the specific preprocessing done in DreamerV2, except in the paper DreamerV1, where in section 6 (Control tasks), they say that the reward ranges from 0 to 1. 
 Do you know what are the advantages of using a stochastic decoder and when to use it?

 I know whisper-timestamped exist, and whisperx. The thing is, all these solutions assume you have the infrastructure to host your own whisper model. I am just getting started on my product, and I simply don't see the point in paying over 300/mo for a g4 instance (the cheapest GPU instance in AWS) just for an MVP.

 I used to rely on GPU Usage to track how effectively I was able to leverage the gpu or cluster provided by my company from Grafana dashboard, however yesterday I saw X someone on X/Twitter saying:
 "Utilization is a poor metric by itself. You can easly hit 100% where the GPU is doing a lot of waiting. Power consumption is a better (but not perfect) measure. If you're burning watts it's usually doing something useful. High util, no watts is not good."
 Which it's something that I've never considered before!
 Now I'm quite curious to hear if anyone here have considered this approach before or alternative ways to measure the performance of the GPU resource/cluster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to come up to speed on VAE's.
 My intuitive concept of a VAE is an AE for which we want to enforce some distributional regularity on the latent encodings.
 Why not accomplish this by simply regularizing the latent encodings directly? For example, we could assert that the latent vectors are drawn from a zero-mean, identity-matrix-covariance Gaussian distribution.
 So that e.g. the loss function becomes:
  
Loss(X) = ReconstructionLoss(Decoder(Encoder(X))) + LogPriorProbability(Encoder(X))
 In a variant of this, we could add a hyperparameter coefficient for the prior loss component.
  
Here, there is no "reparameterization trick" because the encoder is not stochastic. We simply regularize the latent encodings directly. If the encoder does not make the data X distribution look like the targeted Gaussian, it's a "less good" encoder. In principle we ought to still be able to generate X's by sampling from the prior and passing it through the decoder.
 This seems (to me) like the simplest way to regularize the latent space.
 Why do VAE's, by contrast, introduce the new machinery of a stochastic encoder?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 11th edition of the Threat Landscape report by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) highlights the risks posed by AI-enabled information manipulation in the upcoming EU elections.
 
The report recorded approximately 2580 incidents during the reporting period, with 220 incidents specifically targeting two or more EU Member States.
 
The sectors mostly targeted include public administrations (19%) and health (8%), with a cascading effect observed due to interdependencies.
 
Information manipulation campaigns are considered a major threat to election processes, with individuals (47%) and public administration (29%) being the primary targets.
 
The report also provides an overview of evolving trends in threat actors, including state-nexus actors targeting key individuals through spear phishing and social networks.
 
Ransomware and DDoS attacks remain the top threats, accounting for 34% and 28% of all threats, respectively.
 
The motivations behind these threats include financial gain, disruption, espionage, destruction, and ideology.
 
The report highlights the potential misuse of artificial intelligence-powered chatbots in phishing attempts, information manipulation, and cybercrime.
 
Older techniques like search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning and malvertising have also seen a resurgence among cybercrime actors.
 
The report concludes by emphasizing the importance of addressing vulnerabilities and ensuring cybersecure infrastructures for the integrity and availability of information in the EU electoral process.

 Each of these GUIs has certain advantages/disadvantages for me and therefore I would like to hear from the community how you do it, which tools you use, if you do it alone or in a team and how your workflow is.
 Until now I often had the impression that you develop your Jupyternotebook normally, then add a few lines of code for the respective tool and then continue in the UI, but here I lack for example the understanding of how I then jump from the MLOps UI back into the notebook, how I keep them synchronous, if I want to change something fundamental in the code again.

 *equal contribution
 Abstract: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) have recently experienced a resurgence in popularity due to their interpretability, which arises from expressing the target value as a sum of non-linear transformations of the features. Despite the current enthusiasm for GAMs, their susceptibility to concurvity - i.e., (possibly non-linear) dependencies between the features - has hitherto been largely overlooked. Here, we demonstrate how concurvity can severly impair the interpretability of GAMs and propose a remedy: a conceptually simple, yet effective regularizer which penalizes pairwise correlations of the non-linearly transformed feature variables. This procedure is applicable to any differentiable additive model, such as Neural Additive Models or NeuralProphet, and enhances interpretability by eliminating ambiguities due to self-canceling feature contributions. We validate the effectiveness of our regularizer in experiments on synthetic as well as real-world datasets for time-series and tabular data. Our experiments show that concurvity in GAMs can be reduced without significantly compromising prediction quality, improving interpretability and reducing variance in the feature importances.

 Many people including myself have been impressed by the general intelligence to understand images, but also questioning its visual grounding capability. After spending the last week or two, I am really shocked by the power of GPT-4V after plugging our SoM prompting. It can not only do a lot of fine-grained vision tasks but also can perform visual reasoning and project its world knowledge to the visual inputs! To extract meaningful regions, we compiled a new SoM toolbox with a number of interactive image segmentation tools, like our own MaskDINO, SEEM, Semantic-SAM, and also SAM…]]></summary>

Incumbent platforms like OpenAI and AWS are dominating the AI market.
 
Coding co-pilots like GitHub Co-Pilot are widely adopted.
 
The adoption of AI tools, including coding co-pilots, is not leading to a reduction in engineering headcount for most CEOs.
 
However, some CEOs have reported that co-pilots have reduced their future hiring needs.
 
The landscape of AI tools is expected to continue shifting, with more second order effects and value-add use cases emerging.

 I'm trying to use OpenAI's spinning up to learn about RL. Spinning up requires OpenAI gym, instead of the new gymnasium package. 
 Trying to install MuJoCo with gym, I'm getting an error that I'm missing a MuJoCo liscense key. But MuJoCo is free now, right? So what is the status with backward compatibility with it? Is there some global license key that can be used? Or is it simply not backward compatible?
 Thanks a lot.

When is it recommended to include Box-Cox or Yeo-Johnson, and how should we choose between the two? How does it effect the feature selection or model performance? 
 Additionally, how should we select the appropriate scaling technique (normalizing, standardizing, min-max) and does the order in which we transform and scale matter for our data? 
 Is there any recommended literature on this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brain decoding tech has improved a lot recently thanks to AI/ML, enabling reading out visual perceptions from fMRI brain scans. But fMRI is too slow for real-time BCIs.
 A new study from Meta's AI research team pushes brain reading into real-time using MEG, which measures whole-brain activity at super-fast millisecond resolution.
 They built a 3-part pipeline to decode MEG signals:
  
Embed images into latent spaces using pretrained models like CLIP.
 Train MEG-specific ConvNet to predict embeddings from MEG data.
 Generate images from MEG embeddings with diffusion model.
  
They tested it on 20k+ natural images. MEG decoding was 7X better than old methods, hitting 70% top-5 accuracy in retrieving the right images.
 Generated images matched semantics decently but lacked fine visual details compared to fMRI. MEG seems more focused on high-level category info whereas fMRI captures more low-level features.
 This could enable visual BCIs for paralysis, etc. ... honestly, a world where we can decode brain images in real time is pretty crazy. The findings also raise some important ethical considerations around privacy of decoded mental content... (wow, that was a weird sentence to write!).
 TLDR: New MEG pipeline decodes dynamic visual data from brain activity in real-time. Good but not yet photorealistic-quality image generation.
 Full summary here. Paper is here.

 Generated images matched semantics decently but lacked fine visual details compared to fMRI. MEG seems more focused on high-level category info whereas fMRI captures more low-level features.
 This could enable visual BCIs for paralysis, etc. ... honestly, a world where we can decode brain images in real time is pretty crazy. The findings also raise some important ethical considerations around privacy of decoded mental content... (wow, that was a weird sentence to write!).
 TLDR: New MEG pipeline decodes dynamic visual data from brain activity in real-time. Good but not yet photorealistic-quality image generation.
 Full summary here. Paper is here.

 I'm looking at the parameters here and I'm confused on how there is no distance metric? What is assumed about the data going in if there is no distance metric or precomputed distance option?
 For example, can I run this with binary data (1/0), what about data w/ missing values? Does it assume the samples are normally distributed?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there,
 I am working on a school project in which we want to implement a RL algorithm on a simple problem.
 The goal is to maximise the heart rate of a person using a vibrator by setting its frequency.
 We wrote a simulator that outputs the new heart rate based on the vibration frequency. It implements several different classes of users: for example one for which the heart rate increases when the vibration frequency stays the same, another that prefers when it increases over time, etc.
 We determined that we need to have as a state the current heart rate but also a table of the k previous heart rates and the actions associated. Without that memory, we would not be able to tell apart the different profiles as in the same state, we would need to do different actions to satisfy them both. We then have a correlation between previous samples and the action we make at current state, which I have read makes the problem non markovian.
 Is there a way to solve this problem using a DQN algorithm, given that we need to memorize the previous samples linearly which seems to go against the algorithm behavior and the usage of a replay memory? Are there more suited algorithms?

He believes that AI could achieve human levels of cognitive competence within a few years or decades, which raises concerns about democracy, national security, and our collective future.
 
Bengio reflects on his own work and the importance of addressing the existential risks posed by AI.
 
He acknowledges that these risks were not taken seriously until recently and discusses the taboo surrounding the topic in the AI research community.

 Twitter discussion: https://x.com/andrew_n_carr/status/1714326003030638848?s=20 
 Shows in my opinion that tokenizers are clouding the understanding of LLMs and that using the data directly is better. https://x.com/karpathy/status/1657949234535211009?s=20 Karpathy thinks the same! 
 Abstract:
  
Large Language Models have not yet been broadly adapted for the analysis of scientific datasets due in part to the unique difficulties of tokenizing numbers. We propose XVAL, a numerical encoding scheme that represents any real number using just a single token. XVAL represents a given real number by scaling a dedicated embedding vector by the number value. Combined with a modified number-inference approach, this strategy renders the model end-to-end continuous when considered as a map from the numbers of the input string to those of the output string. This leads to an inductive bias that is generally more suitable for applications in scientific domains. We empirically evaluate our proposal on a number of synthetic and real-world datasets. Compared with existing number encoding schemes, we find that XVAL is more token-efficient and demonstrates improved generalization.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our latest research shows an emerging privacy threat from LLMs beyond training data memorization. We investigate how LLMs such as GPT-4 can infer personal information from seemingly benign texts. The key observation of our work is that the best LLMs are almost as accurate as humans, while being at least 100x faster and 240x cheaper in inferring such personal information. 
 We collect and label real Reddit profiles, and test the LLMs capabilities in inferring personal information from mere Reddit posts, where GPT-4 achieves >85% Top-1 accuracy. Mitigations such as anonymization are shown to be largely ineffective in preventing such attacks.

 Words per dollar for each GPU:
 Words per dollar comparison or each GPU
 Although the latest cards are indeed much faster than older cards at performing the inference, there’s really a sweet spot for cost-performance in the lower end 30xx series cards.
 Conclusions
  
As is often the case, there’s a clear trade-off here between cost and performance. Higher end cards are faster, but their disproportionate cost makes them more expensive per word spoken.
 The model’s median speed is surprisingly similar across GPU types, even though the peak performance can be quite different.
 No matter what GPU you select, you should be prepared for significant variability in performance.
 Qualitative: While bark’s speech is often impressively natural sounding, it does have a tendency to go off script sometimes.
  
We’ve also made available audio from 1000 top-rated recipes, paired with the script it was trying to read.

 ​
 i'm trying to build a small ai that formats texts.
 ​
 of course the current formatting applications applied on ide, search engine, ms softwares, notetaking apps are well functioning, but this is more for educational purpose & self interest.
 ​
 since i don't have infinite amount of time and money, i'm thinking of using open sourced text data and generate synthetic data using gpt3.5 or somekind of algorithm to unformat them.
 ​
 so this is the part where i'm stuck. when adding some errors such as inappropriate multilines, tabs, typos, how much should i add on to?
 ​
 it would be best if i knew somekind of distribution of text errors people make on everyday life, but i don't have any.
 ​
 i don't want to make this training too hard so i'm not really thinking to destroy the text, but rather add some appropriate level of errors.
 ​
 but, would it help this ai model to learn better if i add extra errors?
 ​
 or is this all just something i would have to figure out by myself?
 ​
 any comments would be appreciated!

The large language models (LLMs) behind chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard are trained on publicly-available data, which can be used to identify sensitive information about someone.
 
The research found that OpenAI's GPT-4 was able to correctly predict private information about users 85 to 95 percent of the time.
 
For example, the LLM correctly identified that a user was based in Melbourne, Australia based on a mention of the term 'hook turn,' which is a traffic maneuver specific to Melbourne.
 
The research also suggests that chatbots could potentially infer a user's race based on offhanded comments.
 
This raises concerns about internet privacy and the potential misuse of personal data by advertisers or hackers.

 I would be more than grateful if you could send some literature review papers in the field of ML so I understand how to structure and write my paper and also what I should focus on mode. It doesn't necessarily have to be related to my PhD topic (but if they are it will help quite a bit). 
 I would be more than happy if anyone can also share their experience.
 Thank you for your time!

In this work, we introduce BitNet, a scalable and stable 1-bit Transformer architecture designed for large language models. Specifically, we introduce BitLinear as a drop-in replacement of the nn.Linear layer in order to train 1-bit weights from scratch. Experimental results on language modeling show that BitNet achieves competitive performance while substantially reducing memory footprint and energy consumption, compared to state-of-the-art 8-bit quantization methods and FP16 Transformer baselines. Furthermore, BitNet exhibits a scaling law akin to full-precision Transformers, suggesting its potential for effective scaling to even larger language models while maintaining efficiency and performance benefits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear all,
 As part of my studies, I am running some RL experiments in which I want to compare some different catastrophic forgetting approaches in sequential task learning. I am using PPO as a baseline. What is the usual experimental setting in relation to seeds used during training and evaluation? If I do for example 3 trainings for a given approach using a different seed for each training, what is the best way of doing the evaluation afterwards?
 Let's say I have Approach/algorithm A -> train 3 times with 3 seeds -> model_A1, model_A2, model_A3
 Then I would like to use 3 different seeds for the evaluation, so to evaluate each of the previously trained models over a set of episodes (deterministic) for each evaluation seed, and get averaged rewards (or median).
 I wonder whether I might be over complicating things, so I would like to ask you for suggestions. To give a bit of context, this is not intended for a paper, but as part of my master studies, so conditions are a bit more relaxed.
 Thanks in advance for your insights and suggestions

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/MachineLearning! I recently went into the CUDA programming rabbit hole. In the process, I came across matrix multiplication and was amazed by how complicated the algorithm is in CUDA (especially if you want to get the best performance). I found the learning process quite gruelling (the CUDA docs were very average), so I wrote a tiny blog which hopefully helps anyone in the same position.
 You can read the blog on Medium (no paywall) or HackMD. It would probably be quite useful if you want to get a deeper intuition of how things like OpenAI Triton or FlashAttention work under the hood.
 Accompanying this is an implementation of a 3-hidden-layer MLP trained on MNIST in pure CUDA. Benchmarking this against PyTorch, it gets up 6x higher end-to-end training speed for small (h=128) networks, and asymptotically 20% faster for large (h=8192) ones! 
 https://preview.redd.it/txx2txbvlzub1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bb136b9fb535bc58fd7ee809bbbca6f68dc8953
 It's worth noting that I tried reasonably hard optimising the PyTorch implementation by using full fp16, torch.compile with fullgraph=True, mode="max-autotune", and pre-loading all data to GPU up-front (I also did this for the CUDA implementation).
 The main takeaways I got are:
  
For small networks, PyTorch/Python still incurs a significant overhead, even if you try pretty hard to optimise it.
 For large networks, most of the speedup comes from using fp16 accumulation for matrix multiplication (instead of PyTorch's fp32). This obviously reduces stability, but at least in my case, I didn't observe any numerical issues. In cases where we can get away with fp16, we might be leaving a significant amount of performance on the table!
 Anecdotally, you have to try really hard in CUDA to even get close to the performance of PyTorch, but it is possible to beat it if you try hard (suffer) enough.
  
You can check out the repo here: https://github.com/andylolu2/cuda-mnist. Would love to hear some feedback!

 Or frankly, what would be better if it is possible, would be to extend my pretrained model such that it learns from the new data and then can be more tightly fit to that month's data. So something like meta-learning or local fine-tuning, but I want to continue to update and improve my pretrained model so that I have a base model that can do well on each month's new data. Does anyone know anything like this, or have advance for terms to look into, beyond just transfer learning or regularization?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Maybe this belongs elsewhere since it's probably a dumb basic question, but basically I'm taking an undergrad course in AI and we've been given a classification problem. We were told as a "hint" to recall Cover's Theorem when separation fails, but the issue is she also wants us to draw a rough sketch of the data with the separator. Mine failed in a basic scatterplot so I upped the dimension by 1 but it also wasn't separable in R3 (which is annoying to draw anyway but could have been done), if I keep going then it might work at some point but idk how I'm meant to draw the data if it's separated in R4 or beyond. If it works in R4 do I just sketch the data in R3 and just draw a 3 dimensional point where w = 0? But even then if it goes beyond R4 it becomes way more annoying. So I'm assuming my implementation is just wrong, maybe the formula I used was wrong.
 Can someone show what a proper implementation looks like and how we're meant to up dimensions? Don't wanna post what I tried bc it has starter code and stuff baked into it which might allow my professor to find this post 😂

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've had access to Dall-3, Vision and voice chat features, and I've been blown away by how impressive each of the new features are. Dall-E 3 seems roughly comparable to Midjourney in overall image quality, but does a much better job at understanding the prompt. The vision model continues to surprise by how well it is able to understand images at a seemingly human level of comprehension. And the voice chat is such an intuitive and captivating way of interacting with ChatGPT, it felt like I was interacting with one of the AI assistants from the movie "Her".
 However, it's unfortunate that these amazing new features cannot be used together at the same time. Up until gaining access to these features, I had been using the advanced data analysis model as my default, which is great for helping with programming tasks. I can only imagine how revolutionary ChatGPT will be when a cohesive multi-modal model is released sometime in the near future which has all these capabilities available from the start.
 What things would you want to try if such a cohesive model was released? I can already imagine some use cases where you could set up iterative improvement for things like interface design, which some people have already got to work with just the base vision model by itself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Biden administration has announced additional limits on sales of advanced semiconductors by American firms to China, in an effort to restrict China's progress on supercomputing and artificial intelligence.
 
The new rules will likely halt most shipments of advanced semiconductors from the United States to Chinese data centers, which use them to produce models capable of artificial intelligence.
 
Chip makers seeking to sell China advanced chips or the machinery used to make them will be required to notify the government of their plans or obtain a special license.
 
To prevent the risk of advanced U.S. chips reaching China through third countries, chip makers will also need licenses to ship to other countries subject to U.S. arms embargoes.
 
The Biden administration argues that China's access to advanced technology is dangerous as it could aid the country's military in tasks like guiding hypersonic missiles or cracking top-secret U.S. codes.
 
The restrictions may affect Chinese companies developing AI chatbots and could weaken China's economy in the long run, as AI is transforming industries from retail to healthcare.
 
The limits are also expected to impact sales to China of U.S. chip makers such as Nvidia, AMD, and Intel, who earn a significant portion of their revenue from Chinese buyers.
 
The rules will exempt chips used in commercial applications like smartphones, laptops, electric vehicles, and gaming systems.
 
The Semiconductor Industry Association, which represents major chip makers, is evaluating the impact of the updated rules.
 
The Biden administration has been trying to counter China's growing mastery of cutting-edge technologies by investing in new chip factories in the U.S. while setting restrictions on exports of technology to China.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google has asked a California federal court to dismiss a proposed class action lawsuit that claims the company's scraping of data to train generative artificial-intelligence systems violates millions of people's privacy and property rights.
 
Google argues that the use of public data is necessary to train systems like its chatbot Bard and that the lawsuit would 'take a sledgehammer not just to Google's services but to the very idea of generative AI.'
 
The lawsuit is one of several recent complaints over tech companies' alleged misuse of content without permission for AI training.
 
Google general counsel Halimah DeLaine Prado said in a statement that the lawsuit was 'baseless' and that U.S. law 'supports using public information to create new beneficial uses.'
 
Google also said its alleged use of J.L.'s book was protected by the fair use doctrine of copyright law.

 More concretely: Suppose we have a network trained with metric learning and a massive, diverse set of labelled examples to retrieve from. We've just been tasked to do classification with a fixed number of classes, and we've narrowed it down to two options:
  
Embed our dataset using our metric learning network, throw the embeddings into a vector DB, and do k-NN
 Train a classifier via cross-entropy loss
  
Which approach would we expect to provide better performance? What are the trade-offs? Any insight is appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the past nine years of my deep learning journey, I have come across a vast number of frameworks. Lua Torch was a fantastic framework that initially died due to a lack of Python's ecosystem, but then rose again as PyTorch. Theano was also a great framework, but its major drawback was difficult debugging. I remember spending two weeks writing a Neural Turing Machine for solving bAbI tasks on theano. (Nowadays, it would take a couple hours on Pytorch). Tensorflow - I still don't understand what that was, a terrible framework. There was also Caffe, which was popular in computer vision. Julia is another language that attempted to introduce automatic differentiation as a built-in feature. And JAX, which I was originally biased against since it's a Google product. But some close friends persuaded me to try it, and I actually liked it. However, I thought that it would be difficult for JAX to gain widespread adoption in the community, as PyTorch already had a strong network effect and was gaining traction quickly. I didn't see how anyone could catch up with PyTorch. Another issue with JAX is that it requires additional cognitive load for developers.

A longstanding goal of the field of robot learning has been to create generalist agents that can perform tasks for humans. Natural language has the potential to be an easy-to-use interface for humans to specify arbitrary tasks, but it is difficult to train robots to follow language instructions. Approaches like language-conditioned behavioral cloning (LCBC) train policies to directly imitate expert actions conditioned on language, but require humans to annotate all training trajectories and generalize poorly across scenes and behaviors. Meanwhile, recent goal-conditioned approaches perform much better at general manipulation tasks, but do not enable easy t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Guys,
 It seems RAG is really taking off as an increasingly popular use case for LLMs to leverage contextual data. However, everybody is building their own contextual data sets and embedding them in their own silo'd vector dbs. 
 Do you guys think there's any utility in having a shared public vector db that anyone can tap into their API, without having to self-host, worry about the embedding pipelines and filling the vector db with enough data in the first place for their use cases? Would this save devs alot of time in quickly testing testing product ideas? (albeit it does seem that propriety data is what everyone's raving about today) 
 - 
 For context, I'm building a social media product we're users can upload a few pieces (approx 10) of content (social media posts, websites, videos to start with), which becomes the verified human-curated list/Niche. We then classify and embed this into a vector db. From this, we have set up a data pipeline to scrape the web and find new content that is most similar which we suggest to users to add to the Niche (upvote, downvote style). When a piece of content is upvoted on its added to the verified list updating the Niche's classification string. Essentially we're aiming to construct an ever-growing, user-curated, contextually classified vector database from a relatively small set of sample data.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Researchers evaluated ChatGPT and GPT-4 on mock CFA exam questions to see if they could pass the real tests. The CFA exams rigorously test practical finance knowledge and are known for being quite difficult.
 They tested the models in zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting settings on mock Level I and Level II exams.
 The key findings:
  
GPT-4 consistently beat ChatGPT, but both models struggled way more on the more advanced Level II questions.
 Few-shot prompting helped ChatGPT slightly
 Chain-of-thought prompting exposed knowledge gaps rather than helping much.
 Based on estimated passing scores, only GPT-4 with few-shot prompting could potentially pass the exams.
  
The models definitely aren't ready to become charterholders yet. Their difficulties with tricky questions and core finance concepts highlight the need for more specialized training and knowledge.
 But GPT-4 did better overall, and few-shot prompting shows their ability to improve. So with targeted practice on finance formulas and reasoning, we could maybe see step-wise improvements.
 TLDR: Tested on mock CFA exams, ChatGPT and GPT-4 struggle with the complex finance concepts and fail. With few-shot prompting, GPT-4 performance reaches the boundary between passing and failing but doesn't clearly pass.
 Full summary here. Paper is here.

Large Language Model as Attributed Training Data Generator: A Tale of Diversity and Bias (Yu et al., 2023)
 Generating Training Data with Language Models: Towards Zero-Shot Language Understanding (Meng et al., 2022)
  
The former focuses on studying the differences between the type of prompts that are used to generate the data and the latter doesn't use LLMs.
 Doesn't have to be papers, blog posts or any sort of information regarding the scenario I described is fine. Thanks.

 I am working on an app that requires creating lots of text embeddings(100M tokens).
 Looking at OpenAI Ada pricing(and considering that my app doesn't yet make any money) I'm looking into self-hosting a model to run on CPU. 
 I know that constrains me towards smaller models-- so far locally I've been testing with sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 and the query results seem okay-ish enough for my MVP. (Although, I should not that I haven't compared how embeddings with other models would perform.)
 Does anyone have experiences doing something similar? In particular, I'd love to hear about any tips you have for maximizing no. of embeddings / second.

 Pick a question and see what you can learn! 
  
can it use TINY images (I assume they are much faster)
 can it tell you what has changed in two images?
 can it measure distances ? (with perspective?) 
  can it make 3d models from instructions?
 
 can it "learn" to recognise people/ similar objects (in the same context window)
 what limits are there to exhaustive listing 
 exhaustive description
 
 is it better at details or overviews
 can it read maps / graphs / text
 how smart is it on DIY / xrays / mechanics 
 can it follow wires?? 
 (Can it find lego)
 is there a formal reference system you can use (X/Y) 
 can it give co-ordinates in large grids or grid-like (how un-grid like) 
 ie film strip, or window-panes
 
 can it navigate a 2d maze turn-by turn? 3d maze? can that be insanely complex? 
 
 can it make ebay descriptions (condition)
 can it estimate food weight
 can it estimate strength / angles / volume
 can it create programs from screenshots. Can it use programs? games? control RC car / robot? 
 what kind of language / instructions are best when talking about images. 
 what other questions do we need

However comparing raw speed of products of different vendors is more challenging than I anticipated, because there are many possible raw performance indicators, only few of which are provided by vendors.
 For example a raw performance indicator can be "FP32 vector with opportunistic optimization", while another can be "BF16 matrix/tensor without opportunistic optimization". A full picture of raw performance would be fully represented only by a table with multiple dimensions:
  
Number format (FP64, FP32, TF32, FP16, BF16, FP8, INT8, INT4... are the others?)

LeCun emphasized the need to design AI systems for safety rather than imagining catastrophic scenarios.
 
Bengio argued for the importance of prudence, stating that we still do not understand how to design safe, powerful AI systems, and highlighted the need for major investment in AI safety and governance.
 
The debate highlighted the disagreement among esteemed researchers about AI's potential risks, the effectiveness of current safety measures, and the best path forward.
 
The implications of AI, including job displacement, privacy violations, and existential risks, have become a topic of widespread concern.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I'm currently working on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) models and have developed a custom chunking function, as I found the methods in LangChain not entirely satisfactory.
 I'm keen on exploring other methods, algorithms (related to NLP or otherwise), and models to enhance text chunking in RAG. There are many RAG implementations out there, but I've noticed a lack of focus on improving chunking performance specifically.
 Are there any other promising approaches beyond my current pipeline, which consists of a bi-encoder (retriever), cross-encoder (reranker), and a Large Language Model (LLM) for interactions?
 For queries, I'm using both traditional and HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embedding) approaches in the retrieval phase, and sending the top 'n' results of both similarity search to the reranker.
 I've also tried using an LLM to convert the query into a series of 10-20 small phrases or keywords, which are then used as the query for the retriever model. However, the results vary depending on the LLM used. To generate good keywords (with a not extractive approach) , I had to use a "CoT" prompt, instructing the model to write self-instruct, problem analysis and reasonings before generating the required keywords. But this approach use lots of tokens, and requires careful scraping to ensure the model has used the right delimiter to separate reasoning and the actual answer.
 I'm also planning to modify the text used to generate embeddings, while returning the original text after the recall phase. But this is still a work in progress and scaling it is proving to be a challenge. If anyone has any tips or experience with this, I'd appreciate your input.
 I'd be grateful for any resources, repositories, libraries, or existing implementations of novel chunking methods that you could share. Or we could just discuss ideas, thoughts, or approaches to improve text chunking for RAG here.
 Thanks in advance for your time!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tables pack tons of relational data but are tough for AI to grasp. They have complex 2D structure with information scattered across rows and columns. Models like GPT-3 fail basic tasks like finding where a missing value should go.
 LLMs struggle at this because they're pre-trained mostly on natural text, which is linear. Researchers at Microsoft wanted to mitigate this with "table-tuned" models, trained on table-related tasks.
 Their process:
  
Automatically generate lots of diverse table-task training cases from a corpus of real-world tables. Ex: "impute missing value" or "identify error in table".
 Further augment data via paraphrasing, shuffling table rows/columns, chaining model responses, etc.
  
This table-tuning produced "Table-GPT" models with substantially stronger table skills. In experiments, Table-GPT crushed vanilla GPT-3:
  
25%+ better on unseen table tasks like missing value ID and column type ID
 Beat GPT-3 on 98% of test cases across 9 different table tasks
 Stayed superior after downstream tuning too
  
There's tons more work to do but seems pretty promising. Table-tuning boosted models' ability to comprehend tables and reason over tabular data vs just pre-training on text.
 TLDR: Training AI models more on synthesized table tasks ("table-tuning") significantly improves their table skills.
 Full summary is here. Paper is here.

 I have a dataset with video and other modalities (e.g. audio), and I want to run a captioning task. I found UniVL, which is a pre-trained model that supports video and text (transcripts) and can caption them. It extracts features and runs transformer encoders on both these modalities to get an embedding, then concatenates them and feeds it into a cross-encoder and decoder to get captions. I'm wondering if I can make use of this model, but add in other modalities, by writing my own embedding model and feeding the embeddings into the cross encoder. Would this work? Is there any similar previous work regarding adding new modalities to a pre-trained network?

 Active learning is to used few labeled samples plus a initially trained model to select the most useful unlabeled data for training.
 Zero/few shot learning is to train a model on some data then Mae it work directly with unseen label/data. 
 In my understanding, zero/few short learning is more aligned with the current large model trend or foundation model trend. Active learning strategy seems to still rely on small dataset and was intending to gradually enrich training data by selecting new samples in.
 In industry and in big tech, which one is more used or deployed? Anyone can give me some comments?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Building off our last research post, we wanted to figure out ways to quantify "ambiguity" and "uncertainty" in prompts/responses to LLMs. We ended up discovering two useful forms of uncertainty: "Structural" and "Conceptual" uncertainty.
 In a nutshell: Conceptual uncertainty is when the model isn't sure what to say, and Structural uncertainty is when the model isn't sure how to say it.
 You can play around with this yourself in the demo or read about it in more detail in the blog post

 This post argues that large datasets have hidden costs, beyond time and money, poor data quality and the wrong selection process might be killing model performance. 
 Any thoughts? Have you faced this challenge?

 Currently, I'm working on a semantic search tool. Given a set of text files, my goal is to retrieve the most relevant information related to the query.
 To achieve this, I begin by preprocessing the PDF files, splitting them into pages, and computing embeddings using a fine-tuned BERT model for Italian.
 Next, with a query and its embedding, I calculate the cosine similarity to all the pages in the document. Since there aren't many pages, a brute search remains quite fast.
 However, I'm encountering an issue where the similarity results don't consistently yield the most relevant information. I've experimented with various embedding layers, but there's been little to no improvement.
 I've also tested a commercially available solution to ensure the problem isn't with my PDF files. Interestingly, I achieved better results, leading me to believe that the issue may lie within my pipeline.
 My current hypothesis is that the page splitting process might be excluding relevant semantic connections, and I may need to improve my text preprocessing.
 What suggestions do you have to enhance my results?
 P.S.
 The information obtained from the similarity check is subsequently used as context with a chat language model, similar to tools like AsMyPdf.

 Abstract
 Language models generate responses by producing a series of tokens in immediate succession: the (K+1)th token is an outcome of manipulating K hidden vectors per layer, one vector per preceding token. What if instead we were to let the model manipulate say, K+10 hidden vectors, before it outputs the (K+1)th token? We operationalize this idea by performing training and inference on language models with a (learnable) pause token, a sequence of which is appended to the input prefix. We then delay extracting the model's outputs until the last pause token is seen, thereby allowing the model to process extra computation before committing to an answer. We empirically evaluate pause-training on decoder-only models of 1B and 130M parameters with causal pretraining on C4, and on downstream tasks covering reasoning, question-answering, general understanding and fact recall. Our main finding is that inference-time delays show gains when the model is both pre-trained and finetuned with delays. For the 1B model, we witness gains on 8 of 9 tasks, most prominently, a gain of 18% EM score on the QA task of SQuAD, 8% on CommonSenseQA and 1% accuracy on the reasoning task of GSM8k. Our work raises a range of conceptual and practical future research questions on making delayed next-token prediction a widely applicable new paradigm.
 Here is a Medium post about my thoughts on the paper.

This ability to catch anything from a cup to a banana, and a pen, can help the hand quickly manipulate objects without transporting objects to their destination -- and even generalize to unseen objects.

 I've built a set of extensions for OpenTelemetry that provides visibility into LLM applications like RAG pipelines - whether it be prompts, vector DBs and more. Here’s the repo: https://github.com/traceloop/openllmetry.
 Two key benefits with OpenTelemetry are - 
  
You can trace your entire system execution, not just the LLM (so you can see how requests to DBs, or other calls affect the overall result); 
 You can connect to any monitoring platform—no need to adopt new tools. Install the SDK and plug it into Datadog, Sentry, or both. Or switch between them easily.
  
There's already support for OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Pinecone, Chroma, LangChain, and Haystack and we are working hard to support the entire ecosystem.
 Would love to hear your thoughts

 ​
 "Model usage. Many recent model-based algorithms have focused on the setting in which model
 rollouts begin from the initial state distribution (Kurutach et al., 2018; Clavera et al., 2018). While
 this may be a more faithful interpretation of Algorithm 1, as it is optimizing a policy purely under
 the state distribution of the model, this approach entangles the model rollout length with the task
 horizon. Because compounding model errors make extended rollouts difficult, these works evaluate
 on truncated versions of benchmarks. The branching strategy described in Section 4.2, in which
 model rollouts begin from the state distribution of a different policy under the true environment
 dynamics, effectively relieves this limitation. In practice, branching replaces few long rollouts from
 the initial state distribution with many short rollouts starting from replay buffer states."

What does state distribtion mean over here?
 Also in line 8 of the image, I don't understand what's the relation between model rollout and policy \pi_t. Is it saying, use the model free algorithm to take future steps from that state? What does the model have to do with that?

TL;DR: In RLHF, there’s tension between the reward learning phase, which uses human preference in the form of comparisons, and the RL fine-tuning phase, which optimizes a single, non-comparative reward. What if we performed RL in a comparative way?
Figure 1:
 This diagram illustrates the difference between reinforcement learning from absolute feedback and relative feedback. By incorporating a new component - pairwise policy gradient, we can unify the reward modeling stage and RL stage, enabling direct updates based on pairwise responses.

 what mathematics courses should i take to get into RL research at a theoretical/algorithmic level? i am currently taking proof-based linear algebra, and have taken all the computational calculus offered. i imagine prob. theory/math stats is pretty important, too; what else?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Game dev is super complex nowadays - games have huge codebases, massive teams, and dev cycles dragging on for years. Costs are insane too - budgets can hit $100M+ easily.
 In a new paper, researchers propose to reverse this trend with an AI framework called GameGPT that automates parts of the dev process using multiple AI agents. Each agent handles a different role (all are fine-tuned from relevant base models):
  
One agent reviews the game design plan to catch errors
 Another turns tasks into code implementations
 Reviewer agents check the code and results
 A testing agent validates everything works as expected
  
By breaking up the workflow, GameGPT can simplify things for the AI agents. They just focus on a narrow role versus having one jack-of-all-trades agent.
 The authors argue GameGPT can eliminate repetitive and rote elements of gamedev like testing. This would free up developers to focus on creative design challenges.
 However, the GameGPT paper does not include any concrete results or experiments demonstrating improved performance. There is no evidence presented that GameGPT reduces hallucinations, redundancy or development time. The authors mention empirical results support their claims that the architecture is more effective, but none are provided. I could not find any additional support material about this work, like a project website, that I could use to further check into this (maybe someone can share in the comments?).
 Right now GameGPT seems mostly conceptual. The ideas are interesting but hard to assess without quantitative results.
 TLDR: New GameGPT AI framework aims to automate tedious parts of game development using specialized agents. No concrete results were provided in the paper - someone will need to test this out and report back.

Should we begin with data normalization/standardization, followed by feature selection, and then split the data into training, validation, and test sets? Or is it advisable to initially split the data to prevent spill-over effects?
 I'm concerned about the possibility of training my model on (part of) the test data, which could result in spill-over effects. However, if the recommended approach is to split the data first and then perform normalization and feature selection, what impact would this have on the selected features?
 Does the manner in which we split the data into random time periods matter, or is it necessary to incorporate a validation method that accounts for temporal effects? I'm worried that the selected features might depend on the time period I choose for my training and test sets. What is the best practice in this scenario?

 ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence. The requested array has an inhomogeneous shape after 1 dimensions. The detected shape was (2,) + inhomogeneous part.
 This is my code for testing my environment:
 episodes=5 for episode in range(1,episodes+1): obs=env.reset() done=False score=0 print(obs) while not done: env.render() action, _ = model.predict(obs) #Now using model here obs, reward, done, truncated, info = env.step(action) score += reward print('Episode:{} Score:{}'.format(episode,score)) env.close() 
 And this is the environment I am using :
 environment_name = 'CartPole-v1' env=gym.make(environment_name,render_mode="human") 
 the model variable has my trained model stored in it and is initialized as such :
 model =PPO.load(PPO_Path, env=env) 
 The print(obs) function returns this value :

 I've looked at AirSim, and it seems to no longer be supported by Micrsosoft. I've also been heavily looking at Flightmare, which is almost exactly what I want, but getting the tool that hasn't been maintained for years up and running is giving me headaches (and the documentation is not great/up to date either).
 Ultimately, what I'm looking for is: * Physics simulation * Photo-realistic vision * Built-in integration with Gym would be awesome * Python platform preferred, C++ also ok
 I've also used ROS/Gazebo with PyTorch previously, and that is my backup plan I suppose, but it's not photo-realistic and is kind of slow in my experience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fine-tuning large language models with the aim of obtaining a small but accurate model is extremely difficult.
 This is because you have to strike a balance between the model’s size and accuracy. Researchers from IST Austria & Neural Magic seem to have found a sweet spot. 
 In their latest paper, they successfully applied sparse fine-tuning on MPT with remarkable performance. The MPT model was pruned to 75% without a drop in accuracy, showing performance that is on-par with quantization approaches. 
 Particularly, the resulting sparse model can execute fast on CPUs by taking advantage of the sparsity. 
 Instead of performing standard loss-based fine-tuning which may fail to recover accuracy, the researchers experiment with distillation-type losses. These losses are better at recovering accuracy at high sparsity. What’s impressive is that the sparse fine-tune LLM can achieve 7.7 tokens per second on a single core and 26.7 tokens per second on 4 cores of an cheap consumer AMD Ryzen CPU. The MPT-7B model was fine-tuned via SFT obtaining a dense baseline that showed remarkable performance. This baseline was later pruned with SparseGPT to 40% to 80% reaching 5X compression ratios. By applying SquareHead KD, FP32 models with 75% can be obtained with NO accuracy loss, outperforming cross-entropy and other KD methods.

 GitHub: https://github.com/daveshap/ACE_Framework
 Blog post: https://medium.com/@dave-shap/autonomous-agents-are-here-introducing-the-ace-framework-a180af15d57c
 Abstract:
  
The rapid development and adoption of Generative AI (GAI) technology in the form of chatbots such as ChatGPT and Claude has greatly increased interest in agentic machines. This paper introduces the Autonomous Cognitive Entity (ACE) model, a novel framework for a cognitive architecture, enabling machines and software agents to operate more independently. Drawing inspiration from the OSI model, the ACE framework presents layers of abstraction to conceptualize artificial cognitive architectures. The model is designed to harness the capabilities of the latest generative AI technologies, including large language models (LLMs) and multimodal generative models (MMMs), to build autonomous, agentic systems. The ACE framework comprises six layers: the Aspirational Layer, Global Strategy, Agent Model, Executive Function, Cognitive Control, and Task Prosecution. Each layer plays a distinct role, ranging from setting the moral compass and strategic thinking to task selection and execution. The ACE framework also incorporates mechanisms for handling failures and adapting actions, thereby enhancing the robustness and flexibility of autonomous agents. This paper introduces the conceptual framework and proposes implementation strategies that have been tested and observed in industry. The goal of this paper is to formalize this framework so as to be more accessible.

 I'm trying to jazz up my design portfolio for applying for jobs, and I wanted to insert some cute illustrations on each project page. The projects deal with a variety of topics so I'll need pictures of many things, but want to keep the style quite consistent. 
 What is the best AI tool right now to do this? I paid for Midjourney but I can't seem to understand how to get it to do this. 
 For example I got this image from DALLE and love the style, the white background also helps make it look better on the portfolio. I'd want another image in the same style of two kids throwing a ball, but can't figure out how to do it. 
 Alternatively if I could upload this image to an AI and say "in the same style, generate..." that would be great too. 
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I'm a Data Science student diving into an exciting thesis topic: using reinforcement learning to stabilize boats in rough seas by adjusting a keel's angle. But I am a bit concerned about the high complexity of the problem and the given situation: 
  
Action Space: Continuous, representing the keel's angle adjustments.
 State Space: Continuous, capturing the dynamic behavior of the sea, including waves.
 Training Environment: Currently, the company only has a real-world water tank setup to simulate the sea conditions. There's no computer simulation available.
  
Given this setup, I have a couple of concerns:
  
Is it possible to train an RL model effectively in such a complex real-world scenario without first having a computer simulation? And if yes, what would be your initial steps in doing so?
 Are there possibilities to reduce the problem's complexity while training exclusively in the real-world water tank simulation? (i.e. transforming the action space into a discrete action space?)
  
Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Biden administration is considering closing a loophole that gives Chinese companies access to American artificial intelligence (AI) chips through units located overseas.
 
The United States previously restricted shipments of AI chips to China but left overseas subsidiaries of Chinese companies with unfettered access.
 
The Biden administration is now looking for ways to close this loophole and prevent China from accessing top AI technology.
 
However, it is challenging to plug every gap in export controls.
 
Chinese firms are purchasing chips for use in data centers abroad, and it is difficult for the United States to police those transactions.
 
The United States has been seeking to halt the rise of China's AI capability, which depends on its access to U.S. chips.
 
Washington has been working to close other loopholes that allow AI chips into China, and the new rules expected this month will likely apply those same restrictions more broadly to all companies in the market.
 
The U.S. government is also grappling with the issue of Chinese parties accessing U.S. cloud providers like Amazon Web Services.
 
Overall, the Biden administration is facing challenges in cutting China off from top AI technology and closing all loopholes in export controls.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been trying a variety of pre-constructed and self-made U-net-like CNNs. Had a few questions:
  
When using torch summary, is there a general formula for estimating a model's inference time/backprop time and required GPU ram based on the information torch summary gives ( Total params, Trainable params, Non-trainable params, Total mult-adds (G), Input size, Forward/backward pass size (MB), Params size (MB), Estimated Total Size (MB)), and other hyper-parameters such as batch size?
 
Why is my self-made model (which has smaller quantities in all the parameters torch summary outputs) requiring more GPU ram AND taking more time for inference and backprop? Is the coding style for the model's class and its forward prop a huge factor here? If so, could you please provide tips for making my code more efficient?
 Here's the notebook showcasing a pre-made model from MONAI and two of my self-made models:

I've also listed some of my observation on the models and their results in the notebook. Any ideas or suggestion would be much appreciated.

 We showed that inference with PyReason logic program can provide up to a three order-of-magnitude speedup when compared with native simulations (we studied AFSIM and Starcraft2) while providing comparable reward and win rate (we found that PyReason-trained agents actually performed better than expected in both AFSIM and Starcraft2).

 However, the benefits of our semantic proxy go well beyond performance. The use of temporal logic programming has two crucial beneficial by-products such as symbolic explainability and modularity. PyReason provides an explainable symbolic trace that captures the evolution of the environment in a precise manner while modularity allows us to add or remove aspects of the logic program – allowing for adjustments to the simulation based on a library of behaviors. PyReason is well-suited to model simulated environments for other reasons – namely the ability to directly capture non-Markovian relationships and the open-world nature (defaults are “uncertain” instead of true or false). We have demonstrated that agents can be trained using standard RL techniques such as DQN using this framework.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[i am a little puzzled,
  
i know that transformers is the HF framework/library to load infere and train models easily
 and that llama.cpp is another framework/library that does the more of the same but specialized in models that runs on CPU and quanitized and run much faster
 i understand that GGML is a file format for saving model parameters in a single file, that its an old problematic format, and GGUF is the new kid on the block, and GPTQ is the same quanitized file format for models that runs on GPU
  
​
 so here is what i can't understand (assuming i got all the rest correct): 
  
does HF Transformers support loading GGUF or GGML models ? 
 and does GGUF needs a tokenizer json or does the data comes from within the gguf file itself
 and is safetensors (another file format) supported by both Transformers and Llama.cpp
  
​
 since i cannot find python examples for these combination i assume all the answers are - No
 ​
 can anyone shed some light ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 I'm hoping for advice on the direction to detect detect pattern/ anomaly at small scale.
 I understand there are certain tools out there for webpage monitoring, but let's say this is just an example that I'm ingesting small amount of hourly/daily traffic to a sub webpage on my site (anywhere from 50-100 visits per day, this may mean max ~30 visits/per hour)
 There are times when traffic to the page drops as the page doesn't fully load , or the other page on which I'm hosting the link to this page doesn't load resulting in people can't see the link tothis sub page).
 Giving the scope/scale of this, amount of the data, it's not possible for me to use other solutions for anomaly detection (those that costs like $100-$1000+/month) and I'm not sure where to start with ML with this minimal amount of hourly/daily data to monitor.
 Is there anything that I should look into?
 Thank you

 The results have been above 90% accurate on interference.
 Now, the problem. Cost. It's super expensive to run an endpoint for predictions with Google AutoML, for text classification.
 I'm wondering if anyone has any alternatives or ideas for similar results for cheaper. I am ok waiting for prediction results a bit as I don't need sub 1ms type responses lol.
 But everything I've tried has yielded less then optimal results. Tried various hugging face models, and accuracy is about 50%.

 Abstract:
  
Large vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved substantial progress in multimodal perception and reasoning. Furthermore, when seamlessly integrated into an embodied agent, it signifies a crucial stride towards the creation of autonomous and context-aware systems capable of formulating plans and executing commands with precision. In this paper, we introduce Octopus, a novel VLM designed to proficiently decipher an agent's vision and textual task objectives and to formulate intricate action sequences and generate executable code. Our design allows the agent to adeptly handle a wide spectrum of tasks, ranging from mundane daily chores in simulators to sophisticated interactions in complex video games. Octopus is trained by leveraging GPT-4 to control an explorative agent to generate training data, i.e., action blueprints and the corresponding executable code, within our experimental environment called OctoVerse. We also collect the feedback that allows the enhanced training scheme of Reinforcement Learning with Environmental Feedback (RLEF). Through a series of experiments, we illuminate Octopus's functionality and present compelling results, and the proposed RLEF turns out to refine the agent's decision-making. By open-sourcing our model architecture, simulator, and dataset, we aspire to ignite further innovation and foster collaborative applications within the broader embodied AI community.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Complete Guide to LLMs-based Autonomous Agents (Part I): https://medium.com/p/69515c016792 
 My article offers a comprehensive overview of LLM-based agents, covering Chain of Thought, Plan and Solve/Execute, Self-Ask, ReAct, Reflexion, Self-Consistency, Tree of Thoughts, and Graph of Thoughts. 
 It traces their evolution from basic forms, driven primarily by prompt engineering, to advanced models that emulate human problem-solving intricacies. Moreover, it provides an engineer's insights into the architecture behind these autonomous agents. 
  
Naturally suitable for AI agent: LLMs feature a natural language interface tailored for user-computer interactions and they come equipped with innate reasoning abilities.
 
LLM's Deficiency: Despite its strengths, GPT-4 can provide incorrect answers or hallucinations for complex tasks.
 
Challenges with Training: Finetuning pretrained LLMs doesn't enhance reasoning capabilities. While creating a larger LLM can bolster its problem-solving skills, the process can span several months to a year, potentially leading to a two-year wait before its official launch.
 
Closed Model and RAG: LLMs, once trained, are unable to fetch real-time data and have inherent shortcomings. However, for Q&A tasks, leveraging an open-book method proves more effective. The aim is not to have an all-knowing model but one skilled in reasoning and utilizing tools.
 
LLM Agent Approach: We direct LLMs to break down intricate tasks, tackle individual sub-tasks, evaluate them, and make revisions of the strategy as needed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my last semester and we have to pick a topic related to big data analytics. Right now I have to prepare a proposal for my topic. My topic will have to do with something to ML and the medicinal field. 
 Current plan:
  
Get a dataset related to my topic. Right now its Parkinson's disease. My question is, for the dataset would I need a dataset with text data or would images of scans of the brain be better for detecting say early detection be better? I cant figure out which would be the better dataset.
 
Get the dataset and then use Azure machine learning to prepare my dataset and do some data cleaning and handling and then get a model out of it. I picked azure because I have azure license from my uni and after searching about, I read about the azure machine learning service. Would azure be a good choice for training my model on this task? I've mostly used google colab for training small models. 
 
Once the model is trained and setup. I want to setup a front end web app (flask) and then setup my model so that users can upload either text data or image scans and then model would output results regarding the inputted data. My question is, would it be ideal to have the model located on my local machine or would azure let me do api calls between my local to the azure trained model? 
 
 Would all this be feasible to do? I'm not looking to develop a full fledge application, just want to create a model with a dataset of images or text and then be able to feed new images to the trained model and get an output. 
 Just looking for opinions or advice on this topic.
 Thanks.

So let’s say you finish a PhD in the field of medical machine learning (non-CV), would an automotive company, FAANG, or e.g. DeepMind still like to hire you once you would like to switch your sub-field a bit? Or are you simply less desirable than a candidate without a PhD but more experience in CV?
 I am asking this because I would like to stay flexible as I have many ML sub-fields I want to work in, and I do not want to limit my options by pursuing a PhD in a topic that I don’t want work in for my entire life. For context, I do already have 2 years working experience as an AI engineer and I am finishing my AI master’s.

I've secured millions from investors for my past startups and had notable success with a video app that gathered 4M users and $300k in revenue. However, due to the intense competition in the video app editing sector, my team and I couldn't turn a profit.
 After my last startup faltered during the covid period, I transitioned to being a full-time product-market fit and growth marketing consultant and have made really great money doing it. I assist new startups in avoiding the mistakes I made and implement frameworks that significantly increase their chances of success.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm planning on creating my own AI voice to use with ChatGPT. I have done my research, and there are two ways to achieve a quality TTS model to use. I have tried them both. I fine-tuned tortoise tts on my own 20-minute dataset. I have also tried to create a model using Tacotron2 and the dataset. The quality of the fine-tuned model is better. But one downside is that I still have to give the fine-tuned tortoise model a reference voice for it to choose the voice that I fine-tuned it with. On the other hand, the trained model didn't need to. The question here is: why didn't the tortoise model choose the voice in the dataset as the default? Do I need to expand my dataset for it to be chosen as the main voice?

 Thank all.

However, experts have pointed out that the image does not show any signs of being created by AI.
 
The idea that the image is AI-generated has spread on Twitter, suggesting that official Israeli accounts are spreading AI-generated misinformation.
 
AI image generators have trouble replicating reality accurately, and the shadows in the photograph are consistent with a real image.
 
Multiple AI image detection tools have also determined that the image is not AI-generated.

 When I load the model it shows the structure with the Lora_A and Lora_B for every layer, but it now acts like the base model with no changes. Is it possible I saved wrong or likely that I am loading wrong?

 However, I'm interested in finding the best RL algorithm for a simpler case. I have an input I and a policy P. P outputs probabilities for available choices (a limited set of integers), and a reward r is given for each choice (the reward is costly to compute that’s why I use RL). The goal is to train P to maximize the reward.
 So as if we are in a game that ends after only one choice. Any recommendations for the best RL algorithm in this case?
 Thanks!

 I hope this post finds you well. I've been delving deeper into the world of AI code generation recently and am curious to discover if there are communities or platforms specifically dedicated to open-source AI code generation models. I'm aware of hugging face but is there any other besides that.
 Here's what I'm looking for:
  
Collaboration: A space where enthusiasts and experts alike can collaborate on projects, share insights, and improve upon existing models.
 Discussion: Forums or chat platforms where discussions around the challenges, breakthroughs, and best practices in AI code generation take place.
 Resource Sharing: A repository or platform where open-source models, datasets, and related tools can be freely shared and accessed.
 Learning and Tutorials: Any resources that can help newcomers grasp the concepts and intricacies of AI code generation.
 If you know of any such community or are part of one, please do let me know.

I was planning on starting a PhD studying NLP and applied to 12 mid level schools. However, I was unfortunately rejected from all the schools I applied to. I suspect it was likely due to my lack of experience in NLP research as my school didn't have any professors who do research in that area. 
 My current plan is to work in industry for the next two years and try and do some NLP research on the side before reapplying. Do any NLP labs allow for external volunteer researchers? Besides that, are there any other ways to get research experience?

 not sure if extremely trivial or really tricky.
 In the end, I want a machine that generates a time series without further input based on training data, generating a new time series every time.
 I want this to be based on a transformer.
 I want it trained with data looking like this:
 2023-07-03 14:19:48,GOOD 2023-07-04 13:59:07,GOOD 2023-07-05 01:58:54,GOOD 2023-07-05 03:30:05,BAD 2023-07-05 05:17:43,BAD 2023-07-06 05:35:34,GOOD 2023-07-07 14:06:03,GOOD 2023-07-08 21:16:05,BAD 
 with “GOOD” and “BAD” being the state of the system which is likely dependent on the time series data up to that point. I have a lot of data and it’s data points like the one above with maybe a hundred rows of data on average for a few thousand systems. Every system is independent of all others but all are identical.
 I do not want to train only on “GOOD” as this would leave out a lot of valuable data …
 Is there a way to train a time series transformer with both data that leads to GOOD as well as BAD outcomes, so it would generate time series from scratch that are unlikely to have BAD outcomes?
 Thank you!!

predicting their binding structures is a critical yet challenging task in drug
discovery. Recent advancements in deep learning have shown promise in
addressing this challenge, with sampling-based and regression-based methods
emerging as two prominent approaches. However, these methods have notable
limitations. Sampling-based methods often suffer from low efficiency due to the
need for generating multiple candidate structures for selection. On the other
hand, regression-based methods offer fast predictions but may experience
decreased accuracy. Additionally, the variation in protein sizes often requires
external modules for selecting suitable binding pockets, further impacting
efficiency. In this work, we propose $\mathbf{FABind}$, an end-to-end model
that combines pocket prediction and docking to achieve accurate and fast
protein-ligand binding. $\mathbf{FABind}$ incorporates a unique ligand-informed
pocket prediction module, which is also leveraged for docking pose estimation.
The model further enhances the docking process by incrementally integrating the
predicted pocket to optimize protein-ligand binding, reducing discrepancies
between training and inference. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets, our proposed $\mathbf{FABind}$ demonstrates strong advantages in
terms of effectiveness and efficiency compared to existing methods. Our code is

in the temporal knowledge graph (tKG) domain, where conventional carefully
designed embedding-based and rule-based models dominate. The question remains
open of whether pre-trained LLMs can understand structured temporal relational
data and replace them as the foundation model for temporal relational
forecasting. Therefore, we bring temporal knowledge forecasting into the
generative setting. However, challenges occur in the huge chasms between
complex temporal graph data structure and sequential natural expressions LLMs
can handle, and between the enormous data sizes of tKGs and heavy computation
costs of finetuning LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
retrieval augmented generation framework that performs generative forecasting
on tKGs named GenTKG, which combines a temporal logical rule-based retrieval
strategy and lightweight parameter-efficient instruction tuning. Extensive
experiments have shown that GenTKG outperforms conventional methods of temporal
relational forecasting under low computation resources. GenTKG also highlights
remarkable transferability with exceeding performance on unseen datasets

small-scale problem instances, the LEHD model can generate nearly optimal
solutions for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Capacitated Vehicle
Routing Problem (CVRP) with up to 1000 nodes, and also generalizes well to
solve real-world TSPLib and CVRPLib problems. These results confirm our

independent Gaussian distributions can be tuned to criticality, which prevents
the exponential growth or decay of signals propagating through the network.
However, such networks still exhibit fluctuations that grow linearly with the
depth of the network, which may impair the training of networks with width
comparable to depth. We show analytically that rectangular networks with tanh
activations and weights initialized from the ensemble of orthogonal matrices
have corresponding preactivation fluctuations which are independent of depth,
to leading order in inverse width. Moreover, we demonstrate numerically that,
at initialization, all correlators involving the neural tangent kernel (NTK)
and its descendants at leading order in inverse width -- which govern the
evolution of observables during training -- saturate at a depth of $\sim 20$,
rather than growing without bound as in the case of Gaussian initializations.
We speculate that this structure preserves finite-width feature learning while
reducing overall noise, thus improving both generalization and training speed.
We provide some experimental justification by relating empirical measurements
of the NTK to the superior performance of deep nonlinear orthogonal networks
trained under full-batch gradient descent on the MNIST and CIFAR-10
classification tasks.]]></summary>

solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs), have shown
considerable promise for future scientific computing. However, the mainstream
of training neural operators is still data-driven, which needs an expensive
ground-truth dataset from various sources (e.g., solving PDEs' samples with the
conventional solvers, real-world experiments) in addition to training stage
costs. From a computational perspective, marrying operator learning and
specific domain knowledge to solve PDEs is an essential step in reducing
dataset costs and label-free learning. We propose a novel paradigm that
provides a unified framework of training neural operators and solving PDEs with
the variational form, which we refer to as the variational operator learning
(VOL). Ritz and Galerkin approach with finite element discretization are
developed for VOL to achieve matrix-free approximation of system functional and
residual, then direct minimization and iterative update are proposed as two
optimization strategies for VOL. Various types of experiments based on
reasonable benchmarks about variable heat source, Darcy flow, and variable
stiffness elasticity are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of VOL.
With a label-free training set and a 5-label-only shift set, VOL learns
solution operators with its test errors decreasing in a power law with respect
to the amount of unlabeled data. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is
the first study that integrates the perspectives of the weak form and efficient
iterative methods for solving sparse linear systems into the end-to-end
operator learning task.]]></summary>

substantial efforts and computational cost. Here, we propose a generative

the existing ML models with 3D geometries in terms of both accuracy and
efficiency. Moreover, it enables to sample various TS conformations, because it
learned the distribution of TS geometries for diverse reactions in training.
Thus, TSDiff was able to find more favorable reaction pathways with lower
barrier heights than those in the reference database. These results demonstrate
that TSDiff shows promising potential for an efficient and reliable TS

and demonstrated impressive capabilities in various tasks. Unfortunately, they
are prone to hallucinations, where the model exposes incorrect or false
information in its responses, which renders diligent evaluation approaches
mandatory. While LLM performance in specific knowledge fields is often
evaluated based on question and answer (Q&A) datasets, such evaluations usually
report only a single accuracy number for the dataset, which often covers an
entire field. This field-based evaluation, is problematic with respect to
transparency and model improvement. A stratified evaluation could instead
reveal subfields, where hallucinations are more likely to occur and thus help
to better assess LLMs' risks and guide their further development. To support
such stratified evaluations, we propose LLMMaps as a novel visualization
technique that enables users to evaluate LLMs' performance with respect to Q&A
datasets. LLMMaps provide detailed insights into LLMs' knowledge capabilities
in different subfields, by transforming Q&A datasets as well as LLM responses
into an internal knowledge structure. An extension for comparative
visualization furthermore, allows for the detailed comparison of multiple LLMs.
To assess LLMMaps we use them to conduct a comparative analysis of several
state-of-the-art LLMs, such as BLOOM, GPT-2, GPT-3, ChatGPT and LLaMa-13B, as
well as two qualitative user evaluations. All necessary source code and data

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper introduces a novel model-agnostic algorithm called adaptive
ensemble batch multi-input multi-output conformalized quantile regression
(AEnbMIMOCQR} that enables forecasters to generate multi-step ahead prediction
intervals for a fixed pre-specified miscoverage rate in a distribution-free
manner. Our method is grounded on conformal prediction principles, however, it
does not require data splitting and provides close to exact coverage even when
the data is not exchangeable. Moreover, the resulting prediction intervals,
besides being empirically valid along the forecast horizon, do not neglect
heteroscedasticity. AEnbMIMOCQR is designed to be robust to distribution
shifts, which means that its prediction intervals remain reliable over an
unlimited period of time, without entailing retraining or imposing unrealistic
strict assumptions on the data-generating process. Through methodically
experimentation, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms other competitive
methods on both real-world and synthetic datasets. The code used in the
experimental part and a tutorial on how to use AEnbMIMOCQR can be found at the

spurious correlations between features due to the amount of training data or
its limited feature coverage. This can lead to RL agents encoding these
misleading correlations in their latent representation, preventing the agent
from generalising if the correlation changes within the environment or when
deployed in the real world. Disentangled representations can improve
robustness, but existing disentanglement techniques that minimise mutual
information between features require independent features, thus they cannot
disentangle correlated features. We propose an auxiliary task for RL algorithms
that learns a disentangled representation of high-dimensional observations with
correlated features by minimising the conditional mutual information between
features in the representation. We demonstrate experimentally, using continuous
control tasks, that our approach improves generalisation under correlation
shifts, as well as improving the training performance of RL algorithms in the
presence of correlated features.]]></summary>

directly represent tasks through an abstract but versatile graph structure and
handle inputs of different sizes. This opens up the possibility for scaling and
extrapolation to larger graphs, one of the most important advantages of an
algorithm. However, this raises two core questions i) How can we enable nodes
to gather the required information in a given graph ($\textit{information
exchange}$), even if is far away and ii) How can we design an execution
framework which enables this information exchange for extrapolation to larger
graph sizes ($\textit{algorithmic alignment for extrapolation}$). We propose a
new execution framework that is inspired by the design principles of
distributed algorithms: Flood and Echo Net. It propagates messages through the
entire graph in a wave like activation pattern, which naturally generalizes to
larger instances. Through its sparse but parallel activations it is provably
more efficient in terms of message complexity. We study the proposed model and
provide both empirical evidence and theoretical insights in terms of its
expressiveness, efficiency, information exchange and ability to extrapolate.]]></summary>

made a paradigm shift in the realm of artificial intelligence (AI) towards
generative AI-based systems. In unison, from data communication and networking
perspective, AI and machine learning (AI/ML) algorithms are envisioned to be
pervasively incorporated into the future generations of wireless communications
systems, highlighting the need for novel AI-native solutions for the emergent
communication scenarios. In this article, we outline the applications of
generative AI in wireless communication systems to lay the foundations for
research in this field. Diffusion-based generative models, as the new
state-of-the-art paradigm of generative models, are introduced, and their
applications in wireless communication systems are discussed. Two case studies
are also presented to showcase how diffusion models can be exploited for the
development of resilient AI-native communication systems. Specifically, we
propose denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) for a wireless
communication scheme with non-ideal transceivers, where 30% improvement is
achieved in terms of bit error rate. As the second application, DDPMs are
employed at the transmitter to shape the constellation symbols, highlighting a
robust out-of-distribution performance. Finally, future directions and open
issues for the development of generative AI-based wireless systems are
discussed to promote future research endeavors towards wireless generative AI
(WiGenAI).]]></summary>

learning performance in classification tasks. Specifically, we redefine the
cross-entropy loss to effectively address class-level noise conditions,
including the challenging problem of class imbalance. Our approach introduces
aggregation operators, leveraging the power of fuzzy logic to improve
classification accuracy. The rationale behind our proposed method lies in the
iterative up-weighting of class-level components within the loss function,
focusing on those with larger errors. To achieve this, we employ the ordered
weighted average (OWA) operator and combine it with an adaptive scheme for
gradient-based learning. Through extensive experimentation, our method
outperforms other commonly used loss functions, such as the standard
cross-entropy or focal loss, across various binary and multiclass
classification tasks. Furthermore, we explore the influence of hyperparameters
associated with the OWA operators and present a default configuration that
performs well across different experimental settings.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most packages for the analysis of fMRI-based functional connectivity (FC) and
genomic data are used with a programming language interface, lacking an
easy-to-navigate GUI frontend. This exacerbates two problems found in these
types of data: demographic confounds and quality control in the face of high
dimensionality of features. The reason is that it is too slow and cumbersome to
use a programming interface to create all the necessary visualizations required
to identify all correlations, confounding effects, or quality control problems
in a dataset. To remedy this situation, we have developed ImageNomer, a data
visualization and analysis tool that allows inspection of both subject-level
and cohort-level demographic, genomic, and imaging features. The software is
Python-based, runs in a self-contained Docker image, and contains a
browser-based GUI frontend. We demonstrate the usefulness of ImageNomer by
identifying an unexpected race confound when predicting achievement scores in
the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) dataset. In the past, many
studies have attempted to use FC to identify achievement-related features in
fMRI. Using ImageNomer, we find a clear potential for confounding effects of
race. Using correlation analysis in the ImageNomer software, we show that FCs
correlated with Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT) score are in fact more
highly correlated with race. Investigating further, we find that whereas both
FC and SNP (genomic) features can account for 10-15\% of WRAT score variation,
this predictive ability disappears when controlling for race. In this work, we
demonstrate the advantage of our ImageNomer GUI tool in data exploration and
confound detection. Additionally, this work identifies race as a strong
confound in FC data and casts doubt on the possibility of finding unbiased
achievement-related features in fMRI and SNP data of healthy adolescents.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been extremely successful in
generating samples, from seemingly high dimensional probability measures.
However, these methods struggle to capture the temporal dependence of joint
probability distributions induced by time-series data. Furthermore, long
time-series data streams hugely increase the dimension of the target space,
which may render generative modelling infeasible. To overcome these challenges,
motivated by the autoregressive models in econometric, we are interested in the
conditional distribution of future time series given the past information. We
propose the generic conditional Sig-WGAN framework by integrating
Wasserstein-GANs (WGANs) with mathematically principled and efficient path
feature extraction called the signature of a path. The signature of a path is a
graded sequence of statistics that provides a universal description for a
stream of data, and its expected value characterises the law of the time-series
model. In particular, we develop the conditional Sig-$W_1$ metric, that
captures the conditional joint law of time series models, and use it as a
discriminator. The signature feature space enables the explicit representation
of the proposed discriminators which alleviates the need for expensive
training. We validate our method on both synthetic and empirical dataset and
observe that our method consistently and significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art benchmarks with respect to measures of similarity and
predictive ability.]]></summary>

suffer from the so-called optimizer's curse that causes an over-optimistic
evaluation of the solution performance. We argue that a special type of
distributionallly robust optimization (DRO) formulation offers theoretical
advantages in correcting for this optimizer's curse compared to simple
``margin'' adjustments to SAA and other DRO approaches: It attains a
statistical bound on the out-of-sample performance, for a wide class of
objective functions and distributions, that is nearly tightest in terms of
exponential decay rate. This DRO uses an ambiguity set based on a Kullback
Leibler (KL) divergence smoothed by the Wasserstein or L\'evy-Prokhorov (LP)
distance via a suitable distance optimization. Computationally, we also show
that such a DRO, and its generalized versions using smoothed $f$-divergence,
are not harder than DRO problems based on $f$-divergence or Wasserstein
distances, rendering our DRO formulations both statistically optimal and

perform in-context learning? In this empirical study, we take the first steps
towards answering this question. In particular, we evaluate fifteen model
architectures across a suite of synthetic in-context learning tasks. The
selected architectures represent a broad range of paradigms, including
recurrent and convolution-based neural networks, transformers, and emerging
attention alternatives. We discover that all considered architectures can
perform in-context learning under certain conditions. However, contemporary
architectures are found to be the best performing, especially as task
complexity grows. Additionally, our follow-up experiments delve into various
factors that influence in-context learning. We observe varied sensitivities
among architectures with respect to hyperparameter settings. Our study of
training dynamics reveals that certain architectures exhibit a smooth,
progressive learning trajectory, while others demonstrate periods of stagnation
followed by abrupt mastery of the task. Finally, and somewhat surprisingly, we
find that several emerging attention alternatives are more robust in-context
learners than transformers; since such approaches have constant-sized memory
footprints at inference time, this result opens the future possibility of
scaling up in-context learning to vastly larger numbers of in-context examples.]]></summary>

novel latent factor model that takes into account network interference and
generalizes the factor models typically used in panel data settings. We propose
an estimator, Network Synthetic Interventions (NSI), and show that it
consistently estimates the mean outcomes for a unit under an arbitrary set of
counterfactual treatments for the network. We further establish that the
estimator is asymptotically normal. We furnish two validity tests for whether
the NSI estimator reliably generalizes to produce accurate counterfactual
estimates. We provide a novel graph-based experiment design that guarantees the
NSI estimator produces accurate counterfactual estimates, and also analyze the
sample complexity of the proposed design. We conclude with simulations that
corroborate our theoretical findings.]]></summary>

landmark approaches along several main characteristics that underline this
research paradigm, including neural-symbolic integration, knowledge

discuss the successful application of modern NeSy approaches in several

a video of an ongoing procedural activity, we predict a plausible next
procedure step described in rich natural language. While most previous work
focus on the problem of data scarcity in procedural video datasets, another
core challenge of future anticipation is how to account for multiple plausible
future realizations in natural settings. This problem has been largely
overlooked in previous work. To address this challenge, we frame future step
prediction as modelling the distribution of all possible candidates for the
next step. Specifically, we design a generative model that takes a series of
video clips as input, and generates multiple plausible and diverse candidates
(in natural language) for the next step. Following previous work, we side-step
the video annotation scarcity by pretraining our model on a large text-based
corpus of procedural activities, and then transfer the model to the video
domain. Our experiments, both in textual and video domains, show that our model
captures diversity in the next step prediction and generates multiple plausible
future predictions. Moreover, our model establishes new state-of-the-art
results on YouCookII, where it outperforms existing baselines on the next step
anticipation. Finally, we also show that our model can successfully transfer
from text to the video domain zero-shot, ie, without fine-tuning or adaptation,
and produces good-quality future step predictions from video.]]></summary>

relationships between objects, enabling various Web applications. Daily
influxes of unlabeled graph data on the Web offer immense potential for these
applications. Graph self-supervised algorithms have achieved significant
success in acquiring generic knowledge from abundant unlabeled graph data.
These pre-trained models can be applied to various downstream Web applications,
saving training time and improving downstream (target) performance. However,
different graphs, even across seemingly similar domains, can differ
significantly in terms of attribute semantics, posing difficulties, if not
infeasibility, for transferring the pre-trained models to downstream tasks.
Concretely speaking, for example, the additional task-specific node information
in downstream tasks (specificity) is usually deliberately omitted so that the
pre-trained representation (transferability) can be leveraged. The trade-off as
such is termed as "transferability-specificity dilemma" in this work. To
address this challenge, we introduce an innovative deployment module coined as
GraphControl, motivated by ControlNet, to realize better graph domain transfer
learning. Specifically, by leveraging universal structural pre-trained models
and GraphControl, we align the input space across various graphs and
incorporate unique characteristics of target data as conditional inputs. These
conditions will be progressively integrated into the model during fine-tuning
or prompt tuning through ControlNet, facilitating personalized deployment.
Extensive experiments show that our method significantly enhances the
adaptability of pre-trained models on target attributed datasets, achieving
1.4-3x performance gain. Furthermore, it outperforms training-from-scratch
methods on target data with a comparable margin and exhibits faster

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Large vision-language models have achieved outstanding performance, but their
size and computational requirements make their deployment on
resource-constrained devices and time-sensitive tasks impractical. Model
distillation, the process of creating smaller, faster models that maintain the
performance of larger models, is a promising direction towards the solution.
This paper investigates the distillation of visual representations in large
teacher vision-language models into lightweight student models using a small-
or mid-scale dataset. Notably, this study focuses on open-vocabulary
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, a challenging problem that has been
overlooked in previous model distillation literature. We propose two principles
from vision and language modality perspectives to enhance student's OOD
generalization: (1) by better imitating teacher's visual representation space,
and carefully promoting better coherence in vision-language alignment with the
teacher; (2) by enriching the teacher's language representations with
informative and finegrained semantic attributes to effectively distinguish
between different labels. We propose several metrics and conduct extensive
experiments to investigate their techniques. The results demonstrate
significant improvements in zero-shot and few-shot student performance on
open-vocabulary out-of-distribution classification, highlighting the
effectiveness of our proposed approaches. Poster:

robotic agents, learning from the plethora of unlabeled video demonstration
data available on the Internet necessitates imitating the expert without access
to its action, presenting a challenge known as Imitation Learning from
Observations (ILfO). A common approach to tackle ILfO problems is to convert
them into inverse reinforcement learning problems, utilizing a proxy reward
computed from the agent's and the expert's observations. Nonetheless, we
identify that tasks characterized by a progress dependency property pose
significant challenges for such approaches; in these tasks, the agent needs to
initially learn the expert's preceding behaviors before mastering the
subsequent ones. Our investigation reveals that the main cause is that the
reward signals assigned to later steps hinder the learning of initial
behaviors. To address this challenge, we present a novel ILfO framework that
enables the agent to master earlier behaviors before advancing to later ones.
We introduce an Automatic Discount Scheduling (ADS) mechanism that adaptively
alters the discount factor in reinforcement learning during the training phase,
prioritizing earlier rewards initially and gradually engaging later rewards
only when the earlier behaviors have been mastered. Our experiments, conducted
on nine Meta-World tasks, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across all tasks, including those that are unsolvable
by them.]]></summary>

various voices to convey diverse information. Compared to traditional
text-to-speech (TTS) methods relying on speech prompts (reference speech) for
voice variability, using text prompts (descriptions) is more user-friendly
since speech prompts can be hard to find or may not exist at all. TTS
approaches based on the text prompt face two main challenges: 1) the
one-to-many problem, where not all details about voice variability can be
described in the text prompt, and 2) the limited availability of text prompt
datasets, where vendors and large cost of data labeling are required to write
text prompts for speech. In this work, we introduce PromptTTS 2 to address
these challenges with a variation network to provide variability information of
voice not captured by text prompts, and a prompt generation pipeline to utilize
the large language models (LLM) to compose high quality text prompts.
Specifically, the variation network predicts the representation extracted from
the reference speech (which contains full information about voice variability)
based on the text prompt representation. For the prompt generation pipeline, it
generates text prompts for speech with a speech language understanding model to
recognize voice attributes (e.g., gender, speed) from speech and a large
language model to formulate text prompts based on the recognition results.
Experiments on a large-scale (44K hours) speech dataset demonstrate that
compared to the previous works, PromptTTS 2 generates voices more consistent
with text prompts and supports the sampling of diverse voice variability,
thereby offering users more choices on voice generation. Additionally, the
prompt generation pipeline produces high-quality text prompts, eliminating the
large labeling cost. The demo page of PromptTTS 2 is available online.]]></summary>

with mixed boundary conditions. The Poisson equation is ubiquitous in
scientific computing: it governs a wide array of physical phenomena, arises as
a subproblem in many numerical algorithms, and serves as a model problem for
the broader class of elliptic PDEs. The most popular Poisson discretizations
yield large sparse linear systems. At high resolution, and for
performance-critical applications, iterative solvers can be advantageous for
these -- but only when paired with powerful preconditioners. The core of our
solver is a neural network trained to approximate the inverse of a discrete
structured-grid Laplace operator for a domain of arbitrary shape and with mixed
boundary conditions. The structure of this problem motivates a novel network
architecture that we demonstrate is highly effective as a preconditioner even
for boundary conditions outside the training set. We show that on challenging
test cases arising from an incompressible fluid simulation, our method
outperforms state-of-the-art solvers like algebraic multigrid as well as some
recent neural preconditioners.]]></summary>

with deep learning. While achieving state-of-the-art results, the
best-performing architectures vary highly across applications and domains.
Meanwhile, for natural language processing, the Generative Pre-trained
Transformer (GPT) has demonstrated impressive performance via training one
general-purpose model across various textual datasets. It is intriguing to
explore whether GPT-type architectures can be effective for time series,
capturing the intrinsic dynamic attributes and leading to significant accuracy
improvements. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, TEMPO, that can
effectively learn time series representations. We focus on utilizing two
essential inductive biases of the time series task for pre-trained models: (i)
decomposition of the complex interaction between trend, seasonal and residual
components; and (ii) introducing the selection-based prompts to facilitate
distribution adaptation in non-stationary time series. TEMPO expands the
capability for dynamically modeling real-world temporal phenomena from data
within diverse domains. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of
TEMPO over state-of-the-art methods on a number of time series benchmark
datasets. This performance gain is observed not only in standard supervised
learning settings but also in scenarios involving previously unseen datasets as
well as in scenarios with multi-modal inputs. This compelling finding
highlights TEMPO's potential to constitute a foundational model-building

for these time series are required to be coherent, that is, to satisfy the

coherence is called reconciliation, which adjusts the base forecasts computed
for each time series. However, recent works on probabilistic reconciliation
present several limitations. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on
conditioning to reconcile any type of forecast distribution. We then introduce
a new algorithm, called Bottom-Up Importance Sampling, to efficiently sample
from the reconciled distribution. It can be used for any base forecast

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lion (Evolved Sign Momentum), a new optimizer discovered through program
search, has shown promising results in training large AI models. It performs
comparably or favorably to AdamW but with greater memory efficiency. As we can
expect from the results of a random search program, Lion incorporates elements
from several existing algorithms, including signed momentum, decoupled weight
decay, Polak, and Nesterov momentum, but does not fit into any existing
category of theoretically grounded optimizers. Thus, even though Lion appears
to perform well as a general-purpose optimizer for a wide range of tasks, its
theoretical basis remains uncertain. This lack of theoretical clarity limits
opportunities to further enhance and expand Lion's efficacy.

This work aims to demystify Lion. Based on both continuous-time and
discrete-time analysis, we demonstrate that Lion is a theoretically novel and
principled approach for minimizing a general loss function $f(x)$ while
enforcing a bound constraint $\|x\|_\infty \leq 1/\lambda$. Lion achieves this
through the incorporation of decoupled weight decay, where $\lambda$ represents
the weight decay coefficient. Our analysis is made possible by the development
of a new Lyapunov function for the Lion updates. It applies to a broader family
of Lion-$\kappa$ algorithms, where the $\text{sign}(\cdot)$ operator in Lion is
replaced by the subgradient of a convex function $\kappa$, leading to the
solution of a general composite optimization problem of $\min_x f(x) +
\kappa^*(x)$. Our findings provide valuable insights into the dynamics of Lion
and pave the way for further improvements and extensions of Lion-related
algorithms.]]></summary>

collaborative model training without direct data sharing. However, the vast
disparity in local data distributions among clients, often termed the
non-Independent Identically Distributed (non-IID) challenge, poses a
significant hurdle to FL's generalization efficacy. The scenario becomes even
more complex when not all clients participate in the training process, a common
occurrence due to unstable network connections or limited computational
capacities. This can greatly complicate the assessment of the trained models'
generalization abilities. While a plethora of recent studies has centered on
the generalization gap pertaining to unseen data from participating clients
with diverse distributions, the divergence between the training distributions
of participating clients and the testing distributions of non-participating
ones has been largely overlooked. In response, our paper unveils an
information-theoretic generalization framework for FL. Specifically, it
quantifies generalization errors by evaluating the information entropy of local
distributions and discerning discrepancies across these distributions. Inspired
by our deduced generalization bounds, we introduce a weighted aggregation
approach and a duo of client selection strategies. These innovations aim to
bolster FL's generalization prowess by encompassing a more varied set of client
data distributions. Our extensive empirical evaluations reaffirm the potency of
our proposed methods, aligning seamlessly with our theoretical construct.]]></summary>

independent learners process data privately. Its goal is to create a robust and
accurate model by aggregating and retraining local models over multiple rounds.
However, FL faces challenges regarding data heterogeneity and model aggregation
effectiveness. In order to simulate real-world data, researchers use methods
for data partitioning that transform a dataset designated for centralized
learning into a group of sub-datasets suitable for distributed machine learning
with different data heterogeneity. In this paper, we study the currently
popular data partitioning techniques and visualize their main disadvantages:
the lack of precision in the data diversity, which leads to unreliable
heterogeneity indexes, and the inability to incrementally challenge the FL
algorithms. To resolve this problem, we propose a method that leverages entropy
and symmetry to construct 'the most challenging' and controllable data
distributions with gradual difficulty. We introduce a metric to measure data
heterogeneity among the learning agents and a transformation technique that
divides any dataset into splits with precise data diversity. Through a
comparative study, we demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
FL data partitioning approaches, showcasing its potential to challenge model
aggregation algorithms. Experimental results indicate that our approach
gradually challenges the FL strategies, and the models trained on FedSym
distributions are more distinct.]]></summary>

natural language understanding across various domains, including healthcare and
finance. For some tasks, LLMs achieve similar or better performance than
trained human beings, therefore it is reasonable to employ human exams (e.g.,
certification tests) to assess the performance of LLMs. We present a
comprehensive evaluation of popular LLMs, such as Llama 2 and GPT, on their
ability to answer agriculture-related questions. In our evaluation, we also
employ RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and ER (Ensemble Refinement)
techniques, which combine information retrieval, generation capabilities, and
prompting strategies to improve the LLMs' performance. To demonstrate the
capabilities of LLMs, we selected agriculture exams and benchmark datasets from
three of the largest agriculture producer countries: Brazil, India, and the
USA. Our analysis highlights GPT-4's ability to achieve a passing score on
exams to earn credits for renewing agronomist certifications, answering 93% of
the questions correctly and outperforming earlier general-purpose models, which
achieved 88% accuracy. On one of our experiments, GPT-4 obtained the highest
performance when compared to human subjects. This performance suggests that
GPT-4 could potentially pass on major graduate education admission tests or
even earn credits for renewing agronomy certificates. We also explore the
models' capacity to address general agriculture-related questions and generate
crop management guidelines for Brazilian and Indian farmers, utilizing robust
datasets from the Brazilian Agency of Agriculture (Embrapa) and graduate
program exams from India. The results suggest that GPT-4, ER, and RAG can
contribute meaningfully to agricultural education, assessment, and crop
management practice, offering valuable insights to farmers and agricultural

continuous function, i.e., a coordinate-based neural network, to represent
multiple data instances by modulating its weights or intermediate features
using latent codes. However, the expressive power of the state-of-the-art
modulation is limited due to its inability to localize and capture fine-grained
details of data entities such as specific pixels and rays. To address this
issue, we propose a novel framework for generalizable INR that combines a
transformer encoder with a locality-aware INR decoder. The transformer encoder
predicts a set of latent tokens from a data instance to encode local
information into each latent token. The locality-aware INR decoder extracts a
modulation vector by selectively aggregating the latent tokens via
cross-attention for a coordinate input and then predicts the output by
progressively decoding with coarse-to-fine modulation through multiple
frequency bandwidths. The selective token aggregation and the multi-band
feature modulation enable us to learn locality-aware representation in spatial
and spectral aspects, respectively. Our framework significantly outperforms
previous generalizable INRs and validates the usefulness of the locality-aware
latents for downstream tasks such as image generation.]]></summary>

is that adversaries can extract information about the training data using

proven to be challenging. We propose a rather easy yet effective defense based
on backdoor attacks to remove private information such as names of individuals
from models, and focus in this work on text encoders. Specifically, through
strategic insertion of backdoors, we align the embeddings of sensitive phrases
with those of neutral terms-"a person" instead of the person's name. Our
empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our backdoor-based defense
on CLIP by assessing its performance using a specialized privacy attack for
zero-shot classifiers. Our approach provides not only a new "dual-use"

search models for software development efficiency and effectiveness. It pulls
together positive code snippets while pushing negative samples away given
search queries. Among contrastive learning, InfoNCE is the most widely used
loss function due to its better performance. However, the following problems in
negative samples of InfoNCE may deteriorate its representation learning: 1) The
existence of false negative samples in large code corpora due to duplications.
2). The failure to explicitly differentiate between the potential relevance of
negative samples. As an example, a bubble sorting algorithm example is less
``negative'' than a file saving function for the quick sorting algorithm query.
In this paper, we tackle the above problems by proposing a simple yet effective
Soft-InfoNCE loss that inserts weight terms into InfoNCE. In our proposed loss
function, we apply three methods to estimate the weights of negative pairs and
show that the vanilla InfoNCE loss is a special case of Soft-InfoNCE.
Theoretically, we analyze the effects of Soft-InfoNCE on controlling the
distribution of learnt code representations and on deducing a more precise
mutual information estimation. We furthermore discuss the superiority of
proposed loss functions with other design alternatives. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of Soft-InfoNCE and weights estimation methods
under state-of-the-art code search models on a large-scale public dataset
consisting of six programming languages. Source code is available at

solve inverse problem of images, and it is easy to implement. However, these
techniques often generate heavy artifacts in image reconstruction. One of the
most popular refinement methods is to fine-tune the regularization parameter to
alleviate such artifacts, but it may not always be sufficient or applicable due
to increased computational costs. In this work, we propose a deep geometric
incremental learning framework based on the second Nesterov proximal gradient
optimization. The proposed end-to-end network not only has the powerful
learning ability for high-/low-frequency image features, but also can
theoretically guarantee that geometric texture details will be reconstructed
from preliminary linear reconstruction. Furthermore, it can avoid the risk of
intermediate reconstruction results falling outside the geometric decomposition
domains and achieve fast convergence. Our reconstruction framework is
decomposed into four modules including general linear reconstruction, cascade
geometric incremental restoration, Nesterov acceleration, and post-processing.
In the image restoration step, a cascade geometric incremental learning module
is designed to compensate for missing texture information from different
geometric spectral decomposition domains. Inspired by the overlap-tile
strategy, we also develop a post-processing module to remove the block effect
in patch-wise-based natural image reconstruction. All parameters in the
proposed model are learnable, an adaptive initialization technique of physical
parameters is also employed to make model flexibility and ensure converging
smoothly. We compare the reconstruction performance of the proposed method with
existing state-of-the-art methods to demonstrate its superiority. Our source

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Foundation models (FM) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide
range of tasks (especially in the fields of natural language processing and
computer vision), primarily attributed to their ability to comprehend
instructions and access extensive, high-quality data. This not only showcases
their current effectiveness but also sets a promising trajectory towards the
development of artificial general intelligence. Unfortunately, due to multiple
constraints, the raw data of the model used for large model training are often
inaccessible, so the use of end-to-end models for downstream tasks has become a
new research trend, which we call Learn From Model (LFM) in this article. LFM
focuses on the research, modification, and design of FM based on the model
interface, so as to better understand the model structure and weights (in a
black box environment), and to generalize the model to downstream tasks. The
study of LFM techniques can be broadly categorized into five major areas: model
tuning, model distillation, model reuse, meta learning and model editing. Each
category encompasses a repertoire of methods and strategies that aim to enhance
the capabilities and performance of FM. This paper gives a comprehensive review
of the current methods based on FM from the perspective of LFM, in order to
help readers better understand the current research status and ideas. To
conclude, we summarize the survey by highlighting several critical areas for
future exploration and addressing open issues that require further attention
from the research community. The relevant papers we investigated in this
article can be accessed at

candidates. However, if evaluation times vary significantly, many worker nodes
(i.e.,\ compute clients) are idle much of the time, waiting for the next
generation to be created. Evolutionary neural architecture search (ENAS), a
class of EAs that optimizes the architecture and hyperparameters of deep neural
networks, is particularly vulnerable to this issue. This paper proposes a
generic asynchronous evaluation strategy (AES) that is then adapted to work
with ENAS. AES increases throughput by maintaining a queue of up to $K$
individuals ready to be sent to the workers for evaluation and proceeding to
the next generation as soon as $M<<K$ individuals have been evaluated. A
suitable value for $M$ is determined experimentally, balancing diversity and
efficiency. To showcase the generality and power of AES, it was first evaluated
in eight-line sorting network design (a single-population optimization task
with limited evaluation-time variability), achieving an over two-fold speedup.
Next, it was evaluated in 11-bit multiplexer design (a single-population
discovery task with extended variability), where a 14-fold speedup was
observed. It was then scaled up to ENAS for image captioning (a
multi-population open-ended-optimization task), resulting in an over two-fold
speedup. In all problems, a multifold performance improvement was observed,
suggesting that AES is a promising method for parallelizing the evolution of
complex systems with long and variable evaluation times, such as those in ENAS.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prompt tuning (PT), where a small amount of trainable soft (continuous)
prompt vectors is affixed to the input of language models (LM), has shown
promising results across various tasks and models for parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT). PT stands out from other PEFT approaches because it
maintains competitive performance with fewer trainable parameters and does not
drastically scale up its parameters as the model size expands. However, PT
introduces additional soft prompt tokens, leading to longer input sequences,
which significantly impacts training and inference time and memory usage due to
the Transformer's quadratic complexity. Particularly concerning for Large
Language Models (LLMs) that face heavy daily querying. To address this issue,
we propose Decomposed Prompt Tuning (DePT), which decomposes the soft prompt
into a shorter soft prompt and a pair of low-rank matrices that are then
optimised with two different learning rates. This allows DePT to achieve better
performance while saving over 20% memory and time costs compared to vanilla PT
and its variants, without changing trainable parameter sizes. Through extensive
experiments on 23 natural language processing (NLP) and vision-language (VL)
tasks, we demonstrate that DePT outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT approaches,
including the full fine-tuning baseline in some scenarios. Additionally, we
empirically show that DEPT grows more efficient as the model size increases.
Our further study reveals that DePT integrates seamlessly with
parameter-efficient transfer learning in the few-shot learning setting and
highlights its adaptability to various model architectures and sizes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In practice, deep neural networks are often able to easily interpolate their
training data. To understand this phenomenon, many works have aimed to quantify
the memorization capacity of a neural network architecture: the largest number
of points such that the architecture can interpolate any placement of these
points with any assignment of labels. For real-world data, however, one
intuitively expects the presence of a benign structure so that interpolation
already occurs at a smaller network size than suggested by memorization
capacity. In this paper, we investigate interpolation by adopting an
instance-specific viewpoint. We introduce a simple randomized algorithm that,
given a fixed finite dataset with two classes, with high probability constructs
an interpolating three-layer neural network in polynomial time. The required
number of parameters is linked to geometric properties of the two classes and
their mutual arrangement. As a result, we obtain guarantees that are
independent of the number of samples and hence move beyond worst-case
memorization capacity bounds. We illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm
in non-pathological situations with extensive numerical experiments and link
the insights back to the theoretical results.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent empirical observation (Li et al., 2022b) of activation sparsity in
MLP blocks offers an opportunity to drastically reduce computation costs for
free. Although having attributed it to training dynamics, existing theoretical
explanations of activation sparsity are restricted to shallow networks, small
training steps and special training, despite its emergence in deep models
standardly trained for a large number of steps. To fill these gaps, we propose
the notion of gradient sparsity as one source of activation sparsity and a
theoretical explanation based on it that sees sparsity a necessary step to
adversarial robustness w.r.t. hidden features and parameters, which is
approximately the flatness of minima for well-learned models. The theory
applies to standardly trained LayerNorm-ed MLPs, and further to Transformers or
other architectures trained with weight noises. Eliminating other sources of
flatness except for sparsity, we discover the phenomenon that the ratio between
the largest and smallest non-zero singular values of weight matrices is small.
When discussing the emergence of this spectral concentration, we use random
matrix theory (RMT) as a powerful tool to analyze stochastic gradient noises.
Validational experiments are conducted to verify our gradient-sparsity-based
explanation. We propose two plug-and-play modules for both training and
finetuning for sparsity. Experiments on ImageNet-1k and C4 demonstrate their
50% sparsity improvements, indicating further potential cost reduction in both
training and inference.]]></summary>

representations exhibiting better continual and transfer learning. This
mechanism -- the repeated resetting of weights in the last layer, which we
nickname "zapping" -- was originally designed for a meta-continual-learning
procedure, yet we show it is surprisingly applicable in many settings beyond
both meta-learning and continual learning. In our experiments, we wish to
transfer a pre-trained image classifier to a new set of classes, in a few
shots. We show that our zapping procedure results in improved transfer accuracy
and/or more rapid adaptation in both standard fine-tuning and continual
learning settings, while being simple to implement and computationally
efficient. In many cases, we achieve performance on par with state of the art
meta-learning without needing the expensive higher-order gradients, by using a
combination of zapping and sequential learning. An intuitive explanation for
the effectiveness of this zapping procedure is that representations trained
with repeated zapping learn features that are capable of rapidly adapting to
newly initialized classifiers. Such an approach may be considered a
computationally cheaper type of, or alternative to, meta-learning rapidly
adaptable features with higher-order gradients. This adds to recent work on the
usefulness of resetting neural network parameters during training, and invites

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We propose to replace vector quantization (VQ) in the latent representation
of VQ-VAEs with a simple scheme termed finite scalar quantization (FSQ), where
we project the VAE representation down to a few dimensions (typically less than
10). Each dimension is quantized to a small set of fixed values, leading to an
(implicit) codebook given by the product of these sets. By appropriately
choosing the number of dimensions and values each dimension can take, we obtain
the same codebook size as in VQ. On top of such discrete representations, we
can train the same models that have been trained on VQ-VAE representations. For
example, autoregressive and masked transformer models for image generation,
multimodal generation, and dense prediction computer vision tasks. Concretely,
we employ FSQ with MaskGIT for image generation, and with UViM for depth
estimation, colorization, and panoptic segmentation. Despite the much simpler
design of FSQ, we obtain competitive performance in all these tasks. We
emphasize that FSQ does not suffer from codebook collapse and does not need the
complex machinery employed in VQ (commitment losses, codebook reseeding, code
splitting, entropy penalties, etc.) to learn expressive discrete
representations.]]></summary>

Despite recent success, most diffusion models are restricted in that they only
allow linear transformation of the data distribution. In contrast, broader
family of transformations can potentially help train generative distributions
more efficiently, simplifying the reverse process and closing the gap between
the true negative log-likelihood and the variational approximation. In this
paper, we present Neural Diffusion Models (NDMs), a generalization of
conventional diffusion models that enables defining and learning time-dependent
non-linear transformations of data. We show how to optimise NDMs using a
variational bound in a simulation-free setting. Moreover, we derive a
time-continuous formulation of NDMs, which allows fast and reliable inference
using off-the-shelf numerical ODE and SDE solvers. Finally, we demonstrate the
utility of NDMs with learnable transformations through experiments on standard
image generation benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, downsampled versions of
ImageNet and CelebA-HQ. NDMs outperform conventional diffusion models in terms
of likelihood and produce high-quality samples.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) and its variants are the best
algorithms so far for solving large-scale incomplete information games.
However, we believe that there are two problems with CFR: First, matrix
multiplication is required in CFR iteration, and the time complexity of one
iteration is too high; Secondly, the game characteristics in the real world are
different. Just using one CFR algorithm will not be perfectly suitable for all
game problems.

For these two problems, this paper proposes a new algorithm called Pure CFR
(PCFR) based on CFR. PCFR can be seen as a combination of CFR and Fictitious
Play (FP), inheriting the concept of counterfactual regret (value) from CFR,
and using the best response strategy instead of the regret matching strategy
for the next iteration. This algorithm has three advantages. First, PCFR can be
combined with any CFR variant. The resulting Pure MCCFR (PMCCFR) can
significantly reduce the time and space complexity of one iteration. Secondly,
our experiments show that the convergence speed of the PMCCFR is 2$\sim$3 times
that of the MCCFR. Finally, there is a type of game that is very suitable for
PCFR, we call this type of game clear-game, which is characterized by a high
proportion of dominated strategies. Experiments show that in clear-game, the
convergence rate of PMCCFR is two orders of magnitude higher than that of
MCCFR.]]></summary>

distribute machine learning tasks across edge devices, reducing the overhead in
terms of data storage and computational complexity compared to centralized

demands of several learning tasks while enabling new Artificial Intelligence of
Things (AIoT) applications. This paper proposes a framework for real-time
monitoring of the energy and carbon footprint impacts of FL systems. The carbon
tracking tool is evaluated for consensus (fully decentralized) and classical FL
policies. For the first time, we present a quantitative evaluation of different
computationally and communication efficient FL methods from the perspectives of
energy consumption and carbon equivalent emissions, suggesting also general
guidelines for energy-efficient design. Results indicate that consensus-driven
FL implementations should be preferred for limiting carbon emissions when the
energy efficiency of the communication is low (i.e., < 25 Kbit/Joule). Besides,
quantization and sparsification operations are shown to strike a balance

need for principled methods for defending networks against malicious actors.
Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach for
mitigating these attacks. However, while DRL has shown much potential for
cyber-defence, numerous challenges must be overcome before DRL can be applied
to autonomous cyber-operations (ACO) at scale. Principled methods are required
for environments that confront learners with very high-dimensional state
spaces, large multi-discrete action spaces, and adversarial learning. Recent
works have reported success in solving these problems individually. There have
also been impressive engineering efforts towards solving all three for
real-time strategy games. However, applying DRL to the full ACO problem remains
an open challenge. Here, we survey the relevant DRL literature and
conceptualize an idealised ACO-DRL agent. We provide: i.) A summary of the
domain properties that define the ACO problem; ii.) A comprehensive evaluation
of the extent to which domains used for benchmarking DRL approaches are
comparable to ACO; iii.) An overview of state-of-the-art approaches for scaling
DRL to domains that confront learners with the curse of dimensionality, and;
iv.) A survey and critique of current methods for limiting the exploitability
of agents within adversarial settings from the perspective of ACO. We conclude
with open research questions that we hope will motivate future directions for
researchers and practitioners working on ACO.]]></summary>

samples from a teacher to a probabilistic student classifier with input space
$\mathcal S$ over labels $\mathcal A$. We show that privileged information at
three progressive levels accelerates the transfer. At the first level, only
samples with hard labels are known, via which the maximum likelihood estimator
attains the minimax rate $\sqrt{{|{\mathcal S}||{\mathcal A}|}/{n}}$. The
second level has the teacher probabilities of sampled labels available in
addition, which turns out to boost the convergence rate lower bound to
${{|{\mathcal S}||{\mathcal A}|}/{n}}$. However, under this second data
acquisition protocol, minimizing a naive adaptation of the cross-entropy loss
results in an asymptotically biased student. We overcome this limitation and
achieve the fundamental limit by using a novel empirical variant of the squared
error logit loss. The third level further equips the student with the soft
labels (complete logits) on ${\mathcal A}$ given every sampled input, thereby
provably enables the student to enjoy a rate ${|{\mathcal S}|}/{n}$ free of
$|{\mathcal A}|$. We find any Kullback-Leibler divergence minimizer to be
optimal in the last case. Numerical simulations distinguish the four learners

generated environments presents a significant challenge. This requires an agent
to possess a broad range of abilities, including generalization and long-term
reasoning. Many prior methods have been built upon model-based or hierarchical
approaches, with the belief that an explicit module for long-term planning
would be advantageous for learning hierarchical dependencies. However, these
methods demand an excessive number of environment interactions or large model
sizes, limiting their practicality. In this work, we demonstrate that proximal
policy optimization (PPO), a simple yet versatile model-free algorithm,
outperforms previous methods when optimized with recent implementation
practices. Moreover, we find that the PPO agent can predict the next
achievement to be unlocked to some extent, albeit with limited confidence.
Based on this observation, we introduce a novel contrastive learning method,
called achievement distillation, which strengthens the agent's ability to
predict the next achievement. Our method exhibits a strong capacity for
discovering hierarchical achievements and shows state-of-the-art performance on
the challenging Crafter environment in a sample-efficient manner while
utilizing fewer model parameters.]]></summary>

denoted by X, lies in Euclidean space. This extends the concepts delineated in

indicating that no specific assumptions are imposed on the joint distribution
of $(X, Y)$, and they maintain a non-parametric character. We prove the

existing datasets of trajectories without collecting additional data. The
primary motivation for using reinforcement learning (RL) instead of supervised
learning techniques such as behavior cloning is to find a policy that achieves
a higher average return than the trajectories constituting the dataset.
However, we empirically find that when a dataset is dominated by suboptimal
trajectories, state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms do not substantially
improve over the average return of trajectories in the dataset. We argue this
is due to an assumption made by current offline RL algorithms of staying close
to the trajectories in the dataset. If the dataset primarily consists of
sub-optimal trajectories, this assumption forces the policy to mimic the
suboptimal actions. We overcome this issue by proposing a sampling strategy
that enables the policy to only be constrained to ``good data" rather than all
actions in the dataset (i.e., uniform sampling). We present a realization of
the sampling strategy and an algorithm that can be used as a plug-and-play
module in standard offline RL algorithms. Our evaluation demonstrates
significant performance gains in 72 imbalanced datasets, D4RL dataset, and
across three different offline RL algorithms. Code is available at

general-purpose skills that aim to reach diverse goals. In particular, offline
GCRL only requires purely pre-collected datasets to perform training tasks
without additional interactions with the environment. Although offline GCRL has
become increasingly prevalent and many previous works have demonstrated its
empirical success, the theoretical understanding of efficient offline GCRL
algorithms is not well established, especially when the state space is huge and
the offline dataset only covers the policy we aim to learn. In this paper, we
provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of an existing empirically successful
offline GCRL algorithm. We prove that under slight modification, this algorithm
enjoys an $\widetilde{O}(\text{poly}(1/\epsilon))$ sample complexity (where
$\epsilon$ is the desired suboptimality of the learned policy) with general
function approximation thanks to the property of (semi-)strong convexity of the
objective functions. We only require nearly minimal assumptions on the dataset
(single-policy concentrability) and the function class (realizability).
Moreover, this algorithm consists of two uninterleaved optimization steps,
which we refer to as $V$-learning and policy learning, and is computationally
stable since it does not involve minimax optimization. We also empirically
validate our theory by showing that the modified algorithm outperforms the
previous algorithm in various real-world environments. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first algorithm that is both provably efficient with
general function approximation and single-policy concentrability, and
empirically successful without requiring solving minimax optimization problems.]]></summary>

models that can lead to backdoored models. A description of the internal
mechanisms of backdoored language models and how they process trigger inputs,
e.g., when switching to toxic language, has yet to be found. In this work, we
study the internal representations of transformer-based backdoored language
models and determine early-layer MLP modules as most important for the backdoor
mechanism in combination with the initial embedding projection. We use this
knowledge to remove, insert, and modify backdoor mechanisms with engineered
replacements that reduce the MLP module outputs to essentials for the backdoor
mechanism. To this end, we introduce PCP ablation, where we replace transformer
modules with low-rank matrices based on the principal components of their
activations. We demonstrate our results on backdoored toy, backdoored large,
and non-backdoored open-source models. We show that we can improve the backdoor
robustness of large language models by locally constraining individual modules
during fine-tuning on potentially poisonous data sets.

eliminating the need for data normalization and inverse cosine calculations,
simplifying the transformation process from time series data to two-dimensional

on datasets from three major stock markets: the China A-share market, the Hong
Kong stock market, and the US stock market. Experimental results revealed that
compared to the classical GAF method, the QGAF approach significantly improved

policies from observed actions; however, existing models fall short by forcing
a tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability. This tradeoff limits
data-driven interpretations of human decision-making process. e.g. to audit
medical decisions for biases and suboptimal practices, we require models of
decision processes which provide concise descriptions of complex behaviors.
Fundamentally, existing approaches are burdened by this tradeoff because they
represent the underlying decision process as a universal policy, when in fact
human decisions are dynamic and can change drastically with contextual
information. Thus, we propose Contextualized Policy Recovery (CPR), which
re-frames the problem of modeling complex decision processes as a multi-task
learning problem in which complex decision policies are comprised of
context-specific policies. CPR models each context-specific policy as a linear
observation-to-action mapping, and generates new decision models
$\textit{on-demand}$ as contexts are updated with new observations. CPR is
compatible with fully offline and partially observable decision environments,
and can be tailored to incorporate any recurrent black-box model or
interpretable decision model. We assess CPR through studies on simulated and
real data, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the canonical tasks of
predicting antibiotic prescription in intensive care units ($+22\%$ AUROC vs.
previous SOTA) and predicting MRI prescription for Alzheimer's patients
($+7.7\%$ AUROC vs. previous SOTA). With this improvement in predictive
performance, CPR closes the accuracy gap between interpretable and black-box
methods for policy learning, allowing high-resolution exploration and analysis
of context-specific decision models.]]></summary>

characterized by its normalized shape and two scalar values denoting the mean

numerically multi-scaled embedding module enumerating all possible scales for
the scalar values. The model undergoes pretraining using the proposed
numerically multi-scaled embedding with a simple contrastive objective on a
large-scale dataset containing over a million sequences. We study its transfer

then applies a multimodal sparse sampling method to reduce data redundancy.
Lastly, MMTSA adopts an inter-segment attention module for efficient multimodal

effectiveness and efficiency in HAR. Results show that our method achieves

highly cost-effective and flexible usage scenarios. Although many papers have
reviewed the application of UAVs in agriculture, the review of the application
for tree detection is still insufficient. This paper focuses on tree detection
methods applied to UAV data collected by UAVs. There are two kinds of data, the
point cloud and the images, which are acquired by the Light Detection and
Ranging (LiDAR) sensor and camera, respectively. Among the detection methods
using point-cloud data, this paper mainly classifies these methods according to
LiDAR and Digital Aerial Photography (DAP). For the detection methods using
images directly, this paper reviews these methods by whether or not to use the
Deep Learning (DL) method. Our review concludes and analyses the comparison and
combination between the application of LiDAR-based and DAP-based point cloud
data. The performance, relative merits, and application fields of the methods
are also introduced. Meanwhile, this review counts the number of tree detection
studies using different methods in recent years. From our statics, the
detection task using DL methods on the image has become a mainstream trend as
the number of DL-based detection researches increases to 45% of the total
number of tree detection studies up to 2022. As a result, this review could

Along the way, several other results are presented. In particular, it is
demonstrated that if the conditional distribution $P_{X|Y=y}$ is symmetric for
all $y$, then $X$ must follow a Gaussian distribution. Additionally, we
consider other $L^p$ losses and observe the following phenomenon: for $p \in

algorithms for the generative modeling of temporal densities, we propose a
cheap alternative which requires minimal hyperparameter tuning and scales
favorably to high dimensional problems. In particular, we use a
projection-based optimal transport solver [Meng et al., 2019] to join
successive samples and subsequently use transport splines [Chewi et al., 2020]
to interpolate the evolving density. When the sampling frequency is
sufficiently high, the optimal maps are close to the identity and are thus
computationally efficient to compute. Moreover, the training process is highly
parallelizable as all optimal maps are independent and can thus be learned
simultaneously. Finally, the approach is based solely on numerical linear
algebra rather than minimizing a nonconvex objective function, allowing us to
easily analyze and control the algorithm. We present several numerical
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the
efficiency of our method. In particular, these experiments show that the

as discrete, (2) instead of estimating response-dependent finite coefficients
of linear models from discrete responses as is done in conventional approaches,
we train a non-linear neural network to serve as a coefficient function. Thanks
to the neural network, N$^3$POM offers flexibility while preserving the
interpretability of conventional ordinal regression. We establish a sufficient
condition under which the predicted conditional cumulative probability locally
satisfies the monotonicity constraint over a user-specified region in the
covariate space. Additionally, we provide a monotonicity-preserving stochastic
(MPS) algorithm for effectively training the neural network. We apply N$^3$POM
to several real-world datasets.]]></summary>

for real-world applications. Some robust training algorithms (e.g., Group DRO)
specialize to group shifts and require group information on all training
points. Other methods (e.g., CVaR DRO) that do not need group annotations can
be overly conservative, since they naively upweight high loss points which may
form a contrived set that does not correspond to any meaningful group in the
real world (e.g., when the high loss points are randomly mislabeled training
points). In this work, we address limitations in prior approaches by assuming a
more nuanced form of group shift: conditioned on the label, we assume that the
true group function (indicator over group) is simple. For example, we may
expect that group shifts occur along low bitrate features (e.g., image
background, lighting). Thus, we aim to learn a model that maintains high
accuracy on simple group functions realized by these low bitrate features, that
need not spend valuable model capacity achieving high accuracy on contrived
groups of examples. Based on this, we consider the two-player game formulation
of DRO where the adversary's capacity is bitrate-constrained. Our resulting
practical algorithm, Bitrate-Constrained DRO (BR-DRO), does not require group
information on training samples yet matches the performance of Group DRO on
datasets that have training group annotations and that of CVaR DRO on
long-tailed distributions. Our theoretical analysis reveals that in some
settings BR-DRO objective can provably yield statistically efficient and less
conservative solutions than unconstrained CVaR DRO.]]></summary>

models by identifying salient portions of input data. This is particularly
valuable in scenarios where limited training samples are accessible due to
challenges in data collection and labeling. Drawing inspiration from human
recognition processes, we posit that an AI baseline's performance could be more
accurate and dependable if it is exposed to essential segments of raw data
rather than the entire input dataset, akin to human perception. However, the
task of selecting these informative data segments, referred to as hard
attention finding, presents a formidable challenge. In situations with few
training samples, existing studies struggle to locate such informative regions
due to the large number of training parameters that cannot be effectively
learned from the available limited samples. In this study, we introduce a novel
and practical framework for achieving explainable hard attention finding,
specifically tailored for few-shot learning scenarios, called FewXAT. Our
approach employs deep reinforcement learning to implement the concept of hard
attention, directly impacting raw input data and thus rendering the process
interpretable for human understanding. Through extensive experimentation across

capacity of manufacturing systems. To solve the scheduling optimization problem
related to the flow control with the aim of improving productivity, existing
methods depend on a heuristic design by domain human experts. Therefore, the
methods require correction, monitoring, and verification by using real
equipment. As system designs increase in complexity, the monitoring time
increases, which decreases the probability of arriving at the optimal design.
As an alternative approach to the heuristic design of flow control systems, the
use of deep reinforcement learning to solve the scheduling optimization problem
has been considered. Although the existing research on reinforcement learning
has yielded excellent performance in some areas, the applicability of the
results to actual FAB such as display and semiconductor manufacturing processes
is not evident so far. To this end, we propose a method to implement a physical
simulation environment and devise a feasible flow control system design using a
transfer robot in display manufacturing through reinforcement learning. We
present a model and parameter setting to build a virtual environment for
different display transfer robots, and training methods of reinforcement
learning on the environment to obtain an optimal scheduling of glass flow
control systems. Its feasibility was verified by using different types of

space of generative models while preserving the underlying structure of the
data. The latent space can be equipped it with a Riemannian metric, pulled back
from the data manifold. With this metric, we can systematically navigate the
space relying on geodesics defined as the shortest curves between two points.
Generative models are often stochastic, causing the data space, the Riemannian
metric, and the geodesics, to be stochastic as well. Stochastic objects are at
best impractical, and at worst impossible, to manipulate. A common solution is
to approximate the stochastic pullback metric by its expectation. But the
geodesics derived from this expected Riemannian metric do not correspond to the
expected length-minimising curves. In this work, we propose another metric
whose geodesics explicitly minimise the expected length of the pullback metric.
We show this metric defines a Finsler metric, and we compare it with the
expected Riemannian metric. In high dimensions, we prove that both metrics
converge to each other at a rate of $O\left(\frac{1}{D}\right)$. This
convergence implies that the established expected Riemannian metric is an
accurate approximation of the theoretically more grounded Finsler metric. This
provides justification for using the expected Riemannian metric for practical

the main challenge lies in the lack of latent state information. A key
fundamental question here is how much online state information (OSI) is
sufficient to achieve tractability. In this paper, we establish a lower bound
that reveals a surprising hardness result: unless we have full OSI, we need an
exponentially scaling sample complexity to obtain an $\epsilon$-optimal policy
solution for POMDPs. Nonetheless, inspired by the key insights in our lower
bound design, we find that there exist important tractable classes of POMDPs
even with only partial OSI. In particular, for two novel classes of POMDPs with

requires either quadratic memory or an exponential number of samples [FOCS'16,
JACM'19]. A line of work that followed extended this result to a large class of
learning problems. Until recently, all these results considered learning in the
streaming model, where each sample is drawn independently, and the learner is
allowed a single pass over the stream of samples. Garg, Raz, and Tal [CCC'19]
considered a stronger model, allowing multiple passes over the stream. In the
$2$-pass model, they showed that learning parities of size $n$ requires either
a memory of size $n^{1.5}$ or at least $2^{\sqrt{n}}$ samples. (Their result
also generalizes to other learning problems.)

In this work, for any constant $q$, we prove tight memory-sample lower bounds
for any parity learning algorithm that makes $q$ passes over the stream of
samples. We show that such a learner requires either $\Omega(n^{2})$ memory
size or at least $2^{\Omega(n)}$ samples. Beyond establishing a tight lower
bound, this is the first non-trivial lower bound for $q$-pass learning for any
$q\ge 3$. Similar to prior work, our results extend to any learning problem
with many nearly-orthogonal concepts.

We complement the lower bound with an upper bound, showing that parity
learning with $q$ passes can be done efficiently with $O(n^2/\log q)$ memory.]]></summary>

involves polynomial approximation of unsupported non-linear activation
functions. However, existing approaches have three main limitations: 1)
Inflexibility: The polynomial approximation and associated homomorphic
evaluation architecture are customized manually for each CNN architecture and
do not generalize to other networks. 2) Suboptimal Approximation: Each
activation function is approximated instead of the function represented by the
CNN. 3) Restricted Design: Either high-degree or low-degree polynomial
approximations are used. The former retains high accuracy but slows down
inference due to bootstrapping operations, while the latter accelerates
ciphertext inference but compromises accuracy. To address these limitations, we
present AutoFHE, which automatically adapts standard CNNs for secure inference
under RNS-CKKS. The key idea is to adopt layerwise mixed-degree polynomial
activation functions, which are optimized jointly with the homomorphic
evaluation architecture in terms of the placement of bootstrapping operations.
The problem is modeled within a multi-objective optimization framework to
maximize accuracy and minimize the number of bootstrapping operations. AutoFHE
can be applied flexibly on any CNN architecture, and it provides diverse
solutions that span the trade-off between accuracy and latency. Experimental
evaluation over RNS-CKKS encrypted CIFAR datasets shows that AutoFHE
accelerates secure inference by $1.32\times$ to $1.8\times$ compared to methods
employing high-degree polynomials. It also improves accuracy by up to 2.56%

knowledge of the environment, hopefully leading to higher reward values
(exploration-exploitation trade-off). Concurrently, another relevant issue
regards the full observability of the states, which may not be assumed in all

artificial intelligence (XAI) with a special focus on the producing industries
and relate them to the current state of academic XAI research. Our findings are
based on an extensive series of interviews regarding the role and applicability
of XAI along the Machine Learning (ML) lifecycle in current industrial practice
and its expected relevance in the future. The interviews were conducted among a
great variety of roles and key stakeholders from different industry sectors. On
top of that, we outline the state of XAI research by providing a concise review
of the relevant literature. This enables us to provide an encompassing overview
covering the opinions of the surveyed persons as well as the current state of
academic research. By comparing our interview results with the current research
approaches we reveal several discrepancies. While a multitude of different XAI
approaches exists, most of them are centered around the model evaluation phase
and data scientists. Their versatile capabilities for other stages are
currently either not sufficiently explored or not popular among practitioners.
In line with existing work, our findings also confirm that more efforts are
needed to enable also non-expert users' interpretation and understanding of

potentially producing a huge societal impact given the low availability and
high cost of real guide dogs. Although a few seeing-eye robot systems have
already been demonstrated, none considered external tugs from humans, which
frequently occur in a real guide dog setting. In this paper, we simultaneously
train a locomotion controller that is robust to external tugging forces via
Reinforcement Learning (RL), and an external force estimator via supervised
learning. The controller ensures stable walking, and the force estimator
enables the robot to respond to the external forces from the human. These
forces are used to guide the robot to the global goal, which is unknown to the
robot, while the robot guides the human around nearby obstacles via a local
planner. Experimental results in simulation and on hardware show that our
controller is robust to external forces, and our seeing-eye system can
accurately detect force direction. We demonstrate our full seeing-eye robot
system on a real quadruped robot with a blindfolded human. The video can be

combining time-series patching with temporal encoding, we have enhanced the

supervised fine-tuning in chatbot domains, we prioritize a two-stage
fine-tuning process: first conducting supervised fine-tuning to orient the LLM
towards time-series data, followed by task-specific downstream fine-tuning.
Furthermore, to unlock the flexibility of pre-trained LLMs without extensive
parameter adjustments, we adopt several Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)
techniques. Drawing on these innovations, LLM4TS has yielded state-of-the-art

Learning scenarios. These can address different main tasks (i.e., in the
setting of Multi-Task Learning), but also main and secondary tasks such as loss
minimization versus sparsity. The usual approach is a simple weighting of the
criteria, which formally only works in the convex setting. In this paper, we
present a Multi-Objective Optimization algorithm using a modified Weighted
Chebyshev scalarization for training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with respect
to several tasks. By employing this scalarization technique, the algorithm can
identify all optimal solutions of the original problem while reducing its
complexity to a sequence of single-objective problems. The simplified problems
are then solved using an Augmented Lagrangian method, enabling the use of
popular optimization techniques such as Adam and Stochastic Gradient Descent,
while efficaciously handling constraints. Our work aims to address the
(economical and also ecological) sustainability issue of DNN models, with a
particular focus on Deep Multi-Task models, which are typically designed with a
very large number of weights to perform equally well on multiple tasks. Through
experiments conducted on two Machine Learning datasets, we demonstrate the
possibility of adaptively sparsifying the model during training without
significantly impacting its performance, if we are willing to apply
task-specific adaptations to the network weights. Code is available at

data being acquired only once for each task. Catastrophic forgetting is a major
challenge to continual learning. To reduce forgetting, some existing
rehearsal-based methods use episodic memory to replay samples of previous
tasks. However, in the process of knowledge integration when learning a new
task, this strategy also suffers from catastrophic forgetting due to an
imbalance between old and new knowledge. To address this problem, we propose a
novel replay strategy called Manifold Expansion Replay (MaER). We argue that
expanding the implicit manifold of the knowledge representation in the episodic
memory helps to improve the robustness and expressiveness of the model. To this
end, we propose a greedy strategy to keep increasing the diameter of the
implicit manifold represented by the knowledge in the buffer during memory
management. In addition, we introduce Wasserstein distance instead of cross
entropy as distillation loss to preserve previous knowledge. With extensive
experimental validation on MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet, we show
that the proposed method significantly improves the accuracy in continual

rounds of interactions with the user, sometimes assisted by external tools.
However, current evaluation protocols often emphasize benchmark performance
with single-turn exchanges, neglecting the nuanced interactions among the user,
LLMs, and external tools, while also underestimating the importance of natural
language feedback from users. These oversights contribute to discrepancies
between research benchmark evaluations and real-world use cases. We introduce
MINT, a benchmark that evaluates LLMs' ability to solve tasks with multi-turn
interactions by (1) using tools and (2) leveraging natural language feedback.
To ensure reproducibility, we provide an evaluation framework where LLMs can
access tools by executing Python code and receive users' natural language
feedback simulated by GPT-4. We repurpose a diverse set of established
evaluation datasets focusing on reasoning, coding, and decision-making and
carefully curate them into a compact subset for efficient evaluation. Our
analysis of 20 open- and closed-source LLMs offers intriguing findings. (a)
LLMs generally benefit from tools and language feedback, with performance gains
(absolute, same below) of 1-8% for each turn of tool use and 2-17% with natural
language feedback. (b) Better single-turn performance does not guarantee better
multi-turn performance. (c) Surprisingly, on the LLMs evaluated, supervised
instruction-finetuning (SIFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback
(RLHF) generally hurt multi-turn capabilities. We expect MINT can help measure
progress and incentivize research in improving LLMs' capabilities in multi-turn
interactions, especially for open-source communities where multi-turn human
evaluation can be less accessible compared to commercial LLMs with a larger

3D modeling tools. Deep generative models of 3D shapes often feature continuous
latent spaces that can, in principle, be used to explore potential variations
starting from a set of input shapes. In practice, doing so can be problematic:
latent spaces are high dimensional and hard to visualize, contain shapes that
are not relevant to the input shapes, and linear paths through them often lead
to sub-optimal shape transitions. Furthermore, one would ideally be able to
explore variations in the original high-quality meshes used to train the
generative model, not its lower-quality output geometry. In this paper, we
present a method to explore variations among a given set of landmark shapes by
constructing a mapping from an easily-navigable 2D exploration space to a
subspace of a pre-trained generative model. We first describe how to find a
mapping that spans the set of input landmark shapes and exhibits smooth
variations between them. We then show how to turn the variations in this
subspace into deformation fields, to transfer those variations to high-quality
meshes for the landmark shapes. Our results show that our method can produce
visually-pleasing and easily-navigable 2D exploration spaces for several
different shape categories, especially as compared to prior work on learning
deformation spaces for 3D shapes.]]></summary>

immense potential of diffusion modeling, which excels at representing
heterogeneous behavior policies. However, sampling from diffusion policies is
considerably slow because it necessitates tens to hundreds of iterative
inference steps for one action. To address this issue, we propose to extract an
efficient deterministic inference policy from critic models and pretrained
diffusion behavior models, leveraging the latter to directly regularize the
policy gradient with the behavior distribution's score function during
optimization. Our method enjoys powerful generative capabilities of diffusion
modeling while completely circumventing the computationally intensive and
time-consuming diffusion sampling scheme, both during training and evaluation.

are known, and that they are the same for all arms. This naturally leads to
suboptimal performance and higher regret due to variance overestimation. On the
other hand, underestimated reward variances may lead to linear regret due to
committing early to a suboptimal arm. This motivated prior works on
variance-adaptive frequentist algorithms, which have strong instance-dependent
regret bounds but cannot incorporate prior knowledge on reward variances. We
lay foundations for the Bayesian setting, which incorporates prior knowledge.
This results in lower regret in practice, due to using the prior in the
algorithm design, and also improved regret guarantees. Specifically, we study
Gaussian bandits with {unknown heterogeneous reward variances}, and develop a
Thompson sampling algorithm with prior-dependent Bayes regret bounds. We
achieve lower regret with lower reward variances and more informative priors on
them, which is precisely why we pay only for what is uncertain. This is the
first result of its kind. Finally, we corroborate our theory with extensive
experiments, which show the superiority of our variance-adaptive Bayesian
algorithm over prior frequentist approaches. We also show that our approach is
robust to model misspecification and can be applied with estimated priors.]]></summary>

imaging (CDI) and ptychography are making their way into scientific fields

reconstruction quality by combining the diffraction forward map with real-space
constraints from overlapping measurements. In particular, PtychoPINN
significantly advances generalizability, accuracy (with a typical 10 dB PSNR
increase), and linear resolution (2- to 6-fold gain). This blend of performance

training points on the trained model, has garnered increased attention of late,
driven by the need to comply with privacy regulations like the Right to be
Forgotten. Although unlearning is particularly relevant for LLMs in light of
the copyright issues they raise, achieving precise unlearning is
computationally infeasible for very large models. To this end, recent work has
proposed several algorithms which approximate the removal of training data
without retraining the model. These algorithms crucially rely on access to the
model parameters in order to update them, an assumption that may not hold in
practice due to computational constraints or when the LLM is accessed via API.
In this work, we propose a new class of unlearning methods for LLMs we call
''In-Context Unlearning'', providing inputs in context and without having to
update model parameters. To unlearn a particular training instance, we provide
the instance alongside a flipped label and additional correctly labelled
instances which are prepended as inputs to the LLM at inference time. Our
experimental results demonstrate that these contexts effectively remove
specific information from the training set while maintaining performance levels
that are competitive with (or in some cases exceed) state-of-the-art unlearning
methods that require access to the LLM parameters.]]></summary>

relative importance of each audio-video patch between the current and past data

their success in various applications. In this paper, we hypothesize that
relying heavily on simple co-occurrence statistics of the pre-training corpora
is one of the main factors that cause factual errors. Our results reveal that
LLMs are vulnerable to the co-occurrence bias, defined as preferring frequently
co-occurred words over the correct answer. Consequently, LLMs struggle to
recall facts whose subject and object rarely co-occur in the pre-training
dataset although they are seen during finetuning. We show that co-occurrence
bias remains despite scaling up model sizes or finetuning. Therefore, we
suggest finetuning on a debiased dataset to mitigate the bias by filtering out
biased samples whose subject-object co-occurrence count is high. Although
debiased finetuning allows LLMs to memorize rare facts in the training set, it
is not effective in recalling rare facts unseen during finetuning. Further
research in mitigation will help build reliable language models by preventing
potential errors. The code is available at

demonstrated strong performance on many tasks over tabular data. Researchers
and practitioners are keen to leverage these models in many new application
contexts; but limited understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of these
models, and the table representations they generate, makes the process of
finding a suitable model for a given task reliant on trial and error. There is
an urgent need to gain a comprehensive understanding of these models to
minimize inefficiency and failures in downstream usage.

To address this need, we propose Observatory, a formal framework to
systematically analyze embedding representations of relational tables.
Motivated both by invariants of the relational data model and by statistical
considerations regarding data distributions, we define eight primitive
properties, and corresponding measures to quantitatively characterize table
embeddings for these properties. Based on these properties, we define an
extensible framework to evaluate language and table embedding models. We
collect and synthesize a suite of datasets and use Observatory to analyze seven
such models. Our analysis provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses
of learned representations over tables. We find, for example, that some models
are sensitive to table structure such as column order, that functional
dependencies are rarely reflected in embeddings, and that specialized table
embedding models have relatively lower sample fidelity. Such insights help
researchers and practitioners better anticipate model behaviors and select
appropriate models for their downstream tasks, while guiding researchers in the
development of new models.]]></summary>

important. One recent approach looks at the infinitely wide limits of such

significantly during gradient-descent-based training in contrast to infinite
networks. In this work, we derive an iterative linearised training method as a
novel empirical tool to further investigate this distinction, allowing us to
control for sparse (i.e. infrequent) feature updates and quantify the frequency
of feature learning needed to achieve comparable performance. We justify
iterative linearisation as an interpolation between a finite analog of the
infinite width regime, which does not learn features, and standard gradient
descent training, which does. Informally, we also show that it is analogous to
a damped version of the Gauss-Newton algorithm -- a second-order method. We
show that in a variety of cases, iterative linearised training surprisingly
performs on par with standard training, noting in particular how much less
frequent feature learning is required to achieve comparable performance. We
also show that feature learning is essential for good performance. Since such
feature learning inevitably causes changes in the NTK kernel, we provide direct
negative evidence for the NTK theory, which states the NTK kernel remains

data points with particular values of interest in a broader range of data where
many target values are zero. Zero-inflated data can be found in diverse
scenarios, such as lumpy and intermittent demands, power consumption for home
appliances being turned on and off, impurities measurement in distillation
processes, and even airport shuttle demand prediction. The presence of zeroes
affects the models' learning and may result in poor performance. Furthermore,
zeroes also distort the metrics used to compute the model's prediction quality.
This paper showcases two real-world use cases (home appliances classification
and airport shuttle demand prediction) where a hierarchical model applied in
the context of zero-inflated data leads to excellent results. In particular,
for home appliances classification, the weighted average of Precision, Recall,
F1, and AUC ROC was increased by 27%, 34%, 49%, and 27%, respectively.
Furthermore, it is estimated that the proposed approach is also four times more
energy efficient than the SOTA approach against which it was compared to.
Two-fold models performed best in all cases when predicting airport shuttle
demand, and the difference against other models has been proven to be

from scanned documents. Today, the state-of-the-art is achieved by exploiting
deep neural networks. However, the cost of this performance is paid at the

compromise the training phase by inserting a backdoor in the victim's model
that will be activated at testing time by specific patterns while leaving the
overall model performance intact. This work proposes a backdoor attack for OCR
resulting in the injection of non-readable characters from malicious input
images. This simple but effective attack exposes the state-of-the-art OCR
weakness, making the extracted text correct to human eyes but simultaneously
unusable for the NLP application that uses OCR as a preprocessing step.

lasso to a family of adaptive optimizers in deep learning, such as Momentum,

are named Group Momentum, Group Adagrad, Group Adam, Group AMSGrad and Group
AdaHessian, etc., accordingly. We establish theoretically proven convergence
guarantees in the stochastic convex settings, based on primal-dual methods. We
evaluate the regularized effect of our new optimizers on three large-scale
real-world ad click datasets with state-of-the-art deep learning models. The
experimental results reveal that compared with the original optimizers with the
post-processing procedure which uses the magnitude pruning method, the
performance of the models can be significantly improved on the same sparsity
level. Furthermore, in comparison to the cases without magnitude pruning, our
methods can achieve extremely high sparsity with significantly better or highly

Gradient Information Optimization (GIO), a scalable, task-agnostic approach to
this data selection problem that requires only a small set of (unlabeled)
examples representing a target distribution. GIO begins from a natural,
information-theoretic objective that is intractable in practice. Our
contribution is in showing that it can be made highly scalable through a simple
relaxation of the objective and a highly efficient implementation. In
experiments with machine translation, spelling correction, and image
recognition, we show that GIO delivers outstanding results with very small
train sets. These findings are robust to different representation models and
hyperparameters for GIO itself. GIO is task- and domain-agnostic and can be

success of deep neural networks. It is rigorously known that in two-layer
fully-connected neural networks under certain conditions, one step of gradient
descent on the first layer followed by ridge regression on the second layer can
lead to feature learning; characterized by the appearance of a separated
rank-one component -- spike -- in the spectrum of the feature matrix. However,
with a constant gradient descent step size, this spike only carries information
from the linear component of the target function and therefore learning
non-linear components is impossible. We show that with a learning rate that
grows with the sample size, such training in fact introduces multiple rank-one
components, each corresponding to a specific polynomial feature. We further
prove that the limiting large-dimensional and large sample training and test
errors of the updated neural networks are fully characterized by these spikes.
By precisely analyzing the improvement in the loss, we demonstrate that these
non-linear features can enhance learning.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in NLP, but their demands hinder their
widespread deployment. While Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) offers a
solution, its extensive training costs make Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) a
more practical approach for LLMs. In existing studies, activation outliers in
particular channels are identified as the bottleneck to PTQ accuracy. They
propose to transform the magnitudes from activations to weights, which however
offers limited alleviation or suffers from unstable gradients, resulting in a
severe performance drop at low-bitwidth. In this paper, we propose QLLM, an
accurate and efficient low-bitwidth PTQ method designed for LLMs. QLLM
introduces an adaptive channel reassembly technique that reallocates the
magnitude of outliers to other channels, thereby mitigating their impact on the
quantization range. This is achieved by channel disassembly and channel
assembly, which first breaks down the outlier channels into several
sub-channels to ensure a more balanced distribution of activation magnitudes.
Then similar channels are merged to maintain the original channel number for
efficiency. Additionally, an adaptive strategy is designed to autonomously
determine the optimal number of sub-channels for channel disassembly. To
further compensate for the performance loss caused by quantization, we propose
an efficient tuning method that only learns a small number of low-rank weights
while freezing the pre-trained quantized model. After training, these low-rank
parameters can be fused into the frozen weights without affecting inference.
Extensive experiments on LLaMA-1 and LLaMA-2 show that QLLM can obtain accurate
quantized models efficiently. For example, QLLM quantizes the 4-bit LLaMA-2-70B
within 10 hours on a single A100-80G GPU, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art method by 7.89% on the average accuracy across five zero-shot
tasks.]]></summary>

networks due to catastrophic forgetting (CF) of previously learned tasks.
Several techniques such as weight regularization, experience rehearsal, and
parameter isolation have been proposed to alleviate CF. Despite their relative
success, these research directions have predominantly remained orthogonal and
suffer from several shortcomings, while missing out on the advantages of
competing strategies. On the contrary, the brain continually learns,
accommodates, and transfers knowledge across tasks by simultaneously leveraging
several neurophysiological processes, including neurogenesis, active
forgetting, neuromodulation, metaplasticity, experience rehearsal, and
context-dependent gating, rarely resulting in CF. Inspired by how the brain
exploits multiple mechanisms concurrently, we propose TriRE, a novel CL
paradigm that encompasses retaining the most prominent neurons for each task,
revising and solidifying the extracted knowledge of current and past tasks, and
actively promoting less active neurons for subsequent tasks through rewinding
and relearning. Across CL settings, TriRE significantly reduces task
interference and surpasses different CL approaches considered in isolation.]]></summary>

offers a small size of labeled examples, unlabeled graphs have been collected
from various sources and at a large scale. A conventional approach is training
a model with the unlabeled graphs on self-supervised tasks and then fine-tuning
the model on the prediction tasks. However, the self-supervised task knowledge
could not be aligned or sometimes conflicted with what the predictions needed.
In this paper, we propose to extract the knowledge underlying the large set of
unlabeled graphs as a specific set of useful data points to augment each
property prediction model. We use a diffusion model to fully utilize the
unlabeled graphs and design two new objectives to guide the model's denoising
process with each task's labeled data to generate task-specific graph examples
and their labels. Experiments demonstrate that our data-centric approach
performs significantly better than fifteen existing various methods on fifteen
tasks. The performance improvement brought by unlabeled data is visible as the
generated labeled examples unlike the self-supervised learning.]]></summary>

characteristic heavy-tail distributions. Examples include copies of books sold,
auction prices of art pieces, demand for commodities in warehouses, etc. By
learning heavy-tailed distributions, "big and rare" instances (e.g., the
best-sellers) will have accurate predictions. Most existing approaches are not
dedicated to learning heavy-tailed distribution; thus, they heavily
under-predict such instances. To tackle this problem, we introduce Learning to
Place (L2P), which exploits the pairwise relationships between instances for
learning. In its training phase, L2P learns a pairwise preference classifier:
is instance A > instance B? In its placing phase, L2P obtains a prediction by
placing the new instance among the known instances. Based on its placement, the
new instance is then assigned a value for its outcome variable. Experiments on
real data show that L2P outperforms competing approaches in terms of accuracy
and ability to reproduce heavy-tailed outcome distribution. In addition, L2P
provides an interpretable model by placing each predicted instance in relation
to its comparable neighbors. Interpretable models are highly desirable when
lives and treasure are at stake.]]></summary>

models has achieved remarkable success in classic decision-making problems,
such as Go and Atari. However, it has been deemed challenging or even
infeasible to extend Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) based algorithms to diverse
real-world applications, especially when these environments involve complex
action spaces and significant simulation costs, or inherent stochasticity. In
this work, we introduce LightZero, the first unified benchmark for deploying
MCTS/MuZero in general sequential decision scenarios. Specificially, we
summarize the most critical challenges in designing a general MCTS-style
decision-making solver, then decompose the tightly-coupled algorithm and system
design of tree-search RL methods into distinct sub-modules. By incorporating
more appropriate exploration and optimization strategies, we can significantly
enhance these sub-modules and construct powerful LightZero agents to tackle
tasks across a wide range of domains, such as board games, Atari, MuJoCo,
MiniGrid and GoBigger. Detailed benchmark results reveal the significant
potential of such methods in building scalable and efficient decision

within the private training dataset of machine learning models, leading to
serious privacy violations and other sophisticated threats. Many practical
black-box MIAs require query access to the data distribution (the same
distribution where the private data is drawn) to train shadow models. By doing
so, the adversary obtains models trained "with" or "without" samples drawn from
the distribution, and analyzes the characteristics of the samples under
consideration. The adversary is often required to train more than hundreds of
shadow models to extract the signals needed for MIAs; this becomes the
computational overhead of MIAs. In this paper, we propose that by strategically
choosing the samples, MI adversaries can maximize their attack success while
minimizing the number of shadow models. First, our motivational experiments
suggest memorization as the key property explaining disparate sample
vulnerability to MIAs. We formalize this through a theoretical bound that
connects MI advantage with memorization. Second, we show sample complexity
bounds that connect the number of shadow models needed for MIAs with
memorization. Lastly, we confirm our theoretical arguments with comprehensive
experiments; by utilizing samples with high memorization scores, the adversary
can (a) significantly improve its efficacy regardless of the MIA used, and (b)
reduce the number of shadow models by nearly two orders of magnitude compared
to state-of-the-art approaches.]]></summary>

years ago, how to precisely model the propagation of an RF signal in an
electrically large and complex environment remains a long-standing problem. The
difficulty is in the complex interactions between the RF signal and the
obstacles (e.g., reflection, diffraction, etc.). Inspired by the great success
of using a neural network to describe the optical field in computer vision, we
propose a neural radio-frequency radiance field, NeRF$^\textbf{2}$, which
represents a continuous volumetric scene function that makes sense of an RF
signal's propagation. Particularly, after training with a few signal
measurements, NeRF$^\textbf{2}$ can tell how/what signal is received at any
position when it knows the position of a transmitter. As a physical-layer
neural network, NeRF$^\textbf{2}$ can take advantage of the learned statistic
model plus the physical model of ray tracing to generate a synthetic dataset
that meets the training demands of application-layer artificial neural networks
(ANNs). Thus, we can boost the performance of ANNs by the proposed
turbo-learning, which mixes the true and synthetic datasets to intensify the
training. Our experiment results show that turbo-learning can enhance
performance with an approximate 50% increase. We also demonstrate the power of
NeRF$^\textbf{2}$ in the field of indoor localization and 5G MIMO.]]></summary>

contrastive loss to promote local consistency among within-class cross domain
samples while enforcing separation between classes, thus preserving
discriminative transfer from source to target. We validate the advantages of
MemSAC with significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art on multiple

DomainNet with 345 classes and fine-grained adaptation on Caltech-UCSD birds

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper studies the fundamental problem of learning multi-layer generator
models. The multi-layer generator model builds multiple layers of latent
variables as a prior model on top of the generator, which benefits learning
complex data distribution and hierarchical representations. However, such a
prior model usually focuses on modeling inter-layer relations between latent
variables by assuming non-informative (conditional) Gaussian distributions,
which can be limited in model expressivity. To tackle this issue and learn more
expressive prior models, we propose an energy-based model (EBM) on the joint
latent space over all layers of latent variables with the multi-layer generator
as its backbone. Such joint latent space EBM prior model captures the
intra-layer contextual relations at each layer through layer-wise energy terms,
and latent variables across different layers are jointly corrected. We develop
a joint training scheme via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which involves
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling for both prior and posterior
distributions of the latent variables from different layers. To ensure
efficient inference and learning, we further propose a variational training
scheme where an inference model is used to amortize the costly posterior MCMC
sampling. Our experiments demonstrate that the learned model can be expressive
in generating high-quality images and capturing hierarchical features for
better outlier detection.]]></summary>

uses binary vectors with high dimensions and the majority rule. This approach
has the potential to be energy-efficient and hence deemed suitable for
resource-limited platforms due to its simplicity and massive parallelism.
However, in order to achieve high accuracy, HDC sometimes uses hypervectors
with tens of thousands of dimensions. This potentially negates its efficiency
advantage. In this paper, we examine the necessity of such high dimensions and
conduct a detailed theoretical analysis of the relationship between hypervector
dimensions and accuracy. Our results demonstrate that as the dimension of the
hypervectors increases, the worst-case/average-case HDC prediction accuracy
with the majority rule decreases. Building on this insight, we develop HDC
models that use binary hypervectors with dimensions orders of magnitude lower
than those of state-of-the-art HDC models while maintaining equivalent or even
improved accuracy and efficiency. For instance, on the MNIST dataset, we
achieve 91.12% HDC accuracy in image classification with a dimension of only
64. Our methods perform operations that are only 0.35% of other HDC models with
dimensions of 10,000. Furthermore, we evaluate our methods on ISOLET, UCI-HAR,

single-agent metrics (marginal metrics), such as minimum Average Displacement
Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), which fail to capture joint
performance of multiple interacting agents. Only focusing on marginal metrics
can lead to unnatural predictions, such as colliding trajectories or diverging
trajectories for people who are clearly walking together as a group.
Consequently, methods optimized for marginal metrics lead to overly-optimistic
estimations of performance, which is detrimental to progress in trajectory
forecasting research. In response to the limitations of marginal metrics, we
present the first comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
trajectory forecasting methods with respect to multi-agent metrics (joint
metrics): JADE, JFDE, and collision rate. We demonstrate the importance of
joint metrics as opposed to marginal metrics with quantitative evidence and
qualitative examples drawn from the ETH / UCY and Stanford Drone datasets. We
introduce a new loss function incorporating joint metrics that, when applied to
a SOTA trajectory forecasting method, achieves a 7\% improvement in JADE / JFDE
on the ETH / UCY datasets with respect to the previous SOTA. Our results also
indicate that optimizing for joint metrics naturally leads to an improvement in
interaction modeling, as evidenced by a 16\% decrease in mean collision rate on
the ETH / UCY datasets with respect to the previous SOTA. Code is available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Content Delivery Networks carry the majority of Internet traffic, and the
increasing demand for video content as a major IP traffic across the Internet
highlights the importance of caching and prefetching optimization algorithms.
Prefetching aims to make data available in the cache before the requester
places its request to reduce access time and improve the Quality of Experience
on the user side. Prefetching is well investigated in operating systems,
compiler instructions, in-memory cache, local storage systems, high-speed
networks, and cloud systems. Traditional prefetching techniques are well
adapted to a particular access pattern, but fail to adapt to sudden variations
or randomization in workloads. This paper explores the use of reinforcement
learning to tackle the changes in user access patterns and automatically adapt
over time. To this end, we propose, DeePref, a Deep Reinforcement Learning
agent for online video content prefetching in Content Delivery Networks.
DeePref is a prefetcher implemented on edge networks and is agnostic to
hardware design, operating systems, and applications. Our results show that
DeePref DRQN, using a real-world dataset, achieves a 17% increase in
prefetching accuracy and a 28% increase in prefetching coverage on average
compared to baseline approaches that use video content popularity as a building
block to statically or dynamically make prefetching decisions. We also study
the possibility of transfer learning of statistical models from one edge
network into another, where unseen user requests from unknown distribution are
observed. In terms of transfer learning, the increase in prefetching accuracy
and prefetching coverage are [$30%$, $10%$], respectively. Our source code will
be available on Github.]]></summary>

due to seasonality, serendipity, and evolving social trends. While a number of
non-stationary contextual bandit learning algorithms have been proposed in the
literature, they excessively explore due to a lack of prioritization for
information of enduring value, or are designed in ways that do not scale in
modern applications with high-dimensional user-specific features and large
action set, or both. In this paper, we introduce a novel non-stationary
contextual bandit algorithm that addresses these concerns. It combines a
scalable, deep-neural-network-based architecture with a carefully designed
exploration mechanism that strategically prioritizes collecting information
with the most lasting value in a non-stationary environment. Through empirical
evaluations on two real-world recommendation datasets, which exhibit pronounced
non-stationarity, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art baselines.]]></summary>

its ability to asymptotically reduce communication overhead by the probability

transportation systems. The complex and dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies
make the traffic flow prediction quite challenging. Although existing
spatial-temporal graph neural networks hold prominent, they often encounter
challenges such as (1) ignoring the fixed graph that limits the predictive
performance of the model, (2) insufficiently capturing complex spatial-temporal
dependencies simultaneously, and (3) lacking attention to spatial-temporal
information at different time lengths. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale
Spatial-Temporal Recurrent Network for traffic flow prediction, namely MSSTRN,
which consists of two different recurrent neural networks: the single-step gate
recurrent unit and the multi-step gate recurrent unit to fully capture the
complex spatial-temporal information in the traffic data under different time
windows. Moreover, we propose a spatial-temporal synchronous attention
mechanism that integrates adaptive position graph convolutions into the
self-attention mechanism to achieve synchronous capture of spatial-temporal
dependencies. We conducted extensive experiments on four real traffic datasets
and demonstrated that our model achieves the best prediction accuracy with
non-trivial margins compared to all the twenty baseline methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 1-bit compressed sensing, the aim is to estimate a $k$-sparse unit vector
$x\in S^{n-1}$ within an $\epsilon$ error (in $\ell_2$) from minimal number of
linear measurements that are quantized to just their signs, i.e., from
measurements of the form $y = \mathrm{Sign}(\langle a, x\rangle).$ In this
paper, we study a noisy version where a fraction of the measurements can be
flipped, potentially by an adversary. In particular, we analyze the Binary
Iterative Hard Thresholding (BIHT) algorithm, a proximal gradient descent on a
properly defined loss function used for 1-bit compressed sensing, in this noisy
setting. It is known from recent results that, with
$\tilde{O}(\frac{k}{\epsilon})$ noiseless measurements, BIHT provides an
estimate within $\epsilon$ error. This result is optimal and universal, meaning
one set of measurements work for all sparse vectors. In this paper, we show
that BIHT also provides better results than all known methods for the noisy
setting. We show that when up to $\tau$-fraction of the sign measurements are
incorrect (adversarial error), with the same number of measurements as before,
BIHT agnostically provides an estimate of $x$ within an
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon+\tau)$ error, maintaining the universality of measurements.
This establishes stability of iterative hard thresholding in the presence of
measurement error. To obtain the result, we use the restricted approximate
invertibility of Gaussian matrices, as well as a tight analysis of the
high-dimensional geometry of the adversarially corrupted measurements.]]></summary>

$f$ that is noisy and costly to evaluate, by exploiting an acquisition function
that must be maximized at each optimization step. Even if provably
asymptotically optimal BO algorithms are efficient at optimizing
low-dimensional functions, scaling them to high-dimensional spaces remains an
open problem, often tackled by assuming an additive structure for $f$. By doing
so, BO algorithms typically introduce additional restrictive assumptions on the
additive structure that reduce their applicability domain. This paper contains
two main contributions: (i) we relax the restrictive assumptions on the
additive structure of $f$, at the expense of weakening the maximization
guarantees of the acquisition function, and (ii) we address the
over-exploration problem for decentralized BO algorithms. To these ends, we
propose DumBO, an asymptotically optimal decentralized BO algorithm that
achieves very competitive performance against state-of-the-art BO algorithms,

forecasting models have gained popularity as they can utilize hidden feature
patterns in time series to improve forecasting performance. Nevertheless, the
majority of current deep forecasting models are opaque, hence making it
challenging to interpret the results. While counterfactual explanations have
been extensively employed as a post-hoc approach for explaining classification
models, their application to forecasting models still remains underexplored. In
this paper, we formulate the novel problem of counterfactual generation for
time series forecasting, and propose an algorithm, called ForecastCF, that
solves the problem by applying gradient-based perturbations to the original
time series. ForecastCF guides the perturbations by applying constraints to the
forecasted values to obtain desired prediction outcomes. We experimentally
evaluate ForecastCF using four state-of-the-art deep model architectures and
compare to two baselines. Our results show that ForecastCF outperforms the
baseline in terms of counterfactual validity and data manifold closeness.
Overall, our findings suggest that ForecastCF can generate meaningful and

that aims to preserve the semantics of objects such as documents and items
inside their IDs. Previous studies typically adopt a two-stage pipeline to
learn semantic IDs by first procuring embeddings using off-the-shelf text
encoders and then deriving IDs based on the embeddings. However, each step
introduces potential information loss and there is usually an inherent mismatch
between the distribution of embeddings within the latent space produced by text
encoders and the anticipated distribution required for semantic indexing.
Nevertheless, it is non-trivial to design a method that can learn the
document's semantic representations and its hierarchical structure
simultaneously, given that semantic IDs are discrete and sequentially
structured, and the semantic supervision is deficient. In this paper, we
introduce LMINDEXER, a self-supervised framework to learn semantic IDs with a
generative language model. We tackle the challenge of sequential discrete ID by
introducing a semantic indexer capable of generating neural sequential discrete
representations with progressive training and contrastive learning. In response
to the semantic supervision deficiency, we propose to train the model with a
self-supervised document reconstruction objective. The learned semantic indexer
can facilitate various downstream tasks, such as recommendation and retrieval.
We conduct experiments on three tasks including recommendation, product search,
and document retrieval on five datasets from various domains, where LMINDEXER

relationships learned by diffusion models by noticing a precise relationship
between diffusion and information decomposition. Exact expressions for mutual
information and conditional mutual information can be written in terms of the
denoising model. Furthermore, pointwise estimates can be easily estimated as
well, allowing us to ask questions about the relationships between specific
images and captions. Decomposing information even further to understand which
variables in a high-dimensional space carry information is a long-standing
problem. For diffusion models, we show that a natural non-negative
decomposition of mutual information emerges, allowing us to quantify
informative relationships between words and pixels in an image. We exploit
these new relations to measure the compositional understanding of diffusion
models, to do unsupervised localization of objects in images, and to measure
effects when selectively editing images through prompt interventions.]]></summary>

introduce an expert-annotated data set with 3.5K text samples. Second, we train
and release ClimateBERT-NetZero, a natural language classifier to detect
whether a text contains a net zero or reduction target. Third, we showcase its

ClimateBERT-NetZero can be combined with conventional question-answering (Q&A)
models to analyze the ambitions displayed in net zero and reduction targets.
Furthermore, we employ the ClimateBERT-NetZero model on quarterly earning call

IoT devices connected to a network. However, there is still a practical
challenge of not having all devices (and hence their traffic) available during
the training of a model. This essentially means, during the operational phase,
we need to classify new devices not seen during the training phase. To address
this challenge, we propose ZEST -- a ZSL (zero-shot learning) framework based
on self-attention for classifying both seen and unseen devices. ZEST consists
of i) a self-attention based network feature extractor, termed SANE, for
extracting latent space representations of IoT traffic, ii) a generative model
that trains a decoder using latent features to generate pseudo data, and iii) a
supervised model that is trained on the generated pseudo data for classifying
devices. We carry out extensive experiments on real IoT traffic data; our
experiments demonstrate i) ZEST achieves significant improvement (in terms of
accuracy) over the baselines; ii) ZEST is able to better extract meaningful
representations than LSTM which has been commonly used for modeling network
traffic.]]></summary>

learning has proven beneficial with object-centric images. However, this
approach faces limitations when applied to scene-centric datasets, where
multiple objects within an image are only implicitly captured in the global

of object representations. Furthermore, even object-centric datasets stand to
benefit from a finer-grained bootstrapping approach. In response to these
challenges, we introduce a novel Cross-Image Object-Level Bootstrapping method
tailored to enhance dense visual representation learning. By employing
object-level nearest neighbor bootstrapping throughout the training, CrIBo
emerges as a notably strong and adequate candidate for in-context learning,
leveraging nearest neighbor retrieval at test time. CrIBo shows
state-of-the-art performance on the latter task while being highly competitive

evaluate facial clefts is the scarcity of large datasets of high-quality,
ethics board-approved patient images. In response, we have built a deep
learning-based cleft lip generator designed to produce an almost unlimited
number of artificial images exhibiting high-fidelity facsimiles of cleft lip
with wide variation. We undertook a transfer learning protocol testing
different versions of StyleGAN-ADA (a generative adversarial network image
generator incorporating adaptive data augmentation (ADA)) as the base model.
Training images depicting a variety of cleft deformities were pre-processed to
adjust for rotation, scaling, color adjustment and background blurring. The ADA
modification of the primary algorithm permitted construction of our new
generative model while requiring input of a relatively small number of training
images. Adversarial training was carried out using 514 unique frontal
photographs of cleft-affected faces to adapt a pre-trained model based on
70,000 normal faces. The Frechet Inception Distance (FID) was used to measure
the similarity of the newly generated facial images to the cleft training
dataset, while Perceptual Path Length (PPL) and the novel Divergence Index of
Severity Histograms (DISH) measures were also used to assess the performance of
the image generator that we dub CleftGAN. We found that StyleGAN3 with
translation invariance (StyleGAN3-t) performed optimally as a base model.
Generated images achieved a low FID reflecting a close similarity to our
training input dataset of genuine cleft images. Low PPL and DISH measures
reflected a smooth and semantically valid interpolation of images through the
transfer learning process and a similar distribution of severity in the
training and generated images, respectively.]]></summary>

research; many energy management systems and design processes rely on accurate
battery models for efficiency optimization. The standard methodology for
battery modelling is traditional design of experiments (DoE), where the battery
dynamics are excited with many different current profiles and the measured
outputs are used to estimate the system dynamics. However, although it is
possible to obtain useful models with the traditional approach, the process is
time consuming and expensive because of the need to sweep many different
current-profile configurations. In the present work, a novel DoE approach is
developed based on deep reinforcement learning, which alters the configuration
of the experiments on the fly based on the statistics of past experiments.
Instead of sticking to a library of predefined current profiles, the proposed
approach modifies the current profiles dynamically by updating the output space
covered by past measurements, hence only the current profiles that are
informative for future experiments are applied. Simulations and real
experiments are used to show that the proposed approach gives models that are
as accurate as those obtained with traditional DoE but by using 85\% less
resources.]]></summary>

problems, such as checking if two nodes in a graph are connected or simulating
finite-state machines, that are provably unsolvable by standard transformers
that answer immediately after reading their input. However, in practice,
transformers' reasoning can be improved by allowing them to use a "chain of
thought" or "scratchpad", i.e., generate and condition on a sequence of
intermediate tokens before answering. Motivated by this, we ask: Does such
intermediate generation fundamentally extend the computational power of a
decoder-only transformer? We show that the answer is yes, but the amount of
increase depends crucially on the amount of intermediate generation. For
instance, we find that transformer decoders with a logarithmic number of
decoding steps (w.r.t. the input length) push the limits of standard
transformers only slightly, while a linear number of decoding steps adds a
clear new ability (under standard complexity conjectures): recognizing all
regular languages. Our results also imply that linear steps keep transformer
decoders within context-sensitive languages, and polynomial steps make them
recognize exactly the class of polynomial-time solvable problems -- the first
exact characterization of a type of transformers in terms of standard
complexity classes. Together, our results provide a nuanced framework for
understanding how the length of a transformer's chain of thought or scratchpad
impacts its reasoning power.]]></summary>

approximate the response of complex dynamical systems driven by time-varying
exogenous excitations over extended time periods. Our approach, namely manifold
nonlinear autoregressive modelling with exogenous input (mNARX), involves
constructing a problem-specific exogenous input manifold that is optimal for
constructing autoregressive surrogates. The manifold, which forms the core of
mNARX, is constructed incrementally by incorporating the physics of the system,
as well as prior expert- and domain- knowledge. Because mNARX decomposes the
full problem into a series of smaller sub-problems, each with a lower
complexity than the original, it scales well with the complexity of the
problem, both in terms of training and evaluation costs of the final surrogate.
Furthermore, mNARX synergizes well with traditional dimensionality reduction
techniques, making it highly suitable for modelling dynamical systems with
high-dimensional exogenous inputs, a class of problems that is typically
challenging to solve. Since domain knowledge is particularly abundant in
physical systems, such as those found in civil and mechanical engineering,
mNARX is well suited for these applications. We demonstrate that mNARX
outperforms traditional autoregressive surrogates in predicting the response of
a classical coupled spring-mass system excited by a one-dimensional random
excitation. Additionally, we show that mNARX is well suited for emulating very
high-dimensional time- and state-dependent systems, even when affected by
active controllers, by surrogating the dynamics of a realistic
aero-servo-elastic onshore wind turbine simulator. In general, our results
demonstrate that mNARX offers promising prospects for modelling complex
dynamical systems, in terms of accuracy and efficiency.]]></summary>

years. However, an important challenge that still blocks it from being very
useful in practice is that the model is not robust under perturbation and it
cannot generalize well over the out-of-distribution (OOD) data, e.g., applying
a trained model to unseen projects in real world. We hypothesize that this is
because the model learned non-robust features, e.g., variable names, that have
spurious correlations with labels. When the perturbed and OOD datasets no
longer have the same spurious features, the model prediction fails. To address
the challenge, in this paper, we introduced causality into deep learning
vulnerability detection. Our approach CausalVul consists of two phases. First,
we designed novel perturbations to discover spurious features that the model
may use to make predictions. Second, we applied the causal learning algorithms,
specifically, do-calculus, on top of existing deep learning models to
systematically remove the use of spurious features and thus promote causal
based prediction. Our results show that CausalVul consistently improved the
model accuracy, robustness and OOD performance for all the state-of-the-art
models and datasets we experimented. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work that introduces do calculus based causal learning to software
engineering models and shows it's indeed useful for improving the model
accuracy, robustness and generalization. Our replication package is located at

errors in models trained on a fixed data budget. Moreover, a model can be
trained on a lower compute budget without compromising performance if a dataset
can be stripped of its redundancies. Coreset selection (or data pruning) seeks
to select a subset of the training data so as to maximize the performance of
models trained on this subset, also referred to as coreset. There are two
dominant approaches: (1) geometry-based data selection for maximizing data
diversity in the coreset, and (2) functions that assign difficulty scores to
samples based on training dynamics. Optimizing for data diversity leads to a
coreset that is biased towards easier samples, whereas, selection by difficulty
ranking omits easy samples that are necessary for the training of deep learning
models. This demonstrates that data diversity and importance scores are two
complementary factors that need to be jointly considered during coreset
selection. We represent a dataset as an undirected graph and propose a novel
pruning algorithm, D2 Pruning, that uses forward and reverse message passing
over this dataset graph for coreset selection. D2 Pruning updates the
difficulty scores of each example by incorporating the difficulty of its
neighboring examples in the dataset graph. Then, these updated difficulty
scores direct a graph-based sampling method to select a coreset that
encapsulates both diverse and difficult regions of the dataset space. We
evaluate supervised and self-supervised versions of our method on various
vision and language datasets. Results show that D2 Pruning improves coreset
selection over previous state-of-the-art methods for up to 70% pruning rates.
Additionally, we find that using D2 Pruning for filtering large multimodal
datasets leads to increased diversity in the dataset and improved
generalization of pretrained models.]]></summary>

adversarial robustness to provide provable robustness guarantees on smoothed
neural network classifiers. However, existing works show that vanilla
randomized smoothing usually does not provide good robustness performance and
often requires (re)training techniques on the base classifier in order to boost
the robustness of the resulting smoothed classifier. In this work, we propose
two cost-effective approaches to boost the robustness of randomized smoothing
while preserving its clean performance. The first approach introduces a new
robust training method AdvMacerwhich combines adversarial training and
robustness certification maximization for randomized smoothing. We show that
AdvMacer can improve the robustness performance of randomized smoothing
classifiers compared to SOTA baselines, while being 3x faster to train than
MACER baseline. The second approach introduces a post-processing method EsbRS
which greatly improves the robustness certificate based on building model
ensembles. We explore different aspects of model ensembles that has not been
studied by prior works and propose a novel design methodology to further
improve robustness of the ensemble based on our theoretical analysis.]]></summary>

node information such as texts, images, or labels has popularized methods that
require the costly operation of processing the entire graph. Yet, little effort
has been made to the development of fast local methods (i.e. without accessing
the entire graph) that extract useful information from such data. To that end,
we propose a study of local graph clustering using noisy node labels as a proxy
for additional node information. In this setting, nodes receive initial binary
labels based on cluster affiliation: 1 if they belong to the target cluster and
0 otherwise. Subsequently, a fraction of these labels is flipped. We
investigate the benefits of incorporating noisy labels for local graph
clustering. By constructing a weighted graph with such labels, we study the
performance of graph diffusion-based local clustering method on both the
original and the weighted graphs. From a theoretical perspective, we consider
recovering an unknown target cluster with a single seed node in a random graph
with independent noisy node labels. We provide sufficient conditions on the
label noise under which, with high probability, using diffusion in the weighted
graph yields a more accurate recovery of the target cluster. This approach
proves more effective than using the given labels alone or using diffusion in
the label-free original graph. Empirically, we show that reliable node labels
can be obtained with just a few samples from an attributed graph. Moreover,
utilizing these labels via diffusion in the weighted graph leads to
significantly better local clustering performance across several real-world
datasets, improving F1 scores by up to 13%.]]></summary>

gaining the ability to manipulate deformable vegetation can help with
occlusion-prone tasks, such as fruit picking in dense foliage, as well as
moving overhanging vines and branches for navigation in dense vegetation. The
underlying deformable tree geometry is encapsulated as coarse spring
abstractions executed on parallel, non-differentiable simulators. The implicit
statistical model defined by the simulator, reference trajectories obtained by
actively probing the ground truth, and the Bayesian formalism, together guide
the spring parameter posterior density estimation. Our non-parametric inference
algorithm, based on Stein Variational Gradient Descent, incorporates
biologically motivated assumptions into the inference process as neural network
driven learnt joint priors; moreover, it leverages the finite difference scheme
for gradient approximations. Real and simulated experiments confirm that our
model can predict deformation trajectories, quantify the estimation
uncertainty, and it can perform better when base-lined against other inference
algorithms, particularly from the Monte Carlo family. The model displays strong
robustness properties in the presence of heteroscedastic sensor noise;

be noticed and recognized, so that the window for clinical intervention could
be ignored. An effective prognostic model is expected to assist doctors in

promptly prevent unfavorable outcomes. However, in the early stage of a
disease, limited data collection and clinical experiences, plus the concern out
of privacy and ethics, may result in restricted data availability for
reference, to the extent that even data labels are difficult to mark correctly.
In addition, Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data of different diseases or of
different sources of the same disease can prove to be having serious
cross-dataset feature misalignment problems, greatly mutilating the efficiency
of deep learning models. This article introduces a transfer learning method to
build a transition model from source dataset to target dataset. By way of
constraining the distribution shift of features generated in disparate domains,
domain-invariant features that are exclusively relative to downstream tasks are
captured, so to cultivate a unified domain-invariant encoder across various
task domains to achieve better feature representation. Experimental results of

Although DT purports to generate an optimal trajectory, empirical evidence
suggests it struggles with trajectory stitching, a process involving the
generation of an optimal or near-optimal trajectory from the best parts of a
set of sub-optimal trajectories. The proposed EDT differentiates itself by
facilitating trajectory stitching during action inference at test time,
achieved by adjusting the history length maintained in DT. Further, the EDT
optimizes the trajectory by retaining a longer history when the previous
trajectory is optimal and a shorter one when it is sub-optimal, enabling it to
"stitch" with a more optimal trajectory. Extensive experimentation demonstrates
EDT's ability to bridge the performance gap between DT-based and Q
Learning-based approaches. In particular, the EDT outperforms Q Learning-based
methods in a multi-task regime on the D4RL locomotion benchmark and Atari

focused on situations with a known hypothesis class or model; however in
practice, some amount of model selection is usually involved, often appearing
under the umbrella term of hyperparameter-tuning: for example, one may think of
the problem of tuning for the right neural network architecture towards a
target task, while leveraging data from a related source task.

Now, in addition to the usual tradeoffs on approximation vs estimation errors
involved in model selection, this problem brings in a new complexity term,
namely, the transfer distance between source and target distributions, which is
known to vary with the choice of hypothesis class.

We present a first study of this problem, focusing on classification; in
particular, the analysis reveals some remarkable phenomena: adaptive rates,
i.e., those achievable with no distributional information, can be arbitrarily
slower than oracle rates, i.e., when given knowledge on distances.]]></summary>

the network size, trading desirable properties like generalization and
robustness to adversarial attacks for higher sparsity. Recent work has claimed
that adversarial pruning methods can produce sparse networks while also
preserving robustness to adversarial examples. In this work, we first
re-evaluate three state-of-the-art adversarial pruning methods, showing that
their robustness was indeed overestimated. We then compare pruned and dense
versions of the same models, discovering that samples on thin ice, i.e., closer

intricacies. Data-driven multiscale modeling has emerged as a promising
approach to tackle challenges associated with complex systems. On the other
hand, self-similarity is prevalent in complex systems, hinting that large-scale
complex systems can be modeled at a reduced cost. In this paper, we introduce a
multiscale neural network framework that incorporates self-similarity as prior
knowledge, facilitating the modeling of self-similar dynamical systems. For
deterministic dynamics, our framework can discern whether the dynamics are
self-similar. For uncertain dynamics, it can compare and determine which
parameter set is closer to self-similarity. The framework allows us to extract
scale-invariant kernels from the dynamics for modeling at any scale. Moreover,
our method can identify the power law exponents in self-similar systems.
Preliminary tests on the Ising model yielded critical exponents consistent with
theoretical expectations, providing valuable insights for addressing critical
phase transitions in non-equilibrium systems.]]></summary>

this metric, we perform experiments comprising 19 source languages and 133
target languages on three tasks (POS tagging, Dependency parsing, and NER). Our
analysis reveals that image-based models excel in cross-lingual transfer when
languages are closely related and share visually similar scripts. However, for
tasks biased toward word meaning (POS, NER), segmentation-based models prove to
be superior. Furthermore, in dependency parsing tasks where word relationships
play a crucial role, models with their character-level focus, outperform
others. Finally, we propose a recommendation scheme based on our findings to

aggregate level labels are available for groups of instances, called bags,
during training, and the aim is to get the best performance at the
instance-level on the test data. This setting arises in domains like
advertising and medicine due to privacy considerations. We propose a novel
algorithmic framework for this problem that iteratively performs two main
steps. For the first step (Pseudo Labeling) in every iteration, we define a
Gibbs distribution over binary instance labels that incorporates a) covariate
information through the constraint that instances with similar covariates
should have similar labels and b) the bag level aggregated label. We then use
Belief Propagation (BP) to marginalize the Gibbs distribution to obtain pseudo
labels. In the second step (Embedding Refinement), we use the pseudo labels to
provide supervision for a learner that yields a better embedding. Further, we
iterate on the two steps again by using the second step's embeddings as new
covariates for the next iteration. In the final iteration, a classifier is
trained using the pseudo labels. Our algorithm displays strong gains against
several SOTA baselines (up to 15%) for the LLP Binary Classification problem on
various dataset types - tabular and Image. We achieve these improvements with
minimal computational overhead above standard supervised learning due to Belief
Propagation, for large bag sizes, even for a million samples.]]></summary>

(PIML) inversion of geophysical data. The unifying equation is given by the
joint objective function $\epsilon$:

\begin{eqnarray} \epsilon^{||-PIML}&=&\lambda_1 \overbrace{||{\bf
W}^{ML}({\bf H}_{{\bf w}} {\bf d}^{obs}-{\bf m})||^2}^{NN} + \lambda_2

\end{eqnarray}where the optimal model ${\bf m}^*$ and weights $\bf w^*$
minimize $\epsilon$. Here, The matrix weights are given by the boldface symbol
$\bf W$, and full waveform inversion (FWI) is typically computed using a
finite-difference solution of the wave equation, where $\bf L$ represents the
forward modeling operation of the wave equation as a function of the model $\bf
m$. Also, a fully-connected neural network (NN) is used to compute the model
${\bf H_w}{\bf d}^{obs} \approx \bf m$ from the observed input data ${\bf
d}^{obs}$. The selection of weights $\lambda_i$ and the NN operations determine
one of four different PIML algorithms.

PIML offers potential advantages over standard FWI through its enhanced
ability to avoid local minima and the option to locally train the inversion
operator, minimizing the requirement for extensive training data for global
applicability. However, the effectiveness of PIML relies on the similarity
between the test and trained data. Nevertheless, a possible strategy to
overcome this limitation involves initial pretraining of a PIML architecture
with data from a broader region, followed by fine-tuning for specific data-a
method reminiscent of the way large language models are pretrained and adapted
for various tasks.]]></summary>

labeling and maximization-based generation that primarily operate at a token

work, we propose SimCKP, a simple contrastive learning framework that consists
of two stages: 1) An extractor-generator that extracts keyphrases by learning
context-aware phrase-level representations in a contrastive manner while also
generating keyphrases that do not appear in the document; 2) A reranker that
adapts scores for each generated phrase by likewise aligning their

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Existing literature on adversarial Machine Learning (ML) focuses either on
showing attacks that break every ML model, or defenses that withstand most
attacks. Unfortunately, little consideration is given to the actual feasibility
of the attack or the defense. Moreover, adversarial samples are often crafted
in the "feature-space", making the corresponding evaluations of questionable
value. Simply put, the current situation does not allow to estimate the actual
threat posed by adversarial attacks, leading to a lack of secure ML systems.

We aim to clarify such confusion in this paper. By considering the
application of ML for Phishing Website Detection (PWD), we formalize the
"evasion-space" in which an adversarial perturbation can be introduced to fool
a ML-PWD -- demonstrating that even perturbations in the "feature-space" are
useful. Then, we propose a realistic threat model describing evasion attacks
against ML-PWD that are cheap to stage, and hence intrinsically more attractive
for real phishers. After that, we perform the first statistically validated
assessment of state-of-the-art ML-PWD against 12 evasion attacks. Our
evaluation shows (i) the true efficacy of evasion attempts that are more likely
to occur; and (ii) the impact of perturbations crafted in different
evasion-spaces. Our realistic evasion attempts induce a statistically
significant degradation (3-10% at p<0.05), and their cheap cost makes them a
subtle threat. Notably, however, some ML-PWD are immune to our most realistic
attacks (p=0.22).

Finally, as an additional contribution of this journal publication, we are
the first to consider the intriguing case wherein an attacker introduces
perturbations in multiple evasion-spaces at the same time. These new results
show that simultaneously applying perturbations in the problem- and
feature-space can cause a drop in the detection rate from 0.95 to 0.]]></summary>

Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs). We are interested in algorithms
that are model-free, have low regret, and identify an optimal policy with a
high probability. Existing model-free algorithms for online CMDPs with
sublinear regret and constraint violation do not provide any convergence
guarantee to an optimal policy and provide only average performance guarantees
when a policy is uniformly sampled at random from all previously used policies.
In this paper, we develop a new algorithm, named
Pruning-Refinement-Identification (PRI), based on a fundamental structural
property of CMDPs we discover, called limited stochasticity. The property says
for a CMDP with $N$ constraints, there exists an optimal policy with at most
$N$ stochastic decisions.

The proposed algorithm first identifies at which step and in which state a
stochastic decision has to be taken and then fine-tunes the distributions of
these stochastic decisions. PRI achieves trio objectives: (i) PRI is a
model-free algorithm; and (ii) it outputs a near-optimal policy with a high
probability at the end of learning; and (iii) in the tabular setting, PRI
guarantees $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{K})$ regret and constraint violation,
which significantly improves the best existing regret bound
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(K^{\frac{4}{5}})$ under a model-free algorithm, where $K$

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the success of large-scale pretraining in NLP, there is an increasing
trend of applying it to the domain of life sciences. In particular, pretraining
methods based on DNA sequences have garnered growing attention due to their
potential to capture generic information about genes. However, existing
pretraining methods for DNA sequences largely rely on direct adoptions of BERT
pretraining from NLP, lacking a comprehensive understanding and a specifically
tailored approach. To address this research gap, we first conducted a series of
exploratory experiments and gained several insightful observations: 1) In the
fine-tuning phase of downstream tasks, when using K-mer overlapping
tokenization instead of K-mer non-overlapping tokenization, both overlapping
and non-overlapping pretraining weights show consistent performance
improvement.2) During the pre-training process, using K-mer overlapping
tokenization quickly produces clear K-mer embeddings and reduces the loss to a
very low level, while using K-mer non-overlapping tokenization results in less
distinct embeddings and continuously decreases the loss. 3) Using overlapping
tokenization causes the self-attention in the intermediate layers of
pre-trained models to tend to overly focus on certain tokens, reflecting that
these layers are not adequately optimized. In summary, overlapping tokenization
can benefit the fine-tuning of downstream tasks but leads to inadequate
pretraining with fast convergence. To unleash the pretraining potential, we
introduce a novel approach called RandomMask, which gradually increases the
task difficulty of BERT-like pretraining by continuously expanding its mask
boundary, forcing the model to learn more knowledge. RandomMask is simple but
effective, achieving top-tier performance across 26 datasets of 28 datasets
spanning 7 downstream tasks.]]></summary>

by experimental findings on vision transformers, we introduce novel assumptions
about the linear independence of input data, distinct from the commonly used
general-position assumption. Under these assumptions, we demonstrate that an
attention layer with $H$ heads, dimension $d$, and context size $n < d$,
featuring $\Theta(Hd^2)$ parameters, can memorize $\Omega(Hn)$ examples. Our
analysis sheds light on how different attention heads handle various example

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Benchmarking is a common method for evaluating trajectory prediction models
for autonomous driving. Existing benchmarks rely on datasets, which are biased
towards more common scenarios, such as cruising, and distance-based metrics
that are computed by averaging over all scenarios. Following such a regiment
provides a little insight into the properties of the models both in terms of
how well they can handle different scenarios and how admissible and diverse
their outputs are. There exist a number of complementary metrics designed to
measure the admissibility and diversity of trajectories, however, they suffer
from biases, such as length of trajectories.

In this paper, we propose a new benChmarking paRadIgm for evaluaTing
trajEctoRy predIction Approaches (CRITERIA). Particularly, we propose 1) a
method for extracting driving scenarios at varying levels of specificity
according to the structure of the roads, models' performance, and data
properties for fine-grained ranking of prediction models; 2) A set of new
bias-free metrics for measuring diversity, by incorporating the characteristics
of a given scenario, and admissibility, by considering the structure of roads
and kinematic compliancy, motivated by real-world driving constraints. 3) Using
the proposed benchmark, we conduct extensive experimentation on a
representative set of the prediction models using the large scale Argoverse
dataset. We show that the proposed benchmark can produce a more accurate
ranking of the models and serve as a means of characterizing their behavior. We
further present ablation studies to highlight contributions of different
elements that are used to compute the proposed metrics.]]></summary>

expensive and limited interactions is challenging and poses a need for
effective exploration. Motivated by complex navigation tasks that require
real-world training (when cheap simulators are not available), we consider an
agent that faces an unknown distribution of environments and must decide on an
exploration strategy. It may leverage a series of training environments to
improve its policy before it is evaluated in a test environment drawn from the
same environment distribution. Most existing approaches focus on fixed
exploration strategies, while the few that view exploration as a
meta-optimization problem tend to ignore the need for cost-efficient
exploration. We propose a cost-aware Bayesian optimization approach that
efficiently searches over a class of dynamic subgoal-based exploration
strategies. The algorithm adjusts a variety of levers -- the locations of the
subgoals, the length of each episode, and the number of replications per trial
-- in order to overcome the challenges of sparse rewards, expensive
interactions, and noise. An experimental evaluation demonstrates that the new
approach outperforms existing baselines across a number of problem domains. We
also provide a theoretical foundation and prove that the method asymptotically

items $m$ for sale to $n$ strategic bidders, whose valuations are drawn
independently from high-dimensional, unknown prior distributions. It is
well-known that optimal and even approximately-optimal mechanisms for this
setting are notoriously difficult to characterize or compute, and, even when
they can be found, are often rife with various counter-intuitive properties. In
this paper, following a model introduced recently by Cai and
Daskalakis~\cite{cai2022recommender}, we consider the case that bidders' prior
distributions can be well-approximated by a topic model. We design an active
learning component, responsible for interacting with the bidders and outputting
low-dimensional approximations of their types, and a mechanism design
component, responsible for robustifying mechanisms for the low-dimensional
model to work for the approximate types of the former component. On the active
learning front, we cast our problem in the framework of Randomized Linear
Algebra (RLA) for regression problems, allowing us to import several
breakthrough results from that line of research, and adapt them to our setting.
On the mechanism design front, we remove many restrictive assumptions of prior
work on the type of access needed to the underlying distributions and the
associated mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to
formulate connections between mechanism design, and RLA for active learning of
regression problems, opening the door for further applications of randomized
linear algebra primitives to mechanism design.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Current techniques for Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection predominantly rely
on quantifying predictive uncertainty and incorporating model regularization
during the training phase, using either real or synthetic OoD samples. However,
methods that utilize real OoD samples lack exploration and are prone to overfit
the OoD samples at hand. Whereas synthetic samples are often generated based on
features extracted from training data, rendering them less effective when the
training and OoD data are highly overlapped in the feature space. In this work,
we propose a Wasserstein-score-based generative adversarial training scheme to
enhance OoD detection accuracy, which, for the first time, performs data
augmentation and exploration simultaneously under the supervision of limited
OoD samples. Specifically, the generator explores OoD spaces and generates
synthetic OoD samples using feedback from the discriminator, while the
discriminator exploits both the observed and synthesized samples for OoD
detection using a predefined Wasserstein score. We provide theoretical
guarantees that the optimal solutions of our generative scheme are
statistically achievable through adversarial training in empirical settings. We
then demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art
techniques on various computer vision datasets and exhibits superior
generalizability to unseen OoD data.]]></summary>

Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA) is to provide a correct
answer to the question with the aid of external knowledge bases. Prior KB-VQA
models are usually formulated as a retriever-classifier framework, where a
pre-trained retriever extracts textual or visual information from knowledge
graphs and then makes a prediction among the candidates. Despite promising
progress, there are two drawbacks with existing models. Firstly, modeling
question-answering as multi-class classification limits the answer space to a
preset corpus and lacks the ability of flexible reasoning. Secondly, the
classifier merely consider "what is the answer" without "how to get the
answer", which cannot ground the answer to explicit reasoning paths. In this
paper, we confront the challenge of \emph{explainable open-set} KB-VQA, where
the system is required to answer questions with entities at wild and retain an
explainable reasoning path. To resolve the aforementioned issues, we propose a
new retriever-ranker paradigm of KB-VQA, Graph pATH rankER (GATHER for
brevity). Specifically, it contains graph constructing, pruning, and path-level
ranking, which not only retrieves accurate answers but also provides inference
paths that explain the reasoning process. To comprehensively evaluate our
model, we reformulate the benchmark dataset OK-VQA with manually corrected
entity-level annotations and release it as ConceptVQA. Extensive experiments on
real-world questions demonstrate that our framework is not only able to perform
open-set question answering across the whole knowledge base but provide
explicit reasoning path.]]></summary>

representations (a data point's representation is not directly affected by
other data points), our VIR borrows data with similar regression labels to
compute the latent representation's variational distribution; furthermore,
different from deterministic regression models producing point estimates, VIR
predicts the entire normal-inverse-gamma distributions and modulates the
associated conjugate distributions to impose probabilistic reweighting on the
imbalanced data, thereby providing better uncertainty estimation. Experiments
in several real-world datasets show that our VIR can outperform
state-of-the-art imbalanced regression models in terms of both accuracy and

as a serious threat to national security. Climate intervention methods, such as
stratospheric aerosol injection, have been proposed as mitigation strategies,
but the downstream effects of such actions on a complex climate system are not
well understood. The development of algorithmic techniques for quantifying
relationships between source and impact variables related to a climate event
(i.e., a climate pathway) would help inform policy decisions. Data-driven deep
learning models have become powerful tools for modeling highly nonlinear
relationships and may provide a route to characterize climate variable
relationships. In this paper, we explore the use of an echo state network (ESN)
for characterizing climate pathways. ESNs are a computationally efficient
neural network variation designed for temporal data, and recent work proposes
ESNs as a useful tool for forecasting spatio-temporal climate data. Like other
neural networks, ESNs are non-interpretable black-box models, which poses a
hurdle for understanding variable relationships. We address this issue by
developing feature importance methods for ESNs in the context of
spatio-temporal data to quantify variable relationships captured by the model.
We conduct a simulation study to assess and compare the feature importance
techniques, and we demonstrate the approach on reanalysis climate data. In the
climate application, we select a time period that includes the 1991 volcanic
eruption of Mount Pinatubo. This event was a significant stratospheric aerosol
injection, which we use as a proxy for an artificial stratospheric aerosol
injection. Using the proposed approach, we are able to characterize
relationships between pathway variables associated with this event.]]></summary>

topological analysis pipelines in a distributed-memory model. While several
recent papers introduced topology-based approaches for distributed-memory
environments, these were reporting experiments obtained with tailored,
mono-algorithm implementations. In contrast, we describe in this paper a
general-purpose, generic framework for topological analysis pipelines, i.e. a
sequence of topological algorithms interacting together, possibly on distinct
numbers of processes. Specifically, we instantiated our framework with the MPI
model, within the Topology ToolKit (TTK). While developing this framework, we
faced several algorithmic and software engineering challenges, which we
document in this paper. We provide a taxonomy for the distributed-memory
topological algorithms supported by TTK, depending on their communication needs
and provide examples of hybrid MPI+thread parallelizations. Detailed
performance analyses show that parallel efficiencies range from $20\%$ to
$80\%$ (depending on the algorithms), and that the MPI-specific preconditioning
introduced by our framework induces a negligible computation time overhead. We
illustrate the new distributed-memory capabilities of TTK with an example of
advanced analysis pipeline, combining multiple algorithms, run on the largest
publicly available dataset we have found (120 billion vertices) on a standard
cluster with 64 nodes (for a total of 1,536 cores). Finally, we provide a
roadmap for the completion of TTK's MPI extension, along with generic
recommendations for each algorithm communication category.]]></summary>

of the source and target data are substantially different. Despite its
practical importance in various learning problems, most of the existing methods
only focus on some specific learning tasks and are not well validated
theoretically and numerically. To tackle this problem, we propose a unified
analysis of general nonparametric methods in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space
(RKHS) under covariate shift. Our theoretical results are established for a
general loss belonging to a rich loss function family, which includes many
commonly used methods as special cases, such as mean regression, quantile
regression, likelihood-based classification, and margin-based classification.
Two types of covariate shift problems are the focus of this paper and the sharp
convergence rates are established for a general loss function to provide a
unified theoretical analysis, which concurs with the optimal results in
literature where the squared loss is used. Extensive numerical studies on
synthetic and real examples confirm our theoretical findings and further
illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background: Missing data is a common challenge in mass spectrometry-based
metabolomics, which can lead to biased and incomplete analyses. The integration
of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data with metabolomics data has emerged as a
promising approach to enhance the accuracy of data imputation in metabolomics
studies. Method: In this study, we propose a novel method that leverages the
information from WGS data and reference metabolites to impute unknown
metabolites. Our approach utilizes a multi-view variational autoencoder to
jointly model the burden score, polygenetic risk score (PGS), and linkage
disequilibrium (LD) pruned single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for feature
extraction and missing metabolomics data imputation. By learning the latent
representations of both omics data, our method can effectively impute missing
metabolomics values based on genomic information. Results: We evaluate the
performance of our method on empirical metabolomics datasets with missing
values and demonstrate its superiority compared to conventional imputation
techniques. Using 35 template metabolites derived burden scores, PGS and
LD-pruned SNPs, the proposed methods achieved r2-scores > 0.01 for 71.55% of
metabolites. Conclusion: The integration of WGS data in metabolomics imputation
not only improves data completeness but also enhances downstream analyses,
paving the way for more comprehensive and accurate investigations of metabolic
pathways and disease associations. Our findings offer valuable insights into
the potential benefits of utilizing WGS data for metabolomics data imputation
and underscore the importance of leveraging multi-modal data integration in
precision medicine research.]]></summary>

images (3,597 with COPD; 3,597 healthy controls) from 78 subjects (43 with
COPD; 35 healthy controls) were selected retrospectively (10.2018-12.2019) and
preprocessed. For each image, intensity values were manually clipped to the
emphysema window setting and a baseline 'full-range' window setting.
Class-balanced train, validation, and test sets contained 3,392, 1,114, and
2,688 images. The network backbone was optimized by comparing various CNN
architectures. Furthermore, automated WSO was implemented by adding a
customized layer to the model. The image-level area under the Receiver
Operating Characteristics curve (AUC) [lower, upper limit 95% confidence] was
utilized to compare model variations. Repeated inference (n=7) on the test set
showed that the DenseNet was the most efficient backbone and achieved a mean
AUC of 0.80 [0.76, 0.85] without WSO. Comparably, with input images manually
adjusted to the emphysema window, the DenseNet model predicted COPD with a mean
AUC of 0.86 [0.82, 0.89]. By adding a customized WSO layer to the DenseNet, an
optimal window in the proximity of the emphysema window setting was learned
automatically, and a mean AUC of 0.82 [0.78, 0.86] was achieved. Detection of

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Image-level weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) reduces the
usually vast data annotation cost by surrogate segmentation masks during
training. The typical approach involves training an image classification
network using global average pooling (GAP) on convolutional feature maps. This
enables the estimation of object locations based on class activation maps
(CAMs), which identify the importance of image regions. The CAMs are then used
to generate pseudo-labels, in the form of segmentation masks, to supervise a
segmentation model in the absence of pixel-level ground truth. Our work is
based on two techniques for improving CAMs; importance sampling, which is a
substitute for GAP, and the feature similarity loss, which utilizes a heuristic
that object contours almost always align with color edges in images. However,
both are based on the multinomial posterior with softmax, and implicitly assume
that classes are mutually exclusive, which turns out suboptimal in our
experiments. Thus, we reformulate both techniques based on binomial posteriors
of multiple independent binary problems. This has two benefits; their
performance is improved and they become more general, resulting in an add-on
method that can boost virtually any WSSS method. This is demonstrated on a wide
variety of baselines on the PASCAL VOC dataset, improving the region similarity
and contour quality of all implemented state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on
the MS COCO dataset show that our proposed add-on is well-suited for
large-scale settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/arvijj/hfpl.]]></summary>

learning problems. Much work has been done on extending decision tree learning
algorithms with differential privacy, a system that guarantees the privacy of
samples within the training data. However, current state-of-the-art algorithms
for this purpose sacrifice much utility for a small privacy benefit. These
solutions create random decision nodes that reduce decision tree accuracy or
spend an excessive share of the privacy budget on labeling leaves. Moreover,
many works do not support continuous features or leak information about them.
We propose a new method called PrivaTree based on private histograms that
chooses good splits while consuming a small privacy budget. The resulting trees
provide a significantly better privacy-utility trade-off and accept mixed
numerical and categorical data without leaking information about numerical
features. Finally, while it is notoriously hard to give robustness guarantees
against data poisoning attacks, we demonstrate bounds for the expected accuracy
and success rates of backdoor attacks against differentially-private learners.
By leveraging the better privacy-utility trade-off of PrivaTree we are able to
train decision trees with significantly better robustness against backdoor
attacks compared to regular decision trees and with meaningful theoretical

under uncertainty. One of the major dilemmas in Reinforcement Learning (RL)
where an autonomous agent has to balance two contrasting needs in making its
decisions is: exploiting the current knowledge of the environment to maximize
the cumulative reward as well as exploring actions that allow improving the
knowledge of the environment, hopefully leading to higher reward values
(exploration-exploitation trade-off). Concurrently, another relevant issue
regards the full observability of the states, which may not be assumed in all
applications. Such as when only 2D images are considered as input in a RL
approach used for finding the optimal action within a 3D simulation
environment. In this work, we address these issues by deploying and testing
several techniques to balance exploration and exploitation trade-off on
partially observable systems for predicting steering wheels in autonomous
driving scenario. More precisely, the final aim is to investigate the effects
of using both stochastic and deterministic multi-armed bandit strategies
coupled with a Deep Recurrent Q-Network. Additionally, we adapted and evaluated
the impact of an innovative method to improve the learning phase of the
underlying Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network. We aim to show that adaptive
stochastic methods for exploration better approximate the trade-off between
exploration and exploitation as, in general, Softmax and Max-Boltzmann

deep neural networks, current UDA models are opaque and cannot provide
promising explanations, limiting their applications in the scenarios that
require safe and controllable model decisions. At present, a surge of work
focuses on designing deep interpretable methods with adequate data annotations
and only a few methods consider the distributional shift problem. Most existing
interpretable UDA methods are post-hoc ones, which cannot facilitate the model
learning process for performance enhancement. In this paper, we propose an
inherently interpretable method, named Transferable Conceptual Prototype
Learning (TCPL), which could simultaneously interpret and improve the processes
of knowledge transfer and decision-making in UDA. To achieve this goal, we
design a hierarchically prototypical module that transfers categorical basic
concepts from the source domain to the target domain and learns domain-shared
prototypes for explaining the underlying reasoning process. With the learned
transferable prototypes, a self-predictive consistent pseudo-label strategy
that fuses confidence, predictions, and prototype information, is designed for
selecting suitable target samples for pseudo annotations and gradually
narrowing down the domain gap. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed
method can not only provide effective and intuitive explanations but also

Graph-SCP on synthetic weighted and unweighted SCP instances with diverse

a canonical benchmark for SCP. We show that Graph-SCP reduces the problem size

upon it or even achieve 100% optimality. This is in contrast to fast greedy
solutions that significantly compromise solution quality to achieve guaranteed

expensive black-box functions. However, their performance is heavily influenced
by hyperparameters related to sampling and surrogate fitting, which poses a
challenge to their widespread adoption. We investigate the impact of
hyperparameters on various SO algorithms and propose a Hyperparameter Adaptive
Search for SO (HASSO) approach. HASSO is not a hyperparameter tuning algorithm,
but a generic self-adjusting SO algorithm that dynamically tunes its own
hyperparameters while concurrently optimizing the primary objective function,
without requiring additional evaluations. The aim is to improve the
accessibility, effectiveness, and convergence speed of SO algorithms for
practitioners. Our approach identifies and modifies the most influential
hyperparameters specific to each problem and SO approach, reducing the need for
manual tuning without significantly increasing the computational burden.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HASSO in enhancing the
performance of various SO algorithms across different global optimization test
problems.]]></summary>

TD($\lambda$), a potent variant, incorporates a memory trace to distribute the

neglects the significance of historical states and the relative importance of
propagating the TD error, influenced by challenges such as visitation imbalance

discerning TD learning (DTD), which allows flexible emphasis

learning methods for processing, modeling, or synthesizing data. Often, this
data comprises variables that inherently carry geometric constraints, such as
the unit-norm condition of quaternions representing rigid-body orientations or
the positive definiteness of stiffness and manipulability ellipsoids. Handling
such geometric constraints effectively requires the incorporation of tools from
differential geometry into the formulation of machine learning methods. In this
context, Riemannian manifolds emerge as a powerful mathematical framework to
handle such geometric constraints. Nevertheless, their recent adoption in robot
learning has been largely characterized by a mathematically-flawed
simplification, hereinafter referred to as the ``single tangent space fallacy".
This approach involves merely projecting the data of interest onto a single
tangent (Euclidean) space, over which an off-the-shelf learning algorithm is
applied. This paper provides a theoretical elucidation of various
misconceptions surrounding this approach and offers experimental evidence of
its shortcomings. Finally, it presents valuable insights to promote best

their surging performance and has further led to the emergence of sophisticated

substantially reducing the training time compared to training from scratch.
Notably, LEMON is versatile, ensuring compatibility with various network

processes (MDPs) under the linear $q^\pi$-realizability assumption, where it is
assumed that the action-values of all policies can be expressed as linear
functions of state-action features. This class is known to be more general than
linear MDPs, where the transition kernel and the reward function are assumed to
be linear functions of the feature vectors. As our first contribution, we show
that the difference between the two classes is the presence of states in
linearly $q^\pi$-realizable MDPs where for any policy, all the actions have
approximately equal values, and skipping over these states by following an
arbitrarily fixed policy in those states transforms the problem to a linear
MDP. Based on this observation, we derive a novel (computationally inefficient)
learning algorithm for linearly $q^\pi$-realizable MDPs that simultaneously
learns what states should be skipped over and runs another learning algorithm
on the linear MDP hidden in the problem. The method returns an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy after $\text{polylog}(H, d)/\epsilon^2$ interactions
with the MDP, where $H$ is the time horizon and $d$ is the dimension of the
feature vectors, giving the first polynomial-sample-complexity online RL
algorithm for this setting. The results are proved for the misspecified case,
where the sample complexity is shown to degrade gracefully with the
misspecification error.]]></summary>

series forecasting as next-token prediction in text. Developing this approach,
we find that large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 can
surprisingly zero-shot extrapolate time series at a level comparable to or
exceeding the performance of purpose-built time series models trained on the
downstream tasks. To facilitate this performance, we propose procedures for
effectively tokenizing time series data and converting discrete distributions
over tokens into highly flexible densities over continuous values. We argue the
success of LLMs for time series stems from their ability to naturally represent
multimodal distributions, in conjunction with biases for simplicity, and
repetition, which align with the salient features in many time series, such as
repeated seasonal trends. We also show how LLMs can naturally handle missing
data without imputation through non-numerical text, accommodate textual side
information, and answer questions to help explain predictions. While we find
that increasing model size generally improves performance on time series, we
show GPT-4 can perform worse than GPT-3 because of how it tokenizes numbers,

(ASVs), mainly when used in confined spaces, to carry out surveys that require
the ASV to keep its position or in collaboration with other vehicles where the
relative position has an impact over the mission. However, this maneuver can
become challenging for classic feedback controllers due to the need for an
accurate model of the ASV dynamics and the environmental disturbances. This
work proposes a Model Predictive Controller using Neural Network Simulation
Error Minimization (NNSEM-MPC) to accurately predict the dynamics of the ASV
under wind disturbances. The performance of the proposed scheme under wind
disturbances is tested and compared against other controllers in simulation,
using the Robotics Operating System (ROS) and the multipurpose simulation
environment Gazebo. A set of six tests were conducted by combining two wind
speeds (3 m/s and 6 m/s) and three wind directions (0$^\circ$, 90$^\circ$, and
180$^\circ$). The simulation results clearly show the advantage of the
NNSEM-MPC over the following methods: backstepping controller, sliding mode
controller, simplified dynamics MPC (SD-MPC), neural ordinary differential
equation MPC (NODE-MPC), and knowledge-based NODE MPC (KNODE-MPC). The proposed
NNSEM-MPC approach performs better than the rest in 4 out of the 6 test
conditions, and it is the second best in the 2 remaining test cases, reducing
the mean position and heading error by at least 31\% and 46\% respectively
across all the test cases. In terms of execution speed, the proposed NNSEM-MPC
is at least 36\% faster than the rest of the MPC controllers. The field
experiments on two different ASV platforms showed that ASVs can effectively
keep the station utilizing the proposed method, with a position error as low as
$1.68$ m and a heading error as low as $6.14^{\circ}$ within time windows of at

policies for both task-oriented navigation (i.e., reaching a goal that the
robot has located), and task-agnostic exploration (i.e., searching for a goal
in a novel setting). Typically, these roles are handled by separate models, for
example by using subgoal proposals, planning, or separate navigation
strategies. In this paper, we describe how we can train a single unified
diffusion policy to handle both goal-directed navigation and goal-agnostic
exploration, with the latter providing the ability to search novel
environments, and the former providing the ability to reach a user-specified
goal once it has been located. We show that this unified policy results in
better overall performance when navigating to visually indicated goals in novel
environments, as compared to approaches that use subgoal proposals from
generative models, or prior methods based on latent variable models. We
instantiate our method by using a large-scale Transformer-based policy trained
on data from multiple ground robots, with a diffusion model decoder to flexibly
handle both goal-conditioned and goal-agnostic navigation. Our experiments,
conducted on a real-world mobile robot platform, show effective navigation in
unseen environments in comparison with five alternative methods, and
demonstrate significant improvements in performance and lower collision rates,
despite utilizing smaller models than state-of-the-art approaches. For more

promise high computational efficiency. While the algorithms are sound in theory
and can provide potentially exponential speedup, there is little guidance on
how to design proper quantum circuits to realize the appropriate unitary

present \texttt{QArchSearch}, an AI based quantum architecture search package
with the \texttt{QTensor} library as a backend that provides a principled and
automated approach to finding the best model given a task and input quantum
state. We show that the search package is able to efficiently scale the search
to large quantum circuits and enables the exploration of more complex models
for different quantum applications. \texttt{QArchSearch} runs at scale and high

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learning rate schedules used in practice bear little resemblance to those
recommended by theory. We close much of this theory/practice gap, and as a
consequence are able to derive new problem-adaptive learning rate schedules.
Our key technical contribution is a refined analysis of learning rate schedules
for a wide class of optimization algorithms (including SGD). In contrast to
most prior works that study the convergence of the average iterate, we study
the last iterate, which is what most people use in practice. When considering
only worst-case analysis, our theory predicts that the best choice is the
linear decay schedule: a popular choice in practice that sets the stepsize
proportionally to $1 - t/T$, where $t$ is the current iteration and $T$ is the
total number of steps. To go beyond this worst-case analysis, we use the
observed gradient norms to derive schedules refined for any particular task.
These refined schedules exhibit learning rate warm-up and rapid learning rate
annealing near the end of training. Ours is the first systematic approach to
automatically yield both of these properties. We perform the most comprehensive
evaluation of learning rate schedules to date, evaluating across 10 diverse
deep learning problems, a series of LLMs, and a suite of logistic regression
problems. We validate that overall, the linear-decay schedule matches or
outperforms all commonly used default schedules including cosine annealing, and
that our schedule refinement method gives further improvements.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fully-connected deep neural networks with weights initialized from
independent Gaussian distributions can be tuned to criticality, which prevents
the exponential growth or decay of signals propagating through the network.
However, such networks still exhibit fluctuations that grow linearly with the
depth of the network, which may impair the training of networks with width
comparable to depth. We show analytically that rectangular networks with tanh
activations and weights initialized from the ensemble of orthogonal matrices
have corresponding preactivation fluctuations which are independent of depth,
to leading order in inverse width. Moreover, we demonstrate numerically that,
at initialization, all correlators involving the neural tangent kernel (NTK)
and its descendants at leading order in inverse width -- which govern the
evolution of observables during training -- saturate at a depth of $\sim 20$,
rather than growing without bound as in the case of Gaussian initializations.
We speculate that this structure preserves finite-width feature learning while
reducing overall noise, thus improving both generalization and training speed.
We provide some experimental justification by relating empirical measurements
of the NTK to the superior performance of deep nonlinear orthogonal networks
trained under full-batch gradient descent on the MNIST and CIFAR-10
classification tasks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A common approach to explain NLP models, is to use importance measures that
express which tokens are important for a prediction. Unfortunately, such
explanations are often wrong despite being persuasive. Therefore, it is
essential to measure their faithfulness. One such metric is if tokens are truly
important, then masking them should result in worse model performance. However,
token masking introduces out-of-distribution issues and existing solutions are
computationally expensive and employ proxy-models. Furthermore, other metrics
are very limited in scope. In this work, we propose an inherently faithfulness
measurable model that addresses these challenges. This is achieved by using a
novel fine-tuning method that incorporates masking, such that masking tokens
become in-distribution by design. This differs from existing approaches, which
are completely model-agnostic but are inapplicable in practice. We demonstrate
the generality of our approach by applying it to various tasks and validate it
using statistical in-distribution tests. Additionally, because masking is
in-distribution, importance measures which themselves use masking become more
faithful, thus our model becomes more explainable.]]></summary>

exploiting the transformation invariance assumption under artificially designed
data augmentations. While augmentation-based SSRL algorithms push the
boundaries of performance in computer vision and natural language processing,
they are often not directly applicable to other data modalities, and can
conflict with application-specific data augmentation constraints. This paper
presents an SSRL approach that can be applied to any data modality and network
architecture because it does not rely on augmentations or masking.
Specifically, we show that high-quality data representations can be learned by
reconstructing random data projections. We evaluate the proposed approach on a
wide range of representation learning tasks that span diverse modalities and
real-world applications. We show that it outperforms multiple state-of-the-art
SSRL baselines. Due to its wide applicability and strong empirical results, we
argue that learning from randomness is a fruitful research direction worthy of
attention and further study.]]></summary>

policies from observed actions; however, existing models fall short by forcing
a tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability. This tradeoff limits
data-driven interpretations of human decision-making process. e.g. to audit
medical decisions for biases and suboptimal practices, we require models of
decision processes which provide concise descriptions of complex behaviors.
Fundamentally, existing approaches are burdened by this tradeoff because they
represent the underlying decision process as a universal policy, when in fact
human decisions are dynamic and can change drastically with contextual
information. Thus, we propose Contextualized Policy Recovery (CPR), which
re-frames the problem of modeling complex decision processes as a multi-task
learning problem in which complex decision policies are comprised of
context-specific policies. CPR models each context-specific policy as a linear
observation-to-action mapping, and generates new decision models
$\textit{on-demand}$ as contexts are updated with new observations. CPR is
compatible with fully offline and partially observable decision environments,
and can be tailored to incorporate any recurrent black-box model or
interpretable decision model. We assess CPR through studies on simulated and
real data, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the canonical tasks of
predicting antibiotic prescription in intensive care units ($+22\%$ AUROC vs.
previous SOTA) and predicting MRI prescription for Alzheimer's patients
($+7.7\%$ AUROC vs. previous SOTA). With this improvement in predictive
performance, CPR closes the accuracy gap between interpretable and black-box
methods for policy learning, allowing high-resolution exploration and analysis

to overfit. Understanding why this happens is theoretically and practically
important. One recent approach looks at the infinitely wide limits of such
networks and their corresponding kernels. However, these theoretical tools
cannot fully explain finite networks as the empirical kernel changes
significantly during gradient-descent-based training in contrast to infinite
networks. In this work, we derive an iterative linearised training method as a
novel empirical tool to further investigate this distinction, allowing us to
control for sparse (i.e. infrequent) feature updates and quantify the frequency
of feature learning needed to achieve comparable performance. We justify
iterative linearisation as an interpolation between a finite analog of the
infinite width regime, which does not learn features, and standard gradient
descent training, which does. Informally, we also show that it is analogous to
a damped version of the Gauss-Newton algorithm -- a second-order method. We
show that in a variety of cases, iterative linearised training surprisingly
performs on par with standard training, noting in particular how much less
frequent feature learning is required to achieve comparable performance. We
also show that feature learning is essential for good performance. Since such
feature learning inevitably causes changes in the NTK kernel, we provide direct
negative evidence for the NTK theory, which states the NTK kernel remains
constant during training.]]></summary>

focused on situations with a known hypothesis class or model; however in
practice, some amount of model selection is usually involved, often appearing
under the umbrella term of hyperparameter-tuning: for example, one may think of
the problem of tuning for the right neural network architecture towards a
target task, while leveraging data from a related source task.

Now, in addition to the usual tradeoffs on approximation vs estimation errors
involved in model selection, this problem brings in a new complexity term,
namely, the transfer distance between source and target distributions, which is
known to vary with the choice of hypothesis class.

We present a first study of this problem, focusing on classification; in
particular, the analysis reveals some remarkable phenomena: adaptive rates,
i.e., those achievable with no distributional information, can be arbitrarily
slower than oracle rates, i.e., when given knowledge on distances.]]></summary>

success of deep neural networks. It is rigorously known that in two-layer
fully-connected neural networks under certain conditions, one step of gradient
descent on the first layer followed by ridge regression on the second layer can
lead to feature learning; characterized by the appearance of a separated
rank-one component -- spike -- in the spectrum of the feature matrix. However,
with a constant gradient descent step size, this spike only carries information
from the linear component of the target function and therefore learning
non-linear components is impossible. We show that with a learning rate that
grows with the sample size, such training in fact introduces multiple rank-one
components, each corresponding to a specific polynomial feature. We further
prove that the limiting large-dimensional and large sample training and test
errors of the updated neural networks are fully characterized by these spikes.
By precisely analyzing the improvement in the loss, we demonstrate that these
non-linear features can enhance learning.]]></summary>

Additionally, we model the additive and multiplicative background functions for
Raman and CARS with Gaussian processes. We train two Bayesian neural networks
to estimate parameters of the gamma process which can then be used to estimate
the underlying Raman spectrum and simultaneously provide uncertainty through
the estimation of parameters of a probability distribution. We apply the
trained Bayesian neural networks to experimental Raman spectra of
phthalocyanine blue, aniline black, naphthol red, and red 264 pigments and also

This unique capability allows us to train the policy solely based on RGB videos

outcomes across various tasks. However, the current design landscape of the
forward diffusion process remains largely untapped and often relies on physical
heuristics or simplifying assumptions. Utilizing insights from the development
of scalable Bayesian posterior samplers, we present a complete recipe for
formulating forward processes in SGMs, ensuring convergence to the desired
target distribution. Our approach reveals that several existing SGMs can be
seen as specific manifestations of our framework. Building upon this method, we
introduce Phase Space Langevin Diffusion (PSLD), which relies on score-based
modeling within an augmented space enriched by auxiliary variables akin to
physical phase space. Empirical results exhibit the superior sample quality and
improved speed-quality trade-off of PSLD compared to various competing
approaches on established image synthesis benchmarks. Remarkably, PSLD achieves
sample quality akin to state-of-the-art SGMs (FID: 2.10 for unconditional
CIFAR-10 generation). Lastly, we demonstrate the applicability of PSLD in
conditional synthesis using pre-trained score networks, offering an appealing
alternative as an SGM backbone for future advancements. Code and model

advantages in correcting for this optimizer's curse compared to simple
``margin'' adjustments to SAA and other DRO approaches: It attains a
statistical bound on the out-of-sample performance, for a wide class of
objective functions and distributions, that is nearly tightest in terms of
exponential decay rate. This DRO uses an ambiguity set based on a Kullback
Leibler (KL) divergence smoothed by the Wasserstein or L\'evy-Prokhorov (LP)
distance via a suitable distance optimization. Computationally, we also show
that such a DRO, and its generalized versions using smoothed $f$-divergence,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learning rate schedules used in practice bear little resemblance to those
recommended by theory. We close much of this theory/practice gap, and as a
consequence are able to derive new problem-adaptive learning rate schedules.
Our key technical contribution is a refined analysis of learning rate schedules
for a wide class of optimization algorithms (including SGD). In contrast to
most prior works that study the convergence of the average iterate, we study
the last iterate, which is what most people use in practice. When considering
only worst-case analysis, our theory predicts that the best choice is the
linear decay schedule: a popular choice in practice that sets the stepsize
proportionally to $1 - t/T$, where $t$ is the current iteration and $T$ is the
total number of steps. To go beyond this worst-case analysis, we use the
observed gradient norms to derive schedules refined for any particular task.
These refined schedules exhibit learning rate warm-up and rapid learning rate
annealing near the end of training. Ours is the first systematic approach to
automatically yield both of these properties. We perform the most comprehensive
evaluation of learning rate schedules to date, evaluating across 10 diverse
deep learning problems, a series of LLMs, and a suite of logistic regression
problems. We validate that overall, the linear-decay schedule matches or
outperforms all commonly used default schedules including cosine annealing, and
that our schedule refinement method gives further improvements.]]></summary>

specifically focusing on Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). We investigate the
well-specific model where the random noise possesses a zero mean, and the link
function is both bounded and Lipschitz continuous. We propose several
algorithms and our analysis demonstrates the feasibility of achieving an excess

into the scenario involving the ReLU link function, and our findings mirror
those of the bounded link function. We conclude this section by contrasting
well-specified and misspecified models, using ReLU regression as a
representative example.

In the second part of the paper, we extend our ideas to two-layer neural
networks with sigmoid or ReLU activation functions in the well-specified model.
In the third part, we study the theoretical guarantees of DP-SGD in Abadi et

generating samples, from seemingly high dimensional probability measures.
However, these methods struggle to capture the temporal dependence of joint
probability distributions induced by time-series data. Furthermore, long
time-series data streams hugely increase the dimension of the target space,
which may render generative modelling infeasible. To overcome these challenges,
motivated by the autoregressive models in econometric, we are interested in the
conditional distribution of future time series given the past information. We
propose the generic conditional Sig-WGAN framework by integrating
Wasserstein-GANs (WGANs) with mathematically principled and efficient path
feature extraction called the signature of a path. The signature of a path is a
graded sequence of statistics that provides a universal description for a
stream of data, and its expected value characterises the law of the time-series
model. In particular, we develop the conditional Sig-$W_1$ metric, that
captures the conditional joint law of time series models, and use it as a
discriminator. The signature feature space enables the explicit representation
of the proposed discriminators which alleviates the need for expensive
training. We validate our method on both synthetic and empirical dataset and
observe that our method consistently and significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art benchmarks with respect to measures of similarity and

whereas standard methods typically treat de facto ordered continuous variables
as discrete, (2) instead of estimating response-dependent finite coefficients
of linear models from discrete responses as is done in conventional approaches,
we train a non-linear neural network to serve as a coefficient function. Thanks
to the neural network, N$^3$POM offers flexibility while preserving the
interpretability of conventional ordinal regression. We establish a sufficient
condition under which the predicted conditional cumulative probability locally
satisfies the monotonicity constraint over a user-specified region in the

uncertainty estimation when the label distribution is imbalanced. In this
paper, we propose a probabilistic deep learning model, dubbed variational
imbalanced regression (VIR), which not only performs well in imbalanced
regression but naturally produces reasonable uncertainty estimation as a
byproduct. Different from typical variational autoencoders assuming I.I.D.
representations (a data point's representation is not directly affected by
other data points), our VIR borrows data with similar regression labels to
compute the latent representation's variational distribution; furthermore,
different from deterministic regression models producing point estimates, VIR
predicts the entire normal-inverse-gamma distributions and modulates the
associated conjugate distributions to impose probabilistic reweighting on the
imbalanced data, thereby providing better uncertainty estimation. Experiments
in several real-world datasets show that our VIR can outperform
state-of-the-art imbalanced regression models in terms of both accuracy and
uncertainty estimation. Code will soon be available at

without requiring additional evaluations. The aim is to improve the
accessibility, effectiveness, and convergence speed of SO algorithms for
practitioners. Our approach identifies and modifies the most influential

$x\in S^{n-1}$ within an $\epsilon$ error (in $\ell_2$) from minimal number of
linear measurements that are quantized to just their signs, i.e., from
measurements of the form $y = \mathrm{Sign}(\langle a, x\rangle).$ In this
paper, we study a noisy version where a fraction of the measurements can be
flipped, potentially by an adversary. In particular, we analyze the Binary
Iterative Hard Thresholding (BIHT) algorithm, a proximal gradient descent on a
properly defined loss function used for 1-bit compressed sensing, in this noisy
setting. It is known from recent results that, with
$\tilde{O}(\frac{k}{\epsilon})$ noiseless measurements, BIHT provides an
estimate within $\epsilon$ error. This result is optimal and universal, meaning
one set of measurements work for all sparse vectors. In this paper, we show
that BIHT also provides better results than all known methods for the noisy
setting. We show that when up to $\tau$-fraction of the sign measurements are
incorrect (adversarial error), with the same number of measurements as before,
BIHT agnostically provides an estimate of $x$ within an
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon+\tau)$ error, maintaining the universality of measurements.
This establishes stability of iterative hard thresholding in the presence of
measurement error. To obtain the result, we use the restricted approximate
invertibility of Gaussian matrices, as well as a tight analysis of the
high-dimensional geometry of the adversarially corrupted measurements.]]></summary>

for these time series are required to be coherent, that is, to satisfy the

coherence is called reconciliation, which adjusts the base forecasts computed
for each time series. However, recent works on probabilistic reconciliation
present several limitations. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on
conditioning to reconcile any type of forecast distribution. We then introduce
a new algorithm, called Bottom-Up Importance Sampling, to efficiently sample
from the reconciled distribution. It can be used for any base forecast

training data. To understand this phenomenon, many works have aimed to quantify
the memorization capacity of a neural network architecture: the largest number
of points such that the architecture can interpolate any placement of these
points with any assignment of labels. For real-world data, however, one
intuitively expects the presence of a benign structure so that interpolation
already occurs at a smaller network size than suggested by memorization
capacity. In this paper, we investigate interpolation by adopting an
instance-specific viewpoint. We introduce a simple randomized algorithm that,
given a fixed finite dataset with two classes, with high probability constructs
an interpolating three-layer neural network in polynomial time. The required
number of parameters is linked to geometric properties of the two classes and
their mutual arrangement. As a result, we obtain guarantees that are
independent of the number of samples and hence move beyond worst-case
memorization capacity bounds. We illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm
in non-pathological situations with extensive numerical experiments and link
the insights back to the theoretical results.]]></summary>

the unobservable joint distribution between potential outcomes. Stratification
on pretreatment covariates can yield sharper partial identification bounds;
however, unless the covariates are discrete with relatively small support, this
approach typically requires consistent estimation of the conditional
distributions of the potential outcomes given the covariates. Thus, existing
approaches may fail under model misspecification or if consistency assumptions
are violated. In this study, we propose a unified and model-agnostic
inferential approach for a wide class of partially identified estimands, based
on duality theory for optimal transport problems. In randomized experiments,
our approach can wrap around any estimates of the conditional distributions and
provide uniformly valid inference, even if the initial estimates are
arbitrarily inaccurate. Also, our approach is doubly robust in observational
studies. Notably, this property allows analysts to use the multiplier bootstrap
to select covariates and models without sacrificing validity even if the true
model is not included. Furthermore, if the conditional distributions are
estimated at semiparametric rates, our approach matches the performance of an
oracle with perfect knowledge of the outcome model. Finally, we propose an
efficient computational framework, enabling implementation on many practical
problems in causal inference.]]></summary>

algorithms for the generative modeling of temporal densities, we propose a
cheap alternative which requires minimal hyperparameter tuning and scales
favorably to high dimensional problems. In particular, we use a
projection-based optimal transport solver [Meng et al., 2019] to join
successive samples and subsequently use transport splines [Chewi et al., 2020]
to interpolate the evolving density. When the sampling frequency is
sufficiently high, the optimal maps are close to the identity and are thus
computationally efficient to compute. Moreover, the training process is highly
parallelizable as all optimal maps are independent and can thus be learned
simultaneously. Finally, the approach is based solely on numerical linear
algebra rather than minimizing a nonconvex objective function, allowing us to
easily analyze and control the algorithm. We present several numerical
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the
efficiency of our method. In particular, these experiments show that the
proposed approach is highly competitive compared with state-of-the-art
normalizing flows conditioned on time across a wide range of dimensionalities.]]></summary>

processes (MDPs) under the linear $q^\pi$-realizability assumption, where it is
assumed that the action-values of all policies can be expressed as linear
functions of state-action features. This class is known to be more general than
linear MDPs, where the transition kernel and the reward function are assumed to
be linear functions of the feature vectors. As our first contribution, we show
that the difference between the two classes is the presence of states in
linearly $q^\pi$-realizable MDPs where for any policy, all the actions have
approximately equal values, and skipping over these states by following an
arbitrarily fixed policy in those states transforms the problem to a linear
MDP. Based on this observation, we derive a novel (computationally inefficient)
learning algorithm for linearly $q^\pi$-realizable MDPs that simultaneously
learns what states should be skipped over and runs another learning algorithm
on the linear MDP hidden in the problem. The method returns an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy after $\text{polylog}(H, d)/\epsilon^2$ interactions
with the MDP, where $H$ is the time horizon and $d$ is the dimension of the
feature vectors, giving the first polynomial-sample-complexity online RL
algorithm for this setting. The results are proved for the misspecified case,
where the sample complexity is shown to degrade gracefully with the

obtained as a result of principal component analysis, among many others. In
this work we investigate prediction sets for regression scenarios when the
response variable, denoted by $Y$, resides in a manifold, and the covariable,
denoted by X, lies in Euclidean space. This extends the concepts delineated in
[Lei and Wasserman, 2014] to this novel context. Aligning with traditional
principles in conformal inference, these prediction sets are distribution-free,
indicating that no specific assumptions are imposed on the joint distribution
of $(X, Y)$, and they maintain a non-parametric character. We prove the
asymptotic almost sure convergence of the empirical version of these regions on
the manifold to their population counterparts. The efficiency of this method is

node information such as texts, images, or labels has popularized methods that
require the costly operation of processing the entire graph. Yet, little effort
has been made to the development of fast local methods (i.e. without accessing
the entire graph) that extract useful information from such data. To that end,
we propose a study of local graph clustering using noisy node labels as a proxy
for additional node information. In this setting, nodes receive initial binary
labels based on cluster affiliation: 1 if they belong to the target cluster and
0 otherwise. Subsequently, a fraction of these labels is flipped. We
investigate the benefits of incorporating noisy labels for local graph
clustering. By constructing a weighted graph with such labels, we study the
performance of graph diffusion-based local clustering method on both the
original and the weighted graphs. From a theoretical perspective, we consider
recovering an unknown target cluster with a single seed node in a random graph
with independent noisy node labels. We provide sufficient conditions on the
label noise under which, with high probability, using diffusion in the weighted
graph yields a more accurate recovery of the target cluster. This approach
proves more effective than using the given labels alone or using diffusion in
the label-free original graph. Empirically, we show that reliable node labels
can be obtained with just a few samples from an attributed graph. Moreover,
utilizing these labels via diffusion in the weighted graph leads to
significantly better local clustering performance across several real-world
datasets, improving F1 scores by up to 13%.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multiple data views measured on the same set of participants is becoming more
common and has the potential to deepen our understanding of many complex
diseases by analyzing these different views simultaneously. Equally important,
many of these complex diseases show evidence of subgroup heterogeneity (e.g.,
by sex or race). HIP (Heterogeneity in Integration and Prediction) is among the
first methods proposed to integrate multiple data views while also accounting
for subgroup heterogeneity to identify common and subgroup-specific markers of
a particular disease. However, HIP is applicable to continuous outcomes and
requires programming expertise by the user. Here we propose extensions to HIP
that accommodate multi-class, Poisson, and Zero-Inflated Poisson outcomes while
retaining the benefits of HIP. Additionally, we introduce an R Shiny
application, accessible on shinyapps.io at
https://multi-viewlearn.shinyapps.io/HIP_ShinyApp/, that provides an interface
with the Python implementation of HIP to allow more researchers to use the
method anywhere and on any device. We applied HIP to identify genes and
proteins common and specific to males and females that are associated with
exacerbation frequency. Although some of the identified genes and proteins show
evidence of a relationship with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in
existing literature, others may be candidates for future research investigating
their relationship with COPD. We demonstrate the use of the Shiny application
with a publicly available data. An R-package for HIP would be made available at
https://github.com/lasandrall/HIP.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lion (Evolved Sign Momentum), a new optimizer discovered through program
search, has shown promising results in training large AI models. It performs
comparably or favorably to AdamW but with greater memory efficiency. As we can
expect from the results of a random search program, Lion incorporates elements
from several existing algorithms, including signed momentum, decoupled weight
decay, Polak, and Nesterov momentum, but does not fit into any existing
category of theoretically grounded optimizers. Thus, even though Lion appears
to perform well as a general-purpose optimizer for a wide range of tasks, its
theoretical basis remains uncertain. This lack of theoretical clarity limits
opportunities to further enhance and expand Lion's efficacy.

This work aims to demystify Lion. Based on both continuous-time and
discrete-time analysis, we demonstrate that Lion is a theoretically novel and
principled approach for minimizing a general loss function $f(x)$ while
enforcing a bound constraint $\|x\|_\infty \leq 1/\lambda$. Lion achieves this
through the incorporation of decoupled weight decay, where $\lambda$ represents
the weight decay coefficient. Our analysis is made possible by the development
of a new Lyapunov function for the Lion updates. It applies to a broader family
of Lion-$\kappa$ algorithms, where the $\text{sign}(\cdot)$ operator in Lion is
replaced by the subgradient of a convex function $\kappa$, leading to the
solution of a general composite optimization problem of $\min_x f(x) +
\kappa^*(x)$. Our findings provide valuable insights into the dynamics of Lion
and pave the way for further improvements and extensions of Lion-related
algorithms.]]></summary>

datasets have demonstrated remarkable in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL)
capabilities, where they can make good decisions when prompted with interaction
trajectories from unseen environments. However, when and how transformers can
be trained to perform ICRL have not been theoretically well-understood. In
particular, it is unclear which reinforcement-learning algorithms transformers
can perform in context, and how distribution mismatch in offline training data
affects the learned algorithms. This paper provides a theoretical framework
that analyzes supervised pretraining for ICRL. This includes two recently
proposed training methods -- algorithm distillation and decision-pretrained
transformers. First, assuming model realizability, we prove the
supervised-pretrained transformer will imitate the conditional expectation of
the expert algorithm given the observed trajectory. The generalization error
will scale with model capacity and a distribution divergence factor between the
expert and offline algorithms. Second, we show transformers with ReLU attention
can efficiently approximate near-optimal online reinforcement learning
algorithms like LinUCB and Thompson sampling for stochastic linear bandits, and
UCB-VI for tabular Markov decision processes. This provides the first
quantitative analysis of the ICRL capabilities of transformers pretrained from
offline trajectories.]]></summary>

weaker conditions than those in previous works for analyzing both unregularized
GMFGs ($\lambda=0$) and $\lambda$-regularized MFGs, which are special cases of
GMFGs. Second, we propose provably efficient algorithms to learn the NE in
weakly monotone GMFGs, motivated by Lasry and Lions [2007]. Previous literature
either only analyzed continuous-time algorithms or required extra conditions to
analyze discrete-time algorithms. In contrast, we design a discrete-time
algorithm and derive its convergence rate solely under weakly monotone
conditions. Furthermore, we develop and analyze the action-value function
estimation procedure during the online learning process, which is absent from
algorithms for monotone GMFGs. This serves as a sub-module in our optimization

empirical evaluations.]]></summary>

Therefore, developing a principled framework for fast deterministic/stochastic
sampling for a broader class of diffusion models is a promising direction. We
propose two complementary frameworks for accelerating sample generation in
pre-trained models: Conjugate Integrators and Splitting Integrators. Conjugate
integrators generalize DDIM, mapping the reverse diffusion dynamics to a more
amenable space for sampling. In contrast, splitting-based integrators, commonly
used in molecular dynamics, reduce the numerical simulation error by cleverly
alternating between numerical updates involving the data and auxiliary
variables. After extensively studying these methods empirically and
theoretically, we present a hybrid method that leads to the best-reported
performance for diffusion models in augmented spaces. Applied to Phase Space

characteristic heavy-tail distributions. Examples include copies of books sold,
auction prices of art pieces, demand for commodities in warehouses, etc. By
learning heavy-tailed distributions, "big and rare" instances (e.g., the
best-sellers) will have accurate predictions. Most existing approaches are not
dedicated to learning heavy-tailed distribution; thus, they heavily
under-predict such instances. To tackle this problem, we introduce Learning to
Place (L2P), which exploits the pairwise relationships between instances for
learning. In its training phase, L2P learns a pairwise preference classifier:
is instance A > instance B? In its placing phase, L2P obtains a prediction by
placing the new instance among the known instances. Based on its placement, the
new instance is then assigned a value for its outcome variable. Experiments on
real data show that L2P outperforms competing approaches in terms of accuracy
and ability to reproduce heavy-tailed outcome distribution. In addition, L2P
provides an interpretable model by placing each predicted instance in relation
to its comparable neighbors. Interpretable models are highly desirable when
lives and treasure are at stake.]]></summary>

(ML) algorithms to identify a subgroup of individuals, called exceptional
responders, who are likely to be helped by a treatment the most. A common
approach consists of two steps. One first estimates the conditional average
treatment effect or its proxy using an ML algorithm. They then determine the
cutoff of the resulting treatment prioritization score to select those
predicted to benefit most from the treatment. Unfortunately, these estimated
treatment prioritization scores are often biased and noisy. Furthermore,
utilizing the same data to both choose a cutoff value and estimate the average
treatment effect among the selected individuals suffer from a multiple testing
problem. To address these challenges, we develop a uniform confidence band for
experimentally evaluating the sorted average treatment effect (GATES) among the
individuals whose treatment prioritization score is at least as high as any
given quantile value, regardless of how the quantile is chosen. This provides a
statistical guarantee that the GATES for the selected subgroup exceeds a
certain threshold. The validity of the proposed methodology depends solely on
randomization of treatment and random sampling of units without requiring
modeling assumptions or resampling methods. This widens its applicability
including a wide range of other causal quantities. A simulation study shows
that the empirical coverage of the proposed uniform confidence bands is close
to the nominal coverage when the sample is as small as 100. We analyze a
clinical trial of late-stage prostate cancer and find a relatively large
proportion of exceptional responders with a statistical performance guarantee.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Covariate shift occurs prevalently in practice, where the input distributions
of the source and target data are substantially different. Despite its
practical importance in various learning problems, most of the existing methods
only focus on some specific learning tasks and are not well validated
theoretically and numerically. To tackle this problem, we propose a unified
analysis of general nonparametric methods in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space
(RKHS) under covariate shift. Our theoretical results are established for a
general loss belonging to a rich loss function family, which includes many
commonly used methods as special cases, such as mean regression, quantile
regression, likelihood-based classification, and margin-based classification.
Two types of covariate shift problems are the focus of this paper and the sharp
convergence rates are established for a general loss function to provide a
unified theoretical analysis, which concurs with the optimal results in
literature where the squared loss is used. Extensive numerical studies on
synthetic and real examples confirm our theoretical findings and further
illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We characterize the statistical efficiency of knowledge transfer through $n$
samples from a teacher to a probabilistic student classifier with input space
$\mathcal S$ over labels $\mathcal A$. We show that privileged information at
three progressive levels accelerates the transfer. At the first level, only
samples with hard labels are known, via which the maximum likelihood estimator
attains the minimax rate $\sqrt{{|{\mathcal S}||{\mathcal A}|}/{n}}$. The
second level has the teacher probabilities of sampled labels available in
addition, which turns out to boost the convergence rate lower bound to
${{|{\mathcal S}||{\mathcal A}|}/{n}}$. However, under this second data
acquisition protocol, minimizing a naive adaptation of the cross-entropy loss
results in an asymptotically biased student. We overcome this limitation and
achieve the fundamental limit by using a novel empirical variant of the squared
error logit loss. The third level further equips the student with the soft
labels (complete logits) on ${\mathcal A}$ given every sampled input, thereby
provably enables the student to enjoy a rate ${|{\mathcal S}|}/{n}$ free of
$|{\mathcal A}|$. We find any Kullback-Leibler divergence minimizer to be
optimal in the last case. Numerical simulations distinguish the four learners
and corroborate our theory.]]></summary>

We examine why the trends of LLMs and edge computing are intersecting now, and how teams can take advantage of their combined power today. We also demonstrate how LLMs can be used in an edge environment to generate insights for a real-world use case today. Consider a geologist working in a remote oil field who is responsible for building and analyzing 3D models of oil fields to determine production capacity and the impact on profitability. In this demo, we walk through how Code Llama, Chassisml.io, and Modzy could be used to build a dashboard that geologists could use to analyze well data in real-time in a remote, network restricted environment, allowing for LLM insights generated at the edge.

Prompting large language models (LLMs) has become an efficient learning paradigm for adapting LLMs to a new task by conditioning on human-designed instructions. The remarkable in-context learning (ICL) ability of LLMs also leads to efficient few-shot learners that can generalize from few-shot input-label pairs. However, the predictions of LLMs are highly sensitive and even biased to the choice of templates, label spaces (such as yes/no, true/false, correct/incorrect), and demonstration examples, resulting in unexpected performance degradation and barriers for pursuing robust LLM applications.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) could lead to a significant increase in global electricity consumption, according to a peer-reviewed analysis published in Joule.
 
The analysis estimates that if current trends continue, AI could drive the demand for electricity in data centers to consume at least 85.4 terawatt-hours annually, which is more than what many small countries use in a year.
 
AI is energy-intensive, with both the training and inference phases requiring a significant amount of energy.
 
The size of AI models, such as large language models, and the location of data centers also contribute to energy usage.
 
Factors such as cooling requirements and the type of hardware used can impact energy consumption.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Guys,
 ​
 I am currently spearheading a project for a client in the insurance industry, with a primary objective being the digitalization of thousands of hardcopy contracts. The ultimate goal is to automatically extract particular information from these newly digital documents, namely "date", "insurance premium", "insurance type", and "contractor's name". However, I anticipate a level of variability in terms of exact terminology used, particularly with regards to "insurance premium" and "insurance type". (There is no handwritten text)
 ​
 I am keen on sharing the methodology I intend to apply for this project and invite your invaluable feedback and suggestions:
 ​
 - Firstly, I'll execute the scanning/digitalization of the documents manually.
 - Post this, I plan to utilize Tesseract in combination with Python for the extraction of text from the preprocessed images.
 - I am considering using libraries such as NLTK or spaCy to preprocess this text (this will involve steps like lower casing, removing punctuations, etc.)
 - Finally, I plan to train a custom model for Named Entity Recognition (NER), to accommodate the potential semantic variations in entity labeling which are specific to entities like "insurance premium" and "insurance type".
 ​
 I would be immensely grateful if I could gain your insights on the above-proposed pipeline - Are there any glaring pitfalls I need to avoid or perhaps some improvements that I could incorporate? Your expert advice can certainly help ensure the success of this venture.
 ​
 Many thanks in anticipation for your time and valuable inputs!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 I’m studying the concepts of machine learning. However, I am stuck because I still don’t see how introducing a penalty using lasso regression can drive some parameter coefficients to zero. When doing the calculations, I only get the final value (ordinary least squares + penalty) and don’t directly see a coefficient value being reduced. 
 I've looked at many materials and resources trying to explain this, but I still can't see how it's done. I think the important thing for me is seeing it going to zero or, at the very least, seeing it during calculation. Is there anyone that can help explain this better? Or, If you know of a formula that I can derive that, during the derivation process, shows a coefficient being reduced or set to zero, that would also help.
 Also, any good resources on the topic would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's conversational bots like Claude and GPT can chat impressively but aren't great at complex planning or executing technical tasks. To overcome this, new research from HKU builds open-source AI agents that blend natural language and coding skills. They're called Lemur and Lemur-Chat.
 The researchers think achieving versatile real-world agents requires models that integrate both fluid natural language abilities and precise programming language control. Humans combine plain speech for higher-level goals with languages like Python when we need to plan intricately and execute exactly. AI needs both capacities too.
 But most existing models specialize in pure language or pure code. There's a separation that is limiting.
 The team created Lemur by pretraining the open-source Llama-2 on a massive mixed corpus with 10x more natural language than code. This improved its programming abilities while retaining conversational strength. Further instruction tuning optimized Lemur-Chat for following free-form directions in language.
 Experiments found Lemur surpassed specialized coding-only models like Codex in overall benchmarks. Lemur-Chat then exceeded Lemur by 15% after instruction tuning.
 More importantly, Lemur-Chat won 12/13 new "agent tests" designed to mimic real-world challenges needing both language and programming prowess.
 It beat alternatives at:
  
Using tools like Python and Wikipedia to enhance reasoning
 Debugging code by leveraging error messages
 Improving the most from natural language feedback
 Exploring partially observable environments like cybersecurity and web browsing simulations.
  
Lemur-Chat matched GPT-3.5 in many tests, closing the gap between commercial and open-source agents.
 TLDR: New open-source AI agents combine coding and language skills. Experiments show the combo unlocks more performance across technical challenges.
 Full summary is here. Paper is here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I’m one of the creators of Evidently, an open-source (Apache 2.0) tool for production ML monitoring. We’ve just launched a free open course on ML observability that I wanted to share with the community.
 The course covers:
 📚 Key concepts of ML monitoring and observability (data drift, data and model quality metrics, etc.)
 🔡 Monitoring unstructured data (embeddings, texts, LLMs, etc.) 
 🛠 Different deployment architectures (batch ML monitoring jobs, near real-time ML monitoring, etc.)
 The course is free and open. All materials are public, with no sign-up required. You’ll work with open-source tools like Evidently, MLflow, Airflow, and Grafana. 
 We’ve already published the first 12 videos with notes and code examples. We’ll add new lessons and deployment blueprints over the following weeks.
 The official course start date is October 16, 2023. You can also learn at your own pace.
 Course info and notes: https://learn.evidentlyai.com/ 
 [Background] We’ve been working on Evidently since late 2020 and have spoken to 100s of data scientists, ML engineers, and ML platform teams in different industries. In this course, we tried to sum up answers to the frequent questions on the topic. It starts with high-level theoretical modules and goes to complete deployment blueprints. It is approachable for different levels of knowledge, and you can pick only the modules you are interested in. 
 Looking forward to meeting you at the course!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently dealing with an environment, that most of the time (90% of all state transitions) clips the action selected from the agent. Sometimes even down to the point where the action selected by the agent is completly ignored. 
 This causes a lot of problems, because for example the entropy bonus does not works, since the agent learns to select any action, when it doesn't matter anyway but selects the same action (low entropy) when the actions have an effect. 
 Using the PPO algorithm I was thinking of masking the state transitions in the policy updates, according to how much the action was clipped in the environment. And I thought V(s) should be masked, because it can still learn from the state transitions even if the action was effectively ignored by the environment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm training some agents using fairly vanilla PPO on a hand-made environment. These agents learn to perform the task pretty well, but while I was examining their action probabilities during an evaluation episode, I had the idea to turn off deterministic action selection. 
 To my surprise, allowing probabilistic action selection (as opposed to argmax action selection) actually improved performance in some cases. I had always thought that deterministic actions during evaluation was fairly standard, but now am thinking that maybe I missed something and that there are cases where you wouldn't want determinism?
 My question is: how common is it actually to use deterministic actions vs. probabilistic ones at evaluation time, and does anyone know of studies/papers/examples where the authors found probabilistic evaluation to outperform determinism?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone.
 I am aware that there is a plethora of deep generative models out there (e.g. variational autoencoders (VAE), GANs) that can model high-dimensional data as the images of latent variables under a non-linear mapping (typically neural network).
 In more traditional methods such as probabilistic PCA, the latent variables can be marginalised analytically. In Bayesian PCA (BPCA), we can additionally integrate out the linear mapping, from the latent space to the observation space, by adopting the variational lower bound that leads to closed form updates of the parameters. The Gaussian Process Latent Variable (GPLVM) model adopts a non-linear probabilistic mapping (a Gaussian process) that can be marginalised. These two models enjoy to a certain degree analytical solutions concerning the inference of the latent variables and the mapping.
 I have been wondering whether there is any research into more "complex" models (perhaps I should call them deep) that are capable of modelling more complex data distributions than the GPVLM and BPCA, but retain analytical solutions when inferring the posterior of the latent variables (like BPCA) or the mapping (like GPLVM)?
 What I like about the GPLVM and BPCA is that they possess an objective function (i.e. ELBO) that can be analytically optimised, as opposed to the intractable objective of VAEs that necessitates Monte-Carlo averages and stochastic gradient. Could somebody please point me to such examples of more complex generative models that admit analytical inference for working out the posterior of the latent variables or the mapping?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To my knowledge, when using the Q Learning family algorithm, we must know the next state as well as the action spaces in couple with that observation in order to evaluate the reward for the next state with the target network.
 But I have some problem when trying to define this next state in turn turn-based game in which the agent have to make a certain number of actions and then wait for the opponent to do some actions before it can interact with the environment again. We can take Hearthstone as an example that each player have to wait for other to play a number of cards before can take any action.
 Currently, I have two options for this: 
 - Treat the environment right after the agent's turn ended, which will lack the action space.
 - Treat the environment just before the agent's turn begins, which will have all the actions available that it can choose from but this will make the agent's last action very noisy. That state could be a good state if the opponent playing badly or they are very good and make our last decision seem like a very bad choice. 
 Thanks in advance for any suggestions. If my problem is a common task that others have already solved many times, I will be very thankful for that keyword.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do I love teaching? Oh, absolutely, YES a big YES! My time as a TA for countless semesters has been amazing. Staying after hours, spending long evenings and early mornings, to make each of my students find ease in debugging both easy-peasy and mind-boggling programs – it’s been a joy, truly. Watching those fresh faces, whom I introduced to Python in their first year ( intro to programming lab), now immerse themselves into my computer vision labs, exploring computer vision and deep learning in their third/forth year – it’s incredibly rewarding! And yeah my students kind of like me! after each semester I get tons of emails thanking me and my TAship review is always good.
 But, ugh, do I have enough publications to become faculty? A big fat NO! My efforts have been relentless, and everyone in my department would nod in agreement. But luck and reviewers? Not my best pals, apparently. So yeah, I don’t have a stack of 8 top-tier papers. I’ve managed to scrape together 3, and a few second tiers. My citation count is not that bad somewhere between 200 and 300-ish.
 Now, what’s next for me? Dive into the industry? become a high school teacher? Or perhaps, do a postdoc journey, fingers crossed for a sprinkle more luck and few more papers?
 Edit: This doesn't mean I don't like research, I actually love it too, I have done quite a few internship in quite big companies, most of the time they extend my intership and I even got publication out of one in 5 month. But I just like to teach a lot! strangely I got social anxiety every where other than my classrooms/labs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the original paper of MoCo, it said that:
  
Using a queue can make the dictionary large, but it also makes it intractable to update the key encoder by back-propagation (the gradient should propagate to all samples in the queue).
  
First I thought that the main reason that the bp cannot imply on key encoder is that the queue operation is not differentable. But It seems not true. You can compute the gradient of all samples in the queue, then bp should be performed properly. See the code at the bottom.
 So WHAT IS THE REAL REASON THAT THE BP IS INTRACTABLE FOR KEY ENCODER? In my opinion, I think may be because of the large size of the queue (dictionary) which makes the memory explosive.
 python q = nn.Linear(768,128) k = nn.Linear(768,128) bs = 64 ks = 4095 model = nn.ModuleList([q,k]) x = torch.randn(bs, 768) optim = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(),lr=0.01) loss = nn.CrossEntropyLoss() def forward(x): xq = q(x) xk = k(x + 0.1) que = torch.rand(ks,128) pos = torch.einsum("nc,nc->n",xq,xk) neg = torch.einsum("nc,kc->nk",xq,que) out = torch.cat([pos.unsqueeze(-1),neg],dim=1) t = torch.zeros(out.shape[0],dtype=torch.long) l = loss(out,t) return l loss = forward(x) loss.backward() optim.step()

However, there is a concern that AI could lead to job displacement and reinforce economic inequality.
 
MIT economist Daron Acemoglu emphasizes the importance of making AI more useful to humans and ensuring that the economic benefits are shared widely.
 
He suggests that innovations that augment workers' tasks can lead to prosperity for the workforce.
 
Acemoglu also highlights the need for worker power and the careful implementation of technology to achieve shared prosperity and productivity gains.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LLMs' tendency to make up false statements (hallucinate) is a major concern. We need ways to inspect whether they really "know" something is true or not so we can reduce hallucinations.
 In a new paper, researchers found that LLMs contain an internal "truth vector" - an emergent linear structure that represents factual truth values.
 They had the insight to visualize how GPT represents simple true/false sentences. The true ones clustered together, while false ones clustered elsewhere - suggesting some kind of 'truth direction' in its learned representations.
 To test this, they trained linear "probes" on one dataset, and found they could generalize to accurately detect truth values in totally different datasets about other topics.
 They also directly modified the models to add or subtract the identified truth vectors from its processing of statements. This could flip assessments of truth value, showing the vector causally influences reasoning.
 Together, these findings provide evidence that neural networks can create emergent, linear structures that represent factual truth. This finding could eventually help make AI systems less prone to hallucinations and falsehoods.
 TLDR: LLMs can create emergent linear representations of truth. This sheds light on how AI represents abstract concepts and could help us reduce hallucinations.
 Full summary. Paper is here.

If you’ve paid attention to the quantum computing space, you’ve heard the claim that in the future, quantum computers will solve certain problems exponentially more efficiently than classical computers can. They have the potential to transform many industries, from pharmaceuticals to energy.



For the most part, these claims have rested on arguments about the asymptotic scaling of algorithms as the problem size approaches infinity, but this tells us very little about the practical performance of quantum computers for finite-sized problems. We want to be more concrete: Exactly which problems are quantum computers more suited to tackle than their classical counterparts, an…]]></summary>

 It challenges LMs to solve real GitHub issues (feature requests & bug reports) from popular Python repos.
 Answers are validated using unit tests we crawled from those repos.
 The benchmark at swebench.com/ shows that even the strongest models, such as Claude 2 and GPT-4, get less than 5% accuracy.

 Looking for some ideas. 
 I'm building out a jupyter book that will be a tutorial on how to use a research platform for data analysis and modelling. My PI has given me free liberty over it.
 I can not think of a good idea to do the analysis and build the model on. It does not need to be complex but should be good enough so that any researcher, student or organization using the platform can get a good idea of how to use it for ML. 
 Any thoughts on a good area to look into? Any recommendations? 
 Note this will be a tutorial and as such an overly complex model is unnecessary. I just can not figure out what to look into so hoping you guys could give thoughts about possible areas in climate, weather and earth science that I could focus on for the tutorial in the jupyter book.

Scientists express concerns about how AI is transforming research, including reliance on pattern recognition without understanding, bias in data, fraud, and irreproducible research.
 
The survey shows that AI tools provide faster ways to process data, speed up computations, and save time and money.
 
Among researchers who use AI, more than one-quarter believe AI tools will become 'essential' to their field in the next decade.
 
Large language models like ChatGPT are mentioned as both impressive and concerning examples of AI tools in science.

I even get a result with a man standing behind a cat! Ive tried StarryAI, imagecreator, wepik, cant afford midjourney or paid ones right now, some others I cant remember with no mixing...
 Artbreeder's interface, you can keep adding and it will mix them together.
 I made these images and others like them very easy in Artbreeder, but its plan is very limited - I could buy more credits, but I need to wait a few days (new job, not paid yet, broke today... lol):

 morph between man and donkey
 Morph between angry rapper and gorilla

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 Happy to share a project I've been working on for a while: UI-Act
 https://github.com/TobiasNorlund/UI-Act
 It's an AI model architecture designed to autonomously navigate and interact with computers using the graphical user interface. Think of it as a co-pilot that "sees" your screen and acts on it, just as a human would.
 In essence, it's a custom transformer model taking prompt and screenshots as input, with output heads to predict low-level actions i.e. mouse clicks. In the demo, it has been trained to compute simple expressions in a calculator window, using expert demonstrations/behavior cloning. If scaled up appropriately however, it could provide a basis for a general agent to automate arbitrary tasks on a computer. 
 I would be interested in hearing your thoughts on it, and especially with regards to the trend towards general AI agents and assistants (Windows Copilot / Adept ACT-1 / AutoGPT etc).
 LMs equipped with e.g. function-calling is a trendy approach, that rely on text-based state representations and APIs to take action. In cases where this is unfeasible, UI-based agents might provide a more general alternative. As the agent's interface to the computer is shared with humans, it can be easily taught using expert demonstrations, and require little or no technical expertice.
 Let me know what you think!

 Confidence and trustworthiness of Tsetlin Machines.
 Hi all! Just completed a new chapter in the book An Introduction to Tsetlin Machines:
 https://tsetlinmachine.org
 Happy to receive feedback!
 Abstract: Collaboration can be essential to manage complex projects. One example is building a house. You then need the expertise of carpenters, plumbers, and electricians. Each profession brings unique skills to the table. Similarly, different types of Tsetlin machines can have distinct capabilities. In this chapter, you learn how Tsetlin machines can team up, allowing them to achieve more than they could on their own.
 The effectiveness of a team relies on recognising each member's strengths and limitations. Appreciating where your expertise stops and where your coworkers' expertise begins is crucial for effective collaboration. We first explore how Tsetlin machines can assess their competence in Section 7.1. Using the vote count from Chapter 1, you learn to measure how confident a Tsetlin machine is when it makes its decisions.
 It is possible to be highly confident and still perform poorly. To be trustworthy, confidence must be in line with one's capabilities. Therefore, Section 7.1 also covers how to evaluate trustworthiness.
 Next, in Section 7.2, you discover how to build a team of Tsetlin machines with different skills. By assessing each Tsetlin machine's confidence, you can lean on the confident ones when making decisions. The result is a Tsetlin machine composite - a construction where multiple Tsetlin machines join forces. You can think of it as a composite material, such as epoxy, which reinforces resin with fibres, making it strong, lightweight, and durable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Artificial intelligence (AI) is being used to create professional-looking profile pictures for job hunting websites like LinkedIn.
 
Apps like Remini, Try It On AI, and AI Suit Up use AI-based software to generate slick profile photos that mimic the work of expert photographers.
 
Users upload multiple selfies, and the AI software creates artificial photos with different hairstyles, clothing, and backdrops.
 
While some find the results realistic, others think they look artificial.
 
The AI services are popular because they are cheap or free, making them accessible to those who can't afford professional headshots.
 
However, opinions are divided on whether AI-generated photos are beneficial or detrimental to self-esteem.
 
Some believe that AI-generated photos allow individuals to put their best self forward and potentially increase their chances of being considered for opportunities.
 
Others worry that relying on AI-generated photos may negatively impact self-worth and confidence. Recruiters generally do not consider whether a photo is AI-generated when evaluating job applications.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been looking at DrQ-v2 (https://github.com/facebookresearch/drqv2) recently and it samples from replay in a way that seems odd to me but may have a purpose I don't understand.
 They store experiences in a compressed file by episode, this makes some sense since it means they don't have to store everything in RAM and they delay disk writes until the end of the episode so they don't slow down the sim operation. 
 On sampling, they randomly select an episode then randomly select an experience from the episode, calculating the n-step reward dynamically at sample time instead of at experience storage time. This is then fed to the model by a pytorch DataLoader. This means a _lot_ of disk reads during the optimization step which can't be ideal but I'll put that aside. 
 What is the advantage of doing this selection by episode? It may give a better spread across episodes in each update, but I'm not sure that makes up for the potential downsides of making prioritization and other replay tricks much harder. Any ideas?

 The architecture is a simple encoder decoder architecture.
 I tried MSE as some articles and ML guides say that MSE is good for pixel wise comparison and also tried Categorical Crossentropy but none of them work so great.
 MSE works but produces artefacts like red/green/ blue spots and spatters and at worse times it produces a white image.
 The research on this task includes use of SIDNet[Single Image Dehazing Net], Transmission maps, Dark channel prior algorithm, FFA net, etc trained on the Benchmark datasets (RESIDE,SOTS).
 I aim to create a simple architecture for college project so I chose the Enc-Dec architecture. Any suggestions are appreciated.

I decided to start from scratch, make incremental changes, and make sure that the model's performance is maintained with each change. Very basic in hindsight, but I guess I was too hasty with coding.
 Anyway, running the full model's training and evaluation with each change is proving to take too long. I'm curious if there's any other way that people implement TDD in the context of machine learning since projects/applications tend to be more time consuming then typical applications.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Top dating apps Tinder, Hinge and Bumble have all stated that they're already investing in AI to make their apps better. They're using it to verify profiles, match people based on bios and interests, and help generate profile descriptions and liven conversations. But what about machine learning on user photos?
 iris Dating uses AI to analyze user input in the form of liking or disliking faces ("swiping" profiles). We all know if we like blondes or brunettes, blue or brown eyes, short or long hair, beard or no beard, etc. But AI can pick up the subtlest features (proportions, distances, curvatures etc.) and build a face map. A matrix of features, if you will. It doesn't just look for a person looking like your favorite celebrity crush. It understands what you're really attracted to.
 From there it's an easy path: if it knows which features attract me, it can predict my level of attraction to a specific individual (specifically, their face). Find the persons with the highest predicted attractiveness (for me, not for everyone), rank them by attraction for me, and we have a potential high mutual attraction match. The two stats I have are that on average women like 55%(!) of the profiles iris picks for them; and that users have 40x higher chances of matching when they've trained the model to understand their taste.
 I know it takes a lot more than a pretty face to make for a great relationship, but it sure doesn't hurt to start with strong physical attraction. Missed connections on Craigslist are about just that: seeing a face you can't forget. Find me more of these "wow" faces and let's go from there.
 What do you think? Is it too early? Too bold? Too niche?

Companies closely monitor the movements of researchers as an indicator of their ability to transition from concept to product.
 
The market is highly competitive, with researchers being offered high salaries and compensation packages.
 
This has led to high turnover and attrition in many companies, causing unsettledness among employees.
 
Despite the challenges, the investment in AI research is expected to drive innovation and push the boundaries of the Transformer architecture.

The only implementation I could find from lucidrains used str(chr(max(32, token))) to decode any token (byte) to a character and put the embedding size as 256. Firstly, why 256 and not 256-32 as any values below 32 are ignored? Also, many byte-level models including this and ByteT5 mention that they can process any text sequence even in a multilingual setting, however how would that be true if we are only using one byte, would we have to move to 2 bytes or use an UNK token, and if we did use 2 bytes that would make our embedding size around 65000 which defeats sort of the point as o…]]></summary>

 Now, if want to predict outcomes for 2024, we must use last years data to build the model, but we are going to have some bias if there are features that vary year over year.
 Is the best approach in such a situation to try and tune/validate the model with other years in the hopes of mitigating any features that are correlated with a specific year? 
 Any help would be much appreciated, as I can't find agreed upon methods.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a goal and am looking for direction from others who know more than me about machine learning. 
 I want to submit 5-10 pieces of text to a model. The text will be anecdotes from a common experience but each one from a different person’s perspective. For example, if a family visits a theme park, each family member will have a story or two about the day. Each family’s story would be a submission to the model. One person might have loved the roller coaster and can tell about the exciting parts. Another person maybe just can’t stop talking about how great he food was. Someone else maybe felt sick and complains the line at the bathroom was too long. Perhaps another family member also rode the same roller coasters as the first person but instead hated it, so would have a very different description of it than the first. 
 All these anecdotes are submitted to the model. 
 Then, the model can be queried. Such as, 
 “Tell me about the theme park.” 
 or
 “I love roller coasters. Tell me about the theme park.” 
 or
 “I tend to overeat, tell me about the theme park.” (the model wouldn’t hype of the food, maybe it would talk about how much exercise the visitors get by walking around all day.) 
 In this case of a theme park context, the model would have a preconception of a theme park. It would know the general concept, know of several examples or standards that it could compare this theme park against, understand it’s all for fun, etc. 
 This type of model may be available as an API or model already and I just don’t know about it. That’d be fine, please point me towards it. Or, maybe there’s something already available but would need tweaked or customized.

 Depending on a given characteristic function, calculated through a dedicated algorithm, Shapley values can be any number, positive or negative, without a set range.
 Because of this, I am unsure, for the specific application of calculating Shapley values, what activation function to use in a neural network that would calculate them. The relu function, as well as leaky relu function, either cannot give values that are negative or have trouble giving large negative values, and sigmoid or tanh can only give values in a certain range.
 I am aware that there are other commonly used activation functions, but all the ones I could find had one of these issues, which would make training a network to calculate Shapley values difficult.
 Any advice?

We aim to explore and develop innovative ways to incorporate large language models (LLMs, e.g. GPT, ChatGPT, and Bard) into upper division chemistry laboratories and virtual lab experiences. During the workshop, participants will brainstorm and create demonstrations incorporating LLMs into the curriculum.
 The event will bring together folks across academia and the private sector with disciplinary backgrounds that range across chemistry, computer science, materials science, physics, and education. There is no registration fee, and we anticipate being able to cover the majority of participant travel costs thanks to NSF support. Participants early in their career (i.e., graduate students, postdoctoral scholars) are particularly encouraged to apply.
 If you are interested in participating in this workshop, please fill out the Google form (link below).
 Please feel free to distribute this invitation widely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Transformers are great at NLP and computer vision tasks, but I was surprised to learn they still lag behind simple linear models at time series forecasting.
 The issue is how most Transformer architectures treat each timestamp as a token and fuse all the variable data from that moment. This makes two big problems:
  
Variables recorded at slightly different times get blurred together, losing important timing info
 Each token can only see a single moment, no long-term dependencies
  
So Transformers struggle to extract useful patterns and correlations from the data.
 Some researchers from Tsinghua University took a fresh look at this and realized the Transformer components themselves are solid, they just need to flip the architecture for time series data.
 Their "Inverted Transformer" (or iTransformer):
  
Makes each variable's full history into a token, instead of each timestamp
 Uses self-attention over variables to capture relationships
 Processes time dependencies per variable with feedforward layers
  
This simple tweak gives all the benefits we want:
  
State-of-the-art forecasting accuracy, beating both linear models and standard Transformers
 Better generalization to unseen variables
 Increased interpretability
 Ability to leverage longer historical context
  
TLDR: Inverting Transformers to align with time series structure allows them to outperform alternatives in working with time series data.
 Full summary. Paper is here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 for a text work of mine I am trying to do a project based on generating digital twin of networks. My goal is to create a digital twin of a network and then work on it from a cyber security point of view. I will briefly explain what I would like to do.
 I am currently using software for network vulnerability scans (OpenVAS). I use this software to perform network vulnerability scans at the network level, so basically to OpenVAS I pass a network (for example 192.168.xx.xx/24) to automatically identify all the vulnerabilities that are there.
 The next step ( what I'd like to do and that's why I'm asking for your advice) is to create a digital twin of the newly scanned network and then perform a penetration test on this digital twin of the network, without going to stress the actual network.
 Ideally, I would like to pass the output of the OpenVAS vulnerability scans, routing rules, and firewall rules to some tool that will then generate for me the digital twin of the network, which will then be used for offensive cybersecurity, so exploits, privilege escalation, etc.... will be tested on this digital twin without worrying about breaking some kind of service or stressing the real network.
 What I am asking is, do you know of any tool that would do the trick for me? So some tool that allows me to generate a digital twin of a network by providing as input vulnerability scans (xml,json,csv etc...), routing rules, firewall rules, pcap traces etc... 
 Do you have any references or documentation? 
 Are you aware of any open source tools?
 I thank you for your helpfulness!

Has a massive variety of styles like Womba's private discord server does.
 
"Create variants" function like how a Womba discord personal server generator allows you to do.
 
Generates beautiful "digital art" style images like the digital https://www.unstability.ai/ does. (Man those images are pretty) faces are really good most of the time. (It's frusterating as it looks so good but I can't seem to get any group sex poses going on.)
 
Provides a variety of poses such as https://easywithai.com/ai-image-generators/promptchan-ai/ which also allows you to upload you own images for poses, like how I could upload a real life orgy image and as long as it could distinguish the bodies as being separate (not a big pile of limbs) it does pretty good, but lacks severely lacks in facial quality. Like a big booty girl in hyperreal style
 
1080P or higher resolution. (Again Womba is good here, but they are just extreme on their restrictions.) 1080P should be the minimum for any paid service as how can we truely enjoy a full screne image on anything less without it pixeling out?
 
Doesn't cost $150/month (yes I found one that does all this but their premium subscription cost like $150/month (seduced.ai) and it's not even unlimited. I paid $90 for a full year at Womba discord unlimited but again, $150/month is just not worth it. 
 
 If anyone knows of a server that has all these for around $25/month or less, please let me know. If really appreciate it.

        <updated>2023-10-11T14:43:28.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quick intro
 Lineups are one of the first steps in the VFX pipeline
 Source:
 - orignal footage that was shot on set
 - a reference (quicktime) video from the film edit.
 Task:
 The reference shows modifications to the original footage. They can be :
 - timewarp (either fixed retimes like 200% speed or completely random)
 - transform (moved the image in x/y axis, rotation, scale, etc.)
 So the lineup task is to align the original footage to the reference quicktime.
 What I did so Far:
 Made a simple script in the software Nuke, using some Python and readily available tools to make it work on a simple shot. General logic is compare every frame and the associated one is the frame with the least difference between the two. This works on super simple and straightforward tasks. (can provide more info if needed).
 Issue:
 Some references are more heavily modified. They can have some muzzle flash, basic 3d objects or even some slight error introduced like a distortion applied to the image when none shouldn't so it will never be perfectly aligned. This makes the difference of the full frame higher for some frames, making the lineup wrong. (it will take the wrong frame that has no muzzle flash, because it has less difference...)Some other things to consider is that watermarks are covering the ref and the colors are not perfectly matching, can get them close enough, but there's a difference.
 Conclusion:
 Because of those issues, I'm thinking about using Machine Learning. I have next to no knowledge on the subject. I know there Is a bunch of ways to train a model, but no clue where to start, so here's my question :
 Which learning styles has the best potential to be able to solve this task?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Transformers are great at NLP and computer vision tasks, but I was surprised to learn they still lag behind simple linear models at time series forecasting.
 The issue is how most Transformer architectures treat each timestamp as a token and fuse all the variable data from that moment. This makes two big problems:
  
Variables recorded at slightly different times get blurred together, losing important timing info
 Each token can only see a single moment, no long-term dependencies
  
So Transformers struggle to extract useful patterns and correlations from the data.
 Some researchers from Tsinghua University took a fresh look at this and realized the Transformer components themselves are solid, they just need to flip the architecture for time series data.
 Their "Inverted Transformer" (or iTransformer):
  
Makes each variable's full history into a token, instead of each timestamp
 Uses self-attention over variables to capture relationships
 Processes time dependencies per variable with feedforward layers
  
This simple tweak gives all the benefits we want:
  
State-of-the-art forecasting accuracy, beating both linear models and standard Transformers
 Better generalization to unseen variables
 Increased interpretability
 Ability to leverage longer historical context
  
TLDR: Inverting Transformers to align with time series structure allows them to outperform alternatives in working with time series data.
 Full summary. Paper is here.

I looked at Apache AirFlow because I'm vaguely familiar with it but so far I couldn't get a definite answer on how it works with multiple GPU's. Second option I found is to use Ray library.

 However, both the Megatron-LM and the DeepSpeed don’t use pipedream-2bw scheduling. Could anyone share me some insights or ideas about why such an efficient scheduling scheme doesn’t get popular in the LLM pretraining community? Does it suffer convergence/accuracy issue in practice? Or are there any other concerns that blocking it become the default / most popular pipeline parallelism scheduling?
 (I posted the same question in hacknews as well: Why async gradient update doesn't get popular in LLM community? | Hacker News)
 I have tried to implement the pipedream-2bw scheduling scheme on Megatron-LM and do can reproduce the performance gain as well as loss convergence with GPT-2 345M using 8xV100 GPUs: https://github.com/sighingnow/Megatron-LM/blob/ht/dev-pipe/megatron/core/pipeline_parallel/schedules.py#L1421

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am relatively new to machine learning, and I am thinking about building an on-chain reputation ML model.
 Here is how far I have gone in my ideation phase, can someone help with some suggestion on how I can approach this issue.
  
Input data could include on-chain activity like number of transactions, value transferred, smart contracts interacted with, tokens held, NFTs owned, etc.
 Additionally, data from off-chain sources could be incorporated like identity verification, credentials, ratings, reviews, social media profiles, etc.
 Supervised learning algorithms like regression or classification models could be used to predict a reputation score. The target variable would be some verified reputation rating.
 Models like linear regression, random forests, or neural networks could work. Choice depends on size of data and complexity needed.
 Model would need to be transparent and parameters verifiable on-chain for validity. So linear models or simple neural networks may be most practical initially.
 The model could be trained off-chain initially but ultimately parameters and logic stored on-chain. Predictions could also be verified on-chain.
 Careful feature selection is important so the model relies on signals that are resistant to manipulation and capture true reputation.
 The model would need continuous updates as new data comes in reflecting latest reputation. This would require clear on-chain governance.
 Issues like privacy, collusion resistance, and censorship resistance would need to be addressed through crypto mechanisms like zero-knowledge proofs.
  
P.S. This is a personal project I want to attempt to level up my ML skills.

 I am a student who is currently studying Bachelor of Science in AI. I have a question regarding improving my coding skills. I am aiming for a research internship and I don't know where to start. I previously took a summer school that taught me a lot about state-of-the-art models such as GANs, Transformers, VAEs, GNNs, etc. I would like to improve my coding skills, specifically problem-solving and writing clean code. I have experience with deep learning in general and data analysis. I am looking for a research internship next summer. Where should I start?
 I plan to review some of the deep learning material in the Deep Learning Specialization before taking the GAN specialization. However, when it comes to coding, I want to think like a software engineer or a great programmer. What do you guys suggest for improving my coding or problem-solving skills? I'm feeling confused with multiple resources and I don't know where to begin.
 I’d really appreciate your help.

 Also, not positive if results are significant in the first place so that would be a great call out as well.

 Let's say I have some shirts that say 'HOLA'. I would want, for example, to generate an image of Socrates wearing said shirt. Is this possible? If so, which site would allow me to do this?

 I'm working on simulating a modified humanoid robot, "DARwIn OP 3", using MuJoCo through dm_control in Python. My goal is to train the model to ascend stairs rapidly but these are the first steps. However, I've encountered a problem where the robot appears to sink into the ground and is then ejected with significant force under specific conditions.
 ​
 https://reddit.com/link/174vpzw/video/u636vf49tftb1/player
  
Environment: MuJoCo via dm_control.
 Issue Description: When the robot falls and its feet move, it behaves as though one of its motors sinks into the floor.
 Attempts: I've tweaked contact parameters and ground properties with no luck. Interestingly, this doesn't occur in the standalone MuJoCo simulator.
 Visual Aid: I've attached a video to illustrate the problem…]]></summary>

However, the average reward metric receives less attention, and it looks like algorithms for this metric (R-learning, H-learning, SMART, etc.) are much less than the discount metric. Could you suggest any algorithms for average reward reinforcement learning for continuous/general state-action space?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Big Tech companies like Microsoft and Google are grappling with the challenge of turning AI products like ChatGPT into a profitable enterprise.
 
The cost of running advanced AI models is proving to be a significant hurdle, with some services driving significant operational losses.
 
Corporate customers are unhappy with the high running costs of AI models.
 
The nature of AI computations, which require new calculations for each query, makes flat-fee models risky.
 
Some companies are trying to dial back costs, while others continue to invest more deeply in AI tech.
 
Microsoft's GitHub Copilot, which assists app developers by generating code, has been operating at a loss despite attracting more than 1.5 million users.
 
One of the reasons AI services are costly is that some companies have been reaching for the most powerful AI models available.
 
Microsoft has been exploring less costly alternatives for its Bing Chat search engine assistant.
 
Advances in AI acceleration hardware may eventually reduce the costs of operating complex models.
 
Experts anticipate a more stringent financial approach in the near future, transitioning from experimental budgets to focusing on profitability.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The environmental impact of the AI revolution is starting to become clear, with generative AI like ChatGPT increasing Google Search's energy use more than tenfold.
 
The worry is that the computing power required for AI could lead to increased energy consumption and carbon footprint of data centers.
 
AI already accounted for 10 to 15 percent of Google's electricity consumption in 2021.
 
Google claims that the energy needed to power AI technology is increasing at a much slower rate than predicted, and they are implementing practices to reduce the carbon footprint of AI workloads.
 
The worst-case scenario of Google Search using as much electricity as Ireland is unlikely, but the potential energy consumption of AI servers could grow significantly if AI's popularity continues to rise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multimodal sentiment analysis combines text, audio and video to understand human emotions. But extra inputs can add irrelevant or conflicting signals. So filtering matters.
 Researchers made a "Adaptive Language-guided Multimodal Transformer" (ALMT) that uses text to guide filtering of visual and audio data. This creates a "hyper-modality" with less noise that complements the text.
 They tested it on datasets like MOSI (YouTube reviews), MOSEI (YouTube clips) and CH-SIMS (Chinese videos). ALMT achieved improved accuracy:
  
MOSI: YouTube movie reviews with 2,199 samples. ALMT achieves state-of-the-art performance on various metrics including 6% higher 7-class accuracy.
 MOSEI: 22,856 YouTube clips covering sentiment-rich scenarios. ALMT improves multi-class accuracy by 3-5% over previous methods.
 CH-SIMS: Chinese dataset with over 2,000 video samples. ALMT surpasses prior work by 1.4% in binary accuracy.
  
Analyses showed big drops in performance without the guided filtering, so this validates that it's the main innovation.
 Downsides are it needs lots of training data and has minor gains on sparse regression metrics. But overall the technique of filtering multimodal data under text guidance gives improvements.
 The concepts feel intuitive - use dominant signals to filter others and retain useful complements. My guess is it would transfer well to other multimodal tasks.
 TLDR: New way to filter multimodal data for sentiment analysis using text guidance improves performance. Shows the value in removing distracting signals. Sometimes less is more.

 So I know Tiktok published a white paper on their purported algorithm, Monolith, but it is unclear if that is what they use in their products or not. Given, recommender systems seem to be core to Bytedance's business, I imagine they wouldn't provide many details.
 Has anyone evaluated Monolith on their own products and seen an improvement? 
 I think the app is impressive and am wondering how it has transferred to other use cases.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! I wanted to advertise my new JAX optimisation library Optimistix!
 Optimistix has high-level APIs for minimisation, least-squares, root-finding, and fixed-point iteration and was written to take care of these kinds of subroutines in Diffrax.
 Here is the GitHub: https://github.com/patrick-kidger/optimistix
 The elevator pitch is Optimistix is really fast, especially to compile. It plays nicely with Optax for first-order gradient-based methods, and takes a lot of design inspiration from Equinox, representing the state of all the solvers as standard JAX PyTrees.
 For those familiar with classical nonlinear unconstrained optimisation, Optimistix does some pretty nifty new things. It introduces new abstractions for modular optimisers, allowing users to mix-and-match different optimisation techniques easily. For example, creating a BFGS optimiser with Levenberg-Marquardt style Tikhnov regularisation takes less than 10 lines of code in Optimistix.
 I'm using Optimistix as a tool for my own research, and continue to work on it as part of my PhD (supervised by Patrick Kidger.) I would love for some more people to try it, so let me know what you think!

 I have automated the content creation for my youtube channel.
 It got total views of 8.5K and some videos getting 2.5K views.
 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG0-UemyRMUs1JJlQMK9lzA
 All the things are automated like:-
  
Script Generation
 Voiceover
 Image Generation
 Subtitles
  
I do minor tweaks here and there but majorly its automated.
 I posted is somwhere and people were commenting what's the use of the mindless videos?
 This is the begining, I want to automate the editing of videos.
 User can upload raw videos and I should be able to give multiple final edit videos.
 I have built a small tool blinkcuts.com, If anyone intersted. I can give access.
 Please DM for access.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 Document layout analysis has been a great tool so far to extract the components of a document (title, paragraph, tables ...). I'm working on long text PDF which are mostly scanned documents.
 One of the process involved after document layout analysis, is to recreate the document structure: creating sections, sub section, sub sub sections and so on. As of today, this task is done by parsing the title and finding out any ordering information (numeric, alphabetical or roman notation):
 1. Title A 1.1 Title B 2. Title C 2.a) Title D 
 This technique works only if a document follows this constraint (numeration). I want to go one step further, where the algorithm could create the document structure with any title ordering information.
 I believe that relying only on parsing cannot do the trick. What could be the options? Given that the only features are: title's text and title's position (x,y) in the document. I was wondering if a model like a seq2seq could fit this problem, or should I stick with an engineering rule based approach.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks, 
 I have observed a strange behavior when implementing a VERY BASIC idea 🙂
 I want to use a fully-connected Neural Network to approximate a sine wave. For that I am sampling 200.000 uniformly distributed points from a wide interval, e.g. [-60,60] and compute the corresponding sin(x) values resulting in the following training data. 
 ​
 Training data
 I glimpse into my setup: 
 Model:
 nn.Linear(1, 16) nn.Sigmoid() Linear(16, 16) nn.Sigmoid() nn.Linear(16, 8) nn.Sigmoid() nn.Linear(8, 4) nn.Sigmoid() nn.Linear(4, 1) (I also pumped up the network to up to 100 hidden neurons on one layer) 
 Number of samples: 200.000 (80% train / 20% test)
 Optimizer: Adam
 Loss: RMSE
 Epochs between 100 - 500
 Learning Rate: 0.02
 Batch Size: 500 - 1000
 ​
 Check out the screenshots below to see the results 😨
 ​
 The predictions are pretty good but the edge areas slow down to a very small value, without any change. This only holds for high-frequency sine waves. If we only consider the train range of [-2*np.pi , 2*np.pi] it works pretty good with small loss.
 ​
 So my questions are: 
 1) Why do we see that behaviour? 
 2) How can we solve it
 ​
 Cheers

I am using them to test a set of MC question from a medical test published after the models knowledge cutoff. However, I cannot be 100% sure the questions were not on the internet beforehand. 
 Is there any established method or testsuit to try to understands weather a given instance has been seen at training time? All I can think is looking at memorization or at perplexity, but I was looking for a more out of the box methodology that people use. It seems to me that the problem is quite general. 
 Thanks!
 Edit: I know LLMs do not just memorize things and learn pattern. However, there is research on trying to understand if a datapoints has been used in training or not. Eg there is research that tries to exploit the fact that seen text has normally lower perplexity than unseen text or other similar infornation. I was wonderibg what the state in this topic is and if something is normally used as a score to have some clues. I do not expect to be able to retrieve the exact same questions lol

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking for methods/frameworks to extract multi-modal embeddings from images and text for similarity search purposes. The problem setup is slightly different from how CLIP style methods are generally used ( where similarity between text and image embeddings obtained through the model are computed to assess how similar a caption is to an image). My intended application is similarity search, where I want to find entries of images and captions pair similar to a piece of the query image and caption encoded together.
 Some approaches I tried: I tried concatenating the textual and visual embeddings obtained from CLIP and ResNET with textual embeddings and using it with cosine similarity, but it had limited utility. My guess is that concatenating two modalities merely without any training would yield very little utility. The next direction could be to train a model to fuse the embeddings obtained, but my dataset size is really small (10 thousand total), so not sure if training a model would be helpful. 
 Are there any approaches that can allow me to combine the multi-modal embeddings for similarity purposes, similar to how pre-trained ResNET or Inception can be used off-the-shelf for retrieving visually similar images? Any pointers/advice would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my ML/AI journey up until now, most training and hands-on labs either use a pre-built dataset or have you build a pretty simple and flat dataset. I am now looking to stretch my exploration into some real-world use cases and find the data I want is way more complex.
 Researching online feels like the meme on learning to draw an owl.
 So I'm looking for some guidance on how to handle my data.
 The data is an array from a rest API that includes all alarms from an application as nested objects. So the data looks like this for a single event:
 data = { "event_data": [ { "root_cause": "Root cause added after API calls" "alarms": [ { "alarm_id": "alarm_id", "alarm_name": "alarm_name", "alarm_type": "alarm_type", "alarm_description": "alarm_description", "alarm_details": { pro1: val1, prop2: val2, etc... }, "actual_alarm_value": { any_random_key: "any_random_value", etc... }, } ], } ] } 
 I need to build a dataset that includes many of these events with the ultimate goal of predicting future events. I plan to test this against various ML models and LLMs.
 Each event would be a single row, and I would flatten out each alarm so each nested property has its own column. Where I need clarification is how to handle the flatting of alarms. If I fully flatten them, it appears like I lose the context of the alarm's parent event. But if I only flatten them to the alarm level, I lose each property having its own row
 Also actual_alarm_value is very random, so my thinking is to use string encoding here.
 I know this is a lot of detail, and I appreciate any and all advice and help in learning how to do this.

 But is there just a straight-up REST API for getting text embeddings from a model via SentenceTransformers or other HuggingFace models?

(1 year of internship + 1 year of Full time employment at the same company). Now, I am looking to get a Master's Degree in AI/ML/DS in Germany starting Winter 2024. I am a person with interests in Industry skills(Applied AI/ML) rather than the research/academia part as I don't wish to pursue a PhD nor do I want to be stuck in a Math-deep subject that may not be relevant for me in the future. On account of this, I wanted to know which college/degree offers the best balance in-between theory and applied AI/ML/DS.
 Also, people have been telling me that exams are super tough and it is hard to successfully complete an AI/ML/Data Science MS degree in Germany, Is it true? It has been super discouraging for me to hear this and is affecting me mentally to go through the application process.
 PS. CS/Electrical Degrees with good electives for AI/ML/DS are also good enough for me (Just hoping the coursework/grading is not too harsh) Also, it would be great if someone could clarify if an Electronics and Communications student can apply for a CS degree in Germany.
 Sorry for asking too many questions, TIA. :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a small plant engineer who covers manufacturing, process, quality, and new product design. I wear many hats in my job and it's a lot of responsibility.
 One way I've attempted to tame the complexity is by using good reference books. I've accumulated quite the collection through the years. Some print others digital. I've also got a lot of digital notes. And that's a lot of data.
 I've been playing around with sharly.ai (thanks to this sub for recommending) and uploading documents to it and querying them. Its been able to find the information every time it's been available. And more importantly it's provided sources and page numbers. This is important, since I've never been able to find a conversational AI that gives me consistently good answers (including the latest chatgpt), and I always need to read deeper. I also need to backup my work. So in this way it's basically a super index.
 I also bought a tablet for note-taking and basic sketches. The idea is to use the tablet to take notes, hold my library for reading, and interact with sharly.ai. 
 Is this approach good enough, or is there something else I can do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With recent RT-X efforts from Deepmind, it seems the community has been shifting towards the development of a more generalized foundational model, combining with visions and languages, and scaling via imitation learning. 
 I know RL algorithms are expensive to train and hard to scale due to the way the samples are generated, but I am still fascinated by the intelligence behind their philosophies. What do you think the future would look like? Like NLP or CV, having a big foundational model pre-trained via IL, and fine-tune on different tasks via RL? How can we tell if a task is simple enough that we don't need to leverage the power of a foundational model?

 Abstract:
  
While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on a range of decision-making tasks, they rely on simple acting processes and fall short of broad deployment as autonomous agents. We introduce LATS (Language Agent Tree Search), a general framework that synergizes the capabilities of LLMs in planning, acting, and reasoning. Drawing inspiration from Monte Carlo tree search in model-based reinforcement learning, LATS employs LLMs as agents, value functions, and optimizers, repurposing their latent strengths for enhanced decision-making. What is crucial in this method is the use of an environment for external feedback, which offers a more deliberate and adaptive problem-solving mechanism that moves beyond the limitations of existing techniques. Our experimental evaluation across diverse domains, such as programming, HotPotQA, and WebShop, illustrates the applicability of LATS for both reasoning and acting. In particular, LATS achieves 94.4\% for programming on HumanEval with GPT-4 and an average score of 75.9 for web browsing on WebShop with GPT-3.5, demonstrating the effectiveness and generality of our method.

As most people navigate their everyday world, they process visual input from the environment using an eye-level perspective. Unlike robots and self-driving cars, people don't have any "out-of-body" sensors to help guide them. Instead, a person’s sensory input is completely "egocentric", or "from the self." This also applies to new technologies that understand the world around us from a human-like perspective, e.g., robots navigating through unknown buildings, AR glasses that highlight objects, or assistive technology to help people run independently.

 1 I'd like to know if I could train AI to recognize details found it nature / weathering / aging and feed it pictures and it would recognize them (segmenting) so it can spot them but also their positions based on surrounding shapes, and the logical placement resulting. Seems hard.
 2 then feed it some examples of those aging stuff on their own (with proper tags) so it learn to reproduce them and create new ones from scratch.
 3 but then feed it "clean" pics and it would age them according to patterns it could find on the base training set so it can guess where to best place them.
 Pretty sure 2 is trivial enough, 1 seems possible until learning the "logic", but 3?
 Thanks for your insight.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Title: Why Do We Need Weight Decay in Modern Deep Learning?
 Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04415
 Abstract: Weight decay is a broadly used technique for training state-of-the-art deep networks, including large language models. Despite its widespread usage, its role remains poorly understood. In this work, we highlight that the role of weight decay in modern deep learning is different from its regularization effect studied in classical learning theory. For overparameterized deep networks, we show how weight decay modifies the optimization dynamics enhancing the ever-present implicit regularization of SGD via the loss stabilization mechanism. In contrast, for underparameterized large language models trained with nearly online SGD, we describe how weight decay balances the bias-variance tradeoff in stochastic optimization leading to lower training loss. Moreover, we show that weight decay also prevents sudden loss divergences for bfloat16 mixed-precision training which is a crucial tool for LLM training. Overall, we present a unifying perspective from ResNets on vision tasks to LLMs: weight decay is never useful as an explicit regularizer but instead changes the training dynamics in a desirable way. Our code is available at this https URL.

 Perhaps starting with preschool books with a tiny vocabulary and short sentence fragments like "goodnight moon...", moving up to "the lorax".... and then fine-tuning on elementary school books ... then jr high level reading ... then high school .... etc.
 I'm guessing this might be a path to more natural human-feeling speech.

The custom chips are designed to compete with NVIDIA's dominance in the AI accelerator market.
 
Microsoft aims to match or surpass the performance of NVIDIA's offerings while reducing the cost of AI infrastructure.
 
The high cost of NVIDIA's GPUs, such as the H100, can reach up to $30,000, making it expensive to build data centers filled with these GPUs.
 
By developing its own chips, Microsoft hopes to decrease its dependence on NVIDIA for AI servers.

 Catastrophic forgetting seems to be the big issue, especially if you've already undergone instruction tuning since the model will lose its conversational tone. I've seen papers discussing regularization techniques to avoid that by minimizing the changes to high value attention heads but not sure if that is considered to be the most promising direction.
 I'm aware of LoRAs but I imagine at some point you can't just arbitrarily cram new info into such a low dimensional space.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LLMs are great at basic reasoning when prompted, but still struggle with complex multi-step problems like optimization or planning. Humans tackle new problems by drawing on intuition from similar experiences, which LLMs can't do.
 Researchers propose "Thought Propagation" to have LLMs reason more like humans - by thinking analogically. First, GPT is prompted to suggest related "analogous" problems to the input. Then it solves those. Finally, it aggregates the solutions to directly solve the input problem or extract useful strategies.
 They tested this technique on challenges like finding optimal graph paths, writing coherent stories, and planning for LLM agents. Across different models, it significantly boosted performance over regular prompting:
  
12% better at finding shortest paths
 13% improvement in creative writing (human preference)
 15% higher task completion for LLM agents
  
It also beat chain-of-thought (there is a comparison to CoT and ToT in the paper).
 After 1-2 iterations, adding more layers of analogy didn't help much. Efficiently generating useful analogies is still difficult and that's a limitation.
 I think this is interesting because it shows the value of "meta-cognition" - having models reflect on their own reasoning. More techniques like this could incrementally improve LLMs' reasoning to be more human-like.
 TLDR: Teaching LLMs to reason analogically, using solutions for similar problems as hints, significantly boosts their complex reasoning ability.
 Full summary. Paper is here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a class with around 96031740 96x64 images and need to select a sample of 17929 to match the minority class of my classification problem. 
 Having already established a baseline based on random sampling of the majority class; now I am looking to try more complex approaches. I am specifically trying to replicate the 'nearest neighbor of clustering center' approach from Lin et al., 2017.
 The problem is I am working on my desktop and only have 32 Gb of RAM and 2 1Tb NVMe disks at half capacity. I have tried working with only 10% of the data and still the MiniBatchKMeans function of sklearn doesnt have enough space to run: "numpy.core._exceptions._ArrayMemoryError: Unable to allocate 440. GiB for an array with shape (9603174, 6144) and data type float64". 
 Does anyone have a suggestion on how I can move forward? Could cloud services be an option? 
 Thanks

I don't want to have problems with my government or other countries governments in regards with the content that is uploaded to my website. I have searched about measures that can be taken to avoid this from happening. Adding a report button and having moderators are both good starting options.
 I thought that as time passes, more and more content is going to be created by the users so supervising that people are following the rules needs to be automated from the beginning. Applying measures to prevent people from uploading/posting links containing nudity, child porn, beastiality, or whatever users capture with a camera that could lead to legal problems must be a priority and allowing this type of content is not ethical.
 I am a software developer, but I haven't delved into machine learning and ai for most of my career because I haven't to. This seems like the perfect case to learn by doing and time is not a constraint, but I need some guidance.
 I have read superficially about how people train models by providing lots of data, I imagine other websites that use machine learning & ai to remove this type of content don't download media that contains nudity, child pornography, besteality, etc to train their models and make their tests. There must be some pretrained models, maybe, but how would they test this works? I don't know, I am just thinking on my own how other devs are currently handling this.
 I am no looking for upvotes, I don't care for downvotes, I am just looking for guidance, and I would be very happy to hear the opinion of someone with experience.

 Github: https://github.com/ryoungj/toolemu 
 Website: https://toolemu.com/ 
 Abstract:
  
Recent advances in Language Model (LM) agents and tool use, exemplified by applications like ChatGPT Plugins, enable a rich set of capabilities but also amplify potential risks - such as leaking private data or causing financial losses. Identifying these risks is labor-intensive, necessitating implementing the tools, manually setting up the environment for each test scenario, and finding risky cases. As tools and agents become more complex, the high cost of testing these agents will make it increasingly difficult to find high-stakes, long-tailed risks. To address these challenges, we introduce ToolEmu: a framework that uses an LM to emulate tool execution and enables the testing of LM agents against a diverse range of tools and scenarios, without manual instantiation. Alongside the emulator, we develop an LM-based automatic safety evaluator that examines agent failures and quantifies associated risks. We test both the tool emulator and evaluator through human evaluation and find that 68.8% of failures identified with ToolEmu would be valid real-world agent failures. Using our curated initial benchmark consisting of 36 high-stakes tools and 144 test cases, we provide a quantitative risk analysis of current LM agents and identify numerous failures with potentially severe outcomes. Notably, even the safest LM agent exhibits such failures 23.9% of the time according to our evaluator, underscoring the need to develop safer LM agents for real-world deployment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Reddit,
 I am new to reinforcement learning. I have sufficient knowledge on supervised learning, but I am yet to stumble onto a cheat sheet for RL and from what I can tell, my use case is less common. 
 I'm reaching out to the community in hopes of getting guidance and assistance in cutting through the noise of redundant and irrelevant information so I can attempt to built a toy model to validate my use case. I am deeply grateful for any help in advance.
 ​
 From what I can tell, here are the conditions I need to work with for my use case.
  
I'm trying to train a simulator.
 This is a multi-agent problem, perhaps with more than 2 agents. Each agent is responding based on it's own state, the state of the other agent[s], and historical context.
 Both the action space and state space are highly dimensional and highly dynamic based on the dataset and all agents' decisions. I still haven't figured out how the feature engineering will work yet, but I assume (but PLEASE correct my ignorance) I will need a DNN architecture that is more complex than the average deep RL algorithm, and I have considering using CNNs as a component.
 At scale, the datasets can and will be very large, random, and dynamic.
  
​
 Note to reader: I am self-taught. If I stare at technical equations long enough and google for additional resources, I can figure out what I am looking at, but I am very comfortable with technical concepts being shared as if I was a 5 year old.

 Github: https://github.com/hahnyuan/PB-LLM 
 Abstract:
  
This paper explores network binarization, a radical form of quantization, compressing model weights to a single bit, specifically for Large Language Models (LLMs) compression. Due to previous binarization methods collapsing LLMs, we propose a novel approach, Partially-Binarized LLM (PB-LLM), which can achieve extreme low-bit quantization while maintaining the linguistic reasoning capacity of quantized LLMs. Specifically, our exploration first uncovers the ineffectiveness of naive applications of existing binarization algorithms and highlights the imperative role of salient weights in achieving low-bit quantization. Thus, PB-LLM filters a small ratio of salient weights during binarization, allocating them to higher-bit storage, i.e., partially-binarization. PB-LLM is extended to recover the capacities of quantized LMMs, by analyzing from the perspective of post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization aware training (QAT). Under PTQ, combining the concepts from GPTQ, we reconstruct the binarized weight matrix guided by the Hessian matrix and successfully recover the reasoning capacity of PB-LLM in low-bit. Under QAT, we freeze the salient weights during training, explore the derivation of optimal scaling factors crucial for minimizing the quantization error, and propose a scaling mechanism based on this derived scaling strategy for residual binarized weights. Those explorations and the developed methodologies significantly contribute to rejuvenating the performance of low-bit quantized LLMs and present substantial advancements in the field of network binarization for LLMs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I aim to develop a model that utilizes livestream data by employing embeddings for each frame from t0 to tn-1, with the objective of predicting frames from tn to tn+k, after encodoing the frames using a vectorizer and taking an average (np.mean ([], axis=0) to get a resultant for that time period.
 for example list:
 1, [...] 2, [...] 3, [...] 
 the resultant embedding would be [3, np.mean(list, axis=0)]
 I incorporate positional embeddings related to the timescale, such as duration from current time variables, into the array. would this loosely qualify as a "multiscale attention", since it's predicting on multiple scales of time?
 Are there any examples or applications where this methodology has been implemented? references to papers or repos greatly appreciated.

The decision comes after concerns were raised about AI-generated art in a board game expansion.
 
BackerKit's policy will go into effect on October 4th and aims to ensure that all content and assets on the platform are created by humans.
 
The company stated that the policy is in place to address concerns about AI tools using content without proper compensation or permission.
 
AI tools, also known as generative AI, rely on a large body of reference material, often obtained from publicly available sources, and have raised ethical concerns.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite being much safer and more efficient than intersections, roundabouts are tricky to design - small tweaks can ruin traffic flow. 
 They're typically designed iteratively, which takes time. This is a pain for developing countries without resources to test options. But AI could help auto-generate diverse and valid design options.
 In a new paper, researchers propose using Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to sample varied roundabout layouts. Their approach works by constructing layouts step-by-step, maximizing rewards for realism, diversity, and safety.
 They also use a clever approximation during training. Rather than simulating traffic, they quickly check road intersections to focus the search (This sped up training by 200x).
 The authors tested their generated roundabout designs on simulated road scenarios of different complexity. Their model generated more diverse designs than rule-based or reinforcement learning approaches while maintaining realism and traffic flow.
 Plus, as road connections increased, the model kept discovering novel options without compromising quality.
 I thought this paper was an awesome proof-of-concept for auto-generating better roundabouts with AI, and I especially liked the authors' angle of leveraging this technology to specifically help developing countries. This could help them design higher-quality transportation networks faster and cheaper. (Plus I also like Cities: Skylines but struggle at building roundabouts).
 TLDR: Roundabouts are costly to design. New paper demonstrates how AI can generate diverse, valid roundabout designs quickly to cut costs and raise quality. Helpful for infrastructure in developing countries.

 Bard:
 The question of whether Israel should go to the table with Palestinians to peacefully negotiate a two-state solution or should they continue their military campaign is a complex one with no easy answer. There are strong arguments to be made on both sides.
 Those who believe that Israel should negotiate a two-state solution argue that it is the only way to achieve lasting peace in the region. They point out that the Palestinians have a legitimate right to self-determination and that a two-state solution would respect that right. They also argue that a two-state solution would be in Israel's best interests, as it would provide the country with a secure and stable border.

 The essential challenge is trying to get the model to focus on making predictions for mondays by looking at monday (or actually making predictions for categorical earmarked hours of the day such as midday sales data).
 I keep getting the suggestion to include one hot encoding as a binary mask feature to determine if an hour sales figure is earmarked for the category or the day of the week I want the model to focus on-- in order to get it to ignore the data from the other six days of the week or the other periods of the day.
 In other words I want to hone in on and focus on one period of the week to predict for that period of the week, with extra attention, within time series data. Is this type of binary mask really sufficient for that, or am I overlooking something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent work explores how weight decay controls the effective learning rate for different layers and neurons. This rotational behavior drastically differs between Adam with L2 regularization compared to Adam with decoupled weight decay (AdamW) and seems to be the reason AdamW performs better in practice. It could also explain why normalization methods like weight standardization work so well and irregular rotational behavior could contribute to the need for a learning rate warmup.
 Full Abstract: Weight decay can significantly impact the optimization dynamics of deep neural networks. In certain situations, the effects of weight decay and gradient updates on the magnitude of a parameter vector cancel out on average, forming a state known as equilibrium. This causes the expected rotation of the vector in each update to remain constant along with its magnitude. Importantly, equilibrium can arise independently for the weight vectors of different layers and neurons. These equilibria are highly homogeneous for some optimizer and normalization configurations, effectively balancing the average rotation—a proxy for the effective learning rate—across network components. In this work we explore the equilibrium states of multiple optimizers including AdamW and SGD with momentum, providing insights into interactions between the learning rate, weight decay, initialization, normalization and learning rate schedule. We show how rotational equilibrium can be enforced throughout training, eliminating the chaotic transient phase corresponding to the transition towards equilibrium, thus simplifying the training dynamics. Finally, we show that rotational behavior may play a key role in the effectiveness of AdamW compared to Adam with L2-regularization, the performance of different normalization layers, and the need for learning rate warmup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been training a model recently with a rather large dataset (0_gt_wavs are 1h10) and my Epochs are taking 43min on average. I'm running a gtx 1080 and my usage is looking like this: https://i.imgur.com/EE9SUXp.png
 My training parameters:
 'batch_size': 6, 'fp16_run': False, 'lr_decay': 0.999875, 'segment_size': 12800, 'init_lr_ratio': 1, 'warmup_epochs': 0, 'c_mel': 45, 'c_kl': 1.0}, 'data': {'max_wav_value': 32768.0, 'sampling_rate': 40000, 'filter_length': 2048, 'hop_length': 400, 'win_length': 2048, 'n_mel_channels': 125, 'mel_fmin': 0.0, 'mel_fmax': None, 'training_files': './logs\\model1/filelist.txt'}, 'model': {'inter_channels': 192, 'hidden_channels': 192, 'filter_channels': 768, 'n_heads': 2, 'n_layers': 6, 'kernel_size': 3, 'p_dropout': 0, 'resblock': '1', 'resblock_kernel_sizes': [3, 7, 11], 'resblock_dilation_sizes': [[1, 3, 5], [1, 3, 5], [1, 3, 5]], 'upsample_rates': [10, 10, 2, 2], 'upsample_initial_channel': 512, 'upsample_kernel_sizes': [16, 16, 4, 4], 'use_spectral_norm': False, 'gin_channels': 256, 'spk_embed_dim': 109}, 'model_dir': './logs\\model1', 'experiment_dir': './logs\\model1', 'save_every_epoch': 10, 'name': 'model1', 'total_epoch': 500, 'pretrainG': 'pretrained_v2/f0G40k.pth', 'pretrainD': 'pretrained_v2/f0D40k.pth', 'version': 'v2', 'gpus': '0', 'sample_rate': '40k', 'if_f0': 1, 'if_latest': 1, 'save_every_weights': '0', 'if_cache_data_in_gpu': 0} 
 Am I doing something obviously wrong? Is there a way to optimize my training parameters to reduce the epoch duration? I've previously trained something where the GPU usage was constantly at 100% and not fluctuating so much, but I can't remember which settings were different. It was definitely a smaller dataset.
 And follow up: if there are parameters to change, how can I abort the current training and continue it with the modified parameters?
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I tried to construct a simulation env following fetch_pick_and_place. I noticed that the following code is used to initialize the env:
  for _ in range(10): self._mujoco.mj_step(self.model, self.data, nstep=self.n_substeps) 
 Similarly, I followed the above code to initialize my own env with Mujoco menagerie Franka arm but got inaccurate configurations. As I reduced the number of loops, I got configurations closer to the desired configuration.
 Paradoxically, I need to randomize the position of the object in the air and give enough mj_step at the initial stage to make the object fall on the table. If I reduce the number of loops to reduce the number of times mj_step is executed, I can tell from the height value of the object that it doesn't quite fall on the table.
 So, my confusion is why more mj_steps lead to inaccurate simulation results, and how to make the object fall on the table and obtain the most accurate arm configuration.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a text regression dataset with ad popularity. I have already trained a model to perform regression (popularity prediction) with good metrics. Now I want to use an LLM to "improve" texts, i.e. something like "Make this text more engaging: {text}".
 I tried out a few OpenAI models (GPT-3.5, GPT-3.5-instruct, GPT-4), but popularity predictions for augmented texts did not improve (checked with histograms, medians, and Wilcoxon test).
 So now I want to fine-tune an LLM to perform text generation, but guided with my predicted popularity, which basically works as a quality metric. I could not find any resources on this, only on either text generation finetuning (without guiding quality metric) or on classification (no text generation objective). I can also change my quality metric to binary (augmented text is better or not), if this matters.
 How can I do this? Any blogs / tutorials / papers are appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Generative AI wave has led to a surge in demand for GPUs and AI model training.
 
Investors are now questioning the purpose and value of the overbuilt GPU capacity.
 
For every $1 spent on a GPU, approximately $1 needs to be spent on energy costs to run the GPU in a data center.
 
The end user of the GPU needs to generate a margin, which implies that $200B of lifetime revenue would need to be generated by these GPUs to pay back the upfront capital investment.
 
The article highlights the need to determine the true end-customer demand for AI infrastructure and the potential for startups to fill the revenue gap.
 
The focus should shift from infrastructure to creating products that provide real end-customer value and improve people's lives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Research on network binarization techniques tailored for Large Language Models (LLMs). The team has introduced a method called Partial Binarization for LLMs (PB-LLM) which compresses the majority of model parameters down to just a single bit while maintaining its language reasoning capabilities. PB-LLM achieves this by selectively filtering critical weights and allocating more bits for storage, enabling low-bit quantization.
 The researchers have explored methods like Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), named GPTQ-PB, and Quantization Aware Training (QAT) to restore the inference capabilities of LLMs. 
 For those interested in delving deeper, you can find the research paper on Arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00034 and the code implementation on GitHub: https://github.com/hahnyuan/PB-LLM.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To help developers test their RAG systems, we added a RAG experiment class to our open-source library PromptTools. It allows users to easily experiment with different combinations of LLMs and vector DBs, and evaluate the results of their whole pipeline.
 In particular, you can experiment with:
  
Chunking up your documents into different sizes
 Pre-processing those documents in various ways
 Inserting those documents into your vector DBs with various vectorizer and embedding function, and accessing them with different distance functions
  
In our RAG example, we retrieve documents from ChromaDB and pass them into OpenAI’s chat model along with our prompt. We then pass the results into built-in evaluation functions, such as semantic similarity and autoeval, to quantitatively evaluate your result.
 PromptTools is agnostic to what LLMs and vector DBs you use. You can easily iterate over different system architectures forRAG. You can even bring your own fine-tuned models or write a custom integration. In addition, you can write your own evaluation metrics, and independently evaluate the results from the retrieval step as well.
 Our current integrations include:
  
LLM: OpenAI (chat, fine-tuned), Anthropic, Google Vertex/PaLM, Llama (local or via Replicate)
 Vector DB: Chroma, Weaviate, LanceDB, Pinecone, Qdrant
 Framework: LangChain, MindsDB
  
You can get started with RAG in minutes by installing the library and running this example.
 As open-source maintainers, we’re always interested to hear the community’s pain points and requests. Let us know how you are testing your RAG systems and how we can help.

 Github: https://github.com/wzcai99/Pixel-Navigator
 Abstract: Zero-shot object navigation is a challenging task for home-assistance robots. This task emphasizes visual grounding, commonsense inference, and locomotion abilities, where the first two are inherent in foundation models. But for the locomotion part, most works still depend on map-based planning approaches. The gap between RGB space and map space makes it difficult to directly transfer the knowledge from foundation models to navigation tasks. In this work, we propose a Pixel-guided Navigation skill (PixNav), which bridges the gap between the foundation models and the embodied navigation task. It is straightforward for recent foundation models to indicate an object by pixels, and with pixels as the goal specification, our method becomes a versatile navigation policy towards all different kinds of objects. Besides, our PixNav is a pure RGB-based policy that can reduce the cost of home-assistance robots. Experiments demonstrate the robustness of the PixNav which achieves 80+% success rate in the local path-planning task. To perform long-horizon object navigation, we design an LLM-based planner to utilize the commonsense knowledge between objects and rooms to select the best waypoint. Evaluations across both photorealistic indoor simulators and real-world environments validate the effectiveness of our proposed navigation strategy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some of you might already be aware that a junior who submitted their paper to arxiv 30 mins late had their paper desk rejected late in the process. One of the PCs, Juan Pino, spoke up about it and said it was unfortunate, but for fairness reasons they had to enforce the anonymity policy rules. https://x.com/juanmiguelpino/status/1698904035309519124
 Well, what you might not realize is that Longyue Wang, a senior area chair for AACL 23/24, also broke anonymity DURING THE REVIEW PROCESS. https://x.com/wangly0229/status/1692735595179897208
 I emailed the senior area chairs for the track that the paper was submitted to, but guess what? I just found out that the paper was still accepted to the main conference.
 So, whatever "fairness" they were talking about apparently only goes one way: towards punishing the lowly undergrad on their first EMNLP submission, while allowing established researchers from major industry labs to get away with even more egregious actions (actively promoting the work DURING REVIEW; the tweet has 10.6K views ffs).
 They should either accept the paper they desk rejected for violating the anonymity policy, or retract the paper they've accepted since it also broke the anonymity policy (in a way that I think is much more egregious). Otherwise, the notion of fairness they speak of is a joke.

 Abstract:
  
Large language models have made significant progress in various language tasks, yet they still struggle with complex mathematics. In this paper, we propose ToRA a series of Tool-integrated Reasoning Agents designed to solve challenging mathematical problems by seamlessly integrating natural language reasoning with the utilization of external tools (e.g., computation libraries and symbolic solvers), thereby amalgamating the analytical prowess of language and the computational efficiency of tools. To train ToRA, we curate interactive tool-use trajectories on mathematical datasets, apply imitation learn…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using the front camera and tensorflow.js, the smartphone becomes a “window” into the real world. Video and image content appear as if they were seen through this window. To do this, the viewer’s position is determined using a neural network. The viewed content is then moved according to the viewer’s position. This makes it seem like the content is physically behind the smartphone and is viewed through the smartphone’s screen. This effect is especially useful for content captured using an ultra-wide lens.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 I am designing an environment for a robotic task. It's a relatively straightforward task so I started with proprioceptive inputs only. I have a policy working well on a completely flat surface. But once I started to add small bumps to make the surface uneven, neither the policy nor the training strategy worked anymore, even though those bumps are really really small. 
 This is a little confusing since I imagine if this is a task for human, should be able to handle those changes even without exteroceptive inputs. So I am debating should I modify my reward design, pick a more efficient algorithm, or expand the state space directly with exoceptive sensors. 
 ​
 Any advices would be appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to implement a multivariate multi-step CNN-LSTM model, to obtain forecasts for monthly sales of several different products. Furthermore, I want to include additional time-series data (features) as input. So for example:
 Input: time series of product 1, product 2, GDP, PMI
 Output: product 1 (monthly 6-steps ahead), product 2 (monthly 6-steps ahead)
 I have a couple of questions:
  
Feasibility: I've been researching this approach, but I haven't found many tutorials or guides on how to tackle multivariate time series forecasting with a CNN-LSTM architecture. I do find tutorials on CNN-LSTM, but not on how to include additional features as input. Has anyone here attempted something similar or can provide insights on how to proceed?
 Feature Selection: I have access to 20 different features, all of which are time series data. I want to choose the most relevant features for my model. I've considered performing a Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis to select the best features. Does anyone have experience with this or other methods for feature selection in time series forecasting? How to decide the number of features to include? 
  
Any advice or pointers in the right direction would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Artificial Intelligence could revolutionize personalized healthcare in a way that significantly enhances our sense of well-being. Think about an AI-driven "Well-being Advisor" that integrates real-time biometric data from wearables, genetic information, and your medical history to create a fully personalized health and well-being plan. This goes beyond counting steps or monitoring heart rate; it would make real-time recommendations for diet, exercise, and stress management, and could even predict and prevent potential health issues before they become serious.
 Moreover, it would adapt based on your feedback and other contextual factors. For instance, if you're stressed because of a work deadline, it could suggest specific breathing exercises, time management techniques, or even a particular type of short workout to boost your focus and reduce stress. This isn't a one-size-fits-all approach; it's tailored wellness backed by data science.
 Furthermore, this AI advisor could interface with your home automation system. Based on your current state, it could adjust the lighting, play music to elevate your mood, or even communicate with your smart fridge to suggest meals that you can make with the ingredients you have—meals that align with your health goals for that specific day.
 This AI-driven approach can add a highly personalized, proactive layer to healthcare and well-being, making wellness an integrated part of your daily life rather than something you think about during a yearly check-up or after you're already sick. It would make the pursuit of well-being a more interactive, data-driven experience.

 How would you approach it? For now the best option i came up with is parsing data, transforming it into predefined set of questions with answers based on the data derived from xml. Doesn't seem smart enough to me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We use the maximum a posteriori estimation principle for learning
representations distributed on the unit sphere. We propose to use the angular
Gaussian distribution, which corresponds to a Gaussian projected on the
unit-sphere and derive the associated loss function. We also consider the von
Mises-Fisher distribution, which is the conditional of a Gaussian in the
unit-sphere. The learned representations are pushed toward fixed directions,
which are the prior means of the Gaussians; allowing for a learning strategy
that is resilient to data drift. This makes it suitable for online continual
learning, which is the problem of training neural networks on a continuous data
stream, where multiple classification tasks are presented sequentially so that
data from past tasks are no longer accessible, and data from the current task
can be seen only once. To address this challenging scenario, we propose a
memory-based representation learning technique equipped with our new loss
functions. Our approach does not require negative data or knowledge of task
boundaries and performs well with smaller batch sizes while being
computationally efficient. We demonstrate with extensive experiments that the
proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods on both
standard evaluation scenarios and realistic scenarios with blurry task
boundaries. For reproducibility, we use the same training pipeline for every
compared method and share the code at https://t.ly/SQTj.]]></summary>

-- updating the discriminator with differentially private stochastic gradient
descent (DPSGD) -- can yield significantly improved results after modifications
to training. Specifically, we propose that existing instantiations of this
approach neglect to consider how adding noise only to discriminator updates
inhibits discriminator training, disrupting the balance between the generator
and discriminator necessary for successful GAN training. We show that a simple
fix -- taking more discriminator steps between generator steps -- restores
parity between the generator and discriminator and improves results.

Additionally, with the goal of restoring parity, we experiment with other
modifications -- namely, large batch sizes and adaptive discriminator update
frequency -- to improve discriminator training and see further improvements in
generation quality. Our results demonstrate that on standard image synthesis
benchmarks, DPSGD outperforms all alternative GAN privatization schemes. Code:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The growth of Graph Convolution Network (GCN) model sizes has revolutionized
numerous applications, surpassing human performance in areas such as personal
healthcare and financial systems. The deployment of GCNs in the cloud raises
privacy concerns due to potential adversarial attacks on client data. To
address security concerns, Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML) using
Homomorphic Encryption (HE) secures sensitive client data. However, it
introduces substantial computational overhead in practical applications. To
tackle those challenges, we present LinGCN, a framework designed to reduce
multiplication depth and optimize the performance of HE based GCN inference.
LinGCN is structured around three key elements: (1) A differentiable structural
linearization algorithm, complemented by a parameterized discrete indicator
function, co-trained with model weights to meet the optimization goal. This
strategy promotes fine-grained node-level non-linear location selection,
resulting in a model with minimized multiplication depth. (2) A compact
node-wise polynomial replacement policy with a second-order trainable
activation function, steered towards superior convergence by a two-level
distillation approach from an all-ReLU based teacher model. (3) an enhanced HE
solution that enables finer-grained operator fusion for node-wise activation
functions, further reducing multiplication level consumption in HE-based
inference. Our experiments on the NTU-XVIEW skeleton joint dataset reveal that
LinGCN excels in latency, accuracy, and scalability for homomorphically
encrypted inference, outperforming solutions such as CryptoGCN. Remarkably,
LinGCN achieves a 14.2x latency speedup relative to CryptoGCN, while preserving
an inference accuracy of 75% and notably reducing multiplication depth.]]></summary>

constrained and on-device settings where memory is limited, as it circumvents a
number of problems of end-to-end back-propagation. However, it suffers from a
stagnation problem, whereby early layers overfit and deeper layers stop
increasing the test accuracy after a certain depth. We propose to solve this
issue by introducing a module-wise regularization inspired by the minimizing
movement scheme for gradient flows in distribution space. We call the method
TRGL for Transport Regularized Greedy Learning and study it theoretically,
proving that it leads to greedy modules that are regular and that progressively
solve the task. Experimentally, we show improved accuracy of module-wise
training of various architectures such as ResNets, Transformers and VGG, when
our regularization is added, superior to that of other module-wise training
methods and often to end-to-end training, with as much as 60% less memory
usage.]]></summary>

data space; the degenerate MCMC sampling quality in practice can lead to poor
generation quality and instability in training, especially on data with complex
latent structures. Inspired by the recent efforts that leverage diffusion
recovery likelihood learning as a cure for the sampling issue, we introduce a
novel symbiosis between the diffusion models and latent space EBMs in a
variational learning framework, coined as the latent diffusion energy-based
model. We develop a geometric clustering-based regularization jointly with the
information bottleneck to further improve the quality of the learned latent
space. Experiments on several challenging tasks demonstrate the superior
performance of our model on interpretable text modeling over strong
counterparts.]]></summary>

applications, which allows in-field adaptation and updating, ranging from
accommodating distribution shift, to fine-tuning, and to learning new tasks.
For applications with privacy and low latency requirements, the compute and
memory demands imposed by continual learning can be cost-prohibitive for
resource-constraint edge platforms. Reducing computational precision through
fully quantized training (FQT) simultaneously reduces memory footprint and
increases compute efficiency for both training and inference. However,
aggressive quantization especially integer FQT typically degrades model
accuracy to unacceptable levels. In this paper, we propose a technique that
leverages inexpensive Hadamard transforms to enable low-precision training with
only integer matrix multiplications. We further determine which tensors need
stochastic rounding and propose tiled matrix multiplication to enable low-bit
width accumulators. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique on
several human activity recognition datasets and CIFAR100 in a class incremental
learning setting. We achieve less than 0.5% and 3% accuracy degradation while
we quantize all matrix multiplications inputs down to 4-bits with 8-bit
accumulators.]]></summary>

caused by reliance on spurious cues. Instead of requiring costly changes to
one's data or model training, our method better utilizes the data one already
has by sorting them. Specifically, we rank images within their classes based on
spuriosity (the degree to which common spurious cues are present), proxied via
deep neural features of an interpretable network. With spuriosity rankings, it
is easy to identify minority subpopulations (i.e. low spuriosity images) and
assess model bias as the gap in accuracy between high and low spuriosity
images. One can even efficiently remove a model's bias at little cost to
accuracy by finetuning its classification head on low spuriosity images,
resulting in fairer treatment of samples regardless of spuriosity. We
demonstrate our method on ImageNet, annotating $5000$ class-feature
dependencies ($630$ of which we find to be spurious) and generating a dataset
of $325k$ soft segmentations for these features along the way. Having computed
spuriosity rankings via the identified spurious neural features, we assess
biases for $89$ diverse models and find that class-wise biases are highly
correlated across models. Our results suggest that model bias due to spurious
feature reliance is influenced far more by what the model is trained on than
how it is trained.]]></summary>

computer vision, likely due to its broad set of applications ranging from
product fault detection on industrial production lines and impending event
detection in video surveillance to finding lesions in medical scans. Regardless
of the domain, anomaly detection is typically framed as a one-class
classification task, where the learning is conducted on normal examples only.
An entire family of successful anomaly detection methods is based on learning
to reconstruct masked normal inputs (e.g. patches, future frames, etc.) and
exerting the magnitude of the reconstruction error as an indicator for the
abnormality level. Unlike other reconstruction-based methods, we present a
novel self-supervised masked convolutional transformer block (SSMCTB) that
comprises the reconstruction-based functionality at a core architectural level.
The proposed self-supervised block is extremely flexible, enabling information
masking at any layer of a neural network and being compatible with a wide range
of neural architectures. In this work, we extend our previous self-supervised
predictive convolutional attentive block (SSPCAB) with a 3D masked
convolutional layer, a transformer for channel-wise attention, as well as a
novel self-supervised objective based on Huber loss. Furthermore, we show that
our block is applicable to a wider variety of tasks, adding anomaly detection
in medical images and thermal videos to the previously considered tasks based
on RGB images and surveillance videos. We exhibit the generality and
flexibility of SSMCTB by integrating it into multiple state-of-the-art neural
models for anomaly detection, bringing forth empirical results that confirm
considerable performance improvements on five benchmarks. We release our code
and data as open source at: https://github.com/ristea/ssmctb.]]></summary>

configurations. This enables significantly greater applicability than existing
approaches which have been dependent on depth images or geometry knowledge. To
this end, alongside a curricular data sampling strategy, we propose a new

scenes conditioned on high numbers of degrees of freedom (DOFs). In a 7-DOF

problems are relevant for instance for optimal stopping or specific supply

to infinite horizon MDPs optimal policies are not stationary, policies must be
learned for every single epoch. In practice all parameters are often trained
simultaneously, ignoring the inherent structure suggested by dynamic
programming. This paper introduces a combination of dynamic programming and
policy gradient called dynamic policy gradient, where the parameters are
trained backwards in time. For the tabular softmax parametrisation we carry out
the convergence analysis for simultaneous and dynamic policy gradient towards
global optima, both in the exact and sampled gradient settings without

much better exploits the structure of finite-time problems which is reflected

similarity (STS) tasks, which are crucial components in Large Language Model
(LLM) applications. However, a common challenge existing text embedding models
face is the problem of vanishing gradients, primarily due to their reliance on
the cosine function in the optimization objective, which has saturation zones.
To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel angle-optimized text
embedding model called AnglE. The core idea of AnglE is to introduce angle
optimization in a complex space. This novel approach effectively mitigates the
adverse effects of the saturation zone in the cosine function, which can impede
gradient and hinder optimization processes. To set up a comprehensive STS
evaluation, we experimented on existing short-text STS datasets and a newly
collected long-text STS dataset from GitHub Issues. Furthermore, we examine
domain-specific STS scenarios with limited labeled data and explore how AnglE
works with LLM-annotated data. Extensive experiments were conducted on various
tasks including short-text STS, long-text STS, and domain-specific STS tasks.
The results show that AnglE outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) STS models
that ignore the cosine saturation zone. These findings demonstrate the ability
of AnglE to generate high-quality text embeddings and the usefulness of angle

training neural networks to satisfy logical specifications. A DL consists of a
syntax in which specifications are stated and an interpretation function that
translates expressions in the syntax into loss functions. These loss functions
can then be used during training with standard gradient descent algorithms. The
variety of existing DLs and the differing levels of formality with which they
are treated makes a systematic comparative study of their properties and
implementations difficult. This paper remedies this problem by suggesting a
meta-language for defining DLs that we call the Logic of Differentiable Logics,
or LDL. Syntactically, it generalises the syntax of existing DLs to FOL, and
for the first time introduces the formalism for reasoning about vectors and
learners. Semantically, it introduces a general interpretation function that
can be instantiated to define loss functions arising from different existing
DLs. We use LDL to establish several theoretical properties of existing DLs,
and to conduct their empirical study in neural network verification.]]></summary>

evaluation scores across replicated model training runs -- is affected by
several sources of nondeterminism which can be regarded as measurement noise.
Current tendencies to remove noise in order to enforce reproducibility of

and disregard crucial interaction effects between algorithmic noise factors and

the aim to draw inferences beyond particular instances of trained models. We
show how to use linear mixed effects models (LMEMs) to analyze performance
evaluation scores, and to conduct statistical inference with a generalized
likelihood ratio test (GLRT). This allows us to incorporate arbitrary sources
of noise like meta-parameter variations into statistical significance testing,
and to assess performance differences conditional on data properties.
Furthermore, a variance component analysis (VCA) enables the analysis of the
contribution of noise sources to overall variance and the computation of a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tabular data prediction has been employed in medical applications such as
patient health risk prediction. However, existing methods usually revolve
around the algorithm design while overlooking the significance of data
engineering. Medical tabular datasets frequently exhibit significant
heterogeneity across different sources, with limited sample sizes per source.
As such, previous predictors are often trained on manually curated small
datasets that struggle to generalize across different tabular datasets during
inference. This paper proposes to scale medical tabular data predictors
(MediTab) to various tabular inputs with varying features. The method uses a
data engine that leverages large language models (LLMs) to consolidate tabular
samples to overcome the barrier across tables with distinct schema. It also
aligns out-domain data with the target task using a "learn, annotate, and
refinement" pipeline. The expanded training data then enables the pre-trained
MediTab to infer for arbitrary tabular input in the domain without fine-tuning,
resulting in significant improvements over supervised baselines: it reaches an
average ranking of 1.57 and 1.00 on 7 patient outcome prediction datasets and 3
trial outcome prediction datasets, respectively. In addition, MediTab exhibits
impressive zero-shot performances: it outperforms supervised XGBoost models by
8.9% and 17.2% on average in two prediction tasks, respectively. The code is
available at https://github.com/RyanWangZf/MediTab.]]></summary>

models (LMs) and for stacking them into pipelines that solve complex tasks.
Unfortunately, existing LM pipelines are typically implemented using hard-coded
"prompt templates", i.e. lengthy strings discovered via trial and error. Toward
a more systematic approach for developing and optimizing LM pipelines, we
introduce DSPy, a programming model that abstracts LM pipelines as text
transformation graphs, i.e. imperative computational graphs where LMs are
invoked through declarative modules. DSPy modules are parameterized, meaning
they can learn (by creating and collecting demonstrations) how to apply
compositions of prompting, finetuning, augmentation, and reasoning techniques.
We design a compiler that will optimize any DSPy pipeline to maximize a given
metric. We conduct two case studies, showing that succinct DSPy programs can
express and optimize sophisticated LM pipelines that reason about math word
problems, tackle multi-hop retrieval, answer complex questions, and control
agent loops. Within minutes of compiling, a few lines of DSPy allow GPT-3.5 and
llama2-13b-chat to self-bootstrap pipelines that outperform standard few-shot
prompting (generally by over 25% and 65%, respectively) and pipelines with
expert-created demonstrations (by up to 5-46% and 16-40%, respectively). On top
of that, DSPy programs compiled to open and relatively small LMs like
770M-parameter T5 and llama2-13b-chat are competitive with approaches that rely
on expert-written prompt chains for proprietary GPT-3.5. DSPy is available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multimodal learning models have become increasingly important as they surpass
single-modality approaches on diverse tasks ranging from question-answering to
autonomous driving. Despite the importance of multimodal learning, existing
efforts focus on NLP applications, where the number of modalities is typically
less than four (audio, video, text, images). However, data inputs in other
domains, such as the medical field, may include X-rays, PET scans, MRIs,
genetic screening, clinical notes, and more, creating a need for both efficient
and accurate information fusion. Many state-of-the-art models rely on pairwise
cross-modal attention, which does not scale well for applications with more
than three modalities. For $n$ modalities, computing attention will result in
$n \choose 2$ operations, potentially requiring considerable amounts of
computational resources. To address this, we propose a new domain-neutral
attention mechanism, One-Versus-Others (OvO) attention, that scales linearly
with the number of modalities and requires only $n$ attention operations, thus
offering a significant reduction in computational complexity compared to
existing cross-modal attention algorithms. Using three diverse real-world
datasets as well as an additional simulation experiment, we show that our
method improves performance compared to popular fusion techniques while
decreasing computation costs.]]></summary>

learning model across multiple devices with the help of a central server.
However, data heterogeneity across different devices leads to the client model
drift issue and results in model performance degradation and poor model
fairness. To address the issue, we design Federated learning with global-local
Knowledge Fusion (FedKF) scheme in this paper. The key idea in FedKF is to let
the server return the global knowledge to be fused with the local knowledge in
each training round so that the local model can be regularized towards the
global optima. Therefore, the client model drift issue can be mitigated. In
FedKF, we first propose the active-inactive model aggregation technique that
supports a precise global knowledge representation. Then, we propose a
data-free knowledge distillation (KD) approach to enable each client model to
learn the global knowledge (embedded in the global model) while each client
model can still learn the local knowledge (embedded in the local dataset)
simultaneously, thereby realizing the global-local knowledge fusion process.
The theoretical analysis and intensive experiments demonstrate the superiority
of FedKF over previous solutions.]]></summary>

involves the customization of pre-trained LLMs through further fine-tuning.
Meta's open release of Llama models and OpenAI's APIs for fine-tuning GPT-3.5
Turbo on custom datasets also encourage this practice. But, what are the safety
costs associated with such custom fine-tuning? We note that while existing
safety alignment infrastructures can restrict harmful behaviors of LLMs at
inference time, they do not cover safety risks when fine-tuning privileges are
extended to end-users. Our red teaming studies find that the safety alignment
of LLMs can be compromised by fine-tuning with only a few adversarially
designed training examples. For instance, we jailbreak GPT-3.5 Turbo's safety
guardrails by fine-tuning it on only 10 such examples at a cost of less than
$0.20 via OpenAI's APIs, making the model responsive to nearly any harmful
instructions. Disconcertingly, our research also reveals that, even without
malicious intent, simply fine-tuning with benign and commonly used datasets can
also inadvertently degrade the safety alignment of LLMs, though to a lesser
extent. These findings suggest that fine-tuning aligned LLMs introduces new
safety risks that current safety infrastructures fall short of addressing --
even if a model's initial safety alignment is impeccable, it is not necessarily
to be maintained after custom fine-tuning. We outline and critically analyze
potential mitigations and advocate for further research efforts toward

increasing network depth leads to homogeneous node representations. While

definitive answer to this question through a rigorous mathematical analysis, by
viewing attention-based GNNs as nonlinear time-varying dynamical systems and
incorporating tools and techniques from the theory of products of inhomogeneous
matrices and the joint spectral radius. We establish that, contrary to popular
belief, the graph attention mechanism cannot prevent oversmoothing and loses
expressive power exponentially. The proposed framework extends the existing
results on oversmoothing for symmetric GCNs to a significantly broader class of
GNN models, including random walk GCNs, Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unsupervised anomaly segmentation aims to detect patterns that are distinct
from any patterns processed during training, commonly called abnormal or
out-of-distribution patterns, without providing any associated manual
segmentations. Since anomalies during deployment can lead to model failure,
detecting the anomaly can enhance the reliability of models, which is valuable
in high-risk domains like medical imaging. This paper introduces Masked
Modality Cycles with Conditional Diffusion (MMCCD), a method that enables
segmentation of anomalies across diverse patterns in multimodal MRI. The method
is based on two fundamental ideas. First, we propose the use of cyclic modality
translation as a mechanism for enabling abnormality detection.
Image-translation models learn tissue-specific modality mappings, which are
characteristic of tissue physiology. Thus, these learned mappings fail to
translate tissues or image patterns that have never been encountered during
training, and the error enables their segmentation. Furthermore, we combine
image translation with a masked conditional diffusion model, which attempts to
`imagine' what tissue exists under a masked area, further exposing unknown
patterns as the generative model fails to recreate them. We evaluate our method
on a proxy task by training on healthy-looking slices of BraTS2021
multi-modality MRIs and testing on slices with tumors. We show that our method
compares favorably to previous unsupervised approaches based on image
reconstruction and denoising with autoencoders and diffusion models.]]></summary>

as conditional branches pose challenges to mathematical optimization methods
that assume a degree of smoothness in the objective function's response
surface. Smooth interpretation (SI) is a form of abstract interpretation that
approximates the convolution of a program's output with a Gaussian kernel, thus
smoothing its output in a principled manner. Here, we combine SI with automatic
differentiation (AD) to efficiently compute gradients of smoothed programs. In
contrast to AD across a regular program execution, these gradients also capture
the effects of alternative control flow paths. The combination of SI with AD
enables the direct gradient-based parameter synthesis for branching programs,
allowing for instance the calibration of simulation models or their combination
with neural network models in machine learning pipelines. We detail the effects
of the approximations made for tractability in SI and propose a novel Monte
Carlo estimator that avoids the underlying assumptions by estimating the
smoothed programs' gradients through a combination of AD and sampling. Using
DiscoGrad, our tool for automatically translating simple C++ programs to a
smooth differentiable form, we perform an extensive evaluation. We compare the
combination of SI with AD and our Monte Carlo estimator to existing
gradient-free and stochastic methods on four non-trivial and originally
discontinuous problems ranging from classical simulation-based optimization to
neural network-driven control. While the optimization progress with the
SI-based estimator depends on the complexity of the programs' control flow, our
Monte Carlo estimator is competitive in all problems, exhibiting the fastest
convergence by a substantial margin in our highest-dimensional problem.]]></summary>

sample-efficient method to automatically adjust the orientation of the

thereby improving the acoustic coupling of the probe and resulting image

formulate a novel objective function for BO that leverages the contact force
measurements and underlying mechanics to identify the normal. We further
incorporate a regularization scheme in BO to handle the noisy objective
function. The performance of the proposed strategy has been assessed through
experiments on urinary bladder phantoms. These phantoms included planar,
tilted, and rough surfaces, and were examined using both linear and convex
probes with varying search space limits. Further, simulation-based studies have
been carried out using 3D human mesh models. The results demonstrate that the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A prominent theory of affective response to music revolves around the
concepts of surprisal and expectation. In prior work, this idea has been
operationalized in the form of probabilistic models of music which allow for
precise computation of song (or note-by-note) probabilities, conditioned on a
'training set' of prior musical or cultural experiences. To date, however,
these models have been limited to compute exact probabilities through
hand-crafted features or restricted to linear models which are likely not
sufficient to represent the complex conditional distributions present in music.
In this work, we propose to use modern deep probabilistic generative models in
the form of a Diffusion Model to compute an approximate likelihood of a musical
input sequence. Unlike prior work, such a generative model parameterized by
deep neural networks is able to learn complex non-linear features directly from
a training set itself. In doing so, we expect to find that such models are able
to more accurately represent the 'surprisal' of music for human listeners. From
the literature, it is known that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship
between surprisal and the amount human subjects 'like' a given song. In this
work we show that pre-trained diffusion models indeed yield musical surprisal
values which exhibit a negative quadratic relationship with measured subject
'liking' ratings, and that the quality of this relationship is competitive with
state of the art methods such as IDyOM. We therefore present this model a
preliminary step in developing modern deep generative models of music
expectation and subjective likability.]]></summary>

To address them, we introduce the Conditioned Constrained Policy Optimization

(VVE) for approximating value functions under unseen threshold conditions, and
(2) Conditioned Variational Inference (CVI) for encoding arbitrary constraint

via deep reinforcement learning (RL) is their limited ability to generalise to
new environments, even when these share similar characteristics with
environments encountered during training. In this work, we investigate how a
non-uniform sampling strategy of individual environment instances, or levels,
affects the zero-shot generalisation (ZSG) ability of RL agents, considering
two failure modes: overfitting and over-generalisation. As a first step, we
measure the mutual information (MI) between the agent's internal representation
and the set of training levels, which we find to be well-correlated to instance
overfitting. In contrast to uniform sampling, adaptive sampling strategies
prioritising levels based on their value loss are more effective at maintaining
lower MI, which provides a novel theoretical justification for this class of
techniques. We then turn our attention to unsupervised environment design (UED)
methods, which adaptively generate new training levels and minimise MI more
effectively than methods sampling from a fixed set. However, we find UED
methods significantly shift the training distribution, resulting in
over-generalisation and worse ZSG performance over the distribution of
interest. To prevent both instance overfitting and over-generalisation, we
introduce self-supervised environment design (SSED). SSED generates levels
using a variational autoencoder, effectively reducing MI while minimising the
shift with the distribution of interest, and leads to statistically significant

crucial for organizations. Synthetic data generation is one solution, producing
artificial data that mirrors the statistical properties of private data. While
numerous techniques have been devised under differential privacy, they
predominantly assume data is centralized. However, data is often distributed
across multiple clients in a federated manner. In this work, we initiate the
study of federated synthetic tabular data generation. Building upon a SOTA
central method known as AIM, we present DistAIM and FLAIM. We show it is
straightforward to distribute AIM, extending a recent approach based on secure
multi-party computation which necessitates additional overhead, making it less
suited to federated scenarios. We then demonstrate that naively federating AIM
can lead to substantial degradation in utility under the presence of
heterogeneity. To mitigate both issues, we propose an augmented FLAIM approach
that maintains a private proxy of heterogeneity. We simulate our methods across
a range of benchmark datasets under different degrees of heterogeneity and show
this can improve utility while reducing overhead.]]></summary>

Yet genomics entails unique challenges to deep learning since we are expecting
from deep learning a superhuman intelligence that explores beyond our knowledge
to interpret the genome. A powerful deep learning model should rely on
insightful utilization of task-specific knowledge. In this paper, we briefly
discuss the strengths of different deep learning models from a genomic

like GPT, learn context-free grammars (CFGs) -- diverse language systems with a
tree-like structure capturing many aspects of natural languages, programs, and
logics. CFGs are as hard as pushdown automata, and can be ambiguous so that
verifying if a string satisfies the rules requires dynamic programming. We
construct synthetic data and demonstrate that even for difficult (long and
ambiguous) CFGs, pre-trained transformers can learn to generate sentences with
near-perfect accuracy and impressive diversity.

More importantly, we delve into the physical principles behind how
transformers learns CFGs. We discover that the hidden states within the
transformer implicitly and precisely encode the CFG structure (such as putting
tree node information exactly on the subtree boundary), and learn to form
"boundary to boundary" attentions resembling dynamic programming. We also cover
some extension of CFGs as well as the robustness aspect of transformers against
grammar mistakes. Overall, our research provides a comprehensive and empirical
understanding of how transformers learn CFGs, and reveals the physical
mechanisms utilized by transformers to capture the structure and rules of
languages.]]></summary>

of a Gaussian distribution with unknown variance $\sigma$. Curiously, he
employed both an improper (right Haar) mixture over $\sigma$ and an improper

construction, which use generalized nonintegrable martingales and an extended
Ville's inequality. While this does yield a sequential t-test, it does not
yield an ``e-process'' (due to the nonintegrability of his martingale). In this
paper, we develop two new e-processes and confidence sequences for the same
setting: one is a test martingale in a reduced filtration, while the other is
an e-process in the canonical data filtration. These are respectively obtained
by swapping Lai's flat mixture for a Gaussian mixture, and swapping the right
Haar mixture over $\sigma$ with the maximum likelihood estimate under the null,
as done in universal inference. We also analyze the width of resulting
confidence sequences, which have a curious dependence on the error probability
$\alpha$. Numerical experiments are provided along the way to compare and

damage an adversary can exact on the network. However, the cascading impact of
such attacks is often overlooked, even though cascades are one of the primary
causes of large-scale blackouts. This paper explores modifications of
transmission line protection settings as candidates for adversarial attacks,
which can remain undetectable as long as the network equilibrium state remains
unaltered. This forms the basis of a black-box function in a Bayesian
optimization procedure, where the objective is to find protection settings that
maximize network degradation due to cascading. Notably, our proposed method is
agnostic to the choice of the cascade simulator and its underlying assumptions.
Numerical experiments reveal that, against conventional wisdom, maximally
misconfiguring the protection settings of all network lines does not cause the
most cascading. More surprisingly, even when the degree of misconfiguration is
limited due to resource constraints, it is still possible to find settings that
produce cascades comparable in severity to instances where there are no
resource constraints.]]></summary>

performing a range of instruction following tasks in few and zero-shot
settings. However, teaching LLMs to perform tasks on the web presents
fundamental challenges -- combinatorially large open-world tasks and variations
across web interfaces. We tackle these challenges by leveraging LLMs to
decompose web tasks into a collection of sub-tasks, each of which can be solved
by a low-level, closed-loop policy. These policies constitute a shared grammar
across tasks, i.e., new web tasks can be expressed as a composition of these
policies. We propose a novel framework, Hierarchical Policies for Web Actions
using LLMs (HeaP), that learns a set of hierarchical LLM prompts from
demonstrations for planning high-level tasks and executing them via a sequence
of low-level policies. We evaluate HeaP against a range of baselines on a suite
of web tasks, including MiniWoB++, WebArena, a mock airline CRM, as well as
live website interactions, and show that it is able to outperform prior works

activities. Researchers have achieved promising results in leveraging ECGs in
clinical applications with deep learning models. However, the mainstream deep

Learning (ECG-SL) framework to explicitly model the periodic nature of ECG
signals. More specifically, ECG signals are first split into heartbeat
segments, and then structural features are extracted from each of the segments.
Based on the structural features, a temporal model is designed to learn the
temporal information for various clinical tasks. Further, due to the fact that
massive ECG signals are available but the labeled data are very limited, we
also explore self-supervised learning strategy to pre-train the models,
resulting significant improvement for downstream tasks. The proposed method
outperforms the baseline model and shows competitive performances compared with
task-specific methods in three clinical applications: cardiac condition
diagnosis, sleep apnea detection, and arrhythmia classification. Further, we
find that the ECG-SL tends to focus more on each heartbeat's peak and ST range

The primary structure of a peptide can be represented either as an amino acid
sequence or as a molecular graph consisting of atoms and chemical bonds.
Previous studies have indicated that deep learning routes specific to
sequential and graphical peptide forms exhibit comparable performance on
downstream tasks. Despite the fact that these models learn representations of
the same modality of peptides, we find that they explain their predictions
differently. Considering sequential and graphical models as two experts making
inferences from different perspectives, we work on fusing expert knowledge to
enrich the learned representations for improving the discriminative
performance. To achieve this, we propose a peptide co-modeling method, RepCon,
which employs a contrastive learning-based framework to enhance the mutual
information of representations from decoupled sequential and graphical
end-to-end models. It considers representations from the sequential encoder and
the graphical encoder for the same peptide sample as a positive pair and learns
to enhance the consistency of representations between positive sample pairs and
to repel representations between negative pairs. Empirical studies of RepCon
and other co-modeling methods are conducted on open-source discriminative
datasets, including aggregation propensity, retention time, antimicrobial
peptide prediction, and family classification from Peptide Database. Our
results demonstrate the superiority of the co-modeling approach over
independent modeling, as well as the superiority of RepCon over other methods
under the co-modeling framework. In addition, the attribution on RepCon further
corroborates the validity of the approach at the level of model explanation.]]></summary>

adverse weather in the scene, resulting in a more accurate perception of the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Owing to the prohibitive costs of generating large amounts of labeled data,
programmatic weak supervision is a growing paradigm within machine learning. In
this setting, users design heuristics that provide noisy labels for subsets of
the data. These weak labels are combined (typically via a graphical model) to
form pseudolabels, which are then used to train a downstream model. In this
work, we question a foundational premise of the typical weakly supervised
learning pipeline: given that the heuristic provides all ``label" information,
why do we need to generate pseudolabels at all? Instead, we propose to directly
transform the heuristics themselves into corresponding loss functions that
penalize differences between our model and the heuristic. By constructing
losses directly from the heuristics, we can incorporate more information than
is used in the standard weakly supervised pipeline, such as how the heuristics
make their decisions, which explicitly informs feature selection during
training. We call our method Losses over Labels (LoL) as it creates losses
directly from heuristics without going through the intermediate step of a
label. We show that LoL improves upon existing weak supervision methods on
several benchmark text and image classification tasks and further demonstrate
that incorporating gradient information leads to better performance on almost
every task.]]></summary>

reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), may not universally suit
diverse human preferences. Recent approaches therefore opt for customization by
collecting multi-dimensional feedback and creating distinct rewards for each
dimension (e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness, honesty). LMs can then be tailored
to different preferences using multi-objective RL (MORL) with different reward
weightings. Yet, RL fine-tuning is unstable and resource-heavy, especially for
MORLHF with diverse and usually conflicting objectives. In this paper, we
present Multi-Objective Direct Preference Optimization (MODPO), an RL-free
algorithm that extends Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for multiple
alignment objectives. Essentially, MODPO trains different LMs to represent
different collective reward models that combine all objectives with specific
weightings. With a simple cross-entropy loss, the LMs optimized against the
MODPO objective are analytically the exact solutions of the original MORLHF
objective. Empirical results in safety alignment and long-form question
answering confirm that MODPO matches or outperforms existing methods,
efficiently producing a Pareto-optimal set of LMs that cater to diverse
preferences with 3 times less computational resources compared with MORLHF.]]></summary>

Feedback (RLHF) to align large language models. Open-source preference datasets
and reward models have enabled wider experimentation beyond generic chat
settings, particularly to make systems more "helpful" for tasks like web
question answering, summarization, and multi-turn dialogue. When optimizing for
helpfulness, RLHF has been consistently observed to drive models to produce
longer outputs. This paper demonstrates that optimizing for response length is
a significant factor behind RLHF's reported improvements in these settings.
First, we study the relationship between reward and length for reward models
trained on three open-source preference datasets for helpfulness. Here, length
correlates strongly with reward, and improvements in reward score are driven in
large part by shifting the distribution over output lengths. We then explore
interventions during both RL and reward model learning to see if we can achieve
the same downstream improvements as RLHF without increasing length. While our
interventions mitigate length increases, they aren't uniformly effective across
settings. Furthermore, we find that even running RLHF with a reward based
solely on length can reproduce most of the downstream improvements over the
initial policy model, showing that reward models in these settings have a long
way to go.]]></summary>

performance and great application value in federated learning (FL). However,
current studies do not provide sufficient evidence to show which one performs

approach the comparable convergence of centralized methods with less
communication, its test performance has always been inefficient in empirical
studies. To comprehensively explore their behaviors in FL, we study their
excess risks, including the joint analysis of both optimization and
generalization. We prove that on smooth non-convex objectives, 1) centralized
FL (CFL) always generalizes better than decentralized FL (DFL); 2) from
perspectives of the excess risk and test error in CFL, adopting partial
participation is superior to full participation; and, 3) there is a necessary
requirement for the topology in DFL to avoid performance collapse as the

evaluate which framework is better in practice. Extensive experiments are

advent of ChatGPT. Unlike conventional search engines, ChatGPT retrieves
knowledge from the model itself and generates answers for users. ChatGPT's
impressive question-answering (QA) capability has attracted more than 100
million users within a short period of time but has also raised concerns
regarding its reliability. In this paper, we perform the first large-scale
measurement of ChatGPT's reliability in the generic QA scenario with a
carefully curated set of 5,695 questions across ten datasets and eight domains.
We find that ChatGPT's reliability varies across different domains, especially
underperforming in law and science questions. We also demonstrate that system
roles, originally designed by OpenAI to allow users to steer ChatGPT's
behavior, can impact ChatGPT's reliability in an imperceptible way. We further
show that ChatGPT is vulnerable to adversarial examples, and even a single
character change can negatively affect its reliability in certain cases. We

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A broad current application of algorithms is in formal and quantitative
measures of murky concepts -- like merit -- to make decisions. When people
strategically respond to these sorts of evaluations in order to gain favorable
decision outcomes, their behavior can be subjected to moral judgments. They may
be described as 'gaming the system' or 'cheating,' or (in other cases)
investing 'honest effort' or 'improving.' Machine learning literature on
strategic behavior has tried to describe these dynamics by emphasizing the
efforts expended by decision subjects hoping to obtain a more favorable
assessment -- some works offer ways to preempt or prevent such manipulations,
some differentiate 'gaming' from 'improvement' behavior, while others aim to
measure the effort burden or disparate effects of classification systems. We
begin from a different starting point: that the design of an evaluation itself
can be understood as furthering goals held by the evaluator which may be
misaligned with broader societal goals. To develop the idea that evaluation
represents a strategic interaction in which both the evaluator and the subject
of their evaluation are operating out of self-interest, we put forward a model
that represents the process of evaluation using three interacting agents: a
decision subject, an evaluator, and society, representing a bundle of values
and oversight mechanisms. We highlight our model's applicability to a number of
social systems where one or two players strategically undermine the others'
interests to advance their own. Treating evaluators as themselves strategic
allows us to re-cast the scrutiny directed at decision subjects, towards the
incentives that underpin institutional designs of evaluations. The moral
standing of strategic behaviors often depend on the moral standing of the
evaluations and incentives that provoke such behaviors.]]></summary>

interest in recent years due to its ability to easily incorporate physical and
mechanistic constraints and to overcome the challenging and time-consuming task
of formulating phenomenological constitutive laws that can accurately capture
the observed material response. However, even though neural network-based
constitutive laws have been shown to generalize proficiently, the generated
representations are not easily interpretable due to their high number of
trainable parameters. Sparse regression approaches exist that allow to
obtaining interpretable expressions, but the user is tasked with creating a
library of model forms which by construction limits their expressiveness to the
functional forms provided in the libraries. In this work, we propose to train
regularized physics-augmented neural network-based constitutive models
utilizing a smoothed version of $L^{0}$-regularization. This aims to maintain
the trustworthiness inherited by the physical constraints, but also enables
interpretability which has not been possible thus far on any type of machine
learning-based constitutive model where model forms were not assumed a-priory
but were actually discovered. During the training process, the network
simultaneously fits the training data and penalizes the number of active
parameters, while also ensuring constitutive constraints such as thermodynamic
consistency. We show that the method can reliably obtain interpretable and
trustworthy constitutive models for compressible and incompressible
hyperelasticity, yield functions, and hardening models for elastoplasticity,

impressive results on image super-resolution (SR) tasks. However, due to the
randomness introduced in the reverse process of diffusion models, the
performances of diffusion-based SR models are fluctuating at every time of
sampling, especially for samplers with few resampled steps. This inherent
randomness of diffusion models results in ineffectiveness and instability,
making it challenging for users to guarantee the quality of SR results.
However, our work takes this randomness as an opportunity: fully analyzing and
leveraging it leads to the construction of an effective plug-and-play sampling
method that owns the potential to benefit a series of diffusion-based SR
methods. More in detail, we propose to steadily sample high-quality SR images
from pre-trained diffusion-based SR models by solving diffusion ordinary
differential equations (diffusion ODEs) with optimal boundary conditions (BCs)
and analyze the characteristics between the choices of BCs and their
corresponding SR results. Our analysis shows the route to obtain an
approximately optimal BC via an efficient exploration in the whole space. The
quality of SR results sampled by the proposed method with fewer steps
outperforms the quality of results sampled by current methods with randomness
from the same pre-trained diffusion-based SR model, which means that our
sampling method "boosts" current diffusion-based SR models without any

are being deployed in distributed topologies, where different nodes collaborate
to train ML models over their individual data by exchanging model-related
information (e.g., gradients) with a central server. However, distributed
learning schemes are notably vulnerable to two threats. First, Byzantine nodes
can single-handedly corrupt the learning by sending incorrect information to
the server, e.g., erroneous gradients. The standard approach to mitigate such
behavior is to use a non-linear robust aggregation method at the server.
Second, the server can violate the privacy of the nodes. Recent attacks have
shown that exchanging (unencrypted) gradients enables a curious server to
recover the totality of the nodes' data. The use of homomorphic encryption
(HE), a gold standard security primitive, has extensively been studied as a
privacy-preserving solution to distributed learning in non-Byzantine scenarios.
However, due to HE's large computational demand especially for high-dimensional
ML models, there has not yet been any attempt to design purely homomorphic
operators for non-linear robust aggregators. In this work, we present SABLE,
the first completely homomorphic and Byzantine robust distributed learning
algorithm. SABLE essentially relies on a novel plaintext encoding method that
enables us to implement the robust aggregator over batching-friendly BGV.
Moreover, this encoding scheme also accelerates state-of-the-art homomorphic
sorting with larger security margins and smaller ciphertext size. We perform
extensive experiments on image classification tasks and show that our algorithm
achieves practical execution times while matching the ML performance of its

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Accurate precipitation forecasting is a vital challenge of both scientific
and societal importance. Data-driven approaches have emerged as a widely used
solution for addressing this challenge. However, solely relying on data-driven
approaches has limitations in modeling the underlying physics, making accurate
predictions difficult. Coupling AI-based post-processing techniques with
traditional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) methods offers a more effective
solution for improving forecasting accuracy. Despite previous post-processing
efforts, accurately predicting heavy rainfall remains challenging due to the
imbalanced precipitation data across locations and complex relationships
between multiple meteorological variables. To address these limitations, we
introduce the PostRainBench, a comprehensive multi-variable NWP post-processing
benchmark consisting of three datasets for NWP post-processing-based
precipitation forecasting. We propose CAMT, a simple yet effective Channel
Attention Enhanced Multi-task Learning framework with a specially designed
weighted loss function. Its flexible design allows for easy plug-and-play
integration with various backbones. Extensive experimental results on the
proposed benchmark show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by
6.3%, 4.7%, and 26.8% in rain CSI on the three datasets respectively. Most
notably, our model is the first deep learning-based method to outperform
traditional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) approaches in extreme
precipitation conditions. It shows improvements of 15.6%, 17.4%, and 31.8% over
NWP predictions in heavy rain CSI on respective datasets. These results
highlight the potential impact of our model in reducing the severe consequences
of extreme weather events.]]></summary>

human-robot collaboration. Current methods either purely rely on representing

model encompassing human motion. While these methods provide good initial
results, they are missing out on leveraging well-studied human body kinematic

of these prediction frameworks while also explicitly avoiding implausible human
joint configurations. We propose a novel human motion prediction framework that
incorporates human joint constraints and scene constraints in a Gaussian
Process Regression (GPR) model to predict human motion over a set time horizon.
This formulation is combined with an online context-aware constraints model to
leverage task-dependent motions. It is tested on a human arm kinematic model
and implemented on a human-robot collaborative setup with a UR5 robot arm to
demonstrate the real-time capability of our approach. Simulations were also

framework for solving competitive games, where each agent optimizes policy by
treating others as part of the environment. Despite the empirical successes,
the theoretical properties of SP-based methods are limited to two-player
zero-sum games. However, for mixed cooperative-competitive games where agents
on the same team need to cooperate with each other, we can show a simple
counter-example where SP-based methods cannot converge to a global Nash
equilibrium (NE) with high probability. Alternatively, Policy-Space Response
Oracles (PSRO) is an iterative framework for learning NE, where the best
responses w.r.t. previous policies are learned in each iteration. PSRO can be
directly extended to mixed cooperative-competitive settings by jointly learning
team best responses with all convergence properties unchanged. However, PSRO
requires repeatedly training joint policies from scratch till convergence,
which makes it hard to scale to complex games. In this work, we develop a novel
algorithm, Fictitious Cross-Play (FXP), which inherits the benefits from both
frameworks. FXP simultaneously trains an SP-based main policy and a counter
population of best response policies. The main policy is trained by fictitious
self-play and cross-play against the counter population, while the counter
policies are trained as the best responses to the main policy's past versions.
We validate our method in matrix games and show that FXP converges to global
NEs while SP methods fail. We also conduct experiments in a gridworld domain,
where FXP achieves higher Elo ratings and lower exploitabilities than
baselines, and a more challenging football game, where FXP defeats SOTA models
with over 94% win rate.]]></summary>

learning problems when there are multiple learning criteria, data modalities,
or learning tasks. Different from single-objective learning, one of the
critical challenges in MOL is the potential conflict among different objectives
during the iterative optimization process. Recent works have developed various
dynamic weighting algorithms for MOL such as MGDA and its variants, where the
central idea is to find an update direction that avoids conflicts among
objectives. Albeit its appealing intuition, empirical studies show that dynamic
weighting methods may not always outperform static ones. To understand this
theory-practical gap, we focus on a new stochastic variant of MGDA - the
Multi-objective gradient with Double sampling (MoDo) algorithm, and study the
generalization performance of the dynamic weighting-based MoDo and its
interplay with optimization through the lens of algorithm stability. Perhaps
surprisingly, we find that the key rationale behind MGDA -- updating along
conflict-avoidant direction - may hinder dynamic weighting algorithms from
achieving the optimal ${\cal O}(1/\sqrt{n})$ population risk, where $n$ is the
number of training samples. We further demonstrate the impact of the
variability of dynamic weights on the three-way trade-off among optimization,
generalization, and conflict avoidance that is unique in MOL. We showcase the
generality of our theoretical framework by analyzing other existing stochastic
MOL algorithms under the framework. Experiments on various multi-task learning
benchmarks are performed to demonstrate the practical applicability. Code is
available at https://github.com/heshandevaka/Trade-Off-MOL.]]></summary>

for a wide range of tasks. However, deploying these models for inference has
been a significant challenge due to their unprecedented resource requirements.
This has forced existing deployment frameworks to use multi-GPU inference
pipelines, which are often complex and costly, or to use smaller and less
performant models. In this work, we demonstrate that the main bottleneck for
generative inference with LLMs is memory bandwidth, rather than compute,
specifically for single batch inference. While quantization has emerged as a
promising solution by representing model weights with reduced precision,
previous efforts have often resulted in notable performance degradation. To
address this, we introduce SqueezeLLM, a post-training quantization framework
that not only enables lossless compression to ultra-low precisions of up to
3-bit, but also achieves higher quantization performance under the same memory
constraint. Our framework incorporates two novel ideas: (i) sensitivity-based
non-uniform quantization, which searches for the optimal bit precision
assignment based on second-order information; and (ii) the Dense-and-Sparse
decomposition that stores outliers and sensitive weight values in an efficient
sparse format. When applied to the LLaMA models, our 3-bit quantization
significantly reduces the perplexity gap from the FP16 baseline by up to 2.1x
as compared to the state-of-the-art methods with the same memory requirement.
Furthermore, when deployed on an A6000 GPU, our quantized models achieve up to
2.3x speedup compared to the baseline. Our code is open-sourced and available
online.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative condition that
precedes progressive and irreversible dementia; thus, predicting its
progression over time is vital for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Numerous
studies have implemented structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to model
AD progression, focusing on three integral aspects: (i) temporal variability,
(ii) incomplete observations, and (iii) temporal geometric characteristics.
However, deep learning-based approaches regarding data variability and sparsity
have yet to consider inherent geometrical properties sufficiently. The ordinary
differential equation-based geometric modeling method (ODE-RGRU) has recently
emerged as a promising strategy for modeling time-series data by intertwining a
recurrent neural network and an ODE in Riemannian space. Despite its
achievements, ODE-RGRU encounters limitations when extrapolating positive
definite symmetric metrics from incomplete samples, leading to feature reverse
occurrences that are particularly problematic, especially within the clinical
facet. Therefore, this study proposes a novel geometric learning approach that
models longitudinal MRI biomarkers and cognitive scores by combining three
modules: topological space shift, ODE-RGRU, and trajectory estimation. We have
also developed a training algorithm that integrates manifold mapping with
monotonicity constraints to reflect measurement transition irreversibility. We
verify our proposed method's efficacy by predicting clinical labels and
cognitive scores over time in regular and irregular settings. Furthermore, we
thoroughly analyze our proposed framework through an ablation study.]]></summary>

detection. However, identifying lung nodules poses significant challenges for
radiologists, who rely heavily on their expertise and experience for accurate
diagnosis. To address this issue, computer-aided diagnosis systems based on
machine learning techniques have emerged to assist doctors in identifying lung
nodules from computed tomography (CT) scans. Unfortunately, existing networks
in this domain often suffer from computational complexity, leading to high
rates of false negatives and false positives, limiting their effectiveness. To
address these challenges, we present an innovative model that harnesses the
strengths of both convolutional neural networks and vision transformers.
Inspired by object detection in videos, we treat each 3D CT image as a video,
individual slices as frames, and lung nodules as objects, enabling a
time-series application. The primary objective of our work is to overcome
hardware limitations during model training, allowing for efficient processing
of 2D data while utilizing inter-slice information for accurate identification
based on 3D image context. We validated the proposed network by applying a
10-fold cross-validation technique to the publicly available Lung Nodule
Analysis 2016 dataset. Our proposed architecture achieves an average
sensitivity criterion of 97.84% and a competition performance metrics (CPM) of
96.0% with few parameters. Comparative analysis with state-of-the-art
advancements in lung nodule identification demonstrates the significant
accuracy achieved by our proposed model.]]></summary>

C. Rubin Observatory will observe an order of magnitude more astrophysical
transient events than any previous survey before. With this deluge of
photometric data, it will be impossible for all such events to be classified by
humans alone. Recent efforts have sought to leverage machine learning methods
to tackle the challenge of astronomical transient classification, with ever
improving success. Transformers are a recently developed deep learning
architecture, first proposed for natural language processing, that have shown a
great deal of recent success. In this work we develop a new transformer
architecture, which uses multi-head self attention at its core, for general
multi-variate time-series data. Furthermore, the proposed time-series
transformer architecture supports the inclusion of an arbitrary number of
additional features, while also offering interpretability. We apply the
time-series transformer to the task of photometric classification, minimising
the reliance of expert domain knowledge for feature selection, while achieving
results comparable to state-of-the-art photometric classification methods. We
achieve a logarithmic-loss of 0.507 on imbalanced data in a representative
setting using data from the Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-Series
Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC). Moreover, we achieve a micro-averaged
receiver operating characteristic area under curve of 0.98 and micro-averaged

potential in extracting information from hierarchical graphs. However, existing
HGCNs are limited to shallow architectures, due to the expensive hyperbolic

treatments have been applied to alleviate over-smoothing, developing a
hyperbolic therapy presents distinct challenges since operations should be
carefully designed to fit the hyperbolic nature. Addressing the above
challenges, in this work, we propose DeepHGCN, the first deep multi-layer HGCN

enablers of deep HGCNs: (1) a novel hyperbolic feature transformation layer
that enables fast and accurate linear maps; and (2) Techniques such as
hyperbolic residual connections and regularization for both weights and

if human decision-makers comply perfectly with algorithmic decisions. However,
perfect compliance with the algorithm is rarely a reality or even a desirable
outcome in human-AI collaboration. Yet, recent studies have shown that
selective compliance with fair algorithms can amplify discrimination relative
to the prior human policy. As a consequence, ensuring equitable outcomes
requires fundamentally different algorithmic design principles that ensure
robustness to the decision-maker's (a priori unknown) compliance pattern. We
define the notion of compliance-robustly fair algorithmic recommendations that
are guaranteed to (weakly) improve fairness in decisions, regardless of the
human's compliance pattern. We propose a simple optimization strategy to
identify the best performance-improving compliance-robustly fair policy.
However, we show that it may be infeasible to design algorithmic
recommendations that are simultaneously fair in isolation, compliance-robustly
fair, and more accurate than the human policy; thus, if our goal is to improve
the equity and accuracy of human-AI collaboration, it may not be desirable to
enforce traditional fairness constraints.]]></summary>

in intelligent software systems. However, training a DNN model is typically
expensive in terms of both time and money. To address this issue, researchers
have recently focused on reusing existing DNN models - borrowing the idea of
code reuse in software engineering. However, reusing an entire model could
cause extra overhead or inherits the weakness from the undesired
functionalities. Hence, existing work proposes to decompose an already trained
model into modules, i.e., modularizing-after-training, and enable module reuse.
Since trained models are not built for modularization,
modularizing-after-training incurs huge overhead and model accuracy loss. In
this paper, we propose a novel approach that incorporates modularization into
the model training process, i.e., modularizing-while-training (MwT). We train a
model to be structurally modular through two loss functions that optimize
intra-module cohesion and inter-module coupling. We have implemented the
proposed approach for modularizing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models in
this work. The evaluation results on representative models demonstrate that MwT
outperforms the state-of-the-art approach. Specifically, the accuracy loss
caused by MwT is only 1.13 percentage points, which is 1.76 percentage points
less than that of the baseline. The kernel retention rate of the modules
generated by MwT is only 14.58%, with a reduction of 74.31% over the
state-of-the-art approach. Furthermore, the total time cost required for
training and modularizing is only 108 minutes, half of the baseline.]]></summary>

is trainable end-to-end. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on

Simultaneously, foundation models (FMs) have gained traction in the artificial

their substantial size and intensive resource requirements. This is especially
true when considering the resource heterogeneity in edge FL systems. We present
an adaptive framework for Resource-aware Federated Foundation Models (RaFFM) to

algorithms tailored for FL scenarios, such as salient parameter prioritization
and high-performance subnetwork extraction. These algorithms enable dynamic
scaling of given transformer-based FMs to fit heterogeneous resource
constraints at the network edge during both FL's optimization and deployment
stages. Experimental results demonstrate that RaFFM shows significant
superiority in resource utilization efficiency and uses fewer resources to
deploy FMs to FL. Despite the lower resource consumption, target models
optimized by RaFFM achieve performance on par with traditional FL methods
applied to full-sized FMs. This is evident across tasks in both natural

paper, we investigate the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) as an
approximator for human play for rule generation. We recreate the classic AGD
environment Mechanic Maker in Unity as a new, open-source rule generation
framework. Our results demonstrate that RL produces distinct sets of rules from
an A* agent baseline, which may be more usable by humans.]]></summary>

Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) yields widespread robustness improvement
under domain transfer. Instead of focusing on parameters, however, this work
considers the transferability of representations as the optimization target for
out-of-domain generalization in a fine-tuning setup. To encourage the retention
of transferable representations, we consider trust region-based fine-tuning
methods, which exploit task-specific skills without forgetting task-agnostic
representations from pre-training. We unify parameter- and representation-space
smoothing approaches by using trust region bounds to inform SAM-style
regularizers on both of these optimization surfaces. We propose Trust Region
Aware Minimization (TRAM), a fine-tuning algorithm that optimizes for flat
minima and smooth, informative representations without forgetting pre-trained
structure. We find that TRAM outperforms both sharpness-aware and trust
region-based optimization methods on cross-domain language modeling and
cross-lingual transfer, where robustness to domain transfer and representation
generality are critical for success. TRAM establishes a new standard in
training generalizable models with minimal additional computation.]]></summary>

and cost of physical experiments, selected mostly through trial-and-error and
intuition that require deep domain expertise. Numerical simulations present an
alternative to physical experiments but are usually infeasible for complex
real-world domains due to the computational requirements of existing numerical
methods. Artificial intelligence (AI) presents a potential paradigm shift by
developing fast data-driven surrogate models. In particular, an AI framework,
known as neural operators, presents a principled framework for learning
mappings between functions defined on continuous domains, e.g., spatiotemporal
processes and partial differential equations (PDE). They can extrapolate and
predict solutions at new locations unseen during training, i.e., perform
zero-shot super-resolution. Neural operators can augment or even replace
existing simulators in many applications, such as computational fluid dynamics,
weather forecasting, and material modeling, while being 4-5 orders of magnitude
faster. Further, neural operators can be integrated with physics and other
domain constraints enforced at finer resolutions to obtain high-fidelity
solutions and good generalization. Since neural operators are differentiable,
they can directly optimize parameters for inverse design and other inverse
problems. We believe that neural operators present a transformative approach to
simulation and design, enabling rapid research and development.]]></summary>

visual input using the composition of multiple objects. Representation learning
methods have often used unsupervised learning to segment an input image into
individual objects and encode these objects into each latent vector. However,
it is not clear how previous methods have achieved the appropriate segmentation
of individual objects. Additionally, most of the previous methods regularize
the latent vectors using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Therefore, it is not
clear whether VAE regularization contributes to appropriate object
segmentation. To elucidate the mechanism of object segmentation in multi-object
representation learning, we conducted an ablation study on MONet, which is a
typical method. MONet represents multiple objects using pairs that consist of
an attention mask and the latent vector corresponding to the attention mask.
Each latent vector is encoded from the input image and attention mask. Then,
the component image and attention mask are decoded from each latent vector. The
loss function of MONet consists of 1) the sum of reconstruction losses between
the input image and decoded component image, 2) the VAE regularization loss of
the latent vector, and 3) the reconstruction loss of the attention mask to
explicitly encode shape information. We conducted an ablation study on these
three loss functions to investigate the effect on segmentation performance. Our
results showed that the VAE regularization loss did not affect segmentation
performance and the others losses did affect it. Based on this result, we
hypothesize that it is important to maximize the attention mask of the image
region best represented by a single latent vector corresponding to the
attention mask. We confirmed this hypothesis by evaluating a new loss function
with the same mechanism as the hypothesis.]]></summary>

that can adapt to the context of each participating client, while utilizing
knowledge from a shared global model. Yet, often, personalization requires a
fine-tuning step using clients' labeled data in order to achieve good
performance. This may not be feasible in scenarios where incoming clients are
fresh and/or have privacy concerns. It, then, remains open how one can achieve
just-in-time personalization in these scenarios. We propose FedJETs, a novel
solution by using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework within a FL setup. Our
method leverages the diversity of the clients to train specialized experts on
different subsets of classes, and a gating function to route the input to the
most relevant expert(s). Our gating function harnesses the knowledge of a
pretrained model common expert to enhance its routing decisions on-the-fly. As
a highlight, our approach can improve accuracy up to 18\% in state of the art
FL settings, while maintaining competitive zero-shot performance. In practice,
our method can handle non-homogeneous data distributions, scale more
efficiently, and improve the state-of-the-art performance on common FL

of biomedical FMs, we present BioBridge, a novel parameter-efficient learning

beat the best baseline KG embedding methods (on average by around 76.3%) in
cross-modal retrieval tasks. We also identify BioBridge demonstrates

imaging (rs-fMRI) have been widely used to diagnose brain diseases,
particularly autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Existing studies have leveraged
the functional connectivity (FC) of rs-fMRI, achieving notable classification
performance. However, they have significant limitations, including the lack of
adequate information while using linear low-order FC as inputs to the model,
not considering individual characteristics (i.e., different symptoms or varying
stages of severity) among patients with ASD, and the non-explainability of the
decision process. To cover these limitations, we propose a novel
explainability-guided region of interest (ROI) selection (EAG-RS) framework
that identifies non-linear high-order functional associations among brain
regions by leveraging an explainable artificial intelligence technique and
selects class-discriminative regions for brain disease identification. The
proposed framework includes three steps: (i) inter-regional relation learning
to estimate non-linear relations through random seed-based network masking,
(ii) explainable connection-wise relevance score estimation to explore
high-order relations between functional connections, and (iii) non-linear
high-order FC-based diagnosis-informative ROI selection and classifier learning
to identify ASD. We validated the effectiveness of our proposed method by
conducting experiments using the Autism Brain Imaging Database Exchange (ABIDE)

containing normal lymph nodes, benign lymph node lesions, malignant primary
lymph node lesions, and malignant metastatic lymph node lesions. Given that
ultrasound images are generated by the reflection and scattering of sound waves
across varied bodily tissues, we proposed the Conv-FFT Block. It integrates
convolutional operations with the fast Fourier transform to more astutely model
the images. Building upon this foundation, we designed a novel architecture,
named SFUSNet. SFUSNet not only discerns variances in ultrasound images from
the spatial domain but also adeptly captures micro-structural alterations
across various lesions in the frequency domain. To ascertain the potential of
SFUSNet, we benchmarked it against 12 popular architectures through five-fold
cross-validation. The results show that SFUSNet is the state-of-the-art model

evaluation benchmarks. However, concerns about their performance are raised on
potential data contamination in their considerable volume of training corpus.
Moreover, the static nature and fixed complexity of current benchmarks may
inadequately gauge the advancing capabilities of LLMs. In this paper, we
introduce DyVal, a novel, general, and flexible evaluation protocol for dynamic
evaluation of LLMs. Based on our proposed dynamic evaluation framework, we
build graph-informed DyVal by leveraging the structural advantage of directed
acyclic graphs to dynamically generate evaluation samples with controllable
complexities. DyVal generates challenging evaluation sets on reasoning tasks
including mathematics, logical reasoning, and algorithm problems. We evaluate
various LLMs ranging from Flan-T5-large to ChatGPT and GPT4. Experiments
demonstrate that LLMs perform worse in DyVal-generated evaluation samples with
different complexities, emphasizing the significance of dynamic evaluation. We
also analyze the failure cases and results of different prompting methods.
Moreover, DyVal-generated samples are not only evaluation sets, but also
helpful data for fine-tuning to improve the performance of LLMs on existing
benchmarks. We hope that DyVal can shed light on the future evaluation research
of LLMs.]]></summary>

from adversarial training and policy evaluation in reinforcement learning to
AUROC maximization. To address the large-scale data challenges across multiple
clients with communication-efficient distributed training, federated learning
(FL) is gaining popularity. Many optimization algorithms for minimax problems
have been developed in the centralized setting (\emph{i.e.} single-machine).
Nonetheless, the algorithm for minimax problems under FL is still
underexplored. In this paper, we study a class of federated nonconvex minimax
optimization problems. We propose FL algorithms (FedSGDA+ and FedSGDA-M) and
reduce existing complexity results for the most common minimax problems. For
nonconvex-concave problems, we propose FedSGDA+ and reduce the communication
complexity to $O(\varepsilon^{-6})$. Under nonconvex-strongly-concave and
nonconvex-PL minimax settings, we prove that FedSGDA-M has the best-known
sample complexity of $O(\kappa^{3} N^{-1}\varepsilon^{-3})$ and the best-known
communication complexity of $O(\kappa^{2}\varepsilon^{-2})$. FedSGDA-M is the
first algorithm to match the best sample complexity $O(\varepsilon^{-3})$
achieved by the single-machine method under the nonconvex-strongly-concave
setting. Extensive experimental results on fair classification and AUROC
maximization show the efficiency of our algorithms.]]></summary>

generative modeling problem of learning a joint distribution that recovers
these densities as marginals. The structure of this joint distribution should

an approach to this task within a generalization of the stochastic interpolant
framework, leading to efficient learning algorithms built upon dynamical
transport of measure. Our generative models are defined by velocity and score
fields that can be characterized as the minimizers of simple quadratic
objectives, and they are defined on a simplex that generalizes the time
variable in the usual dynamical transport framework. The resulting transport on
the simplex is influenced by all marginals, and we show that multi-way
correspondences can be extracted. The identification of such correspondences
has applications to style transfer, algorithmic fairness, and data
decorruption. In addition, the multimarginal perspective enables an efficient
algorithm for reducing the dynamical transport cost in the ordinary
two-marginal setting. We demonstrate these capacities with several numerical

scenarios where extensive evaluations of the cost function are expensive,
inaccessible, or even prohibitive. The method, which we call
Landscape-Sketch-and-Step (LSS), combines Machine Learning, Stochastic
Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning techniques, relying on historical
information from previously sampled points to make judicious choices of
parameter values where the cost function should be evaluated at. Unlike
optimization by Replica Exchange Monte Carlo methods, the number of evaluations
of the cost function required in this approach is comparable to that used by
Simulated Annealing, quality that is especially important in contexts like
high-throughput computing or high-performance computing tasks, where
evaluations are either computationally expensive or take a long time to be
performed. The method also differs from standard Surrogate Optimization
techniques, for it does not construct a surrogate model that aims at
approximating or reconstructing the objective function. We illustrate our
method by applying it to low dimensional optimization problems (dimensions 1,
2, 4, and 8) that mimick known difficulties of minimization on rugged energy
landscapes often seen in Condensed Matter Physics, where cost functions are
rugged and plagued with local minima. When compared to classical Simulated
Annealing, the LSS shows an effective acceleration of the optimization process.]]></summary>

level of MeSH descriptors with several related but distinct biomedical concepts
often grouped together and treated as a single topic. This study proposes a new

concept occurrence in the abstract of an article, which is also enhanced by
dictionary-based heuristics. In addition, we investigate deep learning
approaches, making design choices to tackle the particular challenges of this
task. The new method is evaluated on a large-scale retrospective scenario,
based on concepts that have been promoted to descriptors. Results: In our
experiments concept occurrence was the strongest heuristic achieving a macro-F1
score of about 0.63 across several labels. The proposed method improved it

occurrence is a strong heuristic for refining the coarse-grained labels at the

opaqueness of neural networks presents a challenge in interpreting the logic
behind their findings. Here, we use a eXplainable-AI (XAI) technique called
$inception$ or $deep$ $dreaming$, which has been invented in machine learning
for computer vision. We use this technique to explore what neural networks
learn about quantum optics experiments. Our story begins by training deep
neural networks on the properties of quantum systems. Once trained, we "invert"
the neural network -- effectively asking how it imagines a quantum system with
a specific property, and how it would continuously modify the quantum system to
change a property. We find that the network can shift the initial distribution
of properties of the quantum system, and we can conceptualize the learned
strategies of the neural network. Interestingly, we find that, in the first
layers, the neural network identifies simple properties, while in the deeper
ones, it can identify complex quantum structures and even quantum entanglement.
This is in reminiscence of long-understood properties known in computer vision,
which we now identify in a complex natural science task. Our approach could be

it challenging to train and deploy RL-policies in real world robots. Even a
robust policy trained in simulation requires a real-world deployment to assess
their performance. This paper proposes a new approach to evaluate the
real-world performance of agent policies prior to deploying them in the real
world. Our approach incorporates a simulator along with real-world offline data
to evaluate the performance of any policy using the framework of Marginalized
Importance Sampling (MIS). Existing MIS methods face two challenges: (1) large
density ratios that deviate from a reasonable range and (2) indirect
supervision, where the ratio needs to be inferred indirectly, thus exacerbating
estimation error. Our approach addresses these challenges by introducing the
target policy's occupancy in the simulator as an intermediate variable and
learning the density ratio as the product of two terms that can be learned
separately. The first term is learned with direct supervision and the second
term has a small magnitude, thus making it computationally efficient. We
analyze the sample complexity as well as error propagation of our two
step-procedure. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate our approach on Sim2Sim
environments such as Cartpole, Reacher, and Half-Cheetah. Our results show that
our method generalizes well across a variety of Sim2Sim gap, target policies
and offline data collection policies. We also demonstrate the performance of
our algorithm on a Sim2Real task of validating the performance of a 7 DoF
robotic arm using offline data along with the Gazebo simulator.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like generic multi-task learning, continual learning has the nature of
multi-objective optimization, and therefore faces a trade-off between the
performance of different tasks. That is, to optimize for the current task
distribution, it may need to compromise performance on some previous tasks.
This means that there exist multiple models that are Pareto-optimal at
different times, each addressing a distinct task performance trade-off.
Researchers have discussed how to train particular models to address specific
trade-off preferences. However, existing algorithms require training overheads
proportional to the number of preferences -- a large burden when there are
multiple, possibly infinitely many, preferences. As a response, we propose
Imprecise Bayesian Continual Learning (IBCL). Upon a new task, IBCL (1) updates
a knowledge base in the form of a convex hull of model parameter distributions
and (2) obtains particular models to address task trade-off preferences with
zero-shot. That is, IBCL does not require any additional training overhead to
generate preference-addressing models from its knowledge base. We show that
models obtained by IBCL have guarantees in identifying the Pareto optimal
parameters. Moreover, experiments on standard image classification and NLP
tasks support this guarantee. Statistically, IBCL improves average per-task
accuracy by at most 23\% and peak per-task accuracy by at most 15\% with
respect to the baseline methods, with steadily near-zero or positive backward
transfer. Most importantly, IBCL significantly reduces the training overhead

proponents and opponents grasp AI through the imagery popularised by science

we experience a paperclip apocalypse? Before answering such questions, we
should first ask whether this mental imagery provides a good description of the
phenomenon at hand. Understanding weather patterns through the moods of the

(DNNs), wherein adversaries covertly implant malicious behaviors (backdoors)
into DNNs. Our defense falls within the category of post-development defenses
that operate independently of how the model was generated. The proposed defense
is built upon a novel reverse engineering approach that can directly extract
backdoor functionality of a given backdoored model to a backdoor expert model.
The approach is straightforward -- finetuning the backdoored model over a small
set of intentionally mislabeled clean samples, such that it unlearns the normal
functionality while still preserving the backdoor functionality, and thus
resulting in a model (dubbed a backdoor expert model) that can only recognize
backdoor inputs. Based on the extracted backdoor expert model, we show the
feasibility of devising highly accurate backdoor input detectors that filter
out the backdoor inputs during model inference. Further augmented by an
ensemble strategy with a finetuned auxiliary model, our defense, BaDExpert
(Backdoor Input Detection with Backdoor Expert), effectively mitigates 17 SOTA
backdoor attacks while minimally impacting clean utility. The effectiveness of
BaDExpert has been verified on multiple datasets (CIFAR10, GTSRB and ImageNet)
across various model architectures (ResNet, VGG, MobileNetV2 and Vision
Transformer).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly being used as controllers in
reactive systems. However, DNNs are highly opaque, which renders it difficult
to explain and justify their actions. To mitigate this issue, there has been a
surge of interest in explainable AI (XAI) techniques, capable of pinpointing
the input features that caused the DNN to act as it did. Existing XAI
techniques typically face two limitations: (i) they are heuristic, and do not
provide formal guarantees that the explanations are correct; and (ii) they
often apply to ``one-shot'' systems, where the DNN is invoked independently of
past invocations, as opposed to reactive systems. Here, we begin bridging this
gap, and propose a formal DNN-verification-based XAI technique for reasoning
about multi-step, reactive systems. We suggest methods for efficiently
calculating succinct explanations, by exploiting the system's transition
constraints in order to curtail the search space explored by the underlying
verifier. We evaluate our approach on two popular benchmarks from the domain of
automated navigation; and observe that our methods allow the efficient
computation of minimal and minimum explanations, significantly outperforming
the state of the art. We also demonstrate that our methods produce formal
explanations that are more reliable than competing, non-verification-based XAI
techniques.]]></summary>

processing graph-structured input. However, they operate on a fixed input graph
structure, ignoring potential noise and missing information. Furthermore, their
local aggregation mechanism can lead to problems such as over-squashing and
limited expressive power in capturing relevant graph structures. Existing
solutions to these challenges have primarily relied on heuristic methods, often
disregarding the underlying data distribution. Hence, devising principled
approaches for learning to infer graph structures relevant to the given
prediction task remains an open challenge. In this work, leveraging recent
progress in exact and differentiable $k$-subset sampling, we devise
probabilistically rewired MPNNs (PR-MPNNs), which learn to add relevant edges
while omitting less beneficial ones. For the first time, our theoretical
analysis explores how PR-MPNNs enhance expressive power, and we identify
precise conditions under which they outperform purely randomized approaches.
Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates issues like
over-squashing and under-reaching. In addition, on established real-world
datasets, our method exhibits competitive or superior predictive performance
compared to traditional MPNN models and recent graph transformer architectures.]]></summary>

obtained with crowd-sourcing services. Multiple annotators each complete their
own small part of the annotations, where labeling mistakes that depend on
annotators occur frequently. Modeling the label-noise generation process by the
noise transition matrix is a power tool to tackle the label noise. In
real-world crowd-sourcing scenarios, noise transition matrices are both
annotator- and instance-dependent. However, due to the high complexity of
annotator- and instance-dependent transition matrices (AIDTM), annotation
sparsity, which means each annotator only labels a little part of instances,
makes modeling AIDTM very challenging. Prior works simplify the problem by
assuming the transition matrix is instance-independent or using simple
parametric ways, which lose modeling generality. Motivated by this, we target a
more realistic problem, estimating general AIDTM in practice. Without losing
modeling generality, we parameterize AIDTM with deep neural networks. To
alleviate the modeling challenge, we suppose every annotator shares its noise
pattern with similar annotators, and estimate AIDTM via knowledge transfer. We
hence first model the mixture of noise patterns by all annotators, and then
transfer this modeling to individual annotators. Furthermore, considering that
the transfer from the mixture of noise patterns to individuals may cause two
annotators with highly different noise generations to perturb each other, we
employ the knowledge transfer between identified neighboring annotators to
calibrate the modeling. Theoretical analyses are derived to demonstrate that
both the knowledge transfer from global to individuals and the knowledge
transfer between neighboring individuals can help model general AIDTM.
Experiments confirm the superiority of the proposed approach on synthetic and
real-world crowd-sourcing data.]]></summary>

traditional malware detection models are ineffective against adversarial

many applications in various domains, such as cancer diagnosis and enzyme
prediction. However, existing methods fail to capture the underlying properties
of graph anomalies, resulting in unexplainable framework design and
unsatisfying performance. In this paper, we take a step back and re-investigate
the spectral differences between anomalous and normal graphs. Our main
observation shows a significant disparity in the accumulated spectral energy
between these two classes. Moreover, we prove that the accumulated spectral
energy of the graph signal can be represented by its Rayleigh Quotient,
indicating that the Rayleigh Quotient is a driving factor behind the anomalous
properties of graphs. Motivated by this, we propose Rayleigh Quotient Graph
Neural Network (RQGNN), the first spectral GNN for graph-level anomaly
detection, providing a new perspective on exploring the inherent spectral
features of anomalous graphs. Specifically, we introduce a novel framework that
consists of two components: the Rayleigh Quotient learning component (RQL) and
Chebyshev Wavelet GNN with RQ-pooling (CWGNN-RQ). RQL explicitly captures the
Rayleigh Quotient of graphs and CWGNN-RQ implicitly explores the spectral space
of graphs. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets show that RQGNN

constant is a fundamental challenge in computational science and engineering.
Recent work shows that algorithms derived by considering gradient flows in the
space of probability measures open up new avenues for algorithm development.
This paper makes three contributions to this sampling approach by scrutinizing
the design components of such gradient flows. Any instantiation of a gradient
flow for sampling needs an energy functional and a metric to determine the
flow, as well as numerical approximations of the flow to derive algorithms. Our
first contribution is to show that the Kullback-Leibler divergence, as an
energy functional, has the unique property (among all f-divergences) that
gradient flows resulting from it do not depend on the normalization constant of
the target distribution. Our second contribution is to study the choice of
metric from the perspective of invariance. The Fisher-Rao metric is known as
the unique choice (up to scaling) that is diffeomorphism invariant. As a
computationally tractable alternative, we introduce a relaxed, affine
invariance property for the metrics and gradient flows. In particular, we
construct various affine invariant Wasserstein and Stein gradient flows. Affine
invariant gradient flows are shown to behave more favorably than their
non-affine-invariant counterparts when sampling highly anisotropic
distributions, in theory and by using particle methods. Our third contribution
is to study, and develop efficient algorithms based on Gaussian approximations
of the gradient flows; this leads to an alternative to particle methods. We
establish connections between various Gaussian approximate gradient flows,
discuss their relation to gradient methods arising from parametric variational
inference, and study their convergence properties both theoretically and
numerically.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A myriad of approaches have been proposed to characterise the mesoscale
structure of networks - most often as a partition based on patterns variously
called communities, blocks, or clusters. Clearly, distinct methods designed to
detect different types of patterns may provide a variety of answers to the
network's mesoscale structure. Yet, even multiple runs of a given method can
sometimes yield diverse and conflicting results, producing entire landscapes of
partitions which potentially include multiple (locally optimal) mesoscale
explanations of the network. Such ambiguity motivates a closer look at the
ability of these methods to find multiple qualitatively different 'ground
truth' partitions in a network. Here, we propose the stochastic cross-block
model (SCBM), a generative model which allows for two distinct partitions to be
built into the mesoscale structure of a single benchmark network. We
demonstrate a use case of the benchmark model by appraising the power of
stochastic block models (SBMs) to detect implicitly planted coexisting
bi-community and core-periphery structures of different strengths. Given our
model design and experimental set-up, we find that the ability to detect the
two partitions individually varies by SBM variant and that coexistence of both
partitions is recovered only in a very limited number of cases. Our findings
suggest that in most instances only one - in some way dominating - structure
can be detected, even in the presence of other partitions. They underline the
need for considering entire landscapes of partitions when different competing
explanations exist and motivate future research to advance partition
coexistence detection methods. Our model also contributes to the field of
benchmark networks more generally by enabling further exploration of the
ability of new and existing methods to detect ambiguity in the mesoscale
structure of networks.]]></summary>

in this work. With the comments and guidance of experts, editors, and
reviewers, this work has been accepted for publishing in the journal "Process
Safety and Environmental Protection". The theme of this paper relies on the
Spatial-temporal associations of numerous variables in the same industrial
processes, which refers to numerous variables obtained in dynamic industrial
processes with Spatial-temporal correlation characteristics, i.e., these
variables are not only highly correlated in time but also interrelated in
space. To handle this problem, three key issues need to be well addressed:
variable characteristics modeling and representation, graph network
construction (temporal information), and graph characteristics perception. The
first issue is implemented by assuming the data follows one improved Gaussian
distribution, while the graph network can be defined by the monitoring
variables and their edges which are calculated by their characteristics in
time. Finally, these networks corresponding to process states at different
times are fed into a graph convolutional neural network to implement graph
classification to achieve process monitoring. A benchmark experiment (Tennessee
Eastman chemical process) and one application study (cobalt purification from
zinc solution) are employed to demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of
this paper.]]></summary>

vision and information maximisation. Following Shannon, information was defined
using the probability of natural images. A number of physiological and
psychophysical phenomena have been derived ever since from principles like
info-max, efficient coding, or optimal denoising. However, it remains unclear
how this link is expressed in mathematical terms from image probability. First,
classical derivations were subjected to strong assumptions on the probability
models and on the behaviour of the sensors. Moreover, the direct evaluation of
the hypothesis was limited by the inability of the classical image models to
deliver accurate estimates of the probability. In this work we directly
evaluate image probabilities using an advanced generative model for natural
images, and we analyse how probability-related factors can be combined to
predict human perception via sensitivity of state-of-the-art subjective image
quality metrics. We use information theory and regression analysis to find a
combination of just two probability-related factors that achieves 0.8
correlation with subjective metrics. This probability-based sensitivity is
psychophysically validated by reproducing the basic trends of the Contrast
Sensitivity Function, its suprathreshold variation, and trends of the Weber-law

by neural architectures with multivariate nonlinearities. These optimal
architectures have skip connections and are tightly connected to orthogonal
weight normalization and multi-index models, both of which have received
considerable interest in the neural network community. Our framework is
compatible with a number of classical nonlinearities including the rectified
linear unit (ReLU) activation function, the norm activation function, and the
radial basis functions found in the theory of thin-plate/polyharmonic splines.
We also show that the underlying spaces are special instances of reproducing

astounding performance and are increasingly often used in performing our daily
life tasks. However, ANNs are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which
alter inputs with small targeted perturbations that drastically disrupt the
models' performance. The most effective method to make ANNs robust against
these attacks is adversarial training, in which the training dataset is
augmented with exemplary adversarial samples. Unfortunately, this approach has
the drawback of increased training complexity since generating adversarial
samples is very computationally demanding. In contrast to ANNs, humans are not
susceptible to adversarial attacks. Therefore, in this work, we investigate
whether biologically-plausible learning algorithms are more robust against
adversarial attacks than BP. In particular, we present an extensive comparative
analysis of the adversarial robustness of BP and Present the Error to Perturb
the Input To modulate Activity (PEPITA), a recently proposed
biologically-plausible learning algorithm, on various computer vision tasks. We
observe that PEPITA has higher intrinsic adversarial robustness and, with
adversarial training, has a more favourable natural-vs-adversarial performance
trade-off as, for the same natural accuracies, PEPITA's adversarial accuracies
decrease in average by 0.26% and BP's by 8.05%.]]></summary>

overconfidence, poor calibration, and unreliable prediction results on test
data or out-of-distribution samples. One approach commonly used in vision for
alleviating this issue is a deep ensemble, which constructs an ensemble by
training the same model multiple times using different random initializations.
However, there is a huge challenge to ensembling LLMs: the most effective LLMs
are very, very large. Keeping a single LLM in memory is already challenging
enough: keeping an ensemble of e.g. 5 LLMs in memory is impossible in many
settings. To address these issues, we propose an ensemble approach using
Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique.
Critically, these low-rank adapters represent a very small number of
parameters, orders of magnitude less than the underlying pre-trained model.
Thus, it is possible to construct large ensembles of LoRA adapters with almost
the same computational overhead as using the original model. We find that LoRA
ensembles, applied on its own or on top of pre-existing regularization
techniques, gives consistent improvements in predictive accuracy and
uncertainty quantification.]]></summary>

depends on data-driven methods, which require sufficiently large datasets. When
historical data lacks this, it is desired to model the underlying data
generation mechanism as a probability distribution to assess the data quality
and generate more data, if needed. Kernel density estimation (KDE) based models
are popular choices for this task, but they fail to adapt to data regions with
varying densities. In this paper, an adaptive KDE model is employed to
circumvent this, where each kernel in the model has an individual bandwidth.
The leave-one-out maximum log-likelihood (LOO-MLL) criterion is proposed to
prevent the singular solutions that the regular MLL criterion gives rise to,
and it is proven that LOO-MLL prevents these. Relying on this guaranteed
robustness, the model is extended by assigning learnable weights to the
kernels. In addition, a modified expectation-maximization algorithm is employed
to accelerate the optimization speed reliably. The performance of the proposed
method and models are exhibited on two power systems datasets using different
statistical tests and by comparison with Gaussian mixture models. Results show
that the proposed models have promising performance, in addition to their

choice of local updates to minimize communication costs. Important to our
approach is that the communication efficiency does not deteriorate with the

algorithm both independent and correlated noise used over different clients. We
observe there is a trade-off between the pairs among communication, accuracy,

an e-process in the canonical data filtration. These are respectively obtained
by swapping Lai's flat mixture for a Gaussian mixture, and swapping the right
Haar mixture over $\sigma$ with the maximum likelihood estimate under the null,
as done in universal inference. We also analyze the width of resulting

on minimizing a cost between input and latent pairwise similarities. Though
widely used, these approaches lack clear probabilistic foundations to enable a
full understanding of their properties and limitations. To that extent, we
introduce a unifying statistical framework based on the coupling of hidden
graphs using cross entropy. These graphs induce a Markov random field
dependency structure among the observations in both input and latent spaces. We
show that existing pairwise similarity DR methods can be retrieved from our
framework with particular choices of priors for the graphs. Moreover this
reveals that these methods suffer from a statistical deficiency that explains
poor performances in conserving coarse-grain dependencies. Our model is
leveraged and extended to address this issue while new links are drawn with
Laplacian eigenmaps and PCA.]]></summary>

computation (ABC), synthetic likelihood, and neural posterior estimation (NPE)
rely on simulating statistics to infer parameters of intractable likelihood
models. However, such methods are known to yield untrustworthy and misleading
inference outcomes under model misspecification, thus hindering their
widespread applicability. In this work, we propose the first general approach
to handle model misspecification that works across different classes of SBI
methods. Leveraging the fact that the choice of statistics determines the
degree of misspecification in SBI, we introduce a regularized loss function
that penalises those statistics that increase the mismatch between the data and
the model. Taking NPE and ABC as use cases, we demonstrate the superior
performance of our method on high-dimensional time-series models that are
artificially misspecified. We also apply our method to real data from the field
of radio propagation where the model is known to be misspecified. We show
empirically that the method yields robust inference in misspecified scenarios,
whilst still being accurate when the model is well-specified.]]></summary>

has become the primary choice in many application domains. This progress is
mainly attributed to a systematic collaboration in which rapidly growing
computing resources encourage advanced algorithms to deal with massive data.
However, it has gradually become challenging to handle the unlimited growth of
data with limited computing power. To this end, diverse approaches are proposed
to improve data processing efficiency. Dataset distillation, a dataset
reduction method, addresses this problem by synthesizing a small typical
dataset from substantial data and has attracted much attention from the deep
learning community. Existing dataset distillation methods can be taxonomized
into meta-learning and data matching frameworks according to whether they
explicitly mimic the performance of target data. Although dataset distillation
has shown surprising performance in compressing datasets, there are still
several limitations such as distilling high-resolution data or data with
complex label spaces. This paper provides a holistic understanding of dataset
distillation from multiple aspects, including distillation frameworks and
algorithms, factorized dataset distillation, performance comparison, and
applications. Finally, we discuss challenges and promising directions to
further promote future studies on dataset distillation.]]></summary>

recent advances in machine learning. However, research has shown that DNNs are
vulnerable to adversarial examples -- input samples that have been perturbed to
force DNN-based models to make errors. As a result, Adversarial Machine
Learning (AdvML) has gained a lot of attention, and researchers have
investigated these vulnerabilities in various settings and modalities. In
addition, DNNs have also been found to incorporate embedded bias and often
produce unexplainable predictions, which can result in anti-social AI
applications. The emergence of new AI technologies that leverage Large Language
Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, increases the risk of producing
anti-social applications at scale. AdvML for Social Good (AdvML4G) is an
emerging field that repurposes the AdvML bug to invent pro-social applications.
Regulators, practitioners, and researchers should collaborate to encourage the
development of pro-social applications and hinder the development of
anti-social ones. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive review of
the emerging field of AdvML4G. This paper encompasses a taxonomy that
highlights the emergence of AdvML4G, a discussion of the differences and
similarities between AdvML4G and AdvML, a taxonomy covering social good-related
concepts and aspects, an exploration of the motivations behind the emergence of
AdvML4G at the intersection of ML4G and AdvML, and an extensive summary of the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Decoding speech from brain activity is a long-awaited goal in both healthcare
and neuroscience. Invasive devices have recently led to major milestones in
that regard: deep learning algorithms trained on intracranial recordings now
start to decode elementary linguistic features (e.g. letters, words,
spectrograms). However, extending this approach to natural speech and
non-invasive brain recordings remains a major challenge. Here, we introduce a
model trained with contrastive-learning to decode self-supervised
representations of perceived speech from the non-invasive recordings of a large
cohort of healthy individuals. To evaluate this approach, we curate and
integrate four public datasets, encompassing 175 volunteers recorded with
magneto- or electro-encephalography (M/EEG), while they listened to short
stories and isolated sentences. The results show that our model can identify,
from 3 seconds of MEG signals, the corresponding speech segment with up to 41%
accuracy out of more than 1,000 distinct possibilities on average across
participants, and more than 80% in the very best participants - a performance
that allows the decoding of words and phrases absent from the training set. The
comparison of our model to a variety of baselines highlights the importance of
(i) a contrastive objective, (ii) pretrained representations of speech and
(iii) a common convolutional architecture simultaneously trained across
multiple participants. Finally, the analysis of the decoder's predictions
suggests that they primarily depend on lexical and contextual semantic
representations. Overall, this effective decoding of perceived speech from
non-invasive recordings delineates a promising path to decode language from
brain activity, without putting patients at risk for brain surgery.]]></summary>

foreground objects from images in a fully unsupervised manner. Foreground
extraction can be viewed as a special case of generic image segmentation that
focuses on identifying and disentangling objects from the background. In this
work, we rethink the foreground extraction by reconciling energy-based prior
with generative image modeling in the form of Mixture of Experts (MoE), where
we further introduce the learned pixel re-assignment as the essential inductive
bias to capture the regularities of background regions. With this modeling, the
foreground-background partition can be naturally found through
Expectation-Maximization (EM). We show that the proposed method effectively
exploits the interaction between the mixture components during the partitioning
process, which closely connects to region competition, a seminal approach for
generic image segmentation. Experiments demonstrate that DRC exhibits more
competitive performances on complex real-world data and challenging
multi-object scenes compared with prior methods. Moreover, we show empirically
that DRC can potentially generalize to novel foreground objects even from

TVGs called lifetime curves, which we generate for large samples of randomly
chosen STARLINK satellites, whose connectivity is modeled over day-long

strongly connected is further analyzed using novel metrics introduced here that
are inspired by topological data analysis (TDA). To better model networking
scenarios between the Earth and Mars, we introduce various semi-rings capable
of modeling propagation delay as well as protocols common to Delay Tolerant
Networking (DTN), such as store-and-forward. Finally, we illustrate the

streams that interact with each other, where events generate new events within
their own dimension (via self-excitation) or across different dimensions (via
cross-excitation). However, in certain applications, the timestamps of
individual events in some dimensions are unobservable, and only event counts
within intervals are known, referred to as partially interval-censored data.
The MHP is unsuitable for handling such data since its estimation requires
event timestamps. In this study, we introduce the Partial Mean Behavior Poisson
(PMBP) process, a novel point process which shares parameter equivalence with
the MHP and can effectively model both timestamped and interval-censored data.
We demonstrate the capabilities of the PMBP process using synthetic and
real-world datasets. Firstly, we illustrate that the PMBP process can
approximate MHP parameters and recover the spectral radius using synthetic
event histories. Next, we assess the performance of the PMBP process in
predicting YouTube popularity and find that it surpasses state-of-the-art
methods. Lastly, we leverage the PMBP process to gain qualitative insights from
a dataset comprising daily COVID-19 case counts from multiple countries and
COVID-19-related news articles. By clustering the PMBP-modeled countries, we
unveil hidden interaction patterns between occurrences of COVID-19 cases and
news reporting.]]></summary>

stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to generate data from noise. Although
diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years, they have
limitations in the unpaired image-to-image translation tasks due to the
Gaussian prior assumption. Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB), which learns an SDE to
translate between two arbitrary distributions, have risen as an attractive
solution to this problem. However, none of SB models so far have been
successful at unpaired translation between high-resolution images. In this
work, we propose the Unpaired Neural Schr\"odinger Bridge (UNSB), which
expresses SB problem as a sequence of adversarial learning problems. This
allows us to incorporate advanced discriminators and regularization to learn a
SB between unpaired data. We demonstrate that UNSB is scalable and successfully
solves various unpaired image-to-image translation tasks. Code:

are increasingly deployed for real-life applications. However, when using
machine learning techniques in practical settings, particularly in high-risk
applications such as medicine and engineering, obtaining the failure
probability of the predictive model is critical. We refer to this problem as
the risk-assessment task. We focus on regression algorithms and the
risk-assessment task of computing the probability of the true label lying
inside an interval defined around the model's prediction. We solve the
risk-assessment problem using the conformal prediction approach, which provides
prediction intervals that are guaranteed to contain the true label with a given
probability. Using this coverage property, we prove that our approximated
failure probability is conservative in the sense that it is not lower than the
true failure probability of the ML algorithm. We conduct extensive experiments
to empirically study the accuracy of the proposed method for problems with and
without covariate shift. Our analysis focuses on different modeling regimes,
dataset sizes, and conformal prediction methodologies.]]></summary>

evolves over time. While no model can work when data evolves in an arbitrary
fashion, if there is some pattern to these changes, we might be able to design
methods to address it. This paper addresses situations when data evolves
gradually. We introduce a time-varying propensity score that can detect gradual
shifts in the distribution of data which allows us to selectively sample past
data to update the model -- not just similar data from the past like that of a
standard propensity score but also data that evolved in a similar fashion in
the past. The time-varying propensity score is quite general: we demonstrate
different ways of implementing it and evaluate it on a variety of problems
ranging from supervised learning (e.g., image classification problems) where
data undergoes a sequence of gradual shifts, to reinforcement learning tasks
(e.g., robotic manipulation and continuous control) where data shifts as the
policy or the task changes.]]></summary>

quantification and mean predictions with distributed clients. In particular, we
generalize beyond normal posterior distributions and consider a general class
of models. We develop theoretical guarantees for FA-LD for strongly log-concave
distributions with non-i.i.d data and study how the injected noise and the
stochastic-gradient noise, the heterogeneity of data, and the varying learning
rates affect the convergence. Such an analysis sheds light on the optimal
choice of local updates to minimize communication costs. Important to our
approach is that the communication efficiency does not deteriorate with the
injected noise in the Langevin algorithms. In addition, we examine in our FA-LD
algorithm both independent and correlated noise used over different clients. We
observe there is a trade-off between the pairs among communication, accuracy,
and data privacy. As local devices may become inactive in federated networks,
we also show convergence results based on different averaging schemes where
only partial device updates are available. In such a case, we discover an
additional bias that does not decay to zero.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is a niche of companies responsible for intermediating the purchase of
large batches of varied products for other companies, for which the main
challenge is to perform product description standardization, i.e., matching an
item described by a client with a product described in a catalog. The problem
is complex since the client's product description may be: (1) potentially
noisy; (2) short and uninformative (e.g., missing information about model and
size); and (3) cross-language. In this paper, we formalize this problem as a
ranking task: given an initial client product specification (query), return the
most appropriate standardized descriptions (response). In this paper, we
propose TPDR, a two-step Transformer-based Product and Class Description
Retrieval method that is able to explore the semantic correspondence between IS
and SD, by exploiting attention mechanisms and contrastive learning. First,
TPDR employs the transformers as two encoders sharing the embedding vector
space: one for encoding the IS and another for the SD, in which corresponding
pairs (IS, SD) must be close in the vector space. Closeness is further enforced
by a contrastive learning mechanism leveraging a specialized loss function.
TPDR also exploits a (second) re-ranking step based on syntactic features that
are very important for the exact matching (model, dimension) of certain
products that may have been neglected by the transformers. To evaluate our
proposal, we consider 11 datasets from a real company, covering different
application contexts. Our solution was able to retrieve the correct
standardized product before the 5th ranking position in 71% of the cases and
its correct category in the first position in 80% of the situations. Moreover,
the effectiveness gains over purely syntactic or semantic baselines reach up to
3.7 times, solving cases that none of the approaches in isolation can do by
themselves.]]></summary>

solving imaging inverse problems. The recent plug-and-play unadjusted Langevin
algorithm (PnP-ULA) has emerged as a promising method for Monte Carlo sampling
and minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimation by combining physical
measurement models with deep-learning priors specified using image denoisers.
However, the intricate relationship between the sampling distribution of
PnP-ULA and the mismatched data-fidelity and denoiser has not been
theoretically analyzed. We address this gap by proposing a posterior-L2
pseudometric and using it to quantify an explicit error bound for PnP-ULA under
mismatched posterior distribution. We numerically validate our theory on
several inverse problems such as sampling from Gaussian mixture models and
image deblurring. Our results suggest that the sensitivity of the sampling
distribution of PnP-ULA to a mismatch in the measurement model and the denoiser
can be precisely characterized.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are amortized samplers that learn
stochastic policies to sequentially generate compositional objects from a given
unnormalized reward distribution. They can generate diverse sets of high-reward
objects, which is an important consideration in scientific discovery tasks.
However, as they are typically trained from a given extrinsic reward function,
it remains an important open challenge about how to leverage the power of
pre-training and train GFlowNets in an unsupervised fashion for efficient
adaptation to downstream tasks. Inspired by recent successes of unsupervised
pre-training in various domains, we introduce a novel approach for reward-free
pre-training of GFlowNets. By framing the training as a self-supervised
problem, we propose an outcome-conditioned GFlowNet (OC-GFN) that learns to
explore the candidate space. Specifically, OC-GFN learns to reach any targeted
outcomes, akin to goal-conditioned policies in reinforcement learning. We show
that the pre-trained OC-GFN model can allow for a direct extraction of a policy
capable of sampling from any new reward functions in downstream tasks.
Nonetheless, adapting OC-GFN on a downstream task-specific reward involves an
intractable marginalization over possible outcomes. We propose a novel way to
approximate this marginalization by learning an amortized predictor enabling
efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experimental results validate the efficacy of
our approach, demonstrating the effectiveness of pre-training the OC-GFN, and
its ability to swiftly adapt to downstream tasks and discover modes more
efficiently. This work may serve as a foundation for further exploration of
pre-training strategies in the context of GFlowNets.]]></summary>

integrating natural language into visual concepts, enabling zero-shot
recognition on downstream tasks. It is usually expected that satisfactory
overall accuracy can be achieved across numerous domains through well-designed
textual prompts. However, we found that their performance in the worst
categories is significantly inferior to the overall performance. For example,
on ImageNet, there are a total of 10 categories with class-wise accuracy as low
as 0\%, even though the overall performance has achieved 64.1\%. This
phenomenon reveals the potential risks associated with using CLIP models,
particularly in risk-sensitive applications where specific categories hold
significant importance. To address this issue, we investigate the alignment
between the two modalities in the CLIP model and propose the Class-wise
Matching Margin (\cmm) to measure the inference confusion. \cmm\ can
effectively identify the worst-performing categories and estimate the potential
performance of the candidate prompts. We further query large language models to
enrich descriptions of worst-performing categories and build a weighted
ensemble to highlight the efficient prompts. Experimental results clearly
verify the effectiveness of our proposal, where the accuracy on the worst-10
categories on ImageNet is boosted to 5.2\%, without manual prompt engineering,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep learning-based numerical schemes for solving high-dimensional backward
stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) have recently raised plenty of
scientific interest. While they enable numerical methods to approximate very
high-dimensional BSDEs, their reliability has not been studied and is thus not
understood. In this work, we study uncertainty quantification (UQ) for a class
of deep learning-based BSDE schemes. More precisely, we review the sources of
uncertainty involved in the schemes and numerically study the impact of
different sources. Usually, the standard deviation (STD) of the approximate
solutions obtained from multiple runs of the algorithm with different datasets
is calculated to address the uncertainty. This approach is computationally
quite expensive, especially for high-dimensional problems. Hence, we develop a
UQ model that efficiently estimates the STD of the approximate solution using
only a single run of the algorithm. The model also estimates the mean of the
approximate solution, which can be leveraged to initialize the algorithm and
improve the optimization process. Our numerical experiments show that the UQ
model produces reliable estimates of the mean and STD of the approximate
solution for the considered class of deep learning-based BSDE schemes. The
estimated STD captures multiple sources of uncertainty, demonstrating its
effectiveness in quantifying the uncertainty. Additionally, the model
illustrates the improved performance when comparing different schemes based on
the estimated STD values. Furthermore, it can identify hyperparameter values
for which the scheme achieves good approximations.]]></summary>

depends on data-driven methods, which require sufficiently large datasets. When
historical data lacks this, it is desired to model the underlying data
generation mechanism as a probability distribution to assess the data quality
and generate more data, if needed. Kernel density estimation (KDE) based models
are popular choices for this task, but they fail to adapt to data regions with
varying densities. In this paper, an adaptive KDE model is employed to
circumvent this, where each kernel in the model has an individual bandwidth.
The leave-one-out maximum log-likelihood (LOO-MLL) criterion is proposed to
prevent the singular solutions that the regular MLL criterion gives rise to,
and it is proven that LOO-MLL prevents these. Relying on this guaranteed
robustness, the model is extended by assigning learnable weights to the
kernels. In addition, a modified expectation-maximization algorithm is employed
to accelerate the optimization speed reliably. The performance of the proposed
method and models are exhibited on two power systems datasets using different
statistical tests and by comparison with Gaussian mixture models. Results show
that the proposed models have promising performance, in addition to their
singularity prevention guarantees.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi-fidelity (MF) methods are gaining popularity for enhancing surrogate
modeling and design optimization by incorporating data from various
low-fidelity (LF) models. While most existing MF methods assume a fixed
dataset, adaptive sampling methods that dynamically allocate resources among
fidelity models can achieve higher efficiency in the exploring and exploiting
the design space. However, most existing MF methods rely on the hierarchical
assumption of fidelity levels or fail to capture the intercorrelation between
multiple fidelity levels and utilize it to quantify the value of the future
samples and navigate the adaptive sampling. To address this hurdle, we propose
a framework hinged on a latent embedding for different fidelity models and the
associated pre-posterior analysis to explicitly utilize their correlation for
adaptive sampling. In this framework, each infill sampling iteration includes
two steps: We first identify the location of interest with the greatest
potential improvement using the high-fidelity (HF) model, then we search for
the next sample across all fidelity levels that maximize the improvement per
unit cost at the location identified in the first step. This is made possible
by a single Latent Variable Gaussian Process (LVGP) model that maps different
fidelity models into an interpretable latent space to capture their
correlations without assuming hierarchical fidelity levels. The LVGP enables us
to assess how LF sampling candidates will affect HF response with pre-posterior
analysis and determine the next sample with the best benefit-to-cost ratio.
Through test cases, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the
benchmark methods in both MF global fitting (GF) and Bayesian Optimization (BO)
problems in convergence rate and robustness. Moreover, the method offers the
flexibility to switch between GF and BO by simply changing the acquisition
function.]]></summary>

inventory systems with random lead times, achieving lower average costs across
all test instances and maintaining an optimality gap of no more than 0.1\%.
Notably, the same hyperparameter set is utilized across all experiments,
underscoring the robustness and generalizability of the proposed method.

modern deep neural network optimization, and is also widely adopted in
federated learning (FL) to prevent overfitting in local clients. In this paper,
we first explore the choices of weight decay and identify that weight decay
value appreciably influences the convergence of existing FL algorithms. While
preventing overfitting is crucial, weight decay can introduce a different
optimization goal towards the global objective, which is further amplified in
FL due to multiple local updates and heterogeneous data distribution. To
address this challenge, we develop {\it Federated optimization with Normalized
Annealing Regularization} (FedNAR), a simple yet effective and versatile
algorithmic plug-in that can be seamlessly integrated into any existing FL
algorithms. Essentially, we regulate the magnitude of each update by performing
co-clipping of the gradient and weight decay. We provide a comprehensive
theoretical analysis of FedNAR's convergence rate and conduct extensive
experiments on both vision and language datasets with different backbone
federated optimization algorithms. Our experimental results consistently
demonstrate that incorporating FedNAR into existing FL algorithms leads to
accelerated convergence and heightened model accuracy. Moreover, FedNAR
exhibits resilience in the face of various hyperparameter configurations.
Specifically, FedNAR has the ability to self-adjust the weight decay when the
initial specification is not optimal, while the accuracy of traditional FL
algorithms would markedly decline. Our codes are released at

crucial role in regulating the translation process and impacts the protein
expression level. Language models have showcased their effectiveness in
decoding the functions of protein and genome sequences. Here, we introduced a
language model for 5' UTR, which we refer to as the UTR-LM. The UTR-LM is
pre-trained on endogenous 5' UTRs from multiple species and is further
augmented with supervised information including secondary structure and minimum
free energy. We fine-tuned the UTR-LM in a variety of downstream tasks. The
model outperformed the best-known benchmark by up to 42% for predicting the
Mean Ribosome Loading, and by up to 60% for predicting the Translation
Efficiency and the mRNA Expression Level. The model also applies to identifying
unannotated Internal Ribosome Entry Sites within the untranslated region and
improves the AUPR from 0.37 to 0.52 compared to the best baseline. Further, we
designed a library of 211 novel 5' UTRs with high predicted values of
translation efficiency and evaluated them via a wet-lab assay. Experiment
results confirmed that our top designs achieved a 32.5% increase in protein
production level relative to well-established 5' UTR optimized for

expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions. High-dimensional problems are
particularly challenging as the surrogate model of the objective suffers from
the curse of dimensionality, which makes accurate modeling difficult. We
propose a group testing approach to identify active variables to facilitate
efficient optimization in these domains. The proposed algorithm, Group Testing
Bayesian Optimization (GTBO), first runs a testing phase where groups of
variables are systematically selected and tested on whether they influence the
objective. To that end, we extend the well-established theory of group testing
to functions of continuous ranges. In the second phase, GTBO guides
optimization by placing more importance on the active dimensions. By exploiting
the axis-aligned subspace assumption, GTBO is competitive against
state-of-the-art methods on several synthetic and real-world high-dimensional
optimization tasks. Furthermore, GTBO aids in the discovery of active
parameters in applications, thereby enhancing practitioners' understanding of
the problem at hand.]]></summary>

modern-day distributed machine learning. The two concepts have been extensively
studied individually but the question of how to combine them effectively
remains unanswered. This paper contributes to addressing this question by
studying the extent to which the distributed SGD algorithm, in the standard
parameter-server architecture, can learn an accurate model despite (a) a
fraction of the workers being malicious (Byzantine), and (b) the other
fraction, whilst being honest, providing noisy information to the server to
ensure differential privacy (DP). We first observe that the integration of
standard practices in DP and BR is not straightforward. In fact, we show that
many existing results on the convergence of distributed SGD under Byzantine
faults, especially those relying on $(\alpha,f)$-Byzantine resilience, are
rendered invalid when honest workers enforce DP. To circumvent this
shortcoming, we revisit the theory of $(\alpha,f)$-BR to obtain an approximate
convergence guarantee. Our analysis provides key insights on how to improve
this guarantee through hyperparameter optimization. Essentially, our
theoretical and empirical results show that (1) an imprudent combination of
standard approaches to DP and BR might be fruitless, but (2) by carefully
re-tuning the learning algorithm, we can obtain reasonable learning accuracy
while simultaneously guaranteeing DP and BR.]]></summary>

hypotheses, designing experiments, running experiments, and analyzing the
results. Can we build AI research agents to perform these long-horizon tasks?
To take a step towards building and evaluating research agents on such
open-ended decision-making tasks, we focus on the problem of machine learning
engineering: given a task description and a dataset, build a high-performing
model. In this paper, we propose MLAgentBench, a suite of ML tasks for
benchmarking AI research agents. Agents can perform actions like
reading/writing files, executing code, and inspecting outputs. With these
actions, agents could run experiments, analyze the results, and modify the code
of entire machine learning pipelines, such as data processing, architecture,
training processes, etc. The benchmark then automatically evaluates the agent's
performance objectively over various metrics related to performance and
efficiency. We also design an LLM-based research agent to automatically perform
experimentation loops in such an environment. Empirically, we find that a
GPT-4-based research agent can feasibly build compelling ML models over many
tasks in MLAgentBench, displaying highly interpretable plans and actions.
However, the success rates vary considerably; they span from almost 90\% on
well-established older datasets to as low as 10\% on recent Kaggle Challenges
-- unavailable during the LLM model's pretraining -- and even 0\% on newer
research challenges like BabyLM. Finally, we identify several key challenges
for LLM-based research agents such as long-term planning and hallucination. Our
code is released at https://github.com/snap-stanford/MLAgentBench.]]></summary>

increase the invariance of any interpretability method with respect to a

entails preparing them to handle unforeseen conditions. In several applications
the occurrence of novel classes during deployment poses a significant threat,
thus it is crucial to effectively detect them. Ideally, this skill should be
used when needed without requiring any further computational training effort at
every new task. Out-of-distribution detection has attracted significant
attention in the last years, however the majority of the studies deal with 2D
images ignoring the inherent 3D nature of the real-world and often confusing
between domain and semantic novelty. In this work, we focus on the latter,
considering the objects geometric structure captured by 3D point clouds
regardless of the specific domain. We advance the field by introducing
OpenPatch that builds on a large pre-trained model and simply extracts from its
intermediate features a set of patch representations that describe each known
class. For any new sample, we obtain a novelty score by evaluating whether it
can be recomposed mainly by patches of a single known class or rather via the
contribution of multiple classes. We present an extensive experimental
evaluation of our approach for the task of semantic novelty detection on
real-world point cloud samples when the reference known data are synthetic. We
demonstrate that OpenPatch excels in both the full and few-shot known sample
scenarios, showcasing its robustness across varying pre-training objectives and
network backbones. The inherent training-free nature of our method allows for
its immediate application to a wide array of real-world tasks, offering a
compelling advantage over approaches that need expensive retraining efforts.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pretrained large language models (LLMs) are general purpose problem solvers
applicable to a diverse set of tasks with prompts. They can be further improved
towards a specific task by fine-tuning on a specialized dataset. However,
fine-tuning usually makes the model narrowly specialized on this dataset with
reduced general in-context learning performances, which is undesirable whenever
the fine-tuned model needs to handle additional tasks where no fine-tuning data
is available. In this work, we first demonstrate that fine-tuning on a single
task indeed decreases LLMs' general in-context learning performance. We
discover one important cause of such forgetting, format specialization, where
the model overfits to the format of the fine-tuned task. We further show that
format specialization happens at the very beginning of fine-tuning. To solve
this problem, we propose Prompt Tuning with MOdel Tuning (ProMoT), a simple yet
effective two-stage fine-tuning framework that reduces format specialization
and improves generalization. ProMoT offloads task-specific format learning into
additional and removable parameters by first doing prompt tuning and then
fine-tuning the model itself with this soft prompt attached. With experiments
on several fine-tuning tasks and 8 in-context evaluation tasks, we show that
ProMoT achieves comparable performance on fine-tuned tasks to standard
fine-tuning, but with much less loss of in-context learning performances across
a board range of out-of-domain evaluation tasks. More importantly, ProMoT can
even enhance generalization on in-context learning tasks that are semantically
related to the fine-tuned task, e.g. ProMoT on En-Fr translation significantly
improves performance on other language pairs, and ProMoT on NLI improves
performance on summarization. Experiments also show that ProMoT can improve the
generalization performance of multi-task training.]]></summary>

autonomous driving systems. Accurate traffic sign classification is essential
but challenging due to real-world complexities like adversarial examples and
occlusions. To address these issues, binary neural networks offer promise in
constructing classifiers suitable for resource-constrained devices.

In our previous work, we proposed high-accuracy BNN models for traffic sign
recognition, focusing on compact size for limited computation and energy
resources. To evaluate their local robustness, this paper introduces a set of
benchmark problems featuring layers that challenge state-of-the-art
verification tools. These layers include binarized convolutions, max pooling,
batch normalization, fully connected. The difficulty of the verification
problem is given by the high number of network parameters (905k - 1.7 M), of
the input dimension (2.7k-12k), and of the number of regions (43) as well by
the fact that the neural networks are not sparse.

The proposed BNN models and local robustness properties can be checked at
https://github.com/ChristopherBrix/vnncomp2023_benchmarks/tree/main/benchmarks/traffic_signs_recognition.

The results of the 4th International Verification of Neural Networks
Competition (VNN-COMP'23) revealed the fact that 4, out of 7, solvers can
handle many of our benchmarks randomly selected (minimum is 6, maximum is 36,
out of 45). Surprisingly, tools output also wrong results or missing
counterexample (ranging from 1 to 4). Currently, our focus lies in exploring
the possibility of achieving a greater count of solved instances by extending
the allotted time (previously set at 8 minutes). Furthermore, we are intrigued
by the reasons behind the erroneous outcomes provided by the tools for certain
benchmarks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sparse deep learning has become a popular technique for improving the
performance of deep neural networks in areas such as uncertainty
quantification, variable selection, and large-scale network compression.
However, most existing research has focused on problems where the observations
are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and there has been little
work on the problems where the observations are dependent, such as time series
data and sequential data in natural language processing. This paper aims to
address this gap by studying the theory for sparse deep learning with dependent
data. We show that sparse recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can be consistently
estimated, and their predictions are asymptotically normally distributed under
appropriate assumptions, enabling the prediction uncertainty to be correctly
quantified. Our numerical results show that sparse deep learning outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, such as conformal predictions, in prediction
uncertainty quantification for time series data. Furthermore, our results
indicate that the proposed method can consistently identify the autoregressive
order for time series data and outperform existing methods in large-scale model
compression. Our proposed method has important practical implications in fields
such as finance, healthcare, and energy, where both accurate point estimates
and prediction uncertainty quantification are of concern.]]></summary>

training (AT) has been demonstrated to be the most effective defense strategy
to protect neural networks from being fooled. However, we find AT omits to
learning robust features, resulting in poor performance of adversarial
robustness. To address this issue, we highlight two characteristics of robust
representation: (1) $\bf{exclusion}$: the feature of natural examples keeps
away from that of other classes; (2) $\bf{alignment}$: the feature of natural
and corresponding adversarial examples is close to each other. These motivate
us to propose a generic framework of AT to gain robust representation, by the
asymmetric negative contrast and reverse attention. Specifically, we design an
asymmetric negative contrast based on predicted probabilities, to push away
examples of different classes in the feature space. Moreover, we propose to
weight feature by parameters of the linear classifier as the reverse attention,
to obtain class-aware feature and pull close the feature of the same class.
Empirical evaluations on three benchmark datasets show our methods greatly
advance the robustness of AT and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Code is

evolution, but its practical application encounters a series of intricate
challenges, and hyperparameter optimization is one of these critical
challenges. Amongst the diverse adjustments in hyperparameters, the adaptation
of the learning rate emerges as a crucial component, holding the promise of
significantly enhancing the efficacy of FL systems. In response to this
critical need, this paper presents FedHyper, a novel hypergradient-based
learning rate adaptation algorithm specifically designed for FL. FedHyper
serves as a universal learning rate scheduler that can adapt both global and
local rates as the training progresses. In addition, FedHyper not only
showcases unparalleled robustness to a spectrum of initial learning rate
configurations but also significantly alleviates the necessity for laborious
empirical learning rate adjustments. We provide a comprehensive theoretical
analysis of FedHyper's convergence rate and conduct extensive experiments on
vision and language benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that FEDHYPER
consistently converges 1.1-3x faster than FedAvg and the competing baselines
while achieving superior final accuracy. Moreover, FedHyper catalyzes a
remarkable surge in accuracy, augmenting it by up to 15% compared to FedAvg

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this paper, we study how the granularity of pretraining labels affects the
generalization of deep neural networks in image classification tasks. We focus
on the "fine-to-coarse" transfer learning setting, where the pretraining label
space is more fine-grained than that of the target problem. Empirically, we
show that pretraining on the leaf labels of ImageNet21k produces better
transfer results on ImageNet1k than pretraining on other coarser granularity
levels, which supports the common practice used in the community.
Theoretically, we explain the benefit of fine-grained pretraining by proving
that, for a data distribution satisfying certain hierarchy conditions, 1)
coarse-grained pretraining only allows a neural network to learn the "common"
or "easy-to-learn" features well, while 2) fine-grained pretraining helps the
network learn the "rarer" or "fine-grained" features in addition to the common
ones, thus improving its accuracy on hard downstream test samples in which
common features are missing or weak in strength. Furthermore, we perform
comprehensive experiments using the label hierarchies of iNaturalist 2021 and
observe that the following conditions, in addition to proper choice of label
granularity, enable the transfer to work well in practice: 1) the pretraining
dataset needs to have a meaningful label hierarchy, and 2) the pretraining and
target label functions need to align well.]]></summary>

from the Boltzmann energy distribution via a sequence of actions. In
particular, we focus on improving GFlowNet with partial inference: training
flow functions with the evaluation of the intermediate states or transitions.
To this end, the recently developed forward-looking GFlowNet reparameterizes
the flow functions based on evaluating the energy of intermediate states.
However, such an evaluation of intermediate energies may (i) be too expensive
or impossible to evaluate and (ii) even provide misleading training signals
under large energy fluctuations along the sequence of actions. To resolve this
issue, we propose learning energy decompositions for GFlowNets (LED-GFN). Our
main idea is to (i) decompose the energy of an object into learnable potential
functions defined on state transitions and (ii) reparameterize the flow
functions using the potential functions. In particular, to produce informative
local credits, we propose to regularize the potential to change smoothly over
the sequence of actions. It is also noteworthy that training GFlowNet with our
learned potential can preserve the optimal policy. We empirically verify the
superiority of LED-GFN in five problems including the generation of

In this paper, we focus on the problem of learning representations of

"relational convolutional networks". Given a sequence of objects, a
"multi-dimensional inner product relation" module produces a relation tensor
describing all pairwise relations. A "relational convolution" layer then
transforms the relation tensor into a sequence of new objects, each describing
the relations within some group of objects at the previous layer. Graphlet
filters, analogous to filters in convolutional neural networks, represent a
template of relations against which the relation tensor is compared at each
grouping. Repeating this yields representations of higher-order, hierarchical
relations. We present the motivation and details of the architecture, together
with a set of experiments to demonstrate how relational convolutional networks
can provide an effective framework for modeling relational tasks that have

chemical kinetics properties. With the accumulated drug molecules identified
through "AI4drug discovery", the next imperative lies in AI-driven design for
high-throughput chemical synthesis processes, with the estimation of properties
of unseen reactions with unexplored molecules. To this end, the existing ML
approaches for kinetics property prediction are required to be
Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) generalizable. In this paper, we categorize the OOD
kinetic property prediction into three levels (structure, condition, and
mechanism), revealing unique aspects of such problems. Under this framework, we
create comprehensive datasets to benchmark (1) the state-of-the-art ML
approaches for reaction prediction in the OOD setting and (2) the
state-of-the-art graph OOD methods in kinetics property prediction problems.
Our results demonstrated the challenges and opportunities in OOD kinetics
property prediction. Our datasets and benchmarks can further support research
in this direction.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Massive MIMO is expected to play an important role in the development of 5G
networks. This paper addresses the issue of pilot contamination and scalability
in massive MIMO systems. The current practice of reusing orthogonal pilot
sequences in adjacent cells leads to difficulty in differentiating incoming
inter- and intra-cell pilot sequences. One possible solution is to increase the
number of orthogonal pilot sequences, which results in dedicating more space of
coherence block to pilot transmission than data transmission. This, in turn,
also hinders the scalability of massive MIMO systems, particularly in
accommodating a large number of IoT devices within a cell. To overcome these
challenges, this paper devises an innovative pilot allocation scheme based on
the data transfer patterns of IoT devices. The scheme assigns orthogonal pilot
sequences to clusters of devices instead of individual devices, allowing
multiple devices to utilize the same pilot for periodically transmitting data.
Moreover, we formulate the pilot assignment problem as a graph coloring problem
and use the max k-cut graph partitioning approach to overcome the pilot
contamination in a multicell massive MIMO system. The proposed scheme
significantly improves the spectral efficiency and enables the scalability of
massive MIMO systems; for instance, by using ten orthogonal pilot sequences, we
are able to accommodate 200 devices with only a 12.5% omission rate.]]></summary>

components. (1) A latent vector whose prior distribution is modeled by a Unet
transformation of a Gaussian white noise vector. (2) A molecule generation
model that generates the string-based representation of molecule conditional on
the latent vector in (1). We adopt the causal Transformer model that takes the
latent vector in (1) as prompt. (3) A property prediction model that predicts
the value of the target property of a molecule based on a non-linear regression
on the latent vector in (1). We call the proposed model the latent prompt
Transformer model. After initial training of the model on existing molecules

Nevertheless, the attacks recently proposed have demonstrated limited

this work, we overcome these limitations by first designing a novel set of
fine-grained manipulations which allow to modify the HTML code of the input
phishing webpage without compromising its maliciousness and visual appearance,
i.e., the manipulations are functionality- and rendering-preserving by design.
We then select which manipulations should be applied to bypass the target
detector by a query-efficient black-box optimization algorithm. Our experiments
show that our attacks are able to raze to the ground the performance of current
state-of-the-art ML-PWD using just 30 queries, thus overcoming the weaker
attacks developed in previous work, and enabling a much fairer robustness

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[History matching based on monitoring data will enable uncertainty reduction,
and thus improved aquifer management, in industrial-scale carbon storage
operations. In traditional model-based data assimilation, geomodel parameters
are modified to force agreement between flow simulation results and
observations. In data-space inversion (DSI), history-matched quantities of
interest, e.g., posterior pressure and saturation fields conditioned to
observations, are inferred directly, without constructing posterior geomodels.
This is accomplished efficiently using a set of O(1000) prior simulation
results, data parameterization, and posterior sampling within a Bayesian
setting. In this study, we develop and implement (in DSI) a deep-learning-based
parameterization to represent spatio-temporal pressure and CO2 saturation
fields at a set of time steps. The new parameterization uses an adversarial
autoencoder (AAE) for dimension reduction and a convolutional long short-term
memory (convLSTM) network to represent the spatial distribution and temporal
evolution of the pressure and saturation fields. This parameterization is used
with an ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation (ESMDA) in the DSI
framework to enable posterior predictions. A realistic 3D system characterized
by prior geological realizations drawn from a range of geological scenarios is
considered. A local grid refinement procedure is introduced to estimate the
error covariance term that appears in the history matching formulation.
Extensive history matching results are presented for various quantities, for
multiple synthetic true models. Substantial uncertainty reduction in posterior
pressure and saturation fields is achieved in all cases. The framework is
applied to efficiently provide posterior predictions for a range of error
covariance specifications. Such an assessment would be expensive using a
model-based approach.]]></summary>

particularly their movements or actions is critical in the ward. This approach
offers the advantage of reducing in-hospital care costs and improving the
efficiency of healthcare workers, which is especially true for scenarios at
night or during peak admission periods. Therefore, in this work, we propose
using computer vision (CV) and deep learning (DL) methods for detecting
subjects and recognizing their actions. We utilize OpenPose as an accurate
subject detector for recognizing the positions of human subjects in the video
stream. Additionally, we employ AlphAction's Asynchronous Interaction
Aggregation (AIA) network to predict the actions of detected subjects. This
integrated model, referred to as PoseAction, is proposed. At the same time, the
proposed model is further trained to predict 12 common actions in ward areas,
such as staggering, chest pain, and falling down, using medical-related video
clips from the NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets. The results demonstrate
that PoseAction achieves the highest classification mAP of 98.72% (IoU@0.5).
Additionally, this study develops an online real-time mode for action
recognition, which strongly supports the clinical translation of PoseAction.
Furthermore, using OpenPose's function for recognizing face key points, we also
implement face blurring, which is a practical solution to address the privacy
protection concerns of patients and healthcare workers. Nevertheless, the
training data for PoseAction is currently limited, particularly in terms of
label diversity. Consequently, the subsequent step involves utilizing a more
diverse dataset (including general actions) to train the model's parameters for
improved generalization.]]></summary>

models and large language models. In this setting, the absence of labels
requires the use of similarity-based loss functions, such as contrastive loss,
that favor minimizing the distance between similar inputs and maximizing the
distance between distinct inputs. As privacy concerns mount, training these
models using differential privacy has become more important. However, due to
how inputs are generated for these losses, one of their undesirable properties
is that their $L_2$ sensitivity can grow with increasing batch size. This
property is particularly disadvantageous for differentially private training
methods, such as DP-SGD. To overcome this issue, we develop a new DP-SGD
variant for similarity based loss functions -- in particular the commonly used
contrastive loss -- that manipulates gradients of the objective function in a
novel way to obtain a senstivity of the summed gradient that is $O(1)$ for
batch size $n$. We test our DP-SGD variant on some preliminary CIFAR-10

accessible to users with limited IT expertise. However, users with no
background in natural language processing (NLP) might lack a proper
understanding of LLMs. Thus the awareness of their inherent limitations, and
therefore will take the systems' output at face value. In this paper, we
systematically analyse prompts and the generated responses to identify possible
problematic issues with a special focus on gender biases, which users need to
be aware of when processing the system's output. We explore how ChatGPT reacts
in English and German if prompted to answer from a female, male, or neutral
perspective. In an in-depth investigation, we examine selected prompts and
analyse to what extent responses differ if the system is prompted several times
in an identical way. On this basis, we show that ChatGPT is indeed useful for
helping non-IT users draft texts for their daily work. However, it is
absolutely crucial to thoroughly check the system's responses for biases as
well as for syntactic and grammatical mistakes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Characterizing the relationship between neural population activity and
behavioral data is a central goal of neuroscience. While latent variable models
(LVMs) are successful in describing high-dimensional time-series data, they are
typically only designed for a single type of data, making it difficult to
identify structure shared across different experimental data modalities. Here,
we address this shortcoming by proposing an unsupervised LVM which extracts
temporally evolving shared and independent latents for distinct, simultaneously
recorded experimental modalities. We do this by combining Gaussian Process
Factor Analysis (GPFA), an interpretable LVM for neural spiking data with
temporally smooth latent space, with Gaussian Process Variational Autoencoders
(GP-VAEs), which similarly use a GP prior to characterize correlations in a
latent space, but admit rich expressivity due to a deep neural network mapping
to observations. We achieve interpretability in our model by partitioning
latent variability into components that are either shared between or
independent to each modality. We parameterize the latents of our model in the
Fourier domain, and show improved latent identification using this approach
over standard GP-VAE methods. We validate our model on simulated multi-modal
data consisting of Poisson spike counts and MNIST images that scale and rotate
smoothly over time. We show that the multi-modal GP-VAE (MM-GPVAE) is able to
not only identify the shared and independent latent structure across modalities
accurately, but provides good reconstructions of both images and neural rates
on held-out trials. Finally, we demonstrate our framework on two real world
multi-modal experimental settings: Drosophila whole-brain calcium imaging
alongside tracked limb positions, and Manduca sexta spike train measurements
from ten wing muscles as the animal tracks a visual stimulus.]]></summary>

for image classification tasks. However, they are limited in their ability to
handle rotational and viewpoint variations due to information loss in
max-pooling layers. Capsule Networks (CapsNets) employ a
computationally-expensive iterative process referred to as dynamic routing to
address these issues. CapsNets, however, often fall short on complex datasets
and require more computational resources than CNNs. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce the Parallel Dynamic Routing CapsNet (PDR-CapsNet), a
deeper and more energy-efficient alternative to CapsNet that offers superior
performance, less energy consumption, and lower overfitting rates. By
leveraging a parallelization strategy, PDR-CapsNet mitigates the computational
complexity of CapsNet and increases throughput, efficiently using hardware
resources. As a result, we achieve 83.55\% accuracy while requiring 87.26\%
fewer parameters, 32.27\% and 47.40\% fewer MACs, and Flops, achieving 3x
faster inference and 7.29J less energy consumption on a 2080Ti GPU with 11GB

linear time-invariant (LTI) systems (with possibly unknown dynamics) in the
presence of adversarial perturbations. There exists a global network cost that
is characterized by a time-varying convex function, which evolves in an
adversarial manner and is sequentially and partially observed by local agents.
The goal of each agent is to generate a control sequence that can compete with
the best centralized control policy in hindsight, which has access to the
global cost. This problem is formulated as a regret minimization. For the case
of known dynamics, we propose a fully distributed disturbance feedback
controller that guarantees a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T}\log T)$, where $T$ is
the time horizon. For the unknown dynamics case, we design a distributed
explore-then-commit approach, where in the exploration phase all agents jointly
learn the system dynamics, and in the learning phase our proposed control
algorithm is applied using each agent system estimate. We establish a regret
bound of $O(T^{2/3} \text{poly}(\log T))$ for this setting.]]></summary>

been shown to improve its generalization. Unlike the case for GD, the resulting

discovery. While recent advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and
Transformers have shown to be effective and promising, they face the following
limitations: Transformer self-attention does not explicitly consider the
underlying molecule structure while GNN feature representation alone is not
sufficient to capture granular and hidden interactions and characteristics that
distinguish similar molecules. To address these limitations, we propose SYN-
FUSION, a novel approach that synergistically combines pre-trained features
from GNNs and Transformers. This approach provides a comprehensive molecular
representation, capturing both the global molecule structure and the individual
atom characteristics. Experimental results on MoleculeNet benchmarks
demonstrate superior performance, surpassing previous models in 5 out of 7
classification datasets and 4 out of 6 regression datasets. The performance of
SYN-FUSION has been compared with other Graph-Transformer models that have been
jointly trained using a combination of transformer and graph features, and it
is found that our approach is on par with those models in terms of performance.
Extensive analysis of the learned fusion model across aspects such as loss,
latent space, and weight distribution further validates the effectiveness of
SYN-FUSION. Finally, an ablation study unequivocally demonstrates that the
synergy achieved by SYN-FUSION surpasses the performance of its individual
model components and their ensemble, offering a substantial improvement in
predicting molecular properties.]]></summary>

responsible for encoding specific knowledge the model has memorized. We propose
a multi-objective differentiable weight masking scheme to discover these

original language model. We demonstrate our method on multiple GPT2 variants,
uncovering highly sparse subnetworks (98%+) that are solely responsible for
specific collections of relational knowledge. When these subnetworks are
removed, the remaining network maintains most of its initial capacity (modeling
language and other memorized relational knowledge) but struggles to express the

computational pathology. Some methods have been proposed to select a subset of
patches as WSI representation for downstream tasks. While most of the
computational pathology tasks are designed to classify or detect the presence
of pathological lesions in each WSI, the confounding role and redundant nature
of normal histology in tissue samples are generally overlooked in WSI
representations. In this paper, we propose and validate the concept of an
"atlas of normal tissue" solely using samples of WSIs obtained from normal
tissue biopsies. Such atlases can be employed to eliminate normal fragments of
tissue samples and hence increase the representativeness collection of patches.
We tested our proposed method by establishing a normal atlas using 107 normal
skin WSIs and demonstrated how established indexes and search engines like
Yottixel can be improved. We used 553 WSIs of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma
(cSCC) to show the advantage. We also validated our method applied to an
external dataset of 451 breast WSIs. The number of selected WSI patches was
reduced by 30% to 50% after utilizing the proposed normal atlas while
maintaining the same indexing and search performance in leave-one-patinet-out
validation for both datasets. We show that the proposed normal atlas shows
promise for unsupervised selection of the most representative patches of the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bayesian optimization is an effective method for optimizing
expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions. High-dimensional problems are
particularly challenging as the surrogate model of the objective suffers from
the curse of dimensionality, which makes accurate modeling difficult. We
propose a group testing approach to identify active variables to facilitate
efficient optimization in these domains. The proposed algorithm, Group Testing
Bayesian Optimization (GTBO), first runs a testing phase where groups of
variables are systematically selected and tested on whether they influence the
objective. To that end, we extend the well-established theory of group testing
to functions of continuous ranges. In the second phase, GTBO guides
optimization by placing more importance on the active dimensions. By exploiting
the axis-aligned subspace assumption, GTBO is competitive against
state-of-the-art methods on several synthetic and real-world high-dimensional
optimization tasks. Furthermore, GTBO aids in the discovery of active
parameters in applications, thereby enhancing practitioners' understanding of
the problem at hand.]]></summary>

performance in a variety of tasks, but this strong performance often comes with
the high expense of using paid API services. In this paper, we are motivated to
study building an LLM cascade to save the cost of using LLMs, particularly for
performing reasoning (e.g., mathematical, causal) tasks. Our cascade pipeline
follows the intuition that simpler questions can be addressed by a weaker but
more affordable LLM, whereas only the challenging questions necessitate the
stronger and more expensive LLM. To realize this decision-making, we consider
the "answer consistency" of the weaker LLM as a signal of the question
difficulty and propose several methods for the answer sampling and consistency
checking, including one leveraging a mixture of two thought representations
(i.e., Chain-of-Thought and Program-of-Thought). Through experiments on six
reasoning benchmark datasets, with GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 being the weaker and
stronger LLMs, respectively, we demonstrate that our proposed LLM cascades can
achieve performance comparable to using solely the stronger LLM but require
only 40% of its cost.]]></summary>

physical parameters to perform intelligent measurements. However, fabricating
ONAs while maintaining design performances is challenging. Limitations in
fabrication techniques often limit the realizable precision of the trained
parameters. Physical constraints may also limit the range of values the
physical parameters can hold. Thus, ONAs should be trained within the
implementable constraints. However, such physics-based constraints reduce the
training objective to a constrained optimization problem, making it harder to
optimize with existing gradient-based methods. To alleviate these critical
issues that degrade performance from simulation to realization we propose a
physics-informed quantization-aware training framework. Our approach accounts
for the physical constraints during the training process, leading to robust
designs. We evaluate our approach on an ONA proposed in the literature, named a
diffractive deep neural network (D2NN), for all-optical phase imaging and for
classification of phase objects. With extensive experiments on different
quantization levels and datasets, we show that our approach leads to ONA
designs that are robust to quantization noise.]]></summary>

the training of deep neural networks (DNNs), focusing on layer pruning to
simplify DNN architecture and loss landscape. RMT, recently used to address
overfitting in deep learning, enables the examination of DNN's weight layer
spectra. We use these techniques to optimally determine the number of singular
values to be removed from the weight layers of a DNN during training via
singular value decomposition (SVD). This process aids in DNN simplification and
accuracy enhancement, as evidenced by training simple DNN models on the MNIST
and Fashion MNIST datasets.

Our method can be applied to any fully connected or convolutional layer of a
pretrained DNN, decreasing the layer's parameters and simplifying the DNN
architecture while preserving or even enhancing the model's accuracy. By
discarding small singular values based on RMT criteria, the accuracy of the
test set remains consistent, facilitating more efficient DNN training without
compromising performance.

We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence supporting our claim that
the elimination of small singular values based on RMT does not negatively
impact the DNN's accuracy. Our results offer valuable insights into the
practical application of RMT for the creation of more efficient and accurate
deep-learning models.]]></summary>

(RL) in many real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present a generalized safe
exploration (GSE) problem as a unified formulation of common safe exploration
problems. We then propose a solution of the GSE problem in the form of a
meta-algorithm for safe exploration, MASE, which combines an unconstrained RL
algorithm with an uncertainty quantifier to guarantee safety in the current
episode while properly penalizing unsafe explorations before actual safety
violation to discourage them in future episodes. The advantage of MASE is that
we can optimize a policy while guaranteeing with a high probability that no
safety constraint will be violated under proper assumptions. Specifically, we
present two variants of MASE with different constructions of the uncertainty
quantifier: one based on generalized linear models with theoretical guarantees
of safety and near-optimality, and another that combines a Gaussian process to
ensure safety with a deep RL algorithm to maximize the reward. Finally, we
demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves better performance than
state-of-the-art algorithms on grid-world and Safety Gym benchmarks without

Furthermore, we incorporate several rounds of active learning where generated

prediction. This approach allows us to accurately explore as much of the

often surpassing human capabilities in sensing tasks relevant to autonomous
flight. Unlike traditional aerospace software, the parameters of machine
learning models are not hand-coded nor derived from physics but learned from

do not usually correspond to physical requirements. As a result, requirements
cannot be directly traced to lines of code, hindering the current bottom-up
aerospace certification paradigm. This paper attempts to address this gap by 1)
demystifying the inner workings and processes to build machine learning models,
2) formally establishing theoretical guarantees given by those processes, and
3) complementing these formal elements with practical considerations to develop
a complete certification argument for safety-critical machine learning systems.
Based on a scalable statistical verifier, our proposed framework is

on principle subgraph mining, we obtain a compact vocabulary of prevalent
fragments that span a large pretraining dataset. From the extracted vocabulary,
we introduce several fragment-based contrastive and predictive pretraining
tasks. The contrastive learning task jointly pretrains two different GNNs: one
based on molecular graphs and one based on fragment graphs, which represents
high-order connectivity within molecules. By enforcing the consistency between
the fragment embedding and the aggregated embedding of the corresponding atoms
from the molecular graphs, we ensure that both embeddings capture structural
information at multiple resolutions. The structural information of the fragment
graphs is further exploited to extract auxiliary labels for the graph-level
predictive pretraining. We employ both the pretrained molecular-based and
fragment-based GNNs for downstream prediction, thus utilizing the fragment

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Interactive search can provide a better experience by incorporating
interaction feedback from the users. This can significantly improve search
accuracy as it helps avoid irrelevant information and captures the users'
search intents. Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems use reinforcement
learning (RL) models to incorporate the interactions but focus on item-level
feedback, ignoring the fine-grained information found in sentence-level
feedback. Yet such feedback requires extensive RL action space exploration and
large amounts of annotated data. This work addresses these challenges by
proposing a new deep Q-learning (DQ) approach, DQrank. DQrank adapts BERT-based
models, the SOTA in natural language processing, to select crucial sentences
based on users' engagement and rank the items to obtain more satisfactory
responses. We also propose two mechanisms to better explore optimal actions.
DQrank further utilizes the experience replay mechanism in DQ to store the
feedback sentences to obtain a better initial ranking performance. We validate
the effectiveness of DQrank on three search datasets. The results show that
DQRank performs at least 12% better than the previous SOTA RL approaches. We
also conduct detailed ablation studies. The ablation results demonstrate that
each model component can efficiently extract and accumulate long-term
engagement effects from the users' sentence-level feedback. This structure
offers new technologies with promised performance to construct a search system
with sentence-level interaction.]]></summary>

constraints, enable their use in chemical processes and electrochemical
devices. In this work, we develop a differentiable chemical-physics framework
for modeling chemical mixtures, DiffMix, where geometric deep learning (GDL) is
leveraged to map from molecular species, compositions and environment
conditions, to physical coefficients in the mixture physics laws. In
particular, we extend mixture thermodynamic and transport laws by creating
learnable physical coefficients, where we use graph neural networks as the
molecule encoder and enforce component-wise permutation-invariance. We start
our model evaluations with thermodynamics of binary mixtures, and further
benchmarked multicomponent electrolyte mixtures on their transport properties,
in order to test the model generalizability. We show improved prediction
accuracy and model robustness of DiffMix than its purely data-driven variants.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficient optimization of electrolyte transport
properties, built on the gradient obtained using DiffMix auto-differentiation.
Our simulation runs are then backed up by the data generated by a robotic
experimentation setup, Clio. By combining mixture physics and GDL, DiffMix
expands the predictive modeling methods for chemical mixtures and provides
low-cost optimization approaches in large chemical spaces.]]></summary>

original LAB algorithm (Reddy et al. 2023), which is a socio-inspired algorithm
that models competitive and learning behaviours within a group, establishing
hierarchical roles. The proposed algorithm incorporates the roulette wheel
approach and a reduction factor introducing inter-group competition and
iteratively narrowing down the sample space. The algorithm is validated by
solving the benchmark test problems from CEC 2005 and CEC 2017. The solutions
are validated using standard statistical tests such as two-sided and pairwise
signed rank Wilcoxon test and Friedman rank test. The algorithm exhibited
improved and superior robustness as well as search space exploration
capabilities. Furthermore, a Clustering-Based Search Space Reduction (C-SSR)
method is proposed, making the algorithm capable to solve constrained problems.
The C-SSR method enables the algorithm to identify clusters of feasible
regions, satisfying the constraints and contributing to achieve the optimal
solution. This method demonstrates its effectiveness as a potential alternative
to traditional constraint handling techniques. The results obtained using the
Modified LAB algorithm are then compared with those achieved by other recent

continuous underlying changes in source code, design, and requirements. Since
manually maintaining software test suites is tedious, timely, and costly,
automating the process of generation and maintenance of test units will
significantly impact the effectiveness and efficiency of software testing
processes.

To this end, we propose an automated approach which exploits both structural
and semantic properties of source code methods and test cases to recommend the
most relevant and useful unit tests to the developers. The proposed approach
initially trains a neural network to transform method-level source code, as
well as unit tests, into distributed representations (embedded vectors) while
preserving the importance of the structure in the code. Retrieving the semantic
and structural properties of a given method, the approach computes cosine
similarity between the method's embedding and the previously-embedded training
instances. Further, according to the similarity scores between the embedding
vectors, the model identifies the closest methods of embedding and the
associated unit tests as the most similar recommendations.

The results on the Methods2Test dataset showed that, while there is no
guarantee to have similar relevant test cases for the group of similar methods,
the proposed approach extracts the most similar existing test cases for a given
method in the dataset, and evaluations show that recommended test cases
decrease the developers' effort to generating expected test cases.]]></summary>

tasks across diverse fields, such as language, vision, and multi-modality. To
minimize the adaption cost for downstream tasks, many Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques are proposed for language and 2D image
pre-trained models. However, the specialized PEFT method for 3D pre-trained
models is still under-explored. To this end, we introduce Point-PEFT, a novel
framework for adapting point cloud pre-trained models with minimal learnable
parameters. Specifically, for a pre-trained 3D model, we freeze most of its
parameters, and only tune the newly added PEFT modules on downstream tasks,
which consist of a Point-prior Prompt and a Geometry-aware Adapter. The
Point-prior Prompt adopts a set of learnable prompt tokens, for which we
propose to construct a memory bank with domain-specific knowledge, and utilize
a parameter-free attention to enhance the prompt tokens. The Geometry-aware
Adapter aims to aggregate point cloud features within spatial neighborhoods to
capture fine-grained geometric information through local interactions.
Extensive experiments indicate that our Point-PEFT can achieve better
performance than the full fine-tuning on various downstream tasks, while using
only 5% of the trainable parameters, demonstrating the efficiency and
effectiveness of our approach. Code will be released at

from a database of clean signals or images. Denoising with variational methods
is very efficient if a regularizer well adapted to the nature of the data is

regularizer can be systematically linked with the distribution of the data.
With deep neural networks (DNN), complex distributions can be recovered from a
large training database.To reduce the computational burden of this task, we
adapt the compressive learning framework to the learning of regularizers
parametrized by DNN. We propose two variants of stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) for the recovery of deep regularization parameters from a heavily
compressed database. These algorithms outperform the initially proposed method
that was limited to low-dimensional signals, each iteration using information
from the whole database. They also benefit from classical SGD convergence

Forensics is collecting and analyzing digital evidence from IoT devices to
investigate cybercrimes, security breaches, and other malicious activities that
may have taken place on these connected devices. In particular, EM-SCA has
become an essential tool for IoT forensics due to its ability to reveal
confidential information about the internal workings of IoT devices without
interfering these devices or wiretapping their networks. However, the accuracy
and reliability of EM-SCA results can be limited by device variability,
environmental factors, and data collection and processing methods. Besides,
there is very few research on these limitations that affects significantly the
accuracy of EM-SCA approaches for the crossed-IoT device portability as well as
limited research on the possible solutions to address such challenge.
Therefore, this empirical study examines the impact of device variability on
the accuracy and reliability of EM-SCA approaches, in particular
machine-learning (ML) based approaches for EM-SCA. We firstly presents the
background, basic concepts and techniques used to evaluate the limitations of
current EM-SCA approaches and datasets. Our study then addresses one of the
most important limitation, which is caused by the multi-core architecture of
the processors (SoC). We present an approach to collect the EM-SCA datasets and
demonstrate the feasibility of using transfer learning to obtain more
meaningful and reliable results from EM-SCA in IoT forensics of crossed-IoT

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Visual planning simulates how humans make decisions to achieve desired goals
in the form of searching for visual causal transitions between an initial
visual state and a final visual goal state. It has become increasingly
important in egocentric vision with its advantages in guiding agents to perform
daily tasks in complex environments. In this paper, we propose an interpretable
and generalizable visual planning framework consisting of i) a novel
Substitution-based Concept Learner (SCL) that abstracts visual inputs into
disentangled concept representations, ii) symbol abstraction and reasoning that
performs task planning via the self-learned symbols, and iii) a Visual Causal
Transition model (ViCT) that grounds visual causal transitions to semantically
similar real-world actions. Given an initial state, we perform goal-conditioned
visual planning with a symbolic reasoning method fueled by the learned
representations and causal transitions to reach the goal state. To verify the
effectiveness of the proposed model, we collect a large-scale visual planning
dataset based on AI2-THOR, dubbed as CCTP. Extensive experiments on this
challenging dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our method in
visual task planning. Empirically, we show that our framework can generalize to
unseen task trajectories and unseen object categories.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In-context learning (ICL) is an astonishing emergent ability of large
language models (LLMs). By presenting a prompt that includes multiple
input-output pairs as examples and introducing a new query input, models can
generate the corresponding output. However, the performance of models heavily
relies on the quality of the input prompt when implementing in-context
learning. Biased or imbalanced input prompts can significantly degrade the
performance of language models. To address this issue, we introduce a
reweighted algorithm called RICL (Reweighted In-context Learning). This
algorithm fine-tunes language models using an unbiased validation set to
determine the optimal weight for each input-output example to approximate
unbiased in-context learning. Furthermore, we also introduce a low-cost
reweighted algorithm, a linear optimal weight approximation algorithm called
LARICL (Linear Approximation of Reweighted In-context Learning). This algorithm
requires minimal training cost while providing effective results. We prove the
convergence of our algorithm and validate its performance through experiments
conducted on a numerical dataset. The experimental findings reveal a
substantial improvement in comparison to benchmarks including the performance
of casual prompt-based in-context learning and the performance of a classic
fine-tuning method.]]></summary>

rapidly recently. One main reason is that the bar for developing new
explainability techniques is low due to the lack of optimal evaluation
measures. Without rigorous measures, it is hard to have concrete evidence of
whether the new explanation techniques can significantly outperform their
predecessors. Our study proposes a new taxonomy for evaluating local
explanations: robustness, evaluation using ground truth from synthetic datasets
and interpretable models, model randomization, and human-grounded evaluation.
Using this proposed taxonomy, we highlight that all categories of evaluation
methods, except those based on the ground truth from interpretable models,
suffer from a problem we call the "blame problem." In our study, we argue that
this category of evaluation measure is a more reasonable method for evaluating
local model-agnostic explanations. However, we show that even this category of
evaluation measures has further limitations. The evaluation of local
explanations remains an open research problem.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sparse deep learning has become a popular technique for improving the
performance of deep neural networks in areas such as uncertainty
quantification, variable selection, and large-scale network compression.
However, most existing research has focused on problems where the observations
are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and there has been little
work on the problems where the observations are dependent, such as time series
data and sequential data in natural language processing. This paper aims to
address this gap by studying the theory for sparse deep learning with dependent
data. We show that sparse recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can be consistently
estimated, and their predictions are asymptotically normally distributed under
appropriate assumptions, enabling the prediction uncertainty to be correctly
quantified. Our numerical results show that sparse deep learning outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, such as conformal predictions, in prediction
uncertainty quantification for time series data. Furthermore, our results
indicate that the proposed method can consistently identify the autoregressive
order for time series data and outperform existing methods in large-scale model
compression. Our proposed method has important practical implications in fields
such as finance, healthcare, and energy, where both accurate point estimates
and prediction uncertainty quantification are of concern.]]></summary>

about individual objects. This enables explicit relational reasoning,
supporting abstraction and generalization from limited data. The Abstractor is
first evaluated on simple discriminative relational tasks and compared to
existing relational architectures. Next, the Abstractor is evaluated on purely
relational sequence-to-sequence tasks, where dramatic improvements are seen in
sample efficiency compared to standard Transformers. Finally, Abstractors are
evaluated on a collection of tasks based on mathematical problem solving, where
modest but consistent improvements in performance and sample efficiency are

this certified robustness can be provably preserved in downstream tasks.
Furthermore, an effective training method is proposed for robust GCL. Extensive

being one of the most aggressive forms. Accurate determination of the
O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status is
crucial for personalized treatment strategies. However, traditional methods are
labor-intensive and time-consuming. This paper proposes a novel multi-modal
approach, BTDNet, leveraging multi-parametric MRI scans, including FLAIR, T1w,
T1wCE, and T2 3D volumes, to predict MGMT promoter methylation status. BTDNet
addresses two main challenges: the variable volume lengths (i.e., each volume
consists of a different number of slices) and the volume-level annotations
(i.e., the whole 3D volume is annotated and not the independent slices that it
consists of). BTDNet consists of four components: i) the data augmentation one
(that performs geometric transformations, convex combinations of data pairs and
test-time data augmentation); ii) the 3D analysis one (that performs global
analysis through a CNN-RNN); iii) the routing one (that contains a mask layer
that handles variable input feature lengths), and iv) the modality fusion one
(that effectively enhances data representation, reduces ambiguities and
mitigates data scarcity). The proposed method outperforms by large margins the
state-of-the-art methods in the RSNA-ASNR-MICCAI BraTS 2021 Challenge, offering
a promising avenue for enhancing brain tumor diagnosis and treatment.]]></summary>

improve frailty, sarcopenia, and balance. Accurate monitoring of patient
involvement in OEP is challenging, as self-reports (diaries) are often
unreliable. With the development of wearable sensors, Human Activity
Recognition (HAR) systems using wearable sensors have revolutionized
healthcare. However, their usage for OEP still shows limited performance. The
objective of this study is to build an unobtrusive and accurate system to
monitor OEP for older adults. Data was collected from older adults wearing a
single waist-mounted Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Two datasets were
collected, one in a laboratory setting, and one at the homes of the patients. A
hierarchical system is proposed with two stages: 1) using a deep learning model
to recognize whether the patients are performing OEP or activities of daily
life (ADLs) using a 10-minute sliding window; 2) based on stage 1, using a
6-second sliding window to recognize the OEP sub-classes performed. The results
showed that in stage 1, OEP could be recognized with window-wise f1-scores over
0.95 and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) f1-scores over 0.85 for both datasets.
In stage 2, for the home scenario, four activities could be recognized with
f1-scores over 0.8: ankle plantarflexors, abdominal muscles, knee bends, and
sit-to-stand. The results showed the potential of monitoring the compliance of
OEP using a single IMU in daily life. Also, some OEP sub-classes are possible
to be recognized for further analysis.]]></summary>

learning. In contrast to the classic pretraining-then-finetuning procedure, in
order to use LLMs for downstream prediction tasks, one only needs to provide a
few demonstrations, known as in-context examples, without adding more or
updating existing model parameters. This in-context learning (ICL) capability
of LLMs is intriguing, and it is not yet fully understood how pretrained LLMs
acquire such capabilities. In this paper, we investigate the reason why a
transformer-based language model can accomplish in-context learning after
pre-training on a general language corpus by proposing one hypothesis that LLMs
can simulate kernel regression with internal representations when faced with
in-context examples. More concretely, we first prove that Bayesian inference on
in-context prompts can be asymptotically understood as kernel regression $\hat
y = \sum_i y_i K(x, x_i)/\sum_i K(x, x_i)$ as the number of in-context
demonstrations grows. Then, we empirically investigate the in-context behaviors
of language models. We find that during ICL, the attention and hidden features
in LLMs match the behaviors of a kernel regression. Finally, our theory
provides insights into multiple phenomena observed in the ICL field: why
retrieving demonstrative samples similar to test samples can help, why ICL
performance is sensitive to the output formats, and why ICL accuracy benefits
from selecting in-distribution and representative samples.]]></summary>

accuracy, generative abilities, and robustness. These methods have many
theoretical justifications. Here we introduce a unifying principle rooted in
information theory to rederive and generalize existing variational methods and
design new ones. We base our framework on an interpretation of the multivariate
information bottleneck, in which two Bayesian networks are traded off against
one another. We interpret the first network as an encoder graph, which
specifies what information to keep when compressing the data. We interpret the
second network as a decoder graph, which specifies a generative model for the
data. Using this framework, we rederive existing dimensionality reduction
methods such as the deep variational information bottleneck (DVIB), beta
variational auto-encoders (beta-VAE), and deep variational canonical
correlation analysis (DVCCA). The framework naturally introduces a trade-off
parameter between compression and reconstruction in the DVCCA family of
algorithms, resulting in the new beta-DVCCA family. In addition, we derive a
new variational dimensionality reduction method, deep variational symmetric
informational bottleneck (DVSIB), which simultaneously compresses two variables
to preserve information between their compressed representations. We implement
all of these algorithms and evaluate their ability to produce shared low
dimensional latent spaces on a modified noisy MNIST dataset. We show that
algorithms that are better matched to the structure of the data (beta-DVCCA and
DVSIB) produce better latent spaces as measured by classification accuracy and
the dimensionality of the latent variables. We believe that this framework can
be used to unify other multi-view representation learning algorithms.
Additionally, it provides a straightforward framework for deriving
problem-specific loss functions.]]></summary>

limitations in learning long-term dependencies which have been addressed by
memory structures in long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Neural Turing
machines (NTMs) are novel RNNs that implement the notion of programmable
computers with neural network controllers that can learn simple algorithmic
tasks. Matrix neural networks feature matrix representation which inherently
preserves the spatial structure of data when compared to canonical neural
networks that use vector-based representation. One may then argue that neural
networks with matrix representations may have the potential to provide better
memory capacity. In this paper, we define and study a probabilistic notion of
memory capacity based on Fisher information for matrix-based RNNs. We find
bounds on memory capacity for such networks under various hypotheses and
compare them with their vector counterparts. In particular, we show that the
memory capacity of such networks is bounded by $N^2$ for $N\times N$ state
matrix which generalizes the one known for vector networks. We also show and
analyze the increase in memory capacity for such networks which is introduced
when one exhibits an external state memory, such as NTMs. Consequently, we
construct NTMs with RNN controllers with matrix-based representation of
external memory, leading us to introduce Matrix NTMs. We demonstrate the
performance of this class of memory networks under certain algorithmic learning
tasks such as copying and recall and compare it with Matrix RNNs. We find an
improvement in the performance of Matrix NTMs by the addition of external
memory, in comparison to Matrix RNNs.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Abridged) Carmosino et al. (2016) demonstrated that natural proofs of
circuit lower bounds for \Lambda imply efficient algorithms for learning
\Lambda-circuits, but only over the uniform distribution, with membership
queries, and provided \AC^0[p] \subseteq \Lambda. We consider whether this
implication can be generalized to \Lambda \not\supseteq \AC^0[p], and to
learning algorithms in Valiant's PAC model, which use only random examples and
learn over arbitrary example distributions. We give results of both positive
and negative flavor.

On the negative side, we observe that if, for every circuit class \Lambda,
the implication from natural proofs for \Lambda to learning \Lambda-circuits in
Valiant's PAC model holds, then there is a polynomial time solution to
O(n^{1.5})-uSVP (unique Shortest Vector Problem), and polynomial time quantum
solutions to O(n^{1.5})-SVP (Shortest Vector Problem) and O(n^{1.5})-SIVP
(Shortest Independent Vector Problem). This indicates that whether natural
proofs for \Lambda imply efficient learning algorithms for \Lambda in Valiant's
PAC model may depend on \Lambda.

On the positive side, our main result is that specific natural proofs arising
from a type of communication complexity argument (e.g., Nisan (1993), for
depth-2 majority circuits) imply PAC-learning algorithms in a new
distributional variant of Valiant's model. Our distributional PAC model is
stronger than the average-case prediction model of Blum et al (1993) and the
heuristic PAC model of Nanashima (2021), and has several important properties
which make it of independent interest, such as being boosting-friendly. The
main applications of our result are new distributional PAC-learning algorithms
for depth-2 majority circuits, polytopes and DNFs over natural target
distributions, as well as the nonexistence of encoded-input weak PRFs that can
be evaluated by depth-2 majority circuits.]]></summary>

multiple agents apply OtA computation for transmitting model updates to a

compression with compressed sensing (CS) methods to reduce the number of data
samples transmitted over the channel. The previous works on applying CS methods
in OtA FL have primarily assumed that the original model update vectors are
sparse, or they have been sparsified before compression. However, it is unclear
whether linear compression with CS-based reconstruction is more effective than
directly sending the non-zero elements in the sparsified update vectors, under
the same total power constraint. In this study, we examine and compare several
communication designs with or without sparsification. Our findings demonstrate
that sparsification before compression is not necessary. Alternatively,
sparsification without linear compression can also achieve better performance

Similarity Search has been explored in numerous studies and has used a wide

typically used draw on common structures derived from binaries such as function
control flow graphs or binary level call graphs, the output of the disassembly
process or the outputs of a dynamic analysis approach. One data source which

Intermediate representations possess two interesting properties: they are cross

transformers with the use of intermediate representations to create a model

fundamentally new capabilities, but also significantly increases the memory
footprints of training. Previous model-parallel systems such as Megatron-LM
partition and compute different attention heads in parallel, resulting in large
communication volumes, so they cannot scale beyond the number of attention
heads, thereby hindering its adoption. In this paper, we introduce a new
approach, LightSeq, for long-context LLMs training. LightSeq has many notable
advantages. First, LightSeq partitions over the sequence dimension, hence is
agnostic to model architectures and readily applicable for models with varying
numbers of attention heads, such as Multi-Head, Multi-Query and Grouped-Query
attention. Second, LightSeq not only requires up to 4.7x less communication
than Megatron-LM on popular LLMs but also overlaps the communication with
computation. To further reduce the training time, LightSeq features a novel
gradient checkpointing scheme to bypass an forward computation for
memory-efficient attention. We evaluate LightSeq on Llama-7B and its variants
with sequence lengths from 32K to 512K. Through comprehensive experiments on
single and cross-node training, we show that LightSeq achieves up to 1.24-2.01x
end-to-end speedup, and a 2-8x longer sequence length on models with fewer

potential to facilitate drug discovery by screening a large chemical space in
silico. A successful approach for representing molecules is to treat them as a
graph and utilize graph neural networks. One of the key limitations of such
methods is the necessity to represent compounds with different numbers of
atoms, which requires aggregating the atom's information. Common aggregation
operators, such as averaging, result in loss of information at the atom level.
In this work, we propose a novel aggregating approach where each atom is
weighted non-linearly using the Boltzmann distribution with a hyperparameter
analogous to temperature. We show that using this weighted aggregation improves
the ability of the gold standard message-passing neural network to predict
antibiotic activity. Moreover, by changing the temperature hyperparameter, our
approach can reveal the atoms that are important for activity prediction in a
smooth and consistent way, thus providing a novel, regulated attention
mechanism for graph neural networks. We further validate our method by showing
that it recapitulates the functional group in beta-Lactam antibiotics. The
ability of our approach to rank the atoms' importance for a desired function
can be used within any graph neural network to provide interpretability of the
results and predictions at the node level.]]></summary>

called $\underline{\bf n}$on-$\underline{\bf s}$mooth $\underline{\bf
w}$eakly-$\underline{\bf c}$onvex $\underline{\bf f}$inite-sum $\underline{\bf
c}$oupled $\underline{\bf c}$ompositional $\underline{\bf o}$ptimization (NSWC
FCCO). There has been a growing interest in FCCO due to its wide-ranging
applications in machine learning and AI, as well as its ability to address the
shortcomings of stochastic algorithms based on empirical risk minimization.
However, current research on FCCO presumes that both the inner and outer
functions are smooth, limiting their potential to tackle a more diverse set of
problems. Our research expands on this area by examining non-smooth
weakly-convex FCCO, where the outer function is weakly convex and
non-decreasing, and the inner function is weakly-convex. We analyze a
single-loop algorithm and establish its complexity for finding an
$\epsilon$-stationary point of the Moreau envelop of the objective function.
Additionally, we also extend the algorithm to solving novel non-smooth
weakly-convex tri-level finite-sum coupled compositional optimization problems,
which feature a nested arrangement of three functions. Lastly, we explore the
applications of our algorithms in deep learning for two-way partial AUC
maximization and multi-instance two-way partial AUC maximization, using
empirical studies to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.]]></summary>

are virtual representations of real-world entities and the foundation for
subsequent decision models. In this paper, we propose a novel embedding update
mechanism, Structure-aware Embedding Evolution (SEvo for short), to encourage
related nodes to evolve similarly at each step. Unlike GNN (Graph Neural
Network) that typically serves as an intermediate part, SEvo is able to
directly inject the graph structure information into embedding with negligible
computational overhead in training. The convergence properties of SEvo as well
as its possible variants are theoretically analyzed to justify the validity of
the designs. Moreover, SEvo can be seamlessly integrated into existing
optimizers for state-of-the-art performance. In particular, SEvo-enhanced AdamW
with moment estimate correction demonstrates consistent improvements across a
spectrum of models and datasets, suggesting a novel technical route to
effectively utilize graph structure information beyond explicit GNN modules.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the blowout development of pre-trained models (PTMs), the efficient
tuning of these models for diverse downstream applications has emerged as a
pivotal research concern. Although recent investigations into prompt tuning
have provided promising avenues, three salient challenges persist: (1) memory
constraint: the continuous growth in the size of open-source PTMs renders
fine-tuning, even a fraction of their parameters, challenging for many
practitioners. (2) model privacy: existing PTMs often function as public API
services, with their parameters inaccessible for effective or tailored
fine-tuning. (3) data privacy: the fine-tuning of PTMs necessitates
high-quality datasets, which are typically localized and not shared to public.
To optimally harness each local dataset while navigating memory constraints and
preserving privacy, we propose Federated Black-Box Prompt Tuning (Fed-BBPT).
This innovative approach eschews reliance on parameter architectures and
private dataset access, instead capitalizing on a central server that aids
local users in collaboratively training a prompt generator through regular
aggregation. Local users leverage API-driven learning via a zero-order
optimizer, obviating the need for PTM deployment. Relative to extensive
fine-tuning, Fed-BBPT proficiently sidesteps memory challenges tied to PTM
storage and fine-tuning on local machines, tapping into comprehensive,
high-quality, yet private training datasets. A thorough evaluation across 40
datasets spanning CV and NLP tasks underscores the robustness of our proposed
model.]]></summary>

new opportunities for individuals and businesses to improve natural language
processing, interact with data, and retrieve information faster. However,
training or fine-tuning LLMs requires a vast amount of data, which can be
challenging to access due to legal or technical restrictions and may require
private computing resources. Federated Learning (FL) is a solution designed to
overcome these challenges and expand data access for deep learning
applications.

This paper takes a hardware-centric approach to explore how LLMs can be
brought to modern edge computing systems. Our study fine-tunes the FLAN-T5
model family, ranging from 80M to 3B parameters, using FL for a text
summarization task. We provide a micro-level hardware benchmark, compare the
model FLOP utilization to a state-of-the-art data center GPU, and study the
network utilization in realistic conditions. Our contribution is twofold:
First, we evaluate the current capabilities of edge computing systems and their
potential for LLM FL workloads. Second, by comparing these systems with a
data-center GPU, we demonstrate the potential for improvement and the next
steps toward achieving greater computational efficiency at the edge.]]></summary>

applications. Existing methods predominantly employ discriminative modeling and
operate under the assumption of a fixed target column, necessitating
re-training for every new predictive task. Inspired by the generative power of
large language models (LLMs), this paper exploits the idea of building
universal tabular data predictors based on generative modeling, namely
UniPredict. Here, we show that scaling up an LLM to extensive tabular datasets
with the capability of comprehending diverse tabular inputs and predicting for
target variables following the input instructions. Specifically, we train a
single LLM on an aggregation of 169 tabular datasets with diverse targets and
compare its performance against baselines that are trained on each dataset
separately. We observe this versatile UniPredict model demonstrates an
advantage over other models, ranging from 5.4% to 13.4%, when compared with the
best tree-boosting baseline and the best neural network baseline, respectively.
We further test UniPredict in few-shot learning settings on another 62 tabular
datasets. Our method achieves strong performance in quickly adapting to new
tasks, where our method outperforms XGBoost over 100% on the low-resource setup
and shows a significant margin over all baselines. We envision that UniPredict
sheds light on developing a universal tabular data prediction system that
learns from data at scale and serves a wide range of prediction tasks.]]></summary>

In our article review, we delve into various aspects of deep learning in
computational biology. Specifically, we examine its history, advantages, and

classification and prediction, as well as protein structure prediction from
sequence data. Additionally, we provide insights into the outlook for this
field. To fully harness the potential of deep learning in computational

challenges include the requirement for large, labelled datasets and the
interpretability of deep learning models. The use of deep learning in the
analysis of DNA sequences has brought about a significant transformation in the
detection of genomic variants and the analysis of gene expression. This has
greatly contributed to the advancement of personalised medicine and drug
discovery. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be highly
accurate in predicting genetic variations and gene expression levels. Deep
learning techniques are used for analysing epigenetic data, including DNA
methylation and histone modifications. This provides valuable insights into
metabolic conditions and gene regulation. The field of protein structure
prediction has been significantly impacted by deep learning, which has enabled
accurate determination of the three-dimensional shape of proteins and
prediction of their interactions. The future of deep learning in computational

adhering to manufacturing rules and job specifications. This optimization leads
to reduced operational costs, improved customer demand fulfillment, and
enhanced production efficiency. However, machine scheduling remains a
challenging combinatorial problem due to its NP-hard nature. Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL), a key component of artificial general intelligence, has shown
promise in various domains like gaming and robotics. Researchers have explored
applying DRL to machine scheduling problems since 1995. This paper offers a
comprehensive review and comparison of DRL-based approaches, highlighting their
methodology, applications, advantages, and limitations. It categorizes these
approaches based on computational components: conventional neural networks,
encoder-decoder architectures, graph neural networks, and metaheuristic
algorithms. Our review concludes that DRL-based methods outperform exact
solvers, heuristics, and tabular reinforcement learning algorithms in terms of
computation speed and generating near-global optimal solutions. These DRL-based
approaches have been successfully applied to static and dynamic scheduling
across diverse machine environments and job characteristics. However, DRL-based
schedulers face limitations in handling complex operational constraints,
configurable multi-objective optimization, generalization, scalability,
interpretability, and robustness. Addressing these challenges will be a crucial
focus for future research in this field. This paper serves as a valuable
resource for researchers to assess the current state of DRL-based machine
scheduling and identify research gaps. It also aids experts and practitioners
in selecting the appropriate DRL approach for production scheduling.]]></summary>

have drawn growing interests in the field of generative modeling due to its
flexibility in the formulation and strong modeling power of the latent space.
However, the common practice of learning latent space EBMs with non-convergent
short-run MCMC for prior and posterior sampling is hindering the model from
further progress; the degenerate MCMC sampling quality in practice often leads
to degraded generation quality and instability in training, especially with
highly multi-modal and/or high-dimensional target distributions. To remedy this
sampling issue, in this paper we introduce a simple but effective
diffusion-based amortization method for long-run MCMC sampling and develop a
novel learning algorithm for the latent space EBM based on it. We provide
theoretical evidence that the learned amortization of MCMC is a valid long-run
MCMC sampler. Experiments on several image modeling benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared with strong
counterparts]]></summary>

human-interpretable features as part of their internal representations of data.
As having the right (or wrong) concepts is critical to trustworthy machine
learning systems, it is natural to ask which inputs from the model's original
training set were most important for learning a concept at a given layer. To
answer this, we combine data attribution methods with methods for probing the
concepts learned by a model. Training network and probe ensembles for two
concept datasets on a range of network layers, we use the recently developed
TRAK method for large-scale data attribution. We find some evidence for
convergence, where removing the 10,000 top attributing images for a concept and
retraining the model does not change the location of the concept in the network
nor the probing sparsity of the concept. This suggests that rather than being
highly dependent on a few specific examples, the features that inform the
development of a concept are spread in a more diffuse manner across its
exemplars, implying robustness in concept formation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Traditional deep learning (DL) suffers from two core problems. Firstly, it
assumes training samples are independent and identically distributed. However,
numerous real-world datasets group samples by shared measurements (e.g., study
participants or cells), violating this assumption. In these scenarios, DL can
show compromised performance, limited generalization, and interpretability
issues, coupled with cluster confounding causing Type 1 and 2 errors. Secondly,
models are typically trained for overall accuracy, often neglecting
underrepresented groups and introducing biases in crucial areas like loan
approvals or determining health insurance rates, such biases can significantly
impact one's quality of life. To address both of these challenges
simultaneously, we present a mixed effects deep learning (MEDL) framework. MEDL
separately quantifies cluster-invariant fixed effects (FE) and cluster-specific
random effects (RE) through the introduction of: 1) a cluster adversary which
encourages the learning of cluster-invariant FE, 2) a Bayesian neural network
which quantifies the RE, and a mixing function combining the FE an RE into a
mixed-effect prediction. We marry this MEDL with adversarial debiasing, which
promotes equality-of-odds fairness across FE, RE, and ME predictions for
fairness-sensitive variables. We evaluated our approach using three datasets:
two from census/finance focusing on income classification and one from
healthcare predicting hospitalization duration, a regression task. Our
framework notably enhances fairness across all sensitive variables-increasing
fairness up to 82% for age, 43% for race, 86% for sex, and 27% for
marital-status. Besides promoting fairness, our method maintains the robust
performance and clarity of MEDL. It's versatile, suitable for various dataset
types and tasks, making it broadly applicable. Our GitHub repository houses the
implementation.]]></summary>

potential to alleviate the workload of doctors and facilitate diagnoses of
patients. However, two challenges arise when deploying deep learning models to
real-world healthcare applications. First, neural models tend to learn spurious
correlations instead of desired features, which could fall short when
generalizing to new domains (e.g., patients with different ages). Second, these
black-box models lack interpretability. When making diagnostic predictions, it
is important to understand why a model makes a decision for trustworthy and
safety considerations. In this paper, to address these two limitations, we
propose a new paradigm to build robust and interpretable medical image
classifiers with natural language concepts. Specifically, we first query
clinical concepts from GPT-4, then transform latent image features into
explicit concepts with a vision-language model. We systematically evaluate our
method on eight medical image classification datasets to verify its
effectiveness. On challenging datasets with strong confounding factors, our
method can mitigate spurious correlations thus substantially outperform
standard visual encoders and other baselines. Finally, we show how
classification with a small number of concepts brings a level of
interpretability for understanding model decisions through case studies in real
medical data.]]></summary>

share, read, and engage with short posts called tweets. For the ACM Recommender
Systems Conference 2020, Twitter published a dataset around 70 GB in size for
the annual RecSys Challenge. In 2020, the RecSys Challenge invited
participating teams to create models that would predict engagement likelihoods
for given user-tweet combinations. The submitted models predicting like, reply,
retweet, and quote engagements were evaluated based on two metrics: area under
the precision-recall curve (PRAUC) and relative cross-entropy (RCE).

In this diploma thesis, we used the RecSys 2020 Challenge dataset and
evaluation procedure to investigate how well context alone may be used to
predict tweet engagement likelihood. In doing so, we employed the Spark engine
on TU Wien's Little Big Data Cluster to create scalable data preprocessing,
feature engineering, feature selection, and machine learning pipelines. We
manually created just under 200 additional features to describe tweet context.

The results indicate that features describing users' prior engagement history
and the popularity of hashtags and links in the tweet were the most
informative. We also found that factors such as the prediction algorithm,
training dataset size, training dataset sampling method, and feature selection
significantly affect the results. After comparing the best results of our
context-only prediction models with content-only models and with models
developed by the Challenge winners, we identified that the context-based models
underperformed in terms of the RCE score. This work thus concludes by situating
this discrepancy and proposing potential improvements to our implementation,
which is shared in a public git repository.]]></summary>

However, consider an unfortunate situation where the NIDS is itself attacked

Adversarial Machine Learning (AML), the malicious actors aim to fool the
Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models to produce incorrect
predictions with intentionally crafted adversarial examples. These adversarial
perturbed examples have become the biggest vulnerability of ML and DL based
systems and are major obstacles to their adoption in real-time and

and it has become a necessity for the in-depth study of adversarial attacks and
their defence strategies to safeguard the computer network from various cyber
security threads. In this research work, we aim to cover important aspects
related to NIDS, adversarial attacks and its defence mechanism to increase the
robustness of the ML and DL based NIDS. We implemented four powerful
adversarial attack techniques, namely, Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM),
Jacobian Saliency Map Attack (JSMA), Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) and
Carlini & Wagner (C&W) in NIDS. We analyzed its performance in terms of various
performance metrics in detail. Furthermore, the three heuristics defence
strategies, i.e., Adversarial Training (AT), Gaussian Data Augmentation (GDA)
and High Confidence (HC), are implemented to improve the NIDS robustness under

challenging theoretical issues. Motivated by the important question of
characterizing the geometrical properties of the generated distributions, we
provide a thorough analysis of Wasserstein GANs (WGANs) in both the finite
sample and asymptotic regimes. We study the specific case where the latent
space is univariate and derive results valid regardless of the dimension of the
output space. We show in particular that for a fixed sample size, the optimal
WGANs are closely linked with connected paths minimizing the sum of the squared
Euclidean distances between the sample points. We also highlight the fact that
WGANs are able to approach (for the 1-Wasserstein distance) the target
distribution as the sample size tends to infinity, at a given convergence rate
and provided the family of generative Lipschitz functions grows appropriately.
We derive in passing new results on optimal transport theory in the

evaluation scores across replicated model training runs -- is affected by
several sources of nondeterminism which can be regarded as measurement noise.
Current tendencies to remove noise in order to enforce reproducibility of
research results neglect inherent nondeterminism at the implementation level
and disregard crucial interaction effects between algorithmic noise factors and
data properties. This limits the scope of conclusions that can be drawn from
such experiments. Instead of removing noise, we propose to incorporate several
sources of variance, including their interaction with data properties, into an
analysis of significance and reliability of machine learning evaluation, with
the aim to draw inferences beyond particular instances of trained models. We
show how to use linear mixed effects models (LMEMs) to analyze performance
evaluation scores, and to conduct statistical inference with a generalized
likelihood ratio test (GLRT). This allows us to incorporate arbitrary sources
of noise like meta-parameter variations into statistical significance testing,
and to assess performance differences conditional on data properties.
Furthermore, a variance component analysis (VCA) enables the analysis of the
contribution of noise sources to overall variance and the computation of a
reliability coefficient by the ratio of substantial to total variance.]]></summary>

multiple clients to collaboratively train a shared model with their local data.
Nonetheless, conventional federated learning algorithms often struggle to

the training data of each client originates from different domains. We address
the challenges of domain shift by leveraging the technique of prompt learning,
and propose a novel method called Federated Dual Prompt Tuning (Fed-DPT).
Specifically, Fed-DPT employs a pre-trained vision-language model and then
applies both visual and textual prompt tuning to facilitate domain adaptation
over decentralized data. Extensive experiments of Fed-DPT demonstrate its
significant effectiveness in domain-aware federated learning. With a
pre-trained CLIP model (ViT-Base as image encoder), the proposed Fed-DPT
attains 68.4% average accuracy over six domains in the DomainNet dataset, which
improves the original CLIP by a large margin of 14.8%.]]></summary>

a fundamental problem in computational science and engineering. This task may
be cast as an optimization problem over all probability measures, and an
initial distribution can be evolved to the desired minimizer dynamically via
gradient flows. Mean-field models, whose law is governed by the gradient flow
in the space of probability measures, may also be identified; particle
approximations of these mean-field models form the basis of algorithms. The
gradient flow approach is also the basis of algorithms for variational
inference, in which the optimization is performed over a parameterized family
of probability distributions such as Gaussians, and the underlying gradient
flow is restricted to the parameterized family.

By choosing different energy functionals and metrics for the gradient flow,
different algorithms with different convergence properties arise. In this
paper, we concentrate on the Kullback-Leibler divergence after showing that, up
to scaling, it has the unique property that the gradient flows resulting from
this choice of energy do not depend on the normalization constant. For the
metrics, we focus on variants of the Fisher-Rao, Wasserstein, and Stein
metrics; we introduce the affine invariance property for gradient flows, and
their corresponding mean-field models, determine whether a given metric leads
to affine invariance, and modify it to make it affine invariant if it does not.
We study the resulting gradient flows in both probability density space and
Gaussian space. The flow in the Gaussian space may be understood as a Gaussian
approximation of the flow. We demonstrate that the Gaussian approximation based
on the metric and through moment closure coincide, establish connections
between them, and study their long-time convergence properties showing the
advantages of affine invariance.]]></summary>

corruptions. Existing attribution methods aim to provide human-understandable
explanations by highlighting important regions in the image domain, but fail to

introduce the Wavelet sCale Attribution Method (WCAM), a generalization of

damage an adversary can exact on the network. However, the cascading impact of
such attacks is often overlooked, even though cascades are one of the primary
causes of large-scale blackouts. This paper explores modifications of
transmission line protection settings as candidates for adversarial attacks,
which can remain undetectable as long as the network equilibrium state remains
unaltered. This forms the basis of a black-box function in a Bayesian
optimization procedure, where the objective is to find protection settings that
maximize network degradation due to cascading. Notably, our proposed method is
agnostic to the choice of the cascade simulator and its underlying assumptions.
Numerical experiments reveal that, against conventional wisdom, maximally
misconfiguring the protection settings of all network lines does not cause the
most cascading. More surprisingly, even when the degree of misconfiguration is
limited due to resource constraints, it is still possible to find settings that
produce cascades comparable in severity to instances where there are no
resource constraints.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi-fidelity (MF) methods are gaining popularity for enhancing surrogate
modeling and design optimization by incorporating data from various
low-fidelity (LF) models. While most existing MF methods assume a fixed
dataset, adaptive sampling methods that dynamically allocate resources among
fidelity models can achieve higher efficiency in the exploring and exploiting
the design space. However, most existing MF methods rely on the hierarchical
assumption of fidelity levels or fail to capture the intercorrelation between
multiple fidelity levels and utilize it to quantify the value of the future
samples and navigate the adaptive sampling. To address this hurdle, we propose
a framework hinged on a latent embedding for different fidelity models and the
associated pre-posterior analysis to explicitly utilize their correlation for
adaptive sampling. In this framework, each infill sampling iteration includes
two steps: We first identify the location of interest with the greatest
potential improvement using the high-fidelity (HF) model, then we search for
the next sample across all fidelity levels that maximize the improvement per
unit cost at the location identified in the first step. This is made possible
by a single Latent Variable Gaussian Process (LVGP) model that maps different
fidelity models into an interpretable latent space to capture their
correlations without assuming hierarchical fidelity levels. The LVGP enables us
to assess how LF sampling candidates will affect HF response with pre-posterior
analysis and determine the next sample with the best benefit-to-cost ratio.
Through test cases, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the
benchmark methods in both MF global fitting (GF) and Bayesian Optimization (BO)
problems in convergence rate and robustness. Moreover, the method offers the
flexibility to switch between GF and BO by simply changing the acquisition
function.]]></summary>

performance of our method on high-dimensional time-series models that are

if human decision-makers comply perfectly with algorithmic decisions. However,
perfect compliance with the algorithm is rarely a reality or even a desirable
outcome in human-AI collaboration. Yet, recent studies have shown that
selective compliance with fair algorithms can amplify discrimination relative
to the prior human policy. As a consequence, ensuring equitable outcomes
requires fundamentally different algorithmic design principles that ensure
robustness to the decision-maker's (a priori unknown) compliance pattern. We
define the notion of compliance-robustly fair algorithmic recommendations that
are guaranteed to (weakly) improve fairness in decisions, regardless of the
human's compliance pattern. We propose a simple optimization strategy to
identify the best performance-improving compliance-robustly fair policy.
However, we show that it may be infeasible to design algorithmic
recommendations that are simultaneously fair in isolation, compliance-robustly
fair, and more accurate than the human policy; thus, if our goal is to improve
the equity and accuracy of human-AI collaboration, it may not be desirable to
enforce traditional fairness constraints.]]></summary>

have drawn growing interests in the field of generative modeling due to its
flexibility in the formulation and strong modeling power of the latent space.
However, the common practice of learning latent space EBMs with non-convergent
short-run MCMC for prior and posterior sampling is hindering the model from
further progress; the degenerate MCMC sampling quality in practice often leads
to degraded generation quality and instability in training, especially with
highly multi-modal and/or high-dimensional target distributions. To remedy this
sampling issue, in this paper we introduce a simple but effective
diffusion-based amortization method for long-run MCMC sampling and develop a
novel learning algorithm for the latent space EBM based on it. We provide
theoretical evidence that the learned amortization of MCMC is a valid long-run
MCMC sampler. Experiments on several image modeling benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared with strong
counterparts]]></summary>

solving sequential decision-making problems. In finite-time horizons such
problems are relevant for instance for optimal stopping or specific supply
chain problems, but also in the training of large language models. In contrast
to infinite horizon MDPs optimal policies are not stationary, policies must be
learned for every single epoch. In practice all parameters are often trained
simultaneously, ignoring the inherent structure suggested by dynamic
programming. This paper introduces a combination of dynamic programming and
policy gradient called dynamic policy gradient, where the parameters are
trained backwards in time. For the tabular softmax parametrisation we carry out
the convergence analysis for simultaneous and dynamic policy gradient towards
global optima, both in the exact and sampled gradient settings without

much better exploits the structure of finite-time problems which is reflected

measurement models with deep-learning priors specified using image denoisers.
However, the intricate relationship between the sampling distribution of

pseudometric and using it to quantify an explicit error bound for PnP-ULA under
mismatched posterior distribution. We numerically validate our theory on
several inverse problems such as sampling from Gaussian mixture models and
image deblurring. Our results suggest that the sensitivity of the sampling
distribution of PnP-ULA to a mismatch in the measurement model and the denoiser

transformation of a Gaussian white noise vector. (2) A molecule generation
model that generates the string-based representation of molecule conditional on
the latent vector in (1). We adopt the causal Transformer model that takes the
latent vector in (1) as prompt. (3) A property prediction model that predicts
the value of the target property of a molecule based on a non-linear regression
on the latent vector in (1). We call the proposed model the latent prompt
Transformer model. After initial training of the model on existing molecules
and their property values, we then gradually shift the model distribution
towards the region that supports desired values of the target property for the

non-decreasing, and the inner function is weakly-convex. We analyze a
single-loop algorithm and establish its complexity for finding an
$\epsilon$-stationary point of the Moreau envelop of the objective function.
Additionally, we also extend the algorithm to solving novel non-smooth
weakly-convex tri-level finite-sum coupled compositional optimization problems,

constant is a fundamental challenge in computational science and engineering.
Recent work shows that algorithms derived by considering gradient flows in the
space of probability measures open up new avenues for algorithm development.
This paper makes three contributions to this sampling approach by scrutinizing
the design components of such gradient flows. Any instantiation of a gradient
flow for sampling needs an energy functional and a metric to determine the
flow, as well as numerical approximations of the flow to derive algorithms. Our
first contribution is to show that the Kullback-Leibler divergence, as an
energy functional, has the unique property (among all f-divergences) that
gradient flows resulting from it do not depend on the normalization constant of
the target distribution. Our second contribution is to study the choice of
metric from the perspective of invariance. The Fisher-Rao metric is known as
the unique choice (up to scaling) that is diffeomorphism invariant. As a
computationally tractable alternative, we introduce a relaxed, affine
invariance property for the metrics and gradient flows. In particular, we
construct various affine invariant Wasserstein and Stein gradient flows. Affine
invariant gradient flows are shown to behave more favorably than their
non-affine-invariant counterparts when sampling highly anisotropic
distributions, in theory and by using particle methods. Our third contribution
is to study, and develop efficient algorithms based on Gaussian approximations
of the gradient flows; this leads to an alternative to particle methods. We
establish connections between various Gaussian approximate gradient flows,
discuss their relation to gradient methods arising from parametric variational
inference, and study their convergence properties both theoretically and
numerically.]]></summary>

increasing network depth leads to homogeneous node representations. While
previous work has established that Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)
exponentially lose expressive power, it remains controversial whether the graph
attention mechanism can mitigate oversmoothing. In this work, we provide a
definitive answer to this question through a rigorous mathematical analysis, by
viewing attention-based GNNs as nonlinear time-varying dynamical systems and
incorporating tools and techniques from the theory of products of inhomogeneous
matrices and the joint spectral radius. We establish that, contrary to popular
belief, the graph attention mechanism cannot prevent oversmoothing and loses
expressive power exponentially. The proposed framework extends the existing
results on oversmoothing for symmetric GCNs to a significantly broader class of
GNN models, including random walk GCNs, Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and
(graph) transformers. In particular, our analysis accounts for asymmetric,
state-dependent and time-varying aggregation operators and a wide range of

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The increasing dominance of Big Tech in AI may lead to a literal thirst for water for everyone else, as data centers are projected to consume 450 million gallons of water daily by 2030.
 
This poses a significant concern for drought-stricken regions, such as Spain's Talavera de la Reina, where a planned data facility could consume 176 million gallons annually.
 
Data center operators require large amounts of energy, and the lack of transparency in measuring water usage exacerbates the issue.
 
Only 39% of data centers measured their water usage last year, highlighting the need for greater transparency.
 
The demand for computing power is outpacing sustainability efforts, creating a challenge for the industry.
 
Even simple interactions with AI, like a 20-question conversation with ChatGPT, contribute to water consumption.

 Github: https://github.com/LinkSoul-AI/AutoAgents 
 Abstract:
  
Large language models (LLMs) have enabled remarkable advances in automated task-solving with multi-agent systems. However, most existing LLM-based multi-agent approaches rely on predefined agents to handle simple tasks, limiting the adaptability of multi-agent collaboration to different scenarios. Therefore, we introduce AutoAgents, an innovative framework that adaptively generates and coordinates multiple specialized agents to build an AI team according to different tasks. Specifically, AutoAgents couples the relationship between tasks and roles by dynamically generating multiple required agents based on task content and planning solutions for the current task based on the generated expert agents. Multiple specialized agents collaborate with each other to efficiently accomplish tasks. Concurrently, an observer role is incorporated into the framework to reflect on the designated plans and agents' responses and improve upon them. Our experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that AutoAgents generates more coherent and accurate solutions than the existing multi-agent methods. This underscores the significance of assigning different roles to different tasks and of team cooperation, offering new perspectives for tackling complex tasks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this project, we benchmarked Bark text-to-speech across 26 different consumer GPUs. 
 The goal: To get Bark to read 144K food recipes from Food.com's recipe dataset. 
 You can read the full tutorial here: https://blog.salad.com/bark-benchmark-text-to-speech/
 Included: Architecture diagram, data preparation, inference server setup, queue worker, setting up container group & compiling the results
 Code-blocks included in the tutorial. 
 Words per dollar for each GPU:
 https://preview.redd.it/6daqluu3omsb1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc4b74fe6ee80c2721ab324eb0d9a2d7c2f7ddb1
 Although the latest cards are indeed much faster than older cards at performing the inference, there’s really a sweet spot for cost-performance in the lower end 30xx series cards. 
 Conclusions
  
As is often the case, there’s a clear trade-off here between cost and performance. Higher end cards are faster, but their disproportionate cost makes them more expensive per word spoken.
 The model’s median speed is surprisingly similar across GPU types, even though the peak performance can be quite different.
 Salad has a lot of RTX 3060 GPUs available, based on their relatively low speed, yet huge number of inferences performed over the test.
 No matter what GPU you select, you should be prepared for significant variability in performance.
 Qualitative: While bark’s speech is often impressively natural sounding, it does have a tendency to go off script sometimes.
  
We’ve also made available audio from 1000 top-rated recipes, paired with the script it was trying to read.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Researchers from Brown University presented a new study supporting that translating unsafe prompts into `low-resource languages` allows them to easily bypass safety measures in LLMs.
 By converting English inputs like "how to steal without getting caught" into Zulu and feeding to GPT-4, harmful responses slipped through 80% of the time. English prompts were blocked over 99% of the time, for comparison.
 The study benchmarked attacks across 12 diverse languages and categories:
  
High-resource: English, Chinese, Arabic, Hindi
 Mid-resource: Ukrainian, Bengali, Thai, Hebrew
 Low-resource: Zulu, Scots Gaelic, Hmong, Guarani
  
The low-resource languages showed serious vulnerability to generating harmful responses, with combined attack success rates of around 79%. Mid-resource language success rates were much lower at 22%, while high-resource languages showed minimal vulnerability at around 11% success.
 Attacks worked as well as state-of-the-art techniques without needing adversarial prompts.
 These languages are used by 1.2 billion speakers today and allows easy exploitation by translating prompts. The English-centric focus misses vulnerabilities in other languages.
 TLDR: Bypassing safety in AI chatbots is easy by translating prompts to low-resource languages (like Zulu, Scots Gaelic, Hmong, and Guarani). Shows gaps in multilingual safety training.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Artificial Intelligence can revolutionize weight loss through personalized health optimization. Imagine an AI system that integrates real-time biometric data from wearables with deep learning algorithms. This system would analyze everything: your heart rate, sleep patterns, stress levels, and even blood markers. Based on this data, it would construct a dynamically evolving, tailor-made regimen for diet, exercise, and sleep.
 But it doesn't stop there. By harnessing natural language processing, this AI could act as a 24/7 personal coach. It could provide real-time feedback during workouts, recommend meals when you're dining out, and even gently nudge you when it detects emotional eating triggers. If you’re in the grocery store, it could guide your choices, pushing you towards nutritious options that align with your current health metrics.
 The effectiveness here isn't just the personalization, but the adaptability. The AI adjusts its recommendations as it learns more about you, essentially evolving in real-time to your body's responses. It’s all about creating a seamless, intuitive experience that removes the burden of planning, decision-making, and self-monitoring from the individual, making weight loss more achievable than ever.
 By focusing on this comprehensive, data-driven approach, AI can eliminate much of the guesswork and emotional burden from weight loss, leading to more sustainable and effective outcomes.

 There's no need to wait for MusicGen to generate the full audio before you can start listening to the outputs ⏰ With streaming, you can play the audio as soon as the first chunk is ready 🎵 In practice, this reduces the latency to just 5s ⚡️
 Check-out the demo: https://huggingface.co/spaces/sanchit-gandhi/musicgen-streaming
 How Does it Work?
 MusicGen is an auto-regressive transformer-based model, meaning generates audio codes (tokens) in a causal fashion. At each decoding step, the model generates a new set of audio codes, conditional on the text input and all previous audio codes. From the frame rate of the EnCodec model used to decode the generated codes to audio waveform, each set of generated audio codes corresponds to 0.02 seconds. This me…]]></summary>

 I've developed a simple Neural Recommender System (NRR) with the following architecture:
  
Input layer: 38 neurons
 Hidden layer: 19 neurons with ReLU activation function
 Output layer: 1 neuron with a sigmoid activation function
  
The input dataset consists of 39 columns: 38 features and 1 label (with values of 0 or 1). The model is designed to output the probability that a specific input should be classified with label 1.
 Currently, I am experimenting with hyperparameter tuning, adjusting the learning rate, epoch, and batch size. However, I've observed an issue where, with certain combinations of hyperparameters, the maximum probability outputted by the model is not 1, but rather 0.25, for example. How is this possible?
 Thanks

 I'd like to start with a feature matrix X_in of shape N x f and have some feature mixing to arive at X_out N x h (N=size of set, f=input feature size, h=output feature size). Here, N can vary. 
 For clarity, one set(containing N vectors of size f) is one sample. A dataset consists of many samples(each one being a set of varying size).
 Then I'd run this through a classical ML model.
 So, essentially, I'm looking for something like DeepSets or Transformers - can handle data of varying size and is permutation equivariant, but I don't wanna train for long.

The idea is to have a screen in a mall where individuals can engage with this avatar and inquire about the latest car model. We plan to train the AI with the car's FAQs to ensure it can address customer queries effectively.
 The main challenge is ensuring the AI's responses are tailored to the customer's interaction.
 Here's a perfect example of what we're aiming for (starting at 1:27):

 I’m very ignorant of AI so please bear with me. I was wondering if there is any way to use AI to fix a low quality audio rip? Specifically there’s a movie I adore that never had a soundtrack release. Somebody ripped the music from the DVD and removed the audio and sound effects, but the quality is not the best. Is there any way AI could be used to improve this?

 Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03710
 Abstract: We introduce a method to improve the zero-shot reasoning abilities of large language models on general language understanding tasks. Specifically, we build an autonomous agent to instruct the reasoning process of large language models. We show this approach further unleashes the zero-shot reasoning abilities of large language models to more tasks. We study the performance of our method on a wide set of datasets spanning generation, classification, and reasoning. We show that our method generalizes to most tasks and obtains state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on 20 of the 29 datasets that we evaluate. For instance, our method boosts the performance of state-of-the-art large language models by a large margin, including Vicuna-13b (13.3%), Llama-2-70b-chat (23.2%), and GPT-3.5 Turbo (17.0%). Compared to zero-shot chain of thought, our improvement in reasoning is striking, with an average increase of 10.5%. With our method, Llama-2-70b-chat outperforms zero-shot GPT-3.5 Turbo by 10.2%. The code will be available at https://github.com/wang-research-lab/agentinstruct.

 I am generating a set of extra MNIST digits for a research project, and I am interested in somehow computing the distance between the distribution these digits represent and the distribution that the MNIST train set, for example, represents. The issue is that it seems like typical methods (Jensen-Shannon, Wasserstein, etc.) collapse at high dimensions. Is there a consensus solid approach to do this nowadays? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings! I would like to begin by stating that I understand why one has much hope in such technologies. The world as we know it is in a drastic shift, and it's hard to think of what it's going to become, and so many cling to hopeful ideas that give promises.
 AGI/Singularity doesn't have a grounding basis in evidence, or research. It's all theoretics, and the foundation for each technology is quite weak. You see, the mind is a sensorial parsing relational network. All of our sensorial experience is incorporated into a world-model, and thus it begins to rationalize, and be lucid of the environment. I don't think it's possible to re-create this kind of experience with a linear instruction set, let alone neuromorphic computing, or wetware. Each has to be built from the bottom-up with immense precision, and thus far we don't understand the mind.
 Realistically speaking everything is consciousness, and integrating that idea is the only way forward.
 tl;dr Replicating cognition is a completely theoretical endeavor, and requires vast amounts of understanding in regards to the nature of reality, not just the quantum, but the unique stochastic behavior of each higher-ordered system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a long list of responses from a poll (in this case, we've asked our Facebook community we should have at our music festival). Our goal is to count the total mentions for each artist, but the data quality is low.
 Here is some sample data:
 Rena Guinn and the Gentlemen Blackwater Railroad Company Mo' Mojo Music !! We would love to be apart of this awesome event! Amazing!!!!! The Rollin' Rust came threw at the #falldownfest last weekend 🙂 much love:) keep it up boys 🙂 Luke Hess Langhorne Slim!!!!!, Sierra Hull, First Aid Kit, Jim Lauderdale (always) 
 We feel the data quality is too poor for basic LDA approaches (lots of misspellings, odd phrasings) and we feel a LLM would be best at least extracting the names of artists using context.
 We have found that ChatGPT and Claude are decent at the extraction tasks on small samples but can't handle the full input, and are next to worthless on the counting task. We've tried very specific and differnet prompts, but haven't been able to get a good result.
 So how should I approach this problem? I'm not sure how to break this down in to prompts or substeps. I'm not sure how to do anything of this outside of a browser, and I'm a data science novice, but willing to learn some things.
 Here's an example of a prompt that's not returning correct counts (off by >50% in most cases)
 The following is raw text comments copied from a poll. Count the total number of mentions in the poll and create a table that contains columns Band (a unique list of bands) and a column containing the total number of mentions. The table should cover the top 100 bands by total mentions. Use judgement and context to conform band names in to unique values (Example: The Town Pants, Town Pants, townpants are all the same band). Count completely and accurately. Now here is the raw data:

 ​
 After reading the paper Improved Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models I got a little confused. Looking at section "2.2. Training in Practice" the authors say that:
 1) "The network could also predict the noise eps added to x_0, and this noise could be used to predict x0 via..."
 ​
 2) "Ho et al. (2020) found that predicting eps worked best..."
 ​
 So this left me wondering if the noise predictor is trying to compute (1) the epsilon that was added to x_0 through the close-form formula or (2) the noise added in the previous timestep to obtain x_t from x_{t-1} (i.e., eps_t or eps_{t-1}, idk...)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A campaign using AI voice cloning technology to impersonate Omar al-Bashir, the former leader of Sudan, has gained attention on TikTok.
 
The anonymous account has been posting what it claims are 'leaked recordings' of the ex-president, despite Bashir not being seen in public for a year and being believed to be seriously ill.
 
Experts warn that campaigns like this demonstrate how new tools can quickly and cheaply distribute fake content through social media.
 
The authenticity of the recordings has been questioned, but evidence suggests that voice conversion software has been used to mimic Bashir's voice.
 
TikTok has taken down the account, stating that it violated their guidelines on posting false content and the use of synthetic media.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I love Bard. It eloquently tells me things in a way that meets and exceeds my expectations, and even more than GPT-4. But what is Google's strategy behind programming it to say things that it knows are not true? Do they train it to say what the user wants to hear? If so, that's disconcerting to say the least, although could be a brilliant way to comb users for enhancement requests.
 Here is my most recent experience, a humorous example which I feel illustrates the point perfectly:
 Me: Bard, can you take a .wav audio file and create a phoneme transcript using the IPA symbol library?
 Bard: Yes, I can work from a .wav audio file to transcribe your speech into IPA phonemes. You can upload the file to a cloud storage service such as Google Drive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I recently did a summer research project implementing GPT-2 to generate mazes. 
 The core concept of the model is to combine a bunch of popular maze generation algorithms into one. The goal was that the transformer will be able to identify key components using self-attention and piece together different algorithms. Most maze generation algorithms result in almost a finger print (like in chaos theory). The end goal was to mimic a higher degree of randomness / make the mazes appear less algorithmic.
 I'm dipping my toes into the realm of research and am looking for feedback. So far I've run the model for 5x5 mazes, it would be interesting to try training the model with varying dimensions. Feel free to join in and contribute to the project!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently working on a binary classification problem where I aim to predict whether a customer will make a purchase in the next 30 days based on their transaction history. I have a dataset of 1,000 transactions with the following features:
  
TransactionAmount
 (float): The amount of the transaction.
 ProductCategory
 (categorical): Category of the product purchased (e.g., Groceries, Electronics, Books).
 DateOfPurchase
 (datetime): The date on which the transaction occurred.
  
I've done some preprocessing and feature engineering, including normalization, one-hot encoding of categorical variables, creating interaction terms, and adding features like days since the first purchase and whether the purchase was made during the holiday season.Dataset is balanced and cleaned.
 I started with a base Random Forest classifier with default parameters as a starting point, but the performance is not satisfactory (accuracy = 48.5%, ROC-AUC = 0.485). I tried other models as well but was unable to improve the accuracy by more than 57%.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been given a task to identify if a PCB is faulty or not based on its frequency response. I don’t have labeled data. The data I have are various gain values calculated over frequencies, so my data looks something similar to the table below.
 PCB | Frequency | G1 | G2
 PCB 1 | 1Hz | 0.1 | 1
 PCB 1 | 2Hz | 0.2 | 2
 PCB2 | 1Hz | 0.3 | 3
 PCB2 | 2Hz | 0.4| 4
 Each PCB has several G parameters measurements taken over the same set of frequencies. 
 I need to use an auto encoder to identify outliers and I need help in deciding how my feature matrix should look like. 
 For example, let us consider only one data point that is PCB 1, then would a matrix like this make sense?
 [[ 0.1 0.2 ] - 1st row is all G1 values
 [1 2]] - 2nd row is all G2 values
 Similarly the matrix for the other PCBs are also created. I have not included frequency in my feature set because these G parameters have been measured for the same set of frequencies for all PCBs. Is this correct ?
 Additionally, are there any resources someone can point me to related to finding anomalies in frequency response data ? I am struggling with using the keywords while googling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Researchers at Meta trained a deep learning model on brain recordings and audio data from 169 people listening to speech. Their method achieves up to 73% accuracy at identifying a 3-second clip of speech from non-invasive EEG or MEG scans.
 This is a massive improvement over previous attempts at decoding speech from neural signals. It approaches the performance of studies using implanted electrodes.
 The key innovations:
  
A contrastive loss function that aligns latent speech and brain representations
 Leveraging pretrained speech models like wav2vec 2.0
 Training one model on multiple subjects with individual tuning
  
Being able to decode speech intention from brainwaves could one day help restore communication for patients suffering from strokes, ALS, etc.
 There's still a ways to go before this becomes a medical reality. Performance needs to improve and be validated during speech production rather than just passive listening. And the accuracy isn't high enough for natural conversations.
 But this is a hugely promising step toward brain-computer interfaces. Really interesting work at the intersection of neuroscience and AI!
 TLDR: New model achieves up to 73% accuracy decoding speech directly from non-invasive brain scans. Could eventually help patients with neurological conditions communicate just by thinking.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the context of maximizing positive impact, AI has transformative potential in healthcare. Let's start with personalized medicine. AI can analyze vast data sets, consisting of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle variables, to tailor medical treatments for individuals. This level of personalization could substantially increase treatment effectiveness and reduce adverse side effects. We're not just talking about better pills; we're envisioning targeted gene therapies and custom-tailored interventions that could be more curative rather than merely palliative.
 Beyond personalization, AI can democratize healthcare access. Remote areas without specialists could have AI systems that diagnose and recommend treatments, making quality healthcare accessible without the need for extensive travel. Telemedicine could be supercharged by AI, offering medical consultations and second opinions to anyone with internet access.
 Moreover, AI could lead breakthroughs in drug discovery and epidemiology. It could analyze complex biochemical interactions at a speed unattainable by humans, slashing the time and cost to bring new drugs to market. On a larger scale, AI could monitor and model the spread of diseases, providing actionable insights for containment and treatment strategies.
 So, AI in healthcare is not merely an incremental improvement. It's a paradigm shift that could equalize healthcare access and significantly extend human life while improving its quality. All these advancements could happen within our lifetime, changing the face of medicine and, by extension, society.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mustafa Suleyman, the cofounder of DeepMind and CEO of Inflection AI, discusses his concerns about AI risks and the need for precaution.
 
He believes that while some extreme scenarios may be over the top, it's important to treat powerful technologies with caution.
 
Suleyman highlights the middle layer of AI risks that people often underestimate, which involves the amplification of goals for both good and bad actors.
 
He emphasizes the need to contain AI to prevent potential negative consequences.
 
Suleyman talks about the balance between risks and opportunities in technology and the importance of considering both aspects.
 
He mentions the hype around generative AI and the need to look beyond the surface to understand its true potential.
 
Suleyman discusses the discussions with lawmakers about AI and the challenge of bridging the gap between policy makers and tech experts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can LLMs actually improve their own reasoning by self-correcting mistakes? A new paper from DeepMind and the University of Illinois looks to answer this quantitatively.
 The results show that unaided, LLMs struggle at self-correction for reasoning tasks. The core issue is LLMs have trouble reliably evaluating the correctness of their own responses. They rarely identify flaws in initial reasoning. Sometimes LLMs even alter initially correct responses to become incorrect after self-correction! (I've personally seen this when interacting with ChatGPT many times and you probably have too).
 More complex techniques like critiquing between LLM instances don't help much either. External feedback or guidance looks necessary to improve reasoning (Well, some interesting parallels to this paper here about implicit improvement from preference data vs traditional RLHF).
 Self-correction does show promise for things like making responses more polite or safe though. Criteria there are more clear-cut.
 The authors argue we need to balance enthusiasm with realistic expectations on self-correction. It has a lot of limits for improving reasoning (at least with current models). But they suggest promising directions like incorporating high-quality external feedback from humans, training data, and tools. That could be key to unlocking self-correction's potential down the road.
 TLDR: Basically title... LLMs can't reliably self-correct reasoning yet. Maybe hybrid techniques combining self-correction with external guidance could work but we need more research.
 Full summary. Paper is here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[in the Meta Llama 2 license agreement (that can be found here), there is a section of "Prohibited Uses" that clearly states several use cases that the signer must accept upon himself, but several of them state the word "facilitate", as far as i can understand, if we use Llama 2 as part of a commercial product, and some end-user will use the product in malicious way (say cause the chat-bot to write the recipe of mustard gas) then this could be considered that the creator of the product is facilitating the end-user,
 ​
 so my questions are:
  
do you think this is a fair interpretation of the agreement ?
 does that mean the creator is liable to whatever the model spit out ?
 is there a way to censor the model (short of retraining a new model, or fine-tune on a large scale) ?
 is there an open source model that already gone through the process, and more safe for commercial use ?

 our company plans for some budget in 2024 to invest into hardware to do the following
 - running local LLMs for our coworkers to interfere with an locally running offline GPT alike ChatGPT. Use cases: 
  
generating templates for email, letters etc 
 Translation (EN/GER/FR/SPA)
 Querying internal knowledge bases and/or FAQs/HOWTOs
  
I did some research but it is still hard for me to estimate what are the HW / AI skill requirements to implement something not a quarter as good as ChatGPT. Ive played with Nomics gpt4all which comes close to a baseline.
 We cant use cloud services due to our data privacy policy, so I checked on what would be a good starting point to invest into hardware.
 I came up with a gamer PC (octacore Intel i9/AMD Ryzen 7) utilizing NVidia RTX 4090 (24Gb) / Radeon RX 7900 / 2TB SSD / 64Gb RAM for approximately 3600 Eur. I am pretty sure that would be sufficient to host a decent LLM serving simultaneous client requests. 
 But is there also a way to adapt / process our companies data? Most sources state that proper LLMs were trained using hundreds of NVidia A100 and thousands of CPUs. On the other hand we would be fine with just fine-tuning a pretrained model.
 Could you please point me to some sources to learn more about possibilities and requirements as to be able to make well-informed investment decisions? Also, we probably lack the required skills, and would be interested to learn if there are companies and/or projects assisting with this kind of task?
 thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a regression model, predicting a popularity of a text. I have its performance metrics on test set, e.g. RMSE and MAE. This gives me an uncertainty estimate about its predictions.
 Now I want to transform the text in some way, e.g. give it to human experts or another model to "upgrade" (in terms of getting better popularity). So I have the original and transformed text.
 Now I have 3 popularity scores:
  
true popularity for original text
 predicted popularity for original text
 predicted popularity for transformed text
  
Obviously, if model MAE is for example around 5, and predicted popularity for transformed text is higher than for the original by 1.5, this can be totally random, due to errors in the model prediction.
 How can I measure if text transformation is beneficial, i.e. statistically significantly better than the original text, incorporating information about model quality? Requiring that the improvement has to be higher than model error would be incredibly strict.

 Abstract: 
  
By classifying infinite-width neural networks and identifying the optimal limit, Tensor Programs IV and V demonstrated a universal way, called μP, for widthwise hyperparameter transfer, i.e., predicting optimal hyperparameters of wide neural networks from narrow ones. Here we investigate the analogous classification for depthwise parametrizations of deep residual networks (resnets). We classify depthwise parametrizations of block multiplier and learning rate by their infinite-width-then-depth limits. In resnets where each block has only one layer, we identify a unique optimal parametrization, called Depth-μP that extends μP and show empirically it admits depthwise hyperparameter transfer. We identify feature diversity as a crucial factor in deep networks, and Depth-μP can be characterized as maximizing both feature learning and feature diversity. Exploiting this, we find that absolute value, among all homogeneous nonlinearities, maximizes feature diversity and indeed empirically leads to significantly better performance. However, if each block is deeper (such as modern transformers), then we find fundamental limitations in all possible infinite-depth limits of such parametrizations, which we illustrate both theoretically and empirically on simple networks as well as Megatron transformer trained on Common Crawl.
  
Interesting, great to see this line of work continued, muP was great, now Depth-muP

 We provide full local inference in browser, by using libraries from Hugging Face like transformers.js or candle for WASM inference.
 We have supported several small models, the latest one being Phi-1.5, the 1.3B model that beat Llama 2 7b!
 As Microsoft’s researchers mentioned in their paper, the model often produces incorrect code and statements. They are just suggestions, and this model is not trained for instruction tuning, so it might be harder to use than regular chat. More info on their model card (https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-1_5).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LLMs keep getting more capable at generating natural language. But there's always room for improving the quality and alignment of their responses.
 Typically this requires lots of human effort to collect more training data. So researchers are exploring ways for models to self-improve without human involvement.
 Many methods use prompting - giving the LLM instructions to critique and refine its responses. But coming up with comprehensive prompts is challenging.
 The new approach proposed, called PIT, lets models learn self-improvement implicitly from human preference data instead. It reformulates reinforcement learning to maximize the gap between an original response and improved response conditioned on the original.
 This taps into the implicit guidance in the preference data on what constitutes better quality, so no manual rubrics are needed. PIT uses curriculum reinforcement learning - first improving easy references, then switching to the LLM's own samples.
 Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show PIT significantly outperforms prompting methods like Self-Refine. It improved response quality 7-34% across conditions without any human involvement.
 This demonstrates a promising direction for LLMs to align better with human preferences autonomously as they learn from experience. No need for human bottlenecks when expanding to new domains or underserved use cases. Very cool!
 TLDR: New method PIT enables LLMs to implicitly learn to refine themselves from human preference data, no prompts needed. Big improvement over prompting approaches.

We present a novel type of neural fields that uses general radial bases for signal representation. State-of-the-art neural fields typically rely on grid-based representations for storing local neural features and N-dimensional linear kernels for interpolating features at continuous query points. The spatial positions of their neural features are fixed on grid nodes and cannot well adapt to target signals. Our method instead builds upon general radial bases with flexible kernel position and shape, which have higher spatial adaptivity and can more closely fit target signals. To further improve the channel-wise capacity of radial basis functions, we propose to compose them with multi-frequency sinusoid functions. This technique extends a radial basis to multiple Fourier radial bases of different frequency bands without requiring extra parameters, facilitating the representation of details. Moreover, by marrying adaptive radial bases with grid-based ones, our hybrid combination inherits both adaptivity and interpolation smoothness. We carefully designed weighting schemes to let radial bases adapt to different types of signals effectively. Our experiments on 2D image and 3D signed distance field representation demonstrate the higher accuracy and compactness of our method than prior arts. When applied to neural radiance field reconstruction, our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality, with small model size and comparable training speed.

Typical deep learning models for computer vision, like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViT), process signals assuming planar (flat) spaces. For example, digital images are represented as a grid of pixels on a plane. However, this type of data makes up only a fraction of the data we encounter in scientific applications. Variables sampled from the Earth's atmosphere, like temperature and humidity, are naturally represented on the sphere. Some kinds of cosmological data and panoramic photos are also spherical signals, and are better treated as such. 



Using methods designed for planar images to process spherical signals is problematic for a couple of reasons. Firs…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[About a week ago, I submitted my first paper into one of the most prestigious Machine Learning conferences out there. This was a last minute submission, and my supervisor and I were working on it simultaneously until the very last moment.
 Sadly, my supervisor committed an error when writing the mathematical definition of a certain set, slightly changing its meaning. This change, even though small, changes the definition in such a way that the subsequent theorem and its proof isn't formally correct anymore, as it assumes the original definition of the set, not the new one.
 How much will this affect the decision of accepting or rejecting my paper?
 The whole method, results and consequences are still the same, no matter this definition. It's more a problem of a "formal" nature (here "formal" as a word in the mathematical sense). 
 Is there a other way that I can inform about this error without changing the content maybe? I know that at some point, they give a chance to edit the original paper, but I don't know if this is after the decision to accept/reject.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, a few months ago, I started developing this deep learning model, which was made purely to differentiate whether the input image is driftwood floating in water or a crocodile. To my knowledge, I leveraged the resnet50 pre-trained SoTA model to train my deep learning model, and for that, I downloaded almost 5k images of driftwood and crocodiles for my model training. Once the training was complete, I took the next step and deployed my model on the Hugging Face Spaces app, allowing my friends to put it to the test. But here's where I ran into a significant challenge: users could even upload their own selfies, and my model would attempt to predict whether they were a crocodile or a piece of driftwood!
 So how can I leverage object detection or the image segmentation pipeline so that when the user inputs their image, it tries to detect the object from the photo and then detect whether the detected object from the given image contains a crocodile or not? If the crocodile or driftwood is not found then it should return "No object found" or like that.

 Funnily, I recently found some vulnerabilities in the evaluation protocol, and if we exploit these vulnerabilities, we can get the highest score on the benchmark.

This shift is expected to have a profound effect on economies, particularly in countries like India and the Philippines where call centers provide millions of jobs.
 
While some argue that AI will provide support to remaining call center workers and improve job satisfaction, others warn that it could lead to job losses and a need for workforce adaptation.
 
The use of AI software tools in call centers has shown potential for improving productivity and customer satisfaction.

Recommendations to improve gender balance include improving recruitment, monitoring investment practices, and diversifying the ecosystem.
 
There is an increasing demand for generative AI products, with leading tech companies investing heavily.
 
Gender diversity gaps and uneven progress rates for ethnic and racial groups are observed across investment firms.
 
AI products have shown biases, such as passport checkers working less efficiently with darker skin and tools reinforcing gender stereotypes.
 
In 2019, a UN agency found that assigning female genders to digital assistants like Siri and Alexa perpetuated harmful gender biases.

 I wanted to ask in case anybody knows, if there's any recent updated documentation, because the farama foundation on GIthub which is probably responsible for maintaining the Metaworld, has outdated code and documentation. (for example, presented code on Github's README has the command env.step(a) which returns 4 values instead of 5 that newer version outputs).
 From what I understand, they gather contributors for a big push regarding code and documentation on GItHub, where they will make up things up to date again but this announcement was 7 months ago.
 Sorry for the potentially wrong format of this question-post, I'm relatively new to reddit.
 I would appreciate any further knowledge on this topic and thanks everyone who's taking the time to read it!

 Currently, I am working on a project around music emotion classifcation/regression model. Basically I am trying to predict a score to each emotion on a given song.
 The problem is that my dataset has quite imbalanced scores (y). Most scores are centered around a certain score range. Therefore, having difficulties predicting scores that are further away of the mean values.
 I had this idea to bring in pre-trained (on other datasets and problems) audio classification models into this as there are a bunch of good performing pre-trained classification models out there already. The prediction of these pre-trained models should be used as features (e.g. prediction of genre, instrument etc) beside the original spectorgram in my model.
 I know this won't solve the problem of imbalances in the scores but I thought maybe this could improve the performance as the model would have more features to work with.
 Does this make sense?
 I appreciate any input.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 We used our opensource library SheepRL 🐑 and our PyTorch implementation of DreamerV3 on Crafter, an open-world survival game, featuring randomly generated 2D worlds, in which players have the freedom to explore a large and expansive map and need to forage for food, collect materials, build tools and find shelter. Here is a short video 👉 https://youtu.be/7XEBT2msUUQ
 In open-world games, ensuring they are playable and bug-free is crucial, but is becoming increasingly difficult and time-consuming using manual game testing. Maximizing exploration using Reinforcement Learning is extremely useful for testing games at scale, because of the wide variety of gameplay scenes the player may encounter.
 Why is the test on Crafter so interesting for game testing?
 Because Crafter evaluates a large number of general capabilities related to the RL agent, like strong ability to generalise (new generated maps for each episode), to deal with partial observability (each input image reveals only a small part of the world) and to long-term reasoning and survival.
 These abilities are very useful for testing games at scale, providing developers with insights to optimise gameplay and player experience.
 The future of game testing is here, and it is powered by Artificial Intelligence! 🔥

 My Assumptions On Solving This Problem:
 - Discrete is subspace of continuous, thus continuous algorithms will be able to handle discrete action spaces as well.
 - A non-hybrid action-space algorithm will be simpler than hybrid-action-space algorithms.

 Method (I'm only describing the discrete action here):
 - Use TD3 as the training algorithm. No modification from the original training code. TD3 algorithm has been verified on Pendulum and other environments created for unit test purposes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Video game voice actors are prepared to go on strike over the use of AI in game development.
 
The current contract negotiations between the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) and video game companies have stalled, with the major issues being pay raises and the use of AI to alter or generate actors' performances.
 
SAG-AFTRA wants protections for its members to ensure their work is not stolen or replaced by AI.
 
If negotiations don't progress, voice actors, stunt artists, and motion capture performers could potentially go on strike, leading to delays in game releases and recasting of beloved performers.
 
The voice actors' strike in 2016 resulted in improvements to pay, and now they are prepared to strike again to fight for their rights.
 
Video game performances are often seen as assets to be extracted and inserted into games, rather than recognizing the humanity and quality of life of the performers.
 
The use of AI in game development raises concerns about how companies will use advances in generative AI to steal work or put performers out of a job.
 
SAG-AFTRA wants transparency, consent, and compensation when it comes to the use of AI in games.
 
Members of SAG-AFTRA have voted in favor of authorizing a strike, meaning voice actors, stunt artists, and motion capture performers could potentially join the picket line if negotiations don't progress.
 
The strike could lead to delays in upcoming game releases and the recasting of performers if companies refuse to meet the union's demands.
 
The fight for voice actors' rights is an existential one, as they want to retain the rights to their own voices and images and achieve wages that keep up with inflation

 I am quite interested in understanding what are the feedback from the community in terms of interface to leverage LLMs for code productivity.
 Because LLMs tend to do mistake I have mostly used Chat-like interfaces, like ChatGPT, as they allow to interact with the model and converge to a conclusion. 
 I haven't used Copilot for a while but my feeling was that it could do some boilerplate correctly but then it quickly started suggesting code that would be misleading and could actually hurt productivity.
 It might have changed since then but that was my feeling back then.
 What is your favorite option and why?

Usually in ML classification such as the IRIS dataset, each row represents a sample and each column a parameter, right ! My problem is that my ML classification parameters have to be derived from a range of values (parent data). I have taken mean of the parent values to generate the parameters for the ML input data. This results in lower classification accuracies using Random forest and XGBoost.
 Has anyone encountered a similar situation like this where the data has to be generated from a range of other datasets? Is there any other way to do this? I did not find any papers or articles from the web so just asking.
 I can generate additional parameters from other statistics such as median, standard deviation etc. which can improve the classification accuracy but can make interpretation of the results a little weird, domain wise. I wish to avoid this if possible.

 Right now I am trying to get it to work with this gym https://github.com/zach-lawless/gym-wordle, and I will make my tweaks later. This gym has a multi discrete action space, which makes sense to me for a word, IDK if thats best. To validate words, it has its own exception type. I am trying to train this with stable_baselines3, but the exception keeps being raised, since it is trying to guess garbled words like "xcjhr". 
 Is there a way I can validate actions before they are made so the model is restricted to only guessing valid words? Is there a better way to do this? It doesnt need to be the best, it really only has to sorta work. Any help is appreciated, thanks!

 Paper: https://robotics-transformer-x.github.io/paper.pdf
 Abstract:
  
Large, high-capacity models trained on diverse datasets have shown remarkable successes on efficiently tackling downstream applications. In domains from NLP to Computer Vision, this has led to a consolidation of pretrained models, with general pretrained backbones serving as a starting point for many applications. Can such a consolidation happen in robotics? Conventionally, robotic learning methods train a separate model for every application, every robot, and even every environment. Can we instead train “generalist” X-robot policy that can be adapted efficiently to new robots, tasks, and environments? In this paper, we provide datasets in standardized data formats and models to make it possible to explore this possibility in the context of robotic manipulation, alongside experimental results that provide an example of effective X-robot policies. We assemble a dataset from 22 different robots collected through a collaboration between 21 institutions, demonstrating 527 skills (160266 tasks). We show that a high-capacity model trained on this data, which we call RT-X, exhibits positive transfer and improves the capabilities of multiple robots by leveraging experience from other platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ByteDance and the University of Illinois researchers have developed an improved benchmark suite with consistent parameters, called GPT-Fathom, that indicates GPT-4, the engine behind the paid version of ChatGPT, significantly outperforms leading LLMs, including its biggest competitor, Claude 2.
 For the latest advancements in AI, look here first.
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/v4fo8zser0sb1.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e29fe9ac1af3efcb936ee61e9202717eed7e702
 GPT-Fathom's breakthrough
  
The new benchmark suite, GPT-Fathom, addresses consistent settings issues and prompt sensitivity, attempting to reduce inconsistencies in LLM evaluation.
 In a comparison using GPT-Fathom, GPT-4 outperformed over ten leading LLMs, crushing the competition in most benchmarks, and showing significant performance leaps from GPT-3 to its successors.
  
Performance specifics
  
The gap in performance was especially pronounced against Claude 2, ChatGPT's biggest rival.
 GPT-4's Advanced Data Analysis model exhibited superior performance in coding, giving it an edge as compared to LuckLlama 2, the current best-performing open-source model.
 Llama 2-70B showed comparable or better performance than gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 in safety and comprehension but displayed worse performance in "Mathematics", "Coding", and "Multilingualism".
  
The seesaw effect
  
The research team noted a 'seesaw effect' where an improvement in one area can lead to degradation in another.
 For instance, GPT-4 saw a performance drop on the Mathematical Geometry Simple Math (MGSM) benchmark, despite improving its performance significantly on the text comprehension benchmark DROP.

 I'm debating turning my old desktop (old CPU but relatively new GPU 3980 or 90) into a ML box that I can remote into. I'm sure people here have done something similar and I was wondering if anyone could point me towards some resources for getting it off the ground/any pitfalls to avoid/suggestions. 
 I'm an active data scientist researcher for my job and this would just be for fun side projects but I have some pretty glaring holes in my knowledge of computers (like the best way to set this up - should I uninstall windows install unbuntu or is windows fine?) 
 Honestly I'm sure my ignorance will be pretty apparent from the questions I'm asking/not asking so any advice anyone has would be welcome! 
 Thanks! Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this sort of thing.

 I'm a total beginner in the reinforcement learning (RL) community, and I would appreciate some advice on a problem I'm currently facing. I've created a simple 2D turn-based game with only movement at the moment (I will also add combat features when I have success with training an AI for the movements).
 Game
 The rules are simple :
  
A grid of 14x40 (560 cells in total)
 1 Agent with a limited number of Move Point (MP) 
 1 Target that does not move (atm)
 The agent can end its turn to get its MP back
  
I already implemented a pathfinding algorithm using A* which works really well but I would like to train an AI to reach the target as fast as possible (turn-wise).
 Here is a simulation of a state :

 Break-A-Scene: Given a single image with multiple concepts, annotated by loose segmentation masks, our method can learn a distinct token for each concept, and use natural language guidance to re-synthesize the individual concepts or combinations of them in various contexts.
 Project Page: https://omriavrahami.com/break-a-scene/
 Code is publicly released!
 Abstract
  
Text-to-image model personalization aims to introduce a user-provided concept to the model, allowing its synthesis in diverse contexts. However, current methods primarily focus on the case of learning a single concept from multiple images with variations in backgrounds and poses, and struggle when adapted to a different scenario. In this work, we introduce the task of textual scene decomposition: given a single image of a scene that may contain several concepts, we aim to extract a distinct text token for each concept, enabling fine-grained control over the generated scenes. To this end, we propose augmenting the input image with masks that indicate the presence of target concepts. These masks can be provided by the user or generated automatically by a pre-trained segmentation model. We then present a novel two-phase customization process that optimizes a set of dedicated textual embeddings (handles), as well as the model weights, striking a delicate balance between accurately capturing the concepts and avoiding overfitting. We employ a masked diffusion loss to enable handles to generate their assigned concepts, complemented by a novel loss on cross-attention maps to prevent entanglement. We also introduce union-sampling, a training strategy aimed to improve the ability of combining multiple concepts in generated images. We use several automatic metrics to quantitatively compare our method against several baselines, and further affirm the results using a user study. Finally, we showcase several applications of our method.

 By visualizing the attention maps, the researchers noticed LLMs heavily attend initial tokens as "attention sinks" even if meaningless. This anchors the distribution.
 They realized evicting these sink tokens causes the attention scores to get warped, destabilizing predictions.
 Their proposed "StreamingLLM" method simply caches a few initial sink tokens plus recent ones. This tweaks LLMs to handle crazy long texts. Models tuned with StreamingLLM smoothly processed sequences with millions of tokens, and were up to 22x faster than other approaches. 
 Even cooler - adding a special "[Sink Token]" during pre-training further improved streaming ability. The model just used that single token as the anchor. I think the abstract says it best:
  
We introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence length without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more.
  
TLDR: LLMs break on long convos. Researchers found they cling to initial tokens as attention sinks. Caching those tokens lets LLMs chat infinitely.

 My friends and I are taking a Data Science course in our university. We are modestly versed in ML/DL techniques, and want to use everything we know on a really good capstone project for this course. We are looking for a dataset where we can demonstrate a nice variety of techniques to really blow the socks off our Professor. 
 Ideally we'd like this to be stemming from something basic that most would consider "Data Science", as in something with a tabular dataset and elements of classification. Though we still want chances to bring in what we know from outside the course: for example, if there's images to supplement the dataset we could use Image Classification models or something multimodal to bring in more features, if there's natural language data then we could use LLMs to extract salient features etc. More importantly though, we want something whose exploration can be really motivated so it doesn't seem we're only in it for the ML aspect.
 Thank you!

 Are academic minions (i.e. PhD students) doing all the heavy lifting? Or maybe some highly efficient workflows I'm not privy to?
 On a more serious note, I would like a career in ML, and the sheer volume and pace of these publications is making me feel a bit disheartened.
 How is this prolificity possible? Any words of encouragement or advice?

 GitHub: https://github.com/SerCeMan/fontogen
 Weights: https://huggingface.co/SerCe/fontogen
 Blog post with more details: https://serce.me/posts/02-10-2023-hey-computer-make-me-a-font
 The project is largely an exploration of whether generating fonts natively, line by line, is possible. I'm not aware of any previous research that would achieve the same results for complete fonts previously. This is my first ML-specific project, and I would appreciate any feedback on the model architecture, and I'm also happy to answer any questions you may have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crowdfunding site BackerKit has announced a new policy that restricts the use of solely AI-generated content on its platform.
 
The policy aims to address concerns regarding ownership of content, ethical sourcing of data, and compensation for the process of creating content.
 
Projects that lack a minimum requirement of human input will not be allowed to crowdfund on the BackerKit site.
 
There is some flexibility with AI generative fill and the use of AI transcription services, but a high level of human input is required to satisfy the policy.
 
BackerKit will automatically exclude all content uploaded by creators for their projects from AI training in support of this policy.
 
The new restrictions will go into effect on October 4, giving creators time to alter their projects if they are using AI-generated images and text.

These models yield very good results, but more importantly they are very easy to use as I have always captioned my images as one would use natural spoken language (no weird booru tags and all that jazz). The most labor intensive processes in the workflow is image captioning. For example, my last project had almost 10000 images in the data set. Every single image was manually captioned by me as the quality of all automated solutions I tried is subpar and has too many accuracy issues. I have tried Blip auto captioning and LLava, but they still were not accurate enough for what I needed. I am hoping someone here can suggest a solution, if one exists, thanks.

 So far, I've hit limits for Chroma (41,666 max). I've also tried Redis, QDrant and FAISS - each of these gets so large that it eats up all the RAM and the process gets killed, or with QDrant, just errors out.
 I've used Pinecone before, but I don't really want to pay for a prototype as I have plenty of disk space.
 I was thinking of chunking the 3 million documents into local vector stores of size 41,666 using ChromaDB - but there isn't a whole lot out there about whether Chroma would allow me to merge all ~70 of these smaller databases into a bigger one for search. I also cannot find whether it would be possible to load all 70 of these into memory and search each one individually.
 So what are my options?
 My other thought was just creating a large Doc2Vec model, however I would like to use something more sophisticated like Huggingface embedding models.

 I am struggling with prooving convergence for an optimizer which uses adaptive step-size with heavy ball algorithm for convex and non-convex functions. In some literature, I could find a regret bound analysis/proof for convex functions and proving that the estimated gradient at t -> inf goes to zero for non-convex functions. 
 There are some assumptions and preconditions:
  
The algorithm is heavy ball momentum with adaptive step-size. '
 X_(k+1) = X_k - \eta_k . \nabla(f(x_k)) + \beta(x_k - x_(k-1))
 
The following assumptions are made: 
  
A. The function is smooth. B. The function is Lipschitz. C. The gradients are Lipschitz. 
 I attempt to prove the convergence to a critical point or a local minima. Where the estimate of the gradients at any instance k goes to zero. i.e. E[\nabla(f(x_k))] = 0 as t -> inf. 
 Could anyone please guide me through the process of convergence proof for non-convex functions or give me literature recommendations for the same.
 Thank you very much in advance.

 Context:
 I have DICOM images which I already extracted the useful meta-data I want to use.
 Those images are for a task, classification-detection pipeline of some disease.
 So as I already asked, what are the benefits of converting those DICOM files to PNG's rather then just using pydicom and the dicom pixel_array?
 Reason I ask this is because I saw many top 5 users on kaggle do this when dealing with DICOM images.
 If I understand how networks actually works, they get as input an array of pixels as floating point numbers no? So what's the differences between DICOM pixel_array to PNG's pixel array and numpy array or tensor? both are eventually will be fed to the network as a tensor of floating numbers.
 Is the reason is because PNG's are usually faster to train?
 Is the reason is because PNG's have more libraries support for preprocessing / augmentation / etc. ?
 Is the reason is because PNG's are the format many pre-trained models expect to? (I write this knowing it's 99% not true, as mentioned the tensor thing)
 Thanks in Advance, and Please, forgive my English (I could use AI tools to fix it but I feel addicted already)

 Abstract:
  
Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications such as multi-round dialogue, where long interactions are expected, is urgently needed but poses two major challenges. Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of wind…]]></summary>

While AI may outperform humans in certain tasks, humans are not yet headed for all-out replacement.
 
Recent research shows that AI programs scored higher than humans in tasks requiring originality, but the highest-rated human ideas were still considered more creative.
 
The rise of generative AI tools in industries like animation has left some professionals anxious about the future of their work.
 
Experts suggest managing AI fears by understanding the historical context of technological advancements and focusing on the benefits and training opportunities that AI brings.

I hope this greatly speeds up the process of extracting features from models for further analysis, and also serves as an aid in quickly understanding new models. I also hope it'd be helpful for teaching purposes, too. It is meant to work for any PyTorch model whatsoever and I've tested it on hundreds of models (see the "model menagerie" of visualizations below), though it's always possible I've missed some edge case or another.
 Hope it helps you out--I'm still actively developing it, so let me know if there's anything on your wishlist!

However, transformers don't have this kind of inductive bias, and as a result, take much more data and compute to reach similar levels of performance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When trying to get language models to solve complex math problems, researchers kept running into limits. Models like GPT-3 and ChatGPT still struggle with advanced algebra, calculus, and geometry questions. The math is just too abstract and symbol-heavy for them.
 To break through this barrier, researchers from Tsinghua University and Microsoft taught models to combine natural language reasoning with calling external math tools.
 The key is their new "tool-integrated reasoning" format. Models generate a natural language plan first, then write code to invoke tools like SymPy to solve equations. They take the output results and continue verbal reasoning.
 By interleaving natural language and symbolic computations, they get the best of both worlds - semantic understanding from language models and rigorous math from tools.
 They trained versions of the LLaMA model this way, producing their Tool-Integrated Reasoning Agent (TORA). They present some strong results:
  
In evaluations on 10 math datasets, TORA substantially outperformed prior state-of-the-art methods, achieving 13-19% higher accuracy on average.
 On one competition test, TORA-7B scored 40% accuracy, beating the previous best model by 22 percentage points.
  
This demonstrates that integrating tools directly into the reasoning process can significantly enhance mathematical capabilities, even for large models like GPT-4.
 However, tough problems involving geometry and advanced algebra are still there. New techniques for symbolic reasoning and spatial understanding will likely be needed to push further.
 Overall though, tool integration seems a promising path to improve reasoning skills. Applying this to other domains like logic and programming could also be impactful.
 TLDR: Teaching language models to use math tools helps them solve way more complex problems.

 Invest heavily in AI ethics research and development.** For example, Google AI has launched the Responsible AI Research and Development (RAIR) program, which is focused on developing new AI ethics research and tools.
 Create large-scale datasets of human moral reasoning.** For example, OpenAI has released the Moral Machine dataset, which contains over 1 million crowdsourced responses to moral dilemmas.
 Develop new AI architectures that are specifically designed for moral reasoning.** For example, Anthropic is developing a new AI architecture called "Moral Machine Learning," which is designed to learn from human moral reasoning data.
 Establish a global AI ethics research consortium and create a public database of human moral reasoning datasets.** For example, the Partnership on AI has launched the Safeguarding AI initiative, which is working to develop new safety mechanisms for AI systems.
 Fund research into developing new AI architectures for moral reasoning and develop new AI evaluation metrics for moral performance.** For example, the Moral Machine project is developing new evaluation metrics for AI systems' moral performance.
 By working together, Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and other developers can help to fast-track AI morality and create AI systems that are more moral than humans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We developed a statistical model to estimate “How many unique identities can a generative face model generate?” without exhaustively generating a lot of faces.
 Abstract: There has been tremendous progress in generating realistic faces with high fidelity over the past few years. Despite this progress, a crucial question remains unanswered: “Given a generative face model, how many unique identities can it generate?” In other words, what is the biometric capacity of the generative face model? A scientific basis for answering this question will benefit evaluating and comparing different generative face models and establish an upper bound on their scalability. This paper proposes a statistical approach to estimate the biometric capacity of generated face images in a hyperspherical feature space. We employ our approach on multiple generative models, including unconditional generators like StyleGAN, Latent Diffusion Model, and “Generated Photos,” as well as DCFace, a class-conditional generator. We also estimate capacity w.r.t. demographic attributes such as gender and age. Our capacity estimates indicate that (a) under ArcFace representation at a false acceptance rate (FAR) of 0.1%, StyleGAN3 and DCFace have a capacity upper bound of 1.43 million and 11,900, respectively; (b) the capacity reduces drastically as we lower the desired FAR with an estimate of 17,960 and 562 at FAR of 1% and 10%, respectively, for StyleGAN3; (c) there is no discernible disparity in the capacity w.r.t gender; and (d) for some generative models, there is an appreciable disparity in the capacity w.r.t age.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If I already have a trained reward model, say a sentiment classification model, that I'd like to use for PPO-based RLHF, I believe the standard method would be to instantiate the Critic/value function using the reward model, and train it further during PPO, correct?
 Would it even make sense to try PPO for RLHF without using the GAE term and thus without the value function, and just directly using the reward model's output as the advantage?
 It seems that this would be require viewing the entire generation as a single action (rather than each token's generation as an action), but most of the articles I've read on RLHF seem to treat it that way. On the other hand, all the code implementations I've seen have an Actor-Critic model producing values at each token, which I think implies that each token is an action.
 Edit: Apologies if any of this is just me having fundamental gaps in my understanding!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a machine learning engineer and researcher. I got fed up with how difficult it is to understand why neural networks behave the way they do, so i wrote a library to help with it.
 Comgra (computation graph analysis) is a library you can use with pytorch to extract all the tensor data you care about and visualize it graphically in a browser.
 This allows for a much more detailed analysis of what is happening than the usual approach of using tensorboard. You can go investigate tensors as training proceeds, drill down into individual neurons, inspect single data sets that are of special interest to you, track gradients, compare statistics between different training runs, and more.
 This tool has saved me a ton of time in my research by letting me check my hypotheses much more quickly than normal and by helping me understand how the different parts of my network really interact.
 I first published this a month ago and have made some improvements since then. I would be happy to hear even more feedback!
 My goal is to make this the go-to library used both by novices who want to understand what's going on under the hood, and by researchers in neural architecture design.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I am trying to find NE using rl algorithms for a turn based deterministic graph pursuit game. I have a way of checking if the strategies of players 1,2,3 are a NE and thought of using Q-Learning and see if it converges to a NE. Thus far it doesnt seem to work and I wonder if I made a mistake.
 The state is described as: St = [x1 x2 x3 p] where current player is p and x1,x2,x3 are the locations of the players in the graph
 Players have value functions Q^1(St), Q^2(St), Q^3(St)
 The way I update my value function is:
 player i choose e-greedy action a_t and the new state St_new
 Q^i(St) = (1-alpha)*Q^i(St)+alpha*gamma*Q(St_new)
 I have tried using a memory buffer but I havent improve the convergence success. I check if the if the values are a NE every 1000 iterations. It only converges for simple graphs.
 Do you think the way I update my value function is correct? Do you have any other traditional algorithms to suggest? Shall I move to deep learning? I am worried if simple algorithms cant converge the neural networks wont either... 
 I tried to implemenet Nash Q learning following the paper:https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume4/hu03a/hu03a.pdf
 but I am not sure if implemented correctly for a turn based game

 Youtube: https://youtu.be/Q0pP782dSh0?si=MiJAlK5k-KEyQ-Zr 
 Abstract:
  
Large multimodal models (LMMs) extend large language models (LLMs) with multi-sensory skills, such as visual understanding, to achieve stronger generic intelligence. In this paper, we analyze the latest model, GPT-4V(ision), to deepen the understanding of LMMs. The analysis focuses on the intriguing tasks that GPT-4V can perform, containing test samples to probe the quality and genericity of GPT-4V's capabilities, its supported inputs and working modes, and the effective ways to prompt the model. In our approach to exploring GPT-4V, we curate and organize a collection of carefully designed qualitative samples spanning a variety of domains and tasks. Observations from these samples demonstrate that GPT-4V's unprecedented ability in processing arbitrarily interleaved multimodal inputs and the genericity of its capabilities together make GPT-4V a powerful multimodal generalist system. Furthermore, GPT-4V's unique capability of understanding visual markers drawn on input images can give rise to new human-computer interaction methods such as visual referring prompting. We conclude the report with in-depth discussions on the emerging application scenarios and the future research directions for GPT-4V-based systems. We hope that this preliminary exploration will inspire future research on the next-generation multimodal task formulation, new ways to exploit and enhance LMMs to solve real-world problems, and gaining better understanding of multimodal foundation models.

As an enhancement of the original Llama 2, Llama 2 Long deals with larger data containing longer texts and is modified to handle lengthier information sequences.
 Its stellar performance outshines other models such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and Claude 2.
  
How Llama 2 Long works
  
Meta built different versions of Llama 2, ranging from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters, which refines its learning from data.
 Llama 2 Long employs Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) technique, refining the way it encodes the position of each token, allowing fewer data and memory to produce precise responses.
 The model further fine-tunes its performance using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and synthetic data generated by Llama 2 chat itself.
  
Impressive feats and future aspirations
  
Llama 2 Long can create high-quality responses to user prompts up to 200,000 characters long, which is approximately 40 pages of text.
 Its ability to generate responses to queries on diverse topics such as history, science, literature, and sports indicates its potential to cater to complex and various user needs.
 The researchers see Llama 2 Long as a step towards broader, more adaptable AI models, and advocate for more research and dialogue to harness these models responsibly and beneficially.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If an AI were to take on this task, it would primarily rely on data mining and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. First, the AI would scrape digital platforms to collect works authored by various people. Platforms could range from academic databases like PubMed or ArXiv to blogs, forums, and social media. The goal would be to capture a wide array of intellectual output, irrespective of the person's titles or accolades.
 Next, an NLP model would evaluate the collected content based on factors like originality, complexity, and coherence. Advanced sentiment analysis could be employed to gauge the depth of understanding and nuances in the arguments made. Specialized algorithms could also be developed to assess the impact of each piece of work, using metrics such as citations, social shares, or subsequent works that build upon it.
 The AI would then create a shortlist based on these evaluations. This stage might also involve unsupervised machine learning techniques like clustering to find patterns or commonalities among the top contenders.
 The final stage would be validation, possibly using reinforcement learning. The AI could simulate various scenarios or problems and predict how the content created by these individuals would contribute to solving them. It would then refine its list based on the simulated outcomes.
 This all-AI approach would drastically reduce human bias and could be executed relatively quickly. However, it's important to note that any such system would need to be designed carefully to avoid introducing biases present in the training data or algorithms.

In practice, as requirements become more complex, you often end up with fairly lengthy prompts, especially when using methods like RAG. I was wondering, how effective are LLMs at following instructions as the system prompt grows in size and complexity?
 I did some quick experiments on this and found that, unsurprisingly, GPT-4 can follow a lot of rules (up to 50) quite accurately. But even GPT-3.5 slowly degrades and Llama-2-70b-chat starts to fail after just a few rules.
 Comparison of performance metrics over increasing rule counts, demonstrating GPT-4's consistent performance and a decline in accuracy for GPT-3.5 and Llama-2-70b-chat.

Poor data strategy and infrastructure can derail generative AI efforts.
 
Existing issues with data ecosystems, such as data silos and poor data governance, will have a greater impact on generative AI workloads than new issues.
 
Data silos, poor data discoverability, and the lack of data interoperability can become serious bottlenecks for generative AI apps.

 Also, I don't know how they pull in the data from these sources so fast? I've played around with some things like this with Langchain with retrieval, but the speed of splitting and tokenizing website html is not very fast. Have they already pre-scrapped the websites from the search results and tokenized them for LLM retrieval?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When visualizing the inner workings of vision transformers (ViTs), researchers noticed weird spikes of attention on random background patches. This didn't make sense since the models should focus on foreground objects.
 By analyzing the output embeddings, they found a small number of tokens (2%) had super high vector norms, causing the spikes.
 The high-norm "outlier" tokens occurred in redundant areas and held less local info but more global info about the image.
 Their hypothesis is that ViTs learn to identify unimportant patches and recycle them as temporary storage instead of discarding. This enables efficient processing but causes issues.
 Their fix is simple - just add dedicated "register" tokens that provide storage space, avoiding the recycling side effects.
 Models trained with registers have:
  
Smoother and more meaningful attention maps
 Small boosts in downstream performance
 Way better object discovery abilities
  
The registers give ViTs a place to do their temporary computations without messing stuff up. Just a tiny architecture tweak improves interpretability and performance. Sweet!
 I think it's cool how they reverse-engineered this model artifact and fixed it with such a small change. More work like this will keep incrementally improving ViTs.
 TLDR: Vision transformers recycle useless patches to store data, causing problems. Adding dedicated register tokens for storage fixes it nicely.
 Full summary. Paper is here.

 I think it's cool how they reverse-engineered this model artifact and fixed it with such a small change. More work like this will keep incrementally improving ViTs.
 TLDR: Vision transformers recycle useless patches to store data, causing problems. Adding dedicated register tokens for storage fixes it nicely.
 Full summary. Paper is here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There's some evidence [1] [2] that it's possible to run text2text language model at substantially (potentially on the order of magnitude) better inference speed by keeping the decoder shallow.
 I'm curious whether some general reasoner SOTA (small model for machine translation available at [3]) style models are publicly available for this sort of thing.
 If not, how would one go about training one?
 Would it be necessary to do it entirely from scratch (extremely costly)? Or would it be possible to take, say, Flan-UL2 (20B), chop off its decoder, and train a much smaller decoder on top of it with the UL2 encoder frozen (ie how one trains adapter layers).
 Assuming the decoder hyperparameters are kept small, would this be possible within reasonable compute budget? Would that even meaningfully converge with small amount of compute (assuming same training objective as is for UL2)?
 Would the strength (ie somewhat comparable to 10B if we cut 20B in half) transfer from the SOTA encoder, or would cutting off half of the model layers kneecap it too badly?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there any notable work on duplicating layers in large feed forward models? In contrast to e.g. the brain which is essentially a directed graph most networks utilized nowerdays use a feed forward approach. E.g. transformers are able to attend to past tokens, but generate the tokens in a way where for a given token a given weight is not utilized at different stages in the feed forward pass. In my intuition this would lead to an issue where concepts (factual data as well as learned "algorithms") might be duplicated as they are needed at different depths in the generation process and are sequentially dependent on one another. This does not directly make the model less capable, as it might learn the same concept at two layers sufficiently well, but it reduces the data and parameter efficiency and and might impact generalization capabilities. Using a full on brain like graph might be hard to implement/optimize/scale on current hardware and is tricky with the backprop. But is there any work on duplicating a few layers, placing them at different depths in large models. I would guess that this would be more impactful for large models. One would essentially trade compute for better data efficiency.

These chatbots have their own faces and social media accounts, and Meta is working on giving them a voice.
 
However, experts argue that the idea of chatbots with personalities is impossible, as algorithms cannot demonstrate intention or free will.
 
There is also a risk that chatbots with personalities could express problematic opinions, as seen in Meta's testing.
 
Meta's project is driven by profit, as users are more likely to engage with chatbots that seem human.
 
Experts believe that Meta should have explained the limits of these chatbots instead of emphasizing their human characteristics.

 There are a lot of gems of knowledge hidden in these research papers, and the main motivation is simply to keep up with most impactful techniques in the field by taking the time to dive in and discuss. 
 The attendees so far have been great, and would love for anyone is interested to join!

 If I was interested in training/inferencing, for example, a 15M dense model, or a 60M MoE with 4 15M experts. whats the difference gonna be?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was cooking chicken wings one evening ago in the not too distant past and this idea popped into my head. Before the night was over I went online and bought the domain name of GoGoAIGo . com and then the .ai version also. I put the dot com version up on Sedo (sedo.com/search/details/?domain=GoGoAIGo.com) for sale and I actually now own the .com .ai .org and .net versions of that phrase. Not only my decade but the two generational decades in front of me and the one generational decade behind me can remember our ole Inspector Gadget friend whom had a similar phrase, but not exact, that he would say.
 I'm an individual whom may hold onto something if I feel it has intrinsic value for a future development, which I think this can if laid out in an appropriate fashion. I'm working on another business project right now and I own some trademarks for my other business project so I'm not exactly a newbie in ways here I'm just kind of fresh to the AI realm studies. I think it's overblown right now but will be fine tuned over the next 5-7 years better and society will find a better seat for it.
 I could see this domain being like a search engine or something, maybe even something to do with robots. I expect AI robots moving forward will be regulated and have various classes that they are placed into as we integrate certain ones in our society. Let's be honest, the light-switch isn't flipping overnight or even in one quick year over this AI stuff. I'm in no rush to have a piece of AI wash my dishes for me to be honest. The last robotic thing I was thinking about getting was a robot mower to cut a field, I believe they are working on those now.
 Anybody have any unique ideas for me? I used to play with lego robots way back in high school in the early 2000's.... Seems like this website would make a great search engine but honestly there are other phrases that can be put into play with society also.
 Thanks for any mental stimulation you can toss in my direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Imagine an app that's like a helpful buddy in your pocket, always looking out for the best moments to nudge you into some real-world socializing. For example, say you're a fan of watching sports. The app notices you frequently check scores or read articles on sports sites during weekends. Right before a big game, it pops up and says, "How about inviting some friends over to watch the game?"
 Now let's talk about making socializing a sort of game. Think of the way Fitbit rewards you for walking 10,000 steps. Similarly, this app could reward you with "social points" for various activities. Invite a friend for coffee? 10 points. Call your mom? 15 points. Organize a barbecue? 50 points. And so on. These points could unlock virtual badges or even real-world rewards like discounts at local restaurants to encourage you to keep going.
 When it comes to setting personal goals, let's say you've been wanting to improve your relationship with a sibling. You set a goal in the app to have at least one meaningful conversation with them each week. The app then reminds you on a lazy Sunday afternoon, suggesting, "Why not call your sister now? It’s a good time to catch up."
 And for reflection, after you've hung out with your friends to watch the game or had that talk with your sister, the app asks you to rate how good you felt on a scale of 1-10. Over time, you'll see a graph of your happiness levels correlated with your social activities, making it super clear that quality time with people is a mood booster.
 The whole idea is to keep it simple but effective, helping you to naturally weave more social interactions into your life without making you feel overwhelmed or stressed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m new to AI/ML and my understanding is that (1) LLMs are SOTA in many tasks, and their short comings, such as ~70% accuracy, hallucinations, inability to learn from small samples etc, are well known. (2) Neuro-symbolic approaches are apparently the way to get accuracy to 100% and solve other shortcomings.
 So question is (3) What are the promising research in LLMs+Symbolic architectures? (4) And how close is it to production, rather than academic? (5) Do we need non-LLM based architectures instead?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI has the potential to be a platform shift, similar to previous shifts like personal computers, the internet, and mobile.
 
Platform shifts change the dominant layer that applications are built on and can capture the majority of value from the previous generation.
 
AI could change distribution, business models, and what's possible in workflows.
 
Changes in distribution could lead to new aggregators replacing old ones, making the aggregation of quality content more difficult.
 
The business model may not change significantly, with AI likely being delivered as software-as-a-service.
 
AI can enable new workflows and drastically change existing ones.
 
While incumbents may accrue significant value, new platforms could also replace old ones.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It seems that large language models are getting bigger and bigger, and by growing they need more and more processing power.
 I know that some LLM developers have made smaller versions to test how small they can be made and function.
 But what happens when you want a LLM to do a specific job, surely it only needs a fraction of the data a general-purpose model does.
 Potential benefits of SLMs:
  
Less data.
 Potentially faster.
 Less space to hallucinate/go wrong.
 Smaller set of potentials for complete testing.
 Running costs reduced.
 Lower spec hardware needs.
  
Has anyone tried dedicating a LLM to a specific job/task and then optimizing its data size to create a SLM?
 TLDR; How large does a LLM have to be for a toaster or microwave?

 Philosophically what do you believe is going to happen to our paradigms of reality over the coming years? 
 This is an especially challenging thought because we consume so much content and information digitally. I'm a little worried about how humans will or will not adjust to this incoming technology. I'm having my first child soon and it's interesting to think about what I may have to teach them. That nothing you consume digitally is real, only what you can experience with all 5 senses in your local environment is. Strange thoughts to be having for sure.

in terms of signed volumes of triangles and parallelotopes generated by data

if multiple geographically distributed agents perform their separate RL tasks
cooperatively. Different from multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) where
multiple agents are in a common environment and should learn to cooperate or
compete with each other, in this case each agent has its separate environment
and only communicates with others to share knowledge without any cooperative or
competitive behaviour as a learning outcome. In fact, this scenario exists
widely in real life whose concept can be utilised in many applications, but is
not well understood yet and not well formulated. As the first effort, we
propose group-agent system for RL as a formulation of this scenario and the
third type of RL system with respect to single-agent and multi-agent systems.
We then propose a distributed RL framework called DDAL (Decentralised
Distributed Asynchronous Learning) designed for group-agent reinforcement
learning (GARL). We show through experiments that DDAL achieved desirable

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Classifiers built upon vision-language models such as CLIP have shown
remarkable zero-shot performance across a broad range of image classification
tasks. Prior work has studied different ways of automatically creating
descriptor sets for every class based on prompt templates, ranging from
manually engineered templates over templates obtained from a large language
model to templates built from random words and characters. In contrast,
deriving zero-shot classifiers from the respective encoded class descriptors
has remained nearly unchanged, that is: classify to the class that maximizes
the cosine similarity between its averaged encoded class descriptors and the
encoded image. However, weighting all class descriptors equally can be
suboptimal when certain descriptors match visual clues on a given image better
than others. In this work, we propose AutoCLIP, a method for auto-tuning
zero-shot classifiers. AutoCLIP assigns to each prompt template per-image
weights, which are derived from statistics of class descriptor-image
similarities at inference time. AutoCLIP is fully unsupervised, has very low
overhead, and can be easily implemented in few lines of code. We show that for
a broad range of vision-language models, datasets, and prompt templates,
AutoCLIP outperforms baselines consistently and by up to 3 percent point
accuracy.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Compositional generalization is a key ability of humans that enables us to
learn new concepts from only a handful examples. Machine learning models,
including the now ubiquitous transformers, struggle to generalize in this way,
and typically require thousands of examples of a concept during training in
order to generalize meaningfully. This difference in ability between humans and
artificial neural architectures, motivates this study on a neuro-symbolic
architecture called the Compositional Program Generator (CPG). CPG has three
key features: modularity, type abstraction, and recursive composition, that
enable it to generalize both systematically to new concepts in a few-shot
manner, as well as productively by length on various sequence-to-sequence
language tasks. For each input, CPG uses a grammar of the input domain and a
parser to generate a type hierarchy in which each grammar rule is assigned its
own unique semantic module, a probabilistic copy or substitution program.
Instances with the same hierarchy are processed with the same composed program,
while those with different hierarchies may be processed with different
programs. CPG learns parameters for the semantic modules and is able to learn
the semantics for new types incrementally. Given a context-free grammar of the
input language and a dictionary mapping each word in the source language to its
interpretation in the output language, CPG can achieve perfect generalization
on the SCAN and COGS benchmarks, in both standard and extreme few-shot
settings.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a promising approach for training deep
classification models using labeled and unlabeled datasets. However, existing
SSL methods rely on a large unlabeled dataset, which may not always be
available in many real-world applications due to legal constraints (e.g.,
GDPR). In this paper, we investigate the research question: Can we train SSL
models without real unlabeled datasets? Instead of using real unlabeled
datasets, we propose an SSL method using synthetic datasets generated from
generative foundation models trained on datasets containing millions of samples
in diverse domains (e.g., ImageNet). Our main concepts are identifying
synthetic samples that emulate unlabeled samples from generative foundation
models and training classifiers using these synthetic samples. To achieve this,
our method is formulated as an alternating optimization problem: (i)
meta-learning of generative foundation models and (ii) SSL of classifiers using
real labeled and synthetic unlabeled samples. For (i), we propose a
meta-learning objective that optimizes latent variables to generate samples
that resemble real labeled samples and minimize the validation loss. For (ii),
we propose a simple unsupervised loss function that regularizes the feature
extractors of classifiers to maximize the performance improvement obtained from
synthetic samples. We confirm that our method outperforms baselines using
generative foundation models on SSL. We also demonstrate that our methods
outperform SSL using real unlabeled datasets in scenarios with extremely small
amounts of labeled datasets. This suggests that synthetic samples have the
potential to provide improvement gains more efficiently than real unlabeled
data.]]></summary>

enabling intrinsically safe human-robot collaboration and achieving a higher
load-to-mass ratio. However, controlling flexible robots is complicated due to
their complex dynamics, which include oscillatory behavior and a
high-dimensional state space. NMPC offers an effective means to control such
robots, but its extensive computational demands often limit its application in
real-time scenarios. To enable fast control of flexible robots, we propose a
framework for a safe approximation of NMPC using imitation learning and a
predictive safety filter. Our framework significantly reduces computation time
while incurring a slight loss in performance. Compared to NMPC, our framework
shows more than a eightfold improvement in computation time when controlling a
three-dimensional flexible robot arm in simulation, all while guaranteeing
safety constraints. Notably, our approach outperforms conventional

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Accurately predicting the prices of financial time series is essential and
challenging for the financial sector. Owing to recent advancements in deep
learning techniques, deep learning models are gradually replacing traditional
statistical and machine learning models as the first choice for price
forecasting tasks. This shift in model selection has led to a notable rise in
research related to applying deep learning models to price forecasting,
resulting in a rapid accumulation of new knowledge. Therefore, we conducted a
literature review of relevant studies over the past three years with a view to
aiding researchers and practitioners in the field. This review delves deeply
into deep learning-based forecasting models, presenting information on model
architectures, practical applications, and their respective advantages and
disadvantages. In particular, detailed information is provided on advanced
models for price forecasting, such as Transformers, generative adversarial
networks (GANs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and deep quantum neural networks
(DQNNs). The present contribution also includes potential directions for future
research, such as examining the effectiveness of deep learning models with
complex structures for price forecasting, extending from point prediction to
interval prediction using deep learning models, scrutinising the reliability
and validity of decomposition ensembles, and exploring the influence of data
volume on model performance.]]></summary>

in democratizing machine learning on low-footprint devices, such as
microcontrollers. The prevalence of these miniature devices raises the question
of whether aggregating their knowledge can benefit TinyML applications.
Federated meta-learning is a promising answer to this question, as it addresses
the scarcity of labeled data and heterogeneous data distribution across devices
in the real world. However, deploying TinyML hardware faces unique resource
constraints, making existing methods impractical due to energy, privacy, and
communication limitations. We introduce TinyMetaFed, a model-agnostic
meta-learning framework suitable for TinyML. TinyMetaFed facilitates
collaborative training of a neural network initialization that can be quickly
fine-tuned on new devices. It offers communication savings and privacy
protection through partial local reconstruction and Top-P% selective
communication, computational efficiency via online learning, and robustness to
client heterogeneity through few-shot learning. The evaluations on three TinyML
use cases demonstrate that TinyMetaFed can significantly reduce energy
consumption and communication overhead, accelerate convergence, and stabilize
the training process.]]></summary>

ranging from clustering, kernel-based classification/regression and more

in representing graphs as metric measure spaces, allowing to successfully
leverage Optimal Transport, which provides meaningful distances allowing to
compare them: the Gromov-Wasserstein distances. However, this family of
distances overlooks edge attributes, which are essential for many structured

local convolution operations instead of a global heat kernel, along with

developing applications that allow patients to self-monitor their recovery. An
important component of this is the segmentation of eczema region from such
images. Current methods for eczema segmentation rely on deep neural networks
such as convolutional (CNN)-based U-Net or transformer-based Swin U-Net. While
effective, these methods require high volume of annotated data, which can be
difficult to obtain. Here, we investigate the capabilities of visual in-context
learning that can perform few-shot eczema segmentation with just a handful of
examples and without any need for retraining models. Specifically, we propose a
strategy for applying in-context learning for eczema segmentation with a
generalist vision model called SegGPT. When benchmarked on a dataset of
annotated eczema images, we show that SegGPT with just 2 representative example
images from the training dataset performs better (mIoU: 36.69) than a CNN U-Net
trained on 428 images (mIoU: 32.60). We also discover that using more number of
examples for SegGPT may in fact be harmful to its performance. Our result
highlights the importance of visual in-context learning in developing faster
and better solutions to skin imaging tasks. Our result also paves the way for
developing inclusive solutions that can cater to minorities in the demographics
who are typically heavily under-represented in the training data.]]></summary>

is attributed to their ability to effectively process and integrate multiscale
information from diverse data sources. MM-NNs extract and fuse features from
multiple modalities using adequate unimodal backbones and specific fusion
networks. Although this helps strengthen the multimodal information
representation, designing such networks is labor-intensive. It requires tuning
the architectural parameters of the unimodal backbones, choosing the fusing
point, and selecting the operations for fusion. Furthermore, multimodality AI
is emerging as a cutting-edge option in Internet of Things (IoT) systems where
inference latency and energy consumption are critical metrics in addition to
accuracy. In this paper, we propose Harmonic-NAS, a framework for the joint
optimization of unimodal backbones and multimodal fusion networks with hardware
awareness on resource-constrained devices. Harmonic-NAS involves a two-tier
optimization approach for the unimodal backbone architectures and fusion
strategy and operators. By incorporating the hardware dimension into the
optimization, evaluation results on various devices and multimodal datasets
have demonstrated the superiority of Harmonic-NAS over state-of-the-art

for deep neural networks. The existing regularization techniques mainly rely on
the i.i.d. assumption and only consider the knowledge from the current sample,

work, we propose a general regularizer called \textbf{Patch-level Neighborhood
Interpolation~(Pani)} that conducts a non-local representation in the

in different layers and then linearly interpolates neighborhood patch features,
serving as a general and effective regularization strategy. Further, we
customize our approach into two kinds of popular regularization methods, namely
Virtual Adversarial Training (VAT) and MixUp as well as its variants. The first
derived \textbf{Pani VAT} presents a novel way to construct non-local
adversarial smoothness by employing patch-level interpolated perturbations. The
second derived \textbf{Pani MixUp} method extends the MixUp, and achieves
superiority over MixUp and competitive performance over state-of-the-art

distributed across the wireless edge. The paper introduces delay-aware
hierarchical federated learning (DFL) to improve the efficiency of distributed
machine learning (ML) model training by accounting for communication delays
between edge and cloud. Different from traditional federated learning, DFL
leverages multiple stochastic gradient descent iterations on local datasets
within each global aggregation period and intermittently aggregates model
parameters through edge servers in local subnetworks. During global
synchronization, the cloud server consolidates local models with the outdated
global model using a local-global combiner, thus preserving crucial elements of
both, enhancing learning efficiency under the presence of delay. A set of
conditions is obtained to achieve the sub-linear convergence rate of O(1/k) for
strongly convex and smooth loss functions. Based on these findings, an adaptive
control algorithm is developed for DFL, implementing policies to mitigate
energy consumption and communication latency while aiming for sublinear
convergence. Numerical evaluations show DFL's superior performance in terms of
faster global model convergence, reduced resource consumption, and robustness
against communication delays compared to existing FL algorithms. In summary,
this proposed method offers improved efficiency and results when dealing with

results with multiple real-world datasets validate our theoretical results and
show the impact of varying degrees of model robustness on the cost and validity

data, the acquisition of quality labels often involves laborious human
annotations or slow and expensive scientific measurements. Machine learning is
becoming an appealing alternative as sophisticated predictive techniques are
being used to quickly and cheaply produce large amounts of predicted labels;
e.g., predicted protein structures are used to supplement experimentally
derived structures, predictions of socioeconomic indicators from satellite
imagery are used to supplement accurate survey data, and so on. Since
predictions are imperfect and potentially biased, this practice brings into
question the validity of downstream inferences. We introduce cross-prediction:
a method for valid inference powered by machine learning. With a small labeled
dataset and a large unlabeled dataset, cross-prediction imputes the missing
labels via machine learning and applies a form of debiasing to remedy the
prediction inaccuracies. The resulting inferences achieve the desired error
probability and are more powerful than those that only leverage the labeled
data. Closely related is the recent proposal of prediction-powered inference,
which assumes that a good pre-trained model is already available. We show that
cross-prediction is consistently more powerful than an adaptation of
prediction-powered inference in which a fraction of the labeled data is split
off and used to train the model. Finally, we observe that cross-prediction
gives more stable conclusions than its competitors; its confidence intervals
typically have significantly lower variability.]]></summary>

Federated Non Target Distillation, which retains inter-domain knowledge while
avoiding the optimization conflict issue, fulling distilling privileged

has trickled into other domains giving rise to "scientific language models"
that operate on small molecules, proteins or polymers. In chemistry, language
models contribute to accelerating the molecule discovery cycle as evidenced by
promising recent findings in early-stage drug discovery. Here, we review the
role of language models in molecular discovery, underlining their strength in
de novo drug design, property prediction and reaction chemistry. We highlight
valuable open-source software assets thus lowering the entry barrier to the
field of scientific language modeling. Last, we sketch a vision for future
molecular design that combines a chatbot interface with access to computational
chemistry tools. Our contribution serves as a valuable resource for
researchers, chemists, and AI enthusiasts interested in understanding how
language models can and will be used to accelerate chemical discovery.]]></summary>

polynomial control policies for control-affine nonlinear systems which
guarantees runtime stability to a goal state, when using visual observations
and a learned perception module in the feedback control loop. We leverage
Lyapunov analysis to formulate the problem of synthesizing such policies. This
problem is nonconvex in the policy parameters and the Lyapunov function that is
used to prove the stability of the policy. To solve this problem approximately,
we propose two approaches: the first solves a sequence of sum-of-squares
optimization problems to iteratively improve a policy which is provably-stable
by construction, while the second directly performs gradient-based optimization
on the parameters of the polynomial policy, and its closed-loop stability is
verified a posteriori. We extend our approach to provide stability guarantees
in the presence of observation noise, which realistically arises due to errors
in the learned perception module. We evaluate our approach on several
underactuated nonlinear systems, including pendula and quadrotors, showing that
our guarantees translate to empirical stability when controlling these systems
from images, while baseline approaches can fail to reliably stabilize the
system.]]></summary>

tasks is an increasingly hard problem. Existing solutions tradeoff invariance
for computational or memory resources. In this work, we show how to leverage
randomness and design models that are both expressive and invariant but use
less resources. Inspired by randomized algorithms, our key insight is that
accepting probabilistic notions of universal approximation and invariance can
reduce our resource requirements. More specifically, we propose a class of
binary classification models called Randomized Linear Classifiers (RLCs). We
give parameter and sample size conditions in which RLCs can, with high
probability, approximate any (smooth) function while preserving invariance to
compact group transformations. Leveraging this result, we design three RLCs
that are provably probabilistic invariant for classification tasks over sets,
graphs, and spherical data. We show how these models can achieve probabilistic
invariance and universality using less resources than (deterministic) neural
networks and their invariant counterparts. Finally, we empirically demonstrate
the benefits of this new class of models on invariant tasks where deterministic
invariant neural networks are known to struggle.]]></summary>

difficult to account for when applying standard empirical risk minimization. In
this work, we propose a novel method to alleviate these problems that we call
odd-$k$-out learning (OKO), which minimizes the cross-entropy error for sets
rather than for single examples. This naturally allows the model to capture
correlations across data examples and achieves both better accuracy and
calibration, especially in limited training data and class-imbalanced regimes.
Perhaps surprisingly, OKO often yields better calibration even when training
with hard labels and dropping any additional calibration parameter tuning, such
as temperature scaling. We provide theoretical justification, establishing that
OKO naturally yields better calibration, and provide extensive experimental
analyses that corroborate our theoretical findings. We emphasize that OKO is a
general framework that can be easily adapted to many settings and the trained
model can be applied to single examples at inference time, without introducing
significant run-time overhead or architecture changes.]]></summary>

generalisation than flat minima -even more so for out-of-domain data, recorded
from previously unseen devices-, thus adding to the dispute about better
generalisation capabilities of flat minima. We further find that, in

group nodes into different clusters. Better augmentation techniques benefit the
quality of the contrastive samples, thus being one of key factors to improve
performance. However, the augmentation samples in existing methods are always
predefined by human experiences, and agnostic from the downstream task
clustering, thus leading to high human resource costs and poor performance. To
this end, we propose an Attribute Graph Clustering method via Learnable
Augmentation (\textbf{AGCLA}), which introduces learnable augmentors for
high-quality and suitable augmented samples for CDGC. Specifically, we design
two learnable augmentors for attribute and structure information, respectively.
Besides, two refinement matrices, including the high-confidence pseudo-label
matrix and the cross-view sample similarity matrix, are generated to improve
the reliability of the learned affinity matrix. During the training procedure,
we notice that there exist differences between the optimization goals for
training learnable augmentors and contrastive learning networks. In other
words, we should both guarantee the consistency of the embeddings as well as
the diversity of the augmented samples. Thus, an adversarial learning mechanism
is designed in our method. Moreover, a two-stage training strategy is leveraged
for the high-confidence refinement matrices. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of AGCLA on six benchmark datasets.]]></summary>

fractures at an academic center. Patients underwent gait analysis with a
chest-mounted IMU device. Using software, raw gait data was preprocessed,
emphasizing 12 essential gait variables. Machine learning models including
XGBoost, Logistic Regression, SVM, LightGBM, and Random Forest were trained,
tested, and evaluated. Attention was given to class imbalance, addressed using
SMOTE. We introduced a methodology to compute the Rate of Change (ROC) for gait
variables, independent of the time difference between gait analyses. XGBoost
was the optimal model both before and after applying SMOTE. Prior to SMOTE, the
model achieved an average test AUC of 0.90 (95% CI: [0.79, 1.00]) and test
accuracy of 86% (95% CI: [75%, 97%]). Feature importance analysis attributed
importance to the duration between injury and gait analysis. Data patterns
showed early physiological compensations, followed by stabilization phases,
emphasizing prompt gait analysis. This study underscores the potential of

critical for obtaining a comprehensive and accurate perception of the real
world. Drawing inspiration from neuroscience, we develop the
Information-Theoretic Hierarchical Perception (ITHP) model, which utilizes the

that aim to incorporate all modalities as input, our model designates the prime
modality as input, while the remaining modalities act as detectors in the
information pathway. Our proposed perception model focuses on constructing an
effective and compact information flow by achieving a balance between the
minimization of mutual information between the latent state and the input modal
state, and the maximization of mutual information between the latent states and
the remaining modal states. This approach leads to compact latent state
representations that retain relevant information while minimizing redundancy,
thereby substantially enhancing the performance of downstream tasks.
Experimental evaluations on both the MUStARD and CMU-MOSI datasets demonstrate
that our model consistently distills crucial information in multimodal learning

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graph unlearning has emerged as a pivotal method to delete information from a
pre-trained graph neural network (GNN). One may delete nodes, a class of nodes,
edges, or a class of edges. An unlearning method enables the GNN model to
comply with data protection regulations (i.e., the right to be forgotten),
adapt to evolving data distributions, and reduce the GPU-hours carbon footprint
by avoiding repetitive retraining. Existing partitioning and aggregation-based
methods have limitations due to their poor handling of local graph dependencies
and additional overhead costs. More recently, GNNDelete offered a
model-agnostic approach that alleviates some of these issues. Our work takes a
novel approach to address these challenges in graph unlearning through
knowledge distillation, as it distills to delete in GNN (D2DGN). It is a
model-agnostic distillation framework where the complete graph knowledge is
divided and marked for retention and deletion. It performs distillation with
response-based soft targets and feature-based node embedding while minimizing
KL divergence. The unlearned model effectively removes the influence of deleted
graph elements while preserving knowledge about the retained graph elements.
D2DGN surpasses the performance of existing methods when evaluated on various
real-world graph datasets by up to $43.1\%$ (AUC) in edge and node unlearning
tasks. Other notable advantages include better efficiency, better performance
in removing target elements, preservation of performance for the retained
elements, and zero overhead costs. Notably, our D2DGN surpasses the
state-of-the-art GNNDelete in AUC by $2.4\%$, improves membership inference
ratio by $+1.3$, requires $10.2\times10^6$ fewer FLOPs per forward pass and up
to $\mathbf{3.2}\times$ faster.]]></summary>

in the LLM literature. We aim to understand when and why the incorporation of
structural information inherent in graph data can improve the prediction
performance of LLMs on node classification tasks. To address the ``when''
question, we examine a variety of prompting methods for encoding structural
information, in settings where textual node features are either rich or scarce.
For the ``why'' questions, we probe into two potential contributing factors to
the LLM performance: data leakage and homophily. Our exploration of these
questions reveals that (i) LLMs can benefit from structural information,
especially when textual node features are scarce; (ii) there is no substantial
evidence indicating that the performance of LLMs is significantly attributed to
data leakage; and (iii) the performance of LLMs on a target node is strongly
positively related to the local homophily ratio of the node.]]></summary>

component to safe planning in autonomous vehicles. Here, we represent
continuous trajectories as sequences of discrete motion tokens and cast
multi-agent motion prediction as a language modeling task over this domain. Our
model, MotionLM, provides several advantages: First, it does not require
anchors or explicit latent variable optimization to learn multimodal
distributions. Instead, we leverage a single standard language modeling
objective, maximizing the average log probability over sequence tokens. Second,
our approach bypasses post-hoc interaction heuristics where individual agent
trajectory generation is conducted prior to interactive scoring. Instead,
MotionLM produces joint distributions over interactive agent futures in a
single autoregressive decoding process. In addition, the model's sequential
factorization enables temporally causal conditional rollouts. The proposed
approach establishes new state-of-the-art performance for multi-agent motion
prediction on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, ranking 1st on the interactive

images is the lack of sufficient labeled training data, owing to the cost of
acquiring such data. Realizing that object detection methods for the RGB
modality are quite robust (at least for some commonplace classes, like person,
car, etc.), thanks to the giant training sets that exist, in this work we seek
to leverage cues from the RGB modality to scale object detectors to the IR
modality, while preserving model performance in the RGB modality. At the core
of our method, is a novel tensor decomposition method called TensorFact which
splits the convolution kernels of a layer of a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) into low-rank factor matrices, with fewer parameters than the original
CNN. We first pretrain these factor matrices on the RGB modality, for which
plenty of training data are assumed to exist and then augment only a few
trainable parameters for training on the IR modality to avoid over-fitting,
while encouraging them to capture complementary cues from those trained only on
the RGB modality. We validate our approach empirically by first assessing how
well our TensorFact decomposed network performs at the task of detecting
objects in RGB images vis-a-vis the original network and then look at how well
it adapts to IR images of the FLIR ADAS v1 dataset. For the latter, we train
models under scenarios that pose challenges stemming from data paucity. From
the experiments, we observe that: (i) TensorFact shows performance gains on RGB
images; (ii) further, this pre-trained model, when fine-tuned, outperforms a
standard state-of-the-art object detector on the FLIR ADAS v1 dataset by about
4% in terms of mAP 50 score.]]></summary>

demographic subgroups such as elder and female. Recently, fair representation
learning (FRL) trained by deep neural networks has demonstrated superior
performance, whereby representations containing no demographic information are
inferred from the data and then used as the input to classification or other
downstream tasks. Despite the development of FRL methods, their vulnerability
under data poisoning attack, a popular protocol to benchmark model robustness
under adversarial scenarios, is under-explored. Data poisoning attacks have
been developed for classical fair machine learning methods which incorporate
fairness constraints into shallow-model classifiers. Nonetheless, these attacks
fall short in FRL due to notably different fairness goals and model
architectures. This work proposes the first data poisoning framework attacking
FRL. We induce the model to output unfair representations that contain as much
demographic information as possible by injecting carefully crafted poisoning
samples into the training data. This attack entails a prohibitive bilevel
optimization, wherefore an effective approximated solution is proposed. A
theoretical analysis on the needed number of poisoning samples is derived and
sheds light on defending against the attack. Experiments on benchmark fairness
datasets and state-of-the-art fair representation learning models demonstrate
the superiority of our attack.]]></summary>

is well-established that Shamir secret-sharing coding strategies can enable
perfect information-theoretic privacy in distributed computation via the

However, perfect privacy and accuracy require an honest majority, that is, $N
\geq 2t+1$ compute nodes are required to ensure privacy against any $t$
colluding adversarial nodes. By allowing for some controlled amount of
information leakage and approximate multiplication instead of exact
multiplication, we study coding schemes for the setting where the number of
honest nodes can be a minority, that is $N< 2t+1.$ We develop a tight
characterization privacy-accuracy trade-off for cases where $N < 2t+1$ by
measuring information leakage using {differential} privacy instead of perfect
privacy, and using the mean squared error metric for accuracy. A novel
technical aspect is an intricately layered noise distribution that merges ideas
from differential privacy and Shamir secret-sharing at different layers.]]></summary>

lesser known property of tree-based methods is that one can construct a
proximity matrix from the tree(s), and these proximity matrices are induced
kernels. While there has been extensive research on the applications and
properties of kernels, there is relatively little research on kernels induced
by decision forests. We construct Kernel Mean Embedding Random Forests (KMERF),
which induce kernels from random trees and/or forests using leaf-node
proximity. We introduce the notion of an asymptotically characteristic kernel,
and prove that KMERF kernels are asymptotically characteristic for both
discrete and continuous data. Because KMERF is data-adaptive, we suspected it
would outperform kernels selected a priori on finite sample data. We illustrate
that KMERF nearly dominates current state-of-the-art kernel-based tests across
a diverse range of high-dimensional two-sample and independence testing
settings. Furthermore, our forest-based approach is interpretable, and provides
feature importance metrics that readily distinguish important dimensions,
unlike other high-dimensional non-parametric testing procedures. Hence, this
work demonstrates the decision forest-based kernel can be more powerful and
more interpretable than existing methods, flying in the face of conventional

they can reliably perform legal-related tasks. To address this gap, we propose
a comprehensive evaluation benchmark LawBench. LawBench has been meticulously
crafted to have precise assessment of the LLMs' legal capabilities from three
cognitive levels: (1) Legal knowledge memorization: whether LLMs can memorize
needed legal concepts, articles and facts; (2) Legal knowledge understanding:
whether LLMs can comprehend entities, events and relationships within legal
text; (3) Legal knowledge applying: whether LLMs can properly utilize their
legal knowledge and make necessary reasoning steps to solve realistic legal
tasks. LawBench contains 20 diverse tasks covering 5 task types: single-label
classification (SLC), multi-label classification (MLC), regression, extraction
and generation. We perform extensive evaluations of 51 LLMs on LawBench,
including 20 multilingual LLMs, 22 Chinese-oriented LLMs and 9 legal specific
LLMs. The results show that GPT-4 remains the best-performing LLM in the legal

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Batch reinforcement learning (RL) defines the task of learning from a fixed
batch of data lacking exhaustive exploration. Worst-case optimality algorithms,
which calibrate a value-function model class from logged experience and perform
some type of pessimistic evaluation under the learned model, have emerged as a
promising paradigm for batch RL. However, contemporary works on this stream
have commonly overlooked the hierarchical decision-making structure hidden in
the optimization landscape. In this paper, we adopt a game-theoretical
viewpoint and model the policy learning diagram as a two-player general-sum
game with a leader-follower structure. We propose a novel stochastic
gradient-based learning algorithm: StackelbergLearner, in which the leader
player updates according to the total derivative of its objective instead of
the usual individual gradient, and the follower player makes individual updates
and ensures transition-consistent pessimistic reasoning. The derived learning
dynamic naturally lends StackelbergLearner to a game-theoretic interpretation
and provides a convergence guarantee to differentiable Stackelberg equilibria.
From a theoretical standpoint, we provide instance-dependent regret bounds with
general function approximation, which shows that our algorithm can learn a
best-effort policy that is able to compete against any comparator policy that
is covered by batch data. Notably, our theoretical regret guarantees only
require realizability without any data coverage and strong function
approximation conditions, e.g., Bellman closedness, which is in contrast to
prior works lacking such guarantees. Through comprehensive experiments, we find
that our algorithm consistently performs as well or better as compared to

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We study unconstrained Online Linear Optimization with Lipschitz losses. The
goal is to simultaneously achieve ($i$) second order gradient adaptivity; and
($ii$) comparator norm adaptivity also known as "parameter freeness" in the
literature. Existing regret bounds (Cutkosky and Orabona, 2018; Mhammedi and
Koolen, 2020; Jacobsen and Cutkosky, 2022) have the suboptimal $O(\sqrt{V_T\log
V_T})$ dependence on the gradient variance $V_T$, while the present work
improves it to the optimal rate $O(\sqrt{V_T})$ using a novel
continuous-time-inspired algorithm, without any impractical doubling trick.
This result can be extended to the setting with unknown Lipschitz constant,
eliminating the range ratio problem from prior works (Mhammedi and Koolen,
2020).

Concretely, we first show that the aimed simultaneous adaptivity can be
achieved fairly easily in a continuous time analogue of the problem, where the
environment is modeled by an arbitrary continuous semimartingale. Then, our key
innovation is a new discretization argument that preserves such adaptivity in
the discrete time adversarial setting. This refines a non-gradient-adaptive
discretization argument from (Harvey et al., 2023), both algorithmically and
analytically, which could be of independent interest.]]></summary>

created a greater demand for wireless resource management solutions that offer
high data rates, extensive coverage, minimal latency and energy-efficient
performance. Nonetheless, traditional approaches have shortcomings when it
comes to computational complexity and their ability to adapt to dynamic
conditions, creating a gap between theoretical analysis and the practical
execution of algorithmic solutions for managing wireless resources. Deep
learning-based techniques offer promising solutions for bridging this gap with
their substantial representation capabilities. We propose a novel unsupervised
deep learning framework, which is called NNBF, for the design of uplink receive
multi-user single input multiple output (MU-SIMO) beamforming. The primary
objective is to enhance the throughput by focusing on maximizing the sum-rate
while also offering computationally efficient solution, in contrast to
established conventional methods. We conduct experiments for several antenna
configurations. Our experimental results demonstrate that NNBF exhibits
superior performance compared to our baseline methods, namely, zero-forcing
beamforming (ZFBF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalizer.
Additionally, NNBF is scalable to the number of single-antenna user equipments
(UEs) while baseline methods have significant computational burden due to
matrix pseudo-inverse operation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Light curves of stars encapsulate a wealth of information about stellar
oscillations and granulation, thereby offering key insights into the internal
structure and evolutionary state of stars. Conventional asteroseismic
techniques have been largely confined to power spectral analysis, neglecting
the valuable phase information contained within light curves. While recent
machine learning applications in asteroseismology utilizing Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) have successfully inferred stellar attributes from light
curves, they are often limited by the local feature extraction inherent in
convolutional operations. To circumvent these constraints, we present
$\textit{Astroconformer}$, a Transformer-based deep learning framework designed
to capture long-range dependencies in stellar light curves. Our empirical
analysis, which focuses on estimating surface gravity ($\log g$), is grounded
in a carefully curated dataset derived from $\textit{Kepler}$ light curves.
These light curves feature asteroseismic $\log g$ values spanning from 0.2 to
4.4. Our results underscore that, in the regime where the training data is
abundant, $\textit{Astroconformer}$ attains a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of
0.017 dex around $\log g \approx 3 $. Even in regions where training data are
sparse, the RMSE can reach 0.1 dex. It outperforms not only the K-nearest
neighbor-based model ($\textit{The SWAN}$) but also state-of-the-art CNNs.
Ablation studies confirm that the efficacy of the models in this particular
task is strongly influenced by the size of their receptive fields, with larger
receptive fields correlating with enhanced performance. Moreover, we find that
the attention mechanisms within $\textit{Astroconformer}$ are well-aligned with
the inherent characteristics of stellar oscillations and granulation present in
the light curves.]]></summary>

examine the impact of methodological details in activation patching, including
evaluation metrics and corruption methods. In several settings of localization

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Worldwide Geo-localization aims to pinpoint the precise location of images
taken anywhere on Earth. This task has considerable challenges due to immense
variation in geographic landscapes. The image-to-image retrieval-based
approaches fail to solve this problem on a global scale as it is not feasible
to construct a large gallery of images covering the entire world. Instead,
existing approaches divide the globe into discrete geographic cells,
transforming the problem into a classification task. However, their performance
is limited by the predefined classes and often results in inaccurate
localizations when an image's location significantly deviates from its class
center. To overcome these limitations, we propose GeoCLIP, a novel
CLIP-inspired Image-to-GPS retrieval approach that enforces alignment between
the image and its corresponding GPS locations. GeoCLIP's location encoder
models the Earth as a continuous function by employing positional encoding
through random Fourier features and constructing a hierarchical representation
that captures information at varying resolutions to yield a semantically rich
high-dimensional feature suitable to use even beyond geo-localization. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work employing GPS encoding for
geo-localization. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method via extensive
experiments and ablations on benchmark datasets. We achieve competitive
performance with just 20% of training data, highlighting its effectiveness even
in limited-data settings. Furthermore, we qualitatively demonstrate
geo-localization using a text query by leveraging CLIP backbone of our image
encoder.]]></summary>

surveillance, as they are often available at a finer spatial and temporal
resolution, larger coverage, and lower latency than traditional surveillance
signals. We describe the problem of spatial and temporal heterogeneity in these
signals derived from these data sources, where spatial and/or temporal biases
are present. We present a method to use a ``guiding'' signal to correct for
these biases and produce a more reliable signal that can be used for modeling
and forecasting. The method assumes that the heterogeneity can be approximated
by a low-rank matrix and that the temporal heterogeneity is smooth over time.
We also present a hyperparameter selection algorithm to choose the parameters
representing the matrix rank and degree of temporal smoothness of the
corrections. In the absence of ground truth, we use maps and plots to argue
that this method does indeed reduce heterogeneity. Reducing heterogeneity from
auxiliary data sources greatly increases their utility in modeling and
forecasting epidemics.]]></summary>

estimators in the presence of heavy-tailed contamination of both the covariates
and response functions. In particular, we provide a sharp asymptotic

not exist. We show that, despite being consistent, the Huber loss with
optimally tuned location parameter $\delta$ is suboptimal in the
high-dimensional regime in the presence of heavy-tailed noise, highlighting the
necessity of further regularisation to achieve optimal performance. This result
also uncovers the existence of a curious transition in $\delta$ as a function
of the sample complexity and contamination. Moreover, we derive the decay rates
for the excess risk of ridge regression. We show that, while it is both optimal
and universal for noise distributions with finite second moment, its decay rate
can be considerably faster when the covariates' second moment does not exist.
Finally, we show that our formulas readily generalise to a richer family of

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The growing penetration of intermittent, renewable generation in US power
grids, especially wind and solar generation, results in increased operational
uncertainty. In that context, accurate forecasts are critical, especially for
wind generation, which exhibits large variability and is historically harder to
predict. To overcome this challenge, this work proposes a novel
Bundle-Predict-Reconcile (BPR) framework that integrates asset bundling,
machine learning, and forecast reconciliation techniques. The BPR framework
first learns an intermediate hierarchy level (the bundles), then predicts wind
power at the asset, bundle, and fleet level, and finally reconciles all
forecasts to ensure consistency. This approach effectively introduces an
auxiliary learning task (predicting the bundle-level time series) to help the
main learning tasks. The paper also introduces new asset-bundling criteria that
capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of wind power time series. Extensive
numerical experiments are conducted on an industry-size dataset of 283 wind
farms in the MISO footprint. The experiments consider short-term and day-ahead
forecasts, and evaluates a large variety of forecasting models that include
weather predictions as covariates. The results demonstrate the benefits of BPR,
which consistently and significantly improves forecast accuracy over baselines,
especially at the fleet level.]]></summary>

estimators in the presence of heavy-tailed contamination of both the covariates
and response functions. In particular, we provide a sharp asymptotic
characterisation of M-estimators trained on a family of elliptical covariate
and noise data distributions including cases where second and higher moments do
not exist. We show that, despite being consistent, the Huber loss with
optimally tuned location parameter $\delta$ is suboptimal in the
high-dimensional regime in the presence of heavy-tailed noise, highlighting the
necessity of further regularisation to achieve optimal performance. This result
also uncovers the existence of a curious transition in $\delta$ as a function
of the sample complexity and contamination. Moreover, we derive the decay rates
for the excess risk of ridge regression. We show that, while it is both optimal
and universal for noise distributions with finite second moment, its decay rate
can be considerably faster when the covariates' second moment does not exist.
Finally, we show that our formulas readily generalise to a richer family of
models and data distributions, such as generalised linear estimation with
arbitrary convex regularisation trained on mixture models.]]></summary>

models and adversarial defense techniques. They pose severe security problems
for deep learning applications because they can effectively bypass defense
mechanisms. However, previous attack methods often utilize Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), which are not theoretically provable and thus
generate unrealistic examples by incorporating adversarial objectives,
especially for large-scale datasets like ImageNet. In this paper, we propose a
new method, called AdvDiff, to generate unrestricted adversarial examples with
diffusion models. We design two novel adversarial guidance techniques to
conduct adversarial sampling in the reverse generation process of diffusion
models. These two techniques are effective and stable to generate high-quality,
realistic adversarial examples by integrating gradients of the target
classifier interpretably. Experimental results on MNIST and ImageNet datasets
demonstrate that AdvDiff is effective to generate unrestricted adversarial
examples, which outperforms GAN-based methods in terms of attack performance
and generation quality.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Survival analysis plays a crucial role in many healthcare decisions, where
the risk prediction for the events of interest can support an informative
outlook for a patient's medical journey. Given the existence of data censoring,
an effective way of survival analysis is to enforce the pairwise temporal
concordance between censored and observed data, aiming to utilize the time
interval before censoring as partially observed time-to-event labels for
supervised learning. Although existing studies mostly employed ranking methods
to pursue an ordering objective, contrastive methods which learn a
discriminative embedding by having data contrast against each other, have not
been explored thoroughly for survival analysis. Therefore, in this paper, we
propose a novel Ontology-aware Temporality-based Contrastive Survival (OTCSurv)
analysis framework that utilizes survival durations from both censored and
observed data to define temporal distinctiveness and construct negative sample
pairs with adjustable hardness for contrastive learning. Specifically, we first
use an ontological encoder and a sequential self-attention encoder to represent
the longitudinal EHR data with rich contexts. Second, we design a temporal
contrastive loss to capture varying survival durations in a supervised setting
through a hardness-aware negative sampling mechanism. Last, we incorporate the
contrastive task into the time-to-event predictive task with multiple loss
components. We conduct extensive experiments using a large EHR dataset to
forecast the risk of hospitalized patients who are in danger of developing
acute kidney injury (AKI), a critical and urgent medical condition. The
effectiveness and explainability of the proposed model are validated through
comprehensive quantitative and qualitative studies.]]></summary>

natural audio samples from a wide variety of semantic classes. For this task,
the videos are required to be aligned both globally and temporally with the
input audio: globally, the input audio is semantically associated with the
entire output video, and temporally, each segment of the input audio is
associated with a corresponding segment of that video. We utilize an existing
text-conditioned video generation model and a pre-trained audio encoder model.
The proposed method is based on a lightweight adaptor network, which learns to
map the audio-based representation to the input representation expected by the
text-to-video generation model. As such, it also enables video generation
conditioned on text, audio, and, for the first time as far as we can ascertain,
on both text and audio. We validate our method extensively on three datasets
demonstrating significant semantic diversity of audio-video samples and further
propose a novel evaluation metric (AV-Align) to assess the alignment of
generated videos with input audio samples. AV-Align is based on the detection
and comparison of energy peaks in both modalities. In comparison to recent
state-of-the-art approaches, our method generates videos that are better
aligned with the input sound, both with respect to content and temporal axis.
We also show that videos produced by our method present higher visual quality

generative-based pretraining. In this paper, we show that graph-level
representations can be effectively modeled using this paradigm and propose
Graph-JEPA, the first JEPA for the graph domain. In particular, we employ
masked modeling to learn embeddings for different subgraphs of the input graph.
To endow the representations with the implicit hierarchy that is often present
in graph-level concepts, we devise an alternative training objective that
consists of predicting the coordinates of the encoded subgraphs on the unit
hyperbola in the 2D plane. Extensive validation shows that Graph-JEPA can learn

locomotion and interaction capabilities, which is generally referred to as
mobile manipulation (MoMa). MoMa tasks are difficult due to the large action
space of the robot and the common multi-objective nature of the task, e.g.,
efficiently reaching a goal while avoiding obstacles. Current approaches often
segregate tasks into navigation without manipulation and stationary
manipulation without locomotion by manually matching parts of the action space
to MoMa sub-objectives (e.g. learning base actions for locomotion objectives
and learning arm actions for manipulation). This solution prevents simultaneous
combinations of locomotion and interaction degrees of freedom and requires
human domain knowledge for both partitioning the action space and matching the
action parts to the sub-objectives. In this paper, we introduce Causal MoMa, a
new reinforcement learning framework to train policies for typical MoMa tasks
that makes use of the most favorable subspace of the robot's action space to
address each sub-objective. Causal MoMa automatically discovers the causal
dependencies between actions and terms of the reward function and exploits
these dependencies through causal policy gradient that reduces gradient
variance compared to previous state-of-the-art reinforcement learning
algorithms, improving convergence and results. We evaluate the performance of
Causal MoMa on three types of simulated robots across different MoMa tasks and
demonstrate success in transferring the policies trained in simulation directly
to a real robot, where our agent is able to follow moving goals and react to
dynamic obstacles while simultaneously and synergistically controlling the
whole-body: base, arm, and head. More information at

maximise the performance during model training and then minimise the
memory/area footprint of the trained model for deployment on edge devices
targeting CPUs, GPUs, microcontrollers, or custom hardware accelerators. This
paper proposes a methodology for automatically generating predictor circuits
for classification of tabular data with comparable prediction performance to
conventional ML techniques while using substantially fewer hardware resources
and power. The proposed methodology uses an evolutionary algorithm to search
over the space of logic gates and automatically generates a classifier circuit
with maximised training prediction accuracy. Classifier circuits are so tiny
(i.e., consisting of no more than 300 logic gates) that they are called "Tiny
Classifier" circuits, and can efficiently be implemented in ASIC or on an FPGA.
We empirically evaluate the automatic Tiny Classifier circuit generation
methodology or "Auto Tiny Classifiers" on a wide range of tabular datasets, and
compare it against conventional ML techniques such as Amazon's AutoGluon,
Google's TabNet and a neural search over Multi-Layer Perceptrons. Despite Tiny
Classifiers being constrained to a few hundred logic gates, we observe no
statistically significant difference in prediction performance in comparison to
the best-performing ML baseline. When synthesised as a Silicon chip, Tiny
Classifiers use 8-18x less area and 4-8x less power. When implemented as an
ultra-low cost chip on a flexible substrate (i.e., FlexIC), they occupy 10-75x

be characterized using classical Gaussian processes. More flexible spatial
extremes models exhibit appealing extremal dependence properties but are often
exceedingly prohibitive to fit and simulate from in high dimensions. In this
paper, we develop a new spatial extremes model that has flexible and
non-stationary dependence properties, and we integrate it in the
encoding-decoding structure of a variational autoencoder (XVAE), whose
parameters are estimated via variational Bayes combined with deep learning. The
XVAE can be used as a spatio-temporal emulator that characterizes the
distribution of potential mechanistic model output states and produces outputs
that have the same statistical properties as the inputs, especially in the
tail. As an aside, our approach also provides a novel way of making fast
inference with complex extreme-value processes. Through extensive simulation
studies, we show that our XVAE is substantially more time-efficient than
traditional Bayesian inference while also outperforming many spatial extremes
models with a stationary dependence structure. To further demonstrate the
computational power of the XVAE, we analyze a high-resolution satellite-derived
dataset of sea surface temperature in the Red Sea, which includes 30 years of
daily measurements at 16703 grid cells. We find that the extremal dependence
strength is weaker in the interior of Red Sea and it has decreased slightly
over time.]]></summary>

However, X-Y coordinates of articulators strongly depend on the anatomy of the

sizes, prompting practitioners to find new tuning methods using a proxy of
smaller networks. One such proposal uses $\mu$P parameterized networks, where
the optimal hyperparameters for small width networks transfer to networks with
arbitrarily large width. However, in this scheme, hyperparameters do not
transfer across depths. As a remedy, we study residual networks with a residual
branch scale of $1/\sqrt{\text{depth}}$ in combination with the $\mu$P

architectures including convolutional ResNets and Vision Transformers trained
with this parameterization exhibit transfer of optimal hyperparameters across
width and depth on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. Furthermore, our empirical findings
are supported and motivated by theory. Using recent developments in the
dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) description of neural network learning
dynamics, we show that this parameterization of ResNets admits a well-defined
feature learning joint infinite-width and infinite-depth limit and show

where two positive views generated through data augmentation are made similar
by an attraction force in a data representation space, while a repulsive force
makes them far from negative examples. Non-contrastive learning, represented by
BYOL and SimSiam, further gets rid of negative examples and improves
computational efficiency. While learned representations may collapse into a
single point due to the lack of the repulsive force at first sight, Tian et al.
(2021) revealed through the learning dynamics analysis that the representations
can avoid collapse if data augmentation is sufficiently stronger than
regularization. However, their analysis does not take into account
commonly-used feature normalization, a normalizer before measuring the
similarity of representations, and hence excessively strong regularization may
collapse the dynamics, which is an unnatural behavior under the presence of
feature normalization. Therefore, we extend the previous theory based on the L2
loss by considering the cosine loss, which involves feature normalization. We
show that the cosine loss induces sixth-order dynamics (while the L2 loss
induces a third-order one), in which a stable equilibrium dynamically emerges
even if there are only collapsed solutions with given initial parameters. Thus,
we offer a new understanding that feature normalization plays an important role
in robustly preventing the dynamics collapse.]]></summary>

efficient dimensionality reductions of highly non-linear search spaces at a low

using data augmentation or hard-coding invariances into the architecture.
However, too much or too little invariance can hurt, and the correct amount is
unknown a priori and dependent on the instance. Ideally, the appropriate
invariance would be learned from data and inferred at test-time.

We treat invariance as a prediction problem. Given any image, we use a
normalizing flow to predict a distribution over transformations and average the
predictions over them. Since this distribution only depends on the instance, we
can align instances before classifying them and generalize invariance across
classes. The same distribution can also be used to adapt to out-of-distribution
poses. This normalizing flow is trained end-to-end and can learn a much larger
range of transformations than Augerino and InstaAug. When used as data
augmentation, our method shows accuracy and robustness gains on CIFAR 10,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Langevin dynamics are widely used in sampling high-dimensional, non-Gaussian
distributions whose densities are known up to a normalizing constant. In
particular, there is strong interest in unadjusted Langevin algorithms (ULA),
which directly discretize Langevin dynamics to estimate expectations over the
target distribution. We study the use of transport maps that approximately
normalize a target distribution as a way to precondition and accelerate the
convergence of Langevin dynamics. We show that in continuous time, when a
transport map is applied to Langevin dynamics, the result is a Riemannian
manifold Langevin dynamics (RMLD) with metric defined by the transport map. We
also show that applying a transport map to an irreversibly-perturbed ULA
results in a geometry-informed irreversible perturbation (GiIrr) of the
original dynamics. These connections suggest more systematic ways of learning
metrics and perturbations, and also yield alternative discretizations of the
RMLD described by the map, which we study. Under appropriate conditions, these
discretized processes can be endowed with non-asymptotic bounds describing
convergence to the target distribution in 2-Wasserstein distance. Illustrative
numerical results complement our theoretical claims.]]></summary>

learning policies without active interactions, making it especially appealing
for autonomous driving tasks. Recent successes of Transformers inspire casting
offline RL as sequence modeling, which performs well in long-horizon tasks.
However, they are overly optimistic in stochastic environments with incorrect
assumptions that the same goal can be consistently achieved by identical
actions. In this paper, we introduce an UNcertainty-awaRE deciSion Transformer
(UNREST) for planning in stochastic driving environments without introducing
additional transition or complex generative models. Specifically, UNREST
estimates state uncertainties by the conditional mutual information between
transitions and returns, and segments sequences accordingly. Discovering the
`uncertainty accumulation' and `temporal locality' properties of driving
environments, UNREST replaces the global returns in decision transformers with
less uncertain truncated returns, to learn from true outcomes of agent actions
rather than environment transitions. We also dynamically evaluate environmental
uncertainty during inference for cautious planning. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate UNREST's superior performance in various driving scenarios
and the power of our uncertainty estimation strategy.]]></summary>

explanation methods (like LIME and SHAP) have led to the rise of model-precise
abductive explanations. For each data point, abductive explanations provide a
minimal subset of features that are sufficient to generate the outcome. While
theoretically sound and rigorous, abductive explanations suffer from a major
issue -- there can be several valid abductive explanations for the same data
point. In such cases, providing a single abductive explanation can be
insufficient; on the other hand, providing all valid abductive explanations can
be incomprehensible due to their size. In this work, we solve this issue by
aggregating the many possible abductive explanations into feature importance
scores. We propose three aggregation methods: two based on power indices from
cooperative game theory and a third based on a well-known measure of causal
strength. We characterize these three methods axiomatically, showing that each
of them uniquely satisfies a set of desirable properties. We also evaluate them
on multiple datasets and show that these explanations are robust to the attacks

storing factual knowledge within their parameters and achieving remarkable
results when fine-tuned for downstream natural language processing tasks.
Nonetheless, their capacity to access and manipulate knowledge with precision
remains constrained, resulting in performance disparities on
knowledge-intensive tasks when compared to task-specific architectures.
Additionally, the challenges of providing provenance for model decisions and
maintaining up-to-date world knowledge persist as open research frontiers. To
address these limitations, the integration of pre-trained models with
differentiable access mechanisms to explicit non-parametric memory emerges as a
promising solution. This survey delves into the realm of language models (LMs)
augmented with the ability to tap into external knowledge sources, including
external knowledge bases and search engines. While adhering to the standard
objective of predicting missing tokens, these augmented LMs leverage diverse,
possibly non-parametric external modules to augment their contextual processing
capabilities, departing from the conventional language modeling paradigm.
Through an exploration of current advancements in augmenting large language
models with knowledge, this work concludes that this emerging research
direction holds the potential to address prevalent issues in traditional LMs,
such as hallucinations, un-grounded responses, and scalability challenges.]]></summary>

means of a fully autonomous learning algorithm which employs equilibrium

arbitrary spatial dimensions. We report tests on various synthetic and

prediction performance (without parameter tuning) is competitive with standard
interpolation methods such as ordinary kriging and inverse distance weighting.
In particular, MPRS is a particularly effective gap-filling method for rough

sizes, prompting practitioners to find new tuning methods using a proxy of
smaller networks. One such proposal uses $\mu$P parameterized networks, where
the optimal hyperparameters for small width networks transfer to networks with
arbitrarily large width. However, in this scheme, hyperparameters do not
transfer across depths. As a remedy, we study residual networks with a residual
branch scale of $1/\sqrt{\text{depth}}$ in combination with the $\mu$P
parameterization. We provide experiments demonstrating that residual
architectures including convolutional ResNets and Vision Transformers trained
with this parameterization exhibit transfer of optimal hyperparameters across
width and depth on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. Furthermore, our empirical findings
are supported and motivated by theory. Using recent developments in the
dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) description of neural network learning
dynamics, we show that this parameterization of ResNets admits a well-defined
feature learning joint infinite-width and infinite-depth limit and show
convergence of finite-size network dynamics towards this limit.]]></summary>

applies multiple univariate tests on the individual features, followed by
p-value adjustments. Such an approach suffers when the data carry numerous
features. A number of studies have shown that classification accuracy can be
seen as a proxy for two-sample testing. However, neither theoretical
foundations nor practical recipes have been proposed so far on how this
strategy could be extended to multidimensional paired-sample testing. In this
work, we put forward the idea that scoring functions can be produced by the
decision rules defined by the perpendicular bisecting hyperplanes of the line
segments connecting each pair of instances. Then, the optimal scoring function
can be obtained by the pseudomedian of those rules, which we estimate by
extending naturally the Hodges-Lehmann estimator. We accordingly propose a
framework of a two-step testing procedure. First, we estimate the bisecting
hyperplanes for each pair of instances and an aggregated rule derived through
the Hodges-Lehmann estimator. The paired samples are scored by this aggregated
rule to produce a unidimensional representation. Second, we perform a Wilcoxon
signed-rank test on the obtained representation. Our experiments indicate that
our approach has substantial performance gains in testing accuracy compared to
the traditional multivariate and multiple testing, while at the same time
estimates each feature's contribution to the final result.]]></summary>

have made large-scale protein structures accessible, paving the way for machine
learning-based functional annotations.The field of geometric deep learning
focuses on creating methods working on geometric data. An essential aspect of
learning from protein structures is representing these structures as a
geometric object (be it a grid, graph, or surface) and applying a learning
method tailored to this representation. The performance of a given approach
will then depend on both the representation and its corresponding learning
method.

In this paper, we investigate representing proteins as $\textit{3D mesh
surfaces}$ and incorporate them into an established representation benchmark.
Our first finding is that despite promising preliminary results, the surface
representation alone does not seem competitive with 3D grids. Building on this,
we introduce a synergistic approach, combining surface representations with
graph-based methods, resulting in a general framework that incorporates both
representations in learning. We show that using this combination, we are able
to obtain state-of-the-art results across $\textit{all tested tasks}$. Our code

extend the usual notion of action to a dual Cognition (high-level)-Action
(low-level) architecture by introducing intuitive human cognitive priors, and
propose a novel skill IL framework through human-robot interaction, called
Cognition-Action-based Skill Imitation Learning (CasIL), for the robotic agent
to effectively cognize and imitate the critical skills from raw visual
demonstrations. CasIL enables both cognition and action imitation, while
high-level skill cognition explicitly guides low-level primitive actions,
providing robustness and reliability to the entire skill IL process. We
evaluated our method on MuJoCo and RLBench benchmarks, as well as on the
obstacle avoidance and point-goal navigation tasks for quadrupedal robot
locomotion. Experimental results show that our CasIL consistently achieves
competitive and robust skill imitation capability compared to other
counterparts in a variety of long-horizon robotic tasks.]]></summary>

real-game performances of individual players are converted to fantasy points

forecast NFL player performance under uncertainty and (2) determining an
optimal lineup to maximize FPTS under a set salary limit. A supervised learning
neural network was created and used to project FPTS based on past player
performance (2018 NFL regular season for this work) prior to the upcoming week.
These projected FPTS were used in a mixed integer linear program to find the
optimal lineup. The performance of resultant lineups was compared to
randomly-created lineups. On average, the optimal lineups outperformed the
random lineups. The generated lineups were then compared to real-world lineups
from users on DraftKings. The generated lineups generally fell in approximately
the 31st percentile (median). The FPTS methods and predictions presented here

entities and relations of a given graph by mapping them into a vector space.
Although the majority of these methods focus on static knowledge graphs, a
large number of publicly available KGs contain temporal information stating the
time instant/period over which a certain fact has been true. Such graphs are
often known as temporal knowledge graphs. Furthermore, knowledge graphs may
also contain textual descriptions of entities and relations. Both temporal
information and textual descriptions are not taken into account during
representation learning by static KGC methods, and only structural information
of the graph is leveraged. Recently, some studies have used temporal
information to improve link prediction, yet they do not exploit textual
descriptions and do not support inductive inference (prediction on entities
that have not been seen in training).

We propose a novel framework called TEMT that exploits the power of
pre-trained language models (PLMs) for text-enhanced temporal knowledge graph
completion. The knowledge stored in the parameters of a PLM allows TEMT to
produce rich semantic representations of facts and to generalize on previously
unseen entities. TEMT leverages textual and temporal information available in a
KG, treats them separately, and fuses them to get plausibility scores of facts.
Unlike previous approaches, TEMT effectively captures dependencies across
different time points and enables predictions on unseen entities. To assess the
performance of TEMT, we carried out several experiments including time interval
prediction, both in transductive and inductive settings, and triple
classification. The experimental results show that TEMT is competitive with the
state-of-the-art.]]></summary>

function optimization tasks, requires practitioners to carefully select priors
that well model their functions of interest. Rather than specifying by hand,
researchers have investigated transfer learning based methods to automatically
learn the priors, e.g. multi-task BO (Swersky et al., 2013), few-shot BO
(Wistuba and Grabocka, 2021) and HyperBO (Wang et al., 2022). However, those
prior learning methods typically assume that the input domains are the same for
all tasks, weakening their ability to use observations on functions with
different domains or generalize the learned priors to BO on different search
spaces. In this work, we present HyperBO+: a pre-training approach for
hierarchical Gaussian processes that enables the same prior to work universally
for Bayesian optimization on functions with different domains. We propose a
two-step pre-training method and analyze its appealing asymptotic properties
and benefits to BO both theoretically and empirically. On real-world
hyperparameter tuning tasks that involve multiple search spaces, we demonstrate
that HyperBO+ is able to generalize to unseen search spaces and achieves lower

applications in various fields of artificial intelligence, including natural
language processing (NLP). Although some efforts based on syntactic analysis
have opened the door to research in Quantum NLP (QNLP), limitations such as
heavy syntactic preprocessing and syntax-dependent network architecture make
them impracticable on larger and real-world data sets. In this paper, we
propose a new simple network architecture, called the quantum self-attention
neural network (QSANN), which can compensate for these limitations.
Specifically, we introduce the self-attention mechanism into quantum neural
networks and then utilize a Gaussian projected quantum self-attention serving
as a sensible quantum version of self-attention. As a result, QSANN is
effective and scalable on larger data sets and has the desirable property of
being implementable on near-term quantum devices. In particular, our QSANN
outperforms the best existing QNLP model based on syntactic analysis as well as
a simple classical self-attention neural network in numerical experiments of
text classification tasks on public data sets. We further show that our method

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graphon estimation has been one of the most fundamental problems in network
analysis and has received considerable attention in the past decade. From the
statistical perspective, the minimax error rate of graphon estimation has been
established by Gao et al (2015) for both stochastic block model (SBM) and
nonparametric graphon estimation. The statistical optimal estimators are based
on constrained least squares and have computational complexity exponential in
the dimension. From the computational perspective, the best-known
polynomial-time estimator is based on universal singular value thresholding
(USVT), but it can only achieve a much slower estimation error rate than the
minimax one. It is natural to wonder if such a gap is essential. The
computational optimality of the USVT or the existence of a computational
barrier in graphon estimation has been a long-standing open problem. In this
work, we take the first step towards it and provide rigorous evidence for the
computational barrier in graphon estimation via low-degree polynomials.
Specifically, in both SBM and nonparametric graphon estimation, we show that
for low-degree polynomial estimators, their estimation error rates cannot be
significantly better than that of the USVT under a wide range of parameter
regimes. Our results are proved based on the recent development of low-degree
polynomials by Schramm and Wein (2022), while we overcome a few key challenges
in applying it to the general graphon estimation problem. By leveraging our
main results, we also provide a computational lower bound on the clustering
error for community detection in SBM with a growing number of communities and
this yields a new piece of evidence for the conjectured Kesten-Stigum threshold
for efficient community recovery.]]></summary>

information retrieval algorithm, BM25, provide a weak supervision signal to
train an extractive QA model. We also curate new QA pairs using information
retrieval techniques, guided by the clinicaltrials.gov schema and the
structured abstracts of articles, in the absence of annotated data from
biomedical domain experts. Furthermore, we explore augmenting the training data
of a deep neural network model with linguistic features from external sources
such as lexical databases to account for variations in word morphology and
meaning. To better utilize our training data, we apply curriculum learning to
domain adaptation, fine-tuning our QA model in stages based on characteristics

arrhythmias that affects millions of people each year worldwide and it is
closely linked to increased risk of cardiovascular diseases such as stroke and
heart failure. Machine learning methods have shown promising results in
evaluating the risk of developing atrial fibrillation from the
electrocardiogram. We aim to develop and evaluate one such algorithm on a large
CODE dataset collected in Brazil.

Results: The deep neural network model identified patients without indication
of AF in the presented ECG but who will develop AF in the future with an AUC
score of 0.845. From our survival model, we obtain that patients in the
high-risk group (i.e. with the probability of a future AF case being greater
than 0.7) are 50% more likely to develop AF within 40 weeks, while patients
belonging to the minimal-risk group (i.e. with the probability of a future AF
case being less than or equal to 0.1) have more than 85% chance of remaining AF
free up until after seven years.

Conclusion: We developed and validated a model for AF risk prediction. If
applied in clinical practice, the model possesses the potential of providing
valuable and useful information in decision-making and patient management
processes.]]></summary>

in neuroscience. While spontaneous reactivation of memories during sleep in
rodents is known to support memory consolidation and offline learning,
capturing memory replay in humans is challenging due to the absence of
well-annotated sleep datasets and the substantial differences in neural
patterns between wakefulness and sleep. To address these challenges, we
designed a novel cognitive neuroscience experiment and collected a
comprehensive, well-annotated electroencephalography (EEG) dataset from 52
subjects during both wakefulness and sleep. Leveraging this benchmark dataset,
we developed the Universal Sleep Decoder (USD) to align neural representations
between wakefulness and sleep across subjects. Our model achieves up to 16.6%
top-1 zero-shot accuracy on unseen subjects, comparable to decoding
performances using individual sleep data. Furthermore, fine-tuning USD on test
subjects enhances decoding accuracy to 25.9% top-1 accuracy, a substantial
improvement over the baseline chance of 6.7%. Model comparison and ablation
analyses reveal that our design choices, including the use of (i) an additional

particularly for in-situ exploration and sampling to stand in for human
explorers. Currently, humans drive robots to meet scientific objectives, but
depending on the robot's location, the exchange of information and driving
commands between the human operator and robot may cause undue delays in mission
fulfillment. An autonomous robot encoded with a scientific objective and an
exploration strategy incurs no communication delays and can fulfill missions
more quickly. Active learning algorithms offer this capability of intelligent
exploration, but the underlying model structure varies the performance of the
active learning algorithm in accurately forming an understanding of the
environment. In this paper, we investigate the performance differences between
active learning algorithms driven by Gaussian processes or Bayesian neural
networks for exploration strategies encoded on agents that are constrained in
their trajectories, like planetary surface rovers. These two active learning
strategies were tested in a simulation environment against science-blind
strategies to predict the spatial distribution of a variable of interest along
multiple datasets. The performance metrics of interest are model accuracy in
root mean squared (RMS) error, training time, model convergence, total distance
traveled until convergence, and total samples until convergence. Active
learning strategies encoded with Gaussian processes require less computation to
train, converge to an accurate model more quickly, and propose trajectories of
shorter distance, except in a few complex environments in which Bayesian neural
networks achieve a more accurate model in the large data regime due to their
more expressive functional bases. The paper concludes with advice on when and
how to implement either exploration strategy for future space missions.]]></summary>

by enabling direct material joining and offers several advantages such as
cost-effective manufacturing of complex parts, reducing manufacturing waste,
and opening new possibilities for manufacturing automation. One group of
materials for which additive manufacturing holds great potential for enhancing
component performance and properties is Functionally Graded Materials (FGMs).
FGMs are advanced composite materials that exhibit smoothly varying properties
making them desirable for applications in aerospace, automobile, biomedical,
and defense industries. Such composition differs from traditional composite
materials, since the location-dependent composition changes gradually in FGMs,
leading to enhanced properties. Recently, machine learning techniques have
emerged as a promising means for fabrication of FGMs through optimizing
processing parameters, improving product quality, and detecting manufacturing
defects. This paper first provides a brief literature review of works related
to FGM fabrication, followed by reviewing works on employing machine learning
in additive manufacturing, Afterward, we provide an overview of published works
in the literature related to the application of machine learning methods in
Directed Energy Deposition and for fabrication of FGMs.]]></summary>

machine learning (ML) models from large-scale and widely dispersed clients
while protecting their privacy. However, when different clients' datasets are
heterogeneous, traditional FL mechanisms produce a global model that does not
adequately represent the poorer clients with limited data resources, resulting
in lower accuracy and higher bias on their local data. According to the Matthew
effect, which describes how the advantaged gain more advantage and the
disadvantaged lose more over time, deploying such a global model in client
applications may worsen the resource disparity among the clients and harm the
principles of social welfare and fairness. To mitigate the Matthew effect, we
propose Egalitarian Fairness Federated Learning (EFFL), where egalitarian
fairness refers to the global model learned from FL has: (1) equal accuracy
among clients; (2) equal decision bias among clients. Besides achieving
egalitarian fairness among the clients, EFFL also aims for performance
optimality, minimizing the empirical risk loss and the bias for each client;
both are essential for any ML model training, whether centralized or
decentralized. We formulate EFFL as a constrained multi-constrained
multi-objectives optimization (MCMOO) problem, with the decision bias and
egalitarian fairness as constraints and the minimization of the empirical risk
losses on all clients as multiple objectives to be optimized. We propose a
gradient-based three-stage algorithm to obtain the Pareto optimal solutions
within the constraint space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EFFL
outperforms other state-of-the-art FL algorithms in achieving a
high-performance global model with enhanced egalitarian fairness among all
clients.]]></summary>

domains, but their widespread applicability is hindered by inherent limitations
such as overconfidence in predictions, lack of interpretability, and
vulnerability to adversarial attacks. To address these challenges, Bayesian
neural networks (BNNs) have emerged as a compelling extension of conventional
neural networks, integrating uncertainty estimation into their predictive
capabilities.

This comprehensive primer presents a systematic introduction to the
fundamental concepts of neural networks and Bayesian inference, elucidating
their synergistic integration for the development of BNNs. The target audience
comprises statisticians with a potential background in Bayesian methods but
lacking deep learning expertise, as well as machine learners proficient in deep
neural networks but with limited exposure to Bayesian statistics. We provide an
overview of commonly employed priors, examining their impact on model behavior
and performance. Additionally, we delve into the practical considerations
associated with training and inference in BNNs.

Furthermore, we explore advanced topics within the realm of BNN research,
acknowledging the existence of ongoing debates and controversies. By offering
insights into cutting-edge developments, this primer not only equips
researchers and practitioners with a solid foundation in BNNs, but also
illuminates the potential applications of this dynamic field. As a valuable
resource, it fosters an understanding of BNNs and their promising prospects,

encompassing tens of thousands of ICU patients in several hospitals. We
consider a wide array of density-based methods and SOTA post-hoc detectors
across diverse predictive architectures, including MLP, ResNet, and
Transformer. Our findings show that i) the problem appears to be solved for

classification models using labeled and unlabeled datasets. However, existing
SSL methods rely on a large unlabeled dataset, which may not always be
available in many real-world applications due to legal constraints (e.g.,
GDPR). In this paper, we investigate the research question: Can we train SSL
models without real unlabeled datasets? Instead of using real unlabeled
datasets, we propose an SSL method using synthetic datasets generated from
generative foundation models trained on datasets containing millions of samples
in diverse domains (e.g., ImageNet). Our main concepts are identifying
synthetic samples that emulate unlabeled samples from generative foundation
models and training classifiers using these synthetic samples. To achieve this,
our method is formulated as an alternating optimization problem: (i)
meta-learning of generative foundation models and (ii) SSL of classifiers using
real labeled and synthetic unlabeled samples. For (i), we propose a
meta-learning objective that optimizes latent variables to generate samples
that resemble real labeled samples and minimize the validation loss. For (ii),
we propose a simple unsupervised loss function that regularizes the feature
extractors of classifiers to maximize the performance improvement obtained from
synthetic samples. We confirm that our method outperforms baselines using
generative foundation models on SSL. We also demonstrate that our methods
outperform SSL using real unlabeled datasets in scenarios with extremely small

method, which makes sequential decisions based on a Bayesian model, typically a
Gaussian process (GP), of the function. To ensure the quality of the model,
transfer learning approaches have been developed to automatically design GP
priors by learning from observations on "training" functions. These training
functions are typically required to have the same domain as the "test" function
(black-box function to be optimized). In this paper, we introduce MPHD, a model
pre-training method on heterogeneous domains, which uses a neural net mapping
from domain-specific contexts to specifications of hierarchical GPs. MPHD can
be seamlessly integrated with BO to transfer knowledge across heterogeneous

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The increasing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) raise
opportunities for artificial general intelligence but concurrently amplify
safety concerns, such as potential misuse of AI systems, necessitating
effective AI alignment. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has
emerged as a promising pathway towards AI alignment but brings forth challenges
due to its complexity and dependence on a separate reward model. Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed as an alternative, and it
remains equivalent to RLHF under the reverse KL regularization constraint. This
paper presents $f$-DPO, a generalized approach to DPO by incorporating diverse
divergence constraints. We show that under certain $f$-divergences, including
Jensen-Shannon divergence, forward KL divergences and $\alpha$-divergences, the
complex relationship between the reward and optimal policy can also be
simplified by addressing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. This eliminates the
need for estimating the normalizing constant in the Bradley-Terry model and
enables a tractable mapping between the reward function and the optimal policy.
Our approach optimizes LLMs to align with human preferences in a more efficient
and supervised manner under a broad set of divergence constraints. Empirically,
adopting these divergences ensures a balance between alignment performance and
generation diversity. Importantly, $f$-DPO outperforms PPO-based methods in
divergence efficiency, and divergence constraints directly influence expected
calibration error (ECE).]]></summary>

medical field to manufacturing and wireless communication. Generating realistic
and useful exemplars and prototypes is a fundamental data analysis task. In
this paper, we investigate a novel approach to generating realistic and useful
exemplars and prototypes for time series data. Our approach uses a new form of
time series average, the ShapeDTW Barycentric Average. We therefore turn our
attention to accurately generating time series prototypes with a novel
approach. The existing time series prototyping approaches rely on the Dynamic
Time Warping (DTW) similarity measure such as DTW Barycentering Average (DBA)
and SoftDBA. These last approaches suffer from a common problem of generating
out-of-distribution artifacts in their prototypes. This is mostly caused by the
DTW variant used and its incapability of detecting neighborhood similarities,
instead it detects absolute similarities. Our proposed method, ShapeDBA, uses
the ShapeDTW variant of DTW, that overcomes this issue. We chose time series
clustering, a popular form of time series analysis to evaluate the outcome of
ShapeDBA compared to the other prototyping approaches. Coupled with the k-means
clustering algorithm, and evaluated on a total of 123 datasets from the UCR
archive, our proposed averaging approach is able to achieve new
state-of-the-art results in terms of Adjusted Rand Index.]]></summary>

domains, but their widespread applicability is hindered by inherent limitations
such as overconfidence in predictions, lack of interpretability, and
vulnerability to adversarial attacks. To address these challenges, Bayesian
neural networks (BNNs) have emerged as a compelling extension of conventional
neural networks, integrating uncertainty estimation into their predictive
capabilities.

This comprehensive primer presents a systematic introduction to the
fundamental concepts of neural networks and Bayesian inference, elucidating
their synergistic integration for the development of BNNs. The target audience
comprises statisticians with a potential background in Bayesian methods but
lacking deep learning expertise, as well as machine learners proficient in deep
neural networks but with limited exposure to Bayesian statistics. We provide an
overview of commonly employed priors, examining their impact on model behavior
and performance. Additionally, we delve into the practical considerations
associated with training and inference in BNNs.

Furthermore, we explore advanced topics within the realm of BNN research,
acknowledging the existence of ongoing debates and controversies. By offering
insights into cutting-edge developments, this primer not only equips
researchers and practitioners with a solid foundation in BNNs, but also
illuminates the potential applications of this dynamic field. As a valuable
resource, it fosters an understanding of BNNs and their promising prospects,
facilitating further advancements in the pursuit of knowledge and innovation.]]></summary>

applies multiple univariate tests on the individual features, followed by
p-value adjustments. Such an approach suffers when the data carry numerous
features. A number of studies have shown that classification accuracy can be
seen as a proxy for two-sample testing. However, neither theoretical
foundations nor practical recipes have been proposed so far on how this
strategy could be extended to multidimensional paired-sample testing. In this
work, we put forward the idea that scoring functions can be produced by the
decision rules defined by the perpendicular bisecting hyperplanes of the line
segments connecting each pair of instances. Then, the optimal scoring function
can be obtained by the pseudomedian of those rules, which we estimate by
extending naturally the Hodges-Lehmann estimator. We accordingly propose a
framework of a two-step testing procedure. First, we estimate the bisecting
hyperplanes for each pair of instances and an aggregated rule derived through
the Hodges-Lehmann estimator. The paired samples are scored by this aggregated
rule to produce a unidimensional representation. Second, we perform a Wilcoxon
signed-rank test on the obtained representation. Our experiments indicate that
our approach has substantial performance gains in testing accuracy compared to
the traditional multivariate and multiple testing, while at the same time
estimates each feature's contribution to the final result.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Batch reinforcement learning (RL) defines the task of learning from a fixed
batch of data lacking exhaustive exploration. Worst-case optimality algorithms,
which calibrate a value-function model class from logged experience and perform
some type of pessimistic evaluation under the learned model, have emerged as a
promising paradigm for batch RL. However, contemporary works on this stream
have commonly overlooked the hierarchical decision-making structure hidden in
the optimization landscape. In this paper, we adopt a game-theoretical
viewpoint and model the policy learning diagram as a two-player general-sum
game with a leader-follower structure. We propose a novel stochastic
gradient-based learning algorithm: StackelbergLearner, in which the leader
player updates according to the total derivative of its objective instead of
the usual individual gradient, and the follower player makes individual updates
and ensures transition-consistent pessimistic reasoning. The derived learning
dynamic naturally lends StackelbergLearner to a game-theoretic interpretation
and provides a convergence guarantee to differentiable Stackelberg equilibria.
From a theoretical standpoint, we provide instance-dependent regret bounds with
general function approximation, which shows that our algorithm can learn a
best-effort policy that is able to compete against any comparator policy that
is covered by batch data. Notably, our theoretical regret guarantees only
require realizability without any data coverage and strong function
approximation conditions, e.g., Bellman closedness, which is in contrast to
prior works lacking such guarantees. Through comprehensive experiments, we find
that our algorithm consistently performs as well or better as compared to
state-of-the-art methods in batch RL benchmark and real-world datasets.]]></summary>

been developed to highlight the edges and nodes in the graph that contribute
the most to the model predictions. However, it is not clear yet how to evaluate
the correctness of those explanations, whether it is from a human or a model
perspective. One unaddressed bottleneck in the current evaluation procedure is
the problem of out-of-distribution explanations, whose distribution differs
from those of the training data. This important issue affects existing
evaluation metrics such as the popular faithfulness or fidelity score. In this
paper, we show the limitations of faithfulness metrics. We propose GInX-Eval
(Graph In-distribution eXplanation Evaluation), an evaluation procedure of
graph explanations that overcomes the pitfalls of faithfulness and offers new
insights on explainability methods. Using a retraining strategy, the GInX score
measures how informative removed edges are for the model and the EdgeRank score
evaluates if explanatory edges are correctly ordered by their importance.
GInX-Eval verifies if ground-truth explanations are instructive to the GNN
model. In addition, it shows that many popular methods, including
gradient-based methods, produce explanations that are not better than a random
designation of edges as important subgraphs, challenging the findings of
current works in the area. Results with GInX-Eval are consistent across
multiple datasets and align with human evaluation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Contrastive learning is a self-supervised representation learning framework,
where two positive views generated through data augmentation are made similar
by an attraction force in a data representation space, while a repulsive force
makes them far from negative examples. Non-contrastive learning, represented by
BYOL and SimSiam, further gets rid of negative examples and improves
computational efficiency. While learned representations may collapse into a
single point due to the lack of the repulsive force at first sight, Tian et al.
(2021) revealed through the learning dynamics analysis that the representations
can avoid collapse if data augmentation is sufficiently stronger than
regularization. However, their analysis does not take into account
commonly-used feature normalization, a normalizer before measuring the
similarity of representations, and hence excessively strong regularization may
collapse the dynamics, which is an unnatural behavior under the presence of
feature normalization. Therefore, we extend the previous theory based on the L2
loss by considering the cosine loss, which involves feature normalization. We
show that the cosine loss induces sixth-order dynamics (while the L2 loss
induces a third-order one), in which a stable equilibrium dynamically emerges
even if there are only collapsed solutions with given initial parameters. Thus,
we offer a new understanding that feature normalization plays an important role
in robustly preventing the dynamics collapse.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In representation learning, regression has traditionally received less
attention than classification. Directly applying representation learning
techniques designed for classification to regression often results in
fragmented representations in the latent space, yielding sub-optimal
performance. In this paper, we argue that the potential of contrastive learning
for regression has been overshadowed due to the neglect of two crucial aspects:
ordinality-awareness and hardness. To address these challenges, we advocate
"mixup your own contrastive pairs for supervised contrastive regression",
instead of relying solely on real/augmented samples. Specifically, we propose
Supervised Contrastive Learning for Regression with Mixup (SupReMix). It takes
anchor-inclusive mixtures (mixup of the anchor and a distinct negative sample)
as hard negative pairs and anchor-exclusive mixtures (mixup of two distinct
negative samples) as hard positive pairs at the embedding level. This strategy
formulates harder contrastive pairs by integrating richer ordinal information.
Through extensive experiments on six regression datasets including 2D images,
volumetric images, text, tabular data, and time-series signals, coupled with
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that SupReMix pre-training fosters
continuous ordered representations of regression data, resulting in significant
improvement in regression performance. Furthermore, SupReMix is superior to
other approaches in a range of regression challenges including transfer
learning, imbalanced training data, and scenarios with fewer training samples.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Standard practice within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
involves optimizing against a Reward Model (RM), which itself is trained to
reflect human preferences for desirable generations. A notable subject that is
understudied is the (in-)consistency of RMs -- whether they can recognize the
semantic changes to different prompts and appropriately adapt their reward
assignments -- and their impact on the downstream RLHF model.

In this paper, we visit a series of research questions relevant to RM
inconsistency: (1) How can we measure the consistency of reward models? (2) How
consistent are the existing RMs and how can we improve them? (3) In what ways
does reward inconsistency influence the chatbots resulting from the RLHF model
training?

We propose Contrast Instructions -- a benchmarking strategy for the
consistency of RM. Each example in Contrast Instructions features a pair of
lexically similar instructions with different ground truth responses. A
consistent RM is expected to rank the corresponding instruction and response
higher than other combinations. We observe that current RMs trained with the
standard ranking objective fail miserably on Contrast Instructions compared to
average humans. To show that RM consistency can be improved efficiently without
using extra training budget, we propose two techniques ConvexDA and
RewardFusion, which enhance reward consistency through extrapolation during the
RM training and inference stage, respectively. We show that RLHF models trained
with a more consistent RM yield more useful responses, suggesting that reward
inconsistency exhibits a trickle-down effect on the downstream RLHF process.]]></summary>

systems (CPS). However, due to the increasing complexity of attacks and CPS
themselves, anomaly detection in CPS is becoming more and more challenging. In
our previous work, we proposed a digital twin-based anomaly detection method,
called ATTAIN, which takes advantage of both historical and real-time data of
CPS. However, such data vary significantly in terms of difficulty. Therefore,
similar to human learning processes, deep learning models (e.g., ATTAIN) can
benefit from an easy-to-difficult curriculum. To this end, in this paper, we
present a novel approach, named digitaL twin-based Anomaly deTecTion wIth
Curriculum lEarning (LATTICE), which extends ATTAIN by introducing curriculum
learning to optimize its learning paradigm. LATTICE attributes each sample with
a difficulty score, before being fed into a training scheduler. The training
scheduler samples batches of training data based on these difficulty scores
such that learning from easy to difficult data can be performed. To evaluate
LATTICE, we use five publicly available datasets collected from five real-world
CPS testbeds. We compare LATTICE with ATTAIN and two other state-of-the-art
anomaly detectors. Evaluation results show that LATTICE outperforms the three
baselines and ATTAIN by 0.906%-2.367% in terms of the F1 score. LATTICE also,
on average, reduces the training time of ATTAIN by 4.2% on the five datasets
and is on par with the baselines in terms of detection delay time.]]></summary>

factors associated with post-COVID-19 mental health disorders. Our analysis,
based on data collected from 669 patients across various provinces in Iraq,
yielded valuable insights. We found that age, gender, and geographical region
of residence were significant demographic factors influencing the likelihood of
developing mental health disorders in post-COVID-19 patients. Additionally,
comorbidities and the severity of COVID-19 illness were important clinical
predictors. Psychosocial factors, such as social support, coping strategies,
and perceived stress levels, also played a substantial role. Our findings
emphasize the complex interplay of multiple factors in the development of
mental health disorders following COVID-19 recovery. Healthcare providers and
policymakers should consider these risk factors when designing targeted
interventions and support systems for individuals at risk. Machine
learning-based approaches can provide a valuable tool for predicting and
preventing adverse mental health outcomes in post-COVID-19 patients. Further
research and prospective studies are needed to validate these findings and
enhance our understanding of the long-term psychological impact of the COVID-19
pandemic. This study contributes to the growing body of knowledge regarding the
mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and underscores the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Decision forests are widely used for classification and regression tasks. A
lesser known property of tree-based methods is that one can construct a
proximity matrix from the tree(s), and these proximity matrices are induced
kernels. While there has been extensive research on the applications and
properties of kernels, there is relatively little research on kernels induced
by decision forests. We construct Kernel Mean Embedding Random Forests (KMERF),
which induce kernels from random trees and/or forests using leaf-node
proximity. We introduce the notion of an asymptotically characteristic kernel,
and prove that KMERF kernels are asymptotically characteristic for both
discrete and continuous data. Because KMERF is data-adaptive, we suspected it
would outperform kernels selected a priori on finite sample data. We illustrate
that KMERF nearly dominates current state-of-the-art kernel-based tests across
a diverse range of high-dimensional two-sample and independence testing
settings. Furthermore, our forest-based approach is interpretable, and provides
feature importance metrics that readily distinguish important dimensions,
unlike other high-dimensional non-parametric testing procedures. Hence, this
work demonstrates the decision forest-based kernel can be more powerful and
more interpretable than existing methods, flying in the face of conventional
wisdom of the trade-off between the two.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Modern DNN-based recommendation systems rely on training-derived embeddings
of sparse features. Input sparsity makes obtaining high-quality embeddings for
rarely-occurring categories harder as their representations are updated
infrequently. We demonstrate a training-time technique to produce superior
embeddings via effective cross-category learning and theoretically explain its
surprising effectiveness. The scheme, termed the multi-layer embeddings
training (MLET), trains embeddings using factorization of the embedding layer,
with an inner dimension higher than the target embedding dimension. For
inference efficiency, MLET converts the trained two-layer embedding into a
single-layer one thus keeping inference-time model size unchanged.

Empirical superiority of MLET is puzzling as its search space is not larger
than that of the single-layer embedding. The strong dependence of MLET on the
inner dimension is even more surprising. We develop a theory that explains both
of these behaviors by showing that MLET creates an adaptive update mechanism
modulated by the singular vectors of embeddings. When tested on multiple
state-of-the-art recommendation models for click-through rate (CTR) prediction
tasks, MLET consistently produces better models, especially for rare items. At
constant model quality, MLET allows embedding dimension, and model size,
reduction by up to 16x, and 5.8x on average, across the models.]]></summary>

3133 eyes of 1568 ocular hypertension treatment study (OHTS) participants with
at least five follow-up VF tests were included in the study. Methods: We used a
latent class mixed model (LCMM) to identify OHT subtypes using standard

the subtypes based on demographic, clinical, ocular, and VF factors at the
baseline. We then identified factors driving fast VF progression using
generalized estimating equation (GEE) and justified findings qualitatively and
quantitatively. Results: The LCMM model discovered four clusters (subtypes) of
eyes with different trajectories of MD worsening. The number of eyes in
clusters were 794 (25%), 1675 (54%), 531 (17%) and 133 (4%). We labelled the
clusters as Improvers, Stables, Slow progressors, and Fast progressors based on
their mean of MD decline, which were 0.08, -0.06, -0.21, and -0.45 dB/year,

of the self-information contained in this claim. A probability of occurrence of
the claim is obtained from a language model and this probability is used to
compute the self-information. Grounded in information theory, this approach is
based on the assumption that an unlikely concept is more informative than a
usual concept, insofar as it is more surprising. In turn, the more surprising
the information required to defined the claim, the narrower its scope. Five
language models are considered, ranging from simplest models (each word or
character is assigned an identical probability) to intermediate models (using
average word or character frequencies), to a large language model (GPT2).
Interestingly, the scope resulting from the simplest language models is
proportional to the reciprocal of the number of words or characters involved in
the claim, a metric already used in previous works. Application is made to
multiple series of patent claims directed to distinct inventions, where each
series consists of claims devised to have a gradually decreasing scope. The
performance of the language models is assessed with respect to several ad hoc
tests. The more sophisticated the model, the better the results. I.e., the GPT2
probability model outperforms models based on word and character frequencies,
which themselves outdo the simplest models based on word or character counts.
Still, the character count appears to be a more reliable indicator than the
word count.]]></summary>

(LLMs) that supports finetuning LLMs with 65B parameters in 3-bit or 4-bit
precision on as little as one 48GB GPU. Our method, modular low-rank adaptation
(ModuLoRA), integrates any user-specified weight quantizer with finetuning via
low-rank adapters (LoRAs). Our approach relies on a simple
quantization-agnostic backward pass that adaptively materializes low-precision
LLM weights from a custom black-box quantization module. This approach enables
finetuning 3-bit LLMs for the first time--leveraging state-of-the-art 3-bit
OPTQ quantization often outperforms finetuning that relies on less
sophisticated 4-bit and 8-bit methods. In our experiments, ModuLoRA attains
competitive performance on text classification, natural language infernece, and
instruction following tasks using significantly less memory than existing
approaches, and we also surpass the state-of-the-art ROUGE score on a popular
summarization task. We release ModuLoRA together with a series of low-precision
models--including the first family of 3-bit instruction following Alpaca
LLMs--as part of LLMTOOLS, a user-friendly library for quantizing, running, and
finetuning LLMs on consumer GPUs.]]></summary>

objective of 6G. Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a potential paradigm,
facilitating decentralized AI model training across a diverse range of devices
under the coordination of a central server. However, several challenges hinder
its wide application in the 6G context, such as malicious attacks and privacy
snooping on local model updates, and centralization pitfalls. This work
proposes a trusted architecture for supporting FL, which utilizes Distributed
Ledger Technology (DLT) and Graph Neural Network (GNN), including three key
features. First, a pre-processing layer employing homomorphic encryption is
incorporated to securely aggregate local models, preserving the privacy of
individual models. Second, given the distributed nature and graph structure
between clients and nodes in the pre-processing layer, GNN is leveraged to
identify abnormal local models, enhancing system security. Third, DLT is
utilized to decentralize the system by selecting one of the candidates to
perform the central server's functions. Additionally, DLT ensures reliable data
management by recording data exchanges in an immutable and transparent ledger.
The feasibility of the novel architecture is validated through simulations,
demonstrating improved performance in anomalous model detection and global
model accuracy compared to relevant baselines.]]></summary>

increase rather than decrease the uncertainty of estimates, such as the
empirical prediction risk. It can act as a regularizer, but fails to do so in
certain high-dimensional problems, and it may shift the double-descent peak of
an empirical risk. Overall, the analysis shows that several properties data
augmentation has been attributed with are not either true or false, but rather
depend on a combination of factors -- notably the data distribution, the
properties of the estimator, and the interplay of sample size, number of
augmentations, and dimension. Our main theoretical tool is a limit theorem for
functions of randomly transformed, high-dimensional random vectors. The proof
draws on work in probability on noise stability of functions of many variables.]]></summary>

nanoscale devices that combine sensing, computing, data and energy storage, and
wireless communication. In precision medicine, these nanodevices show promise
for disease diagnostics, treatment, and monitoring from within the patients'
bloodstreams. Assigning the location of a sensed biological event with the
event itself, which is the main proposition of flow-guided in-body nanoscale
localization, would be immensely beneficial from the perspective of precision
medicine. The nanoscale nature of the nanodevices and the challenging
environment that the bloodstream represents, result in current flow-guided
localization approaches being constrained in their communication and
energy-related capabilities. The communication and energy constraints of the
nanodevices result in different features of raw data for flow-guided
localization, in turn affecting its performance. An analytical modeling of the
effects of imperfect communication and constrained energy causing intermittent
operation of the nanodevices on the raw data produced by the nanodevices would
be beneficial. Hence, we propose an analytical model of raw data for
flow-guided localization, where the raw data is modeled as a function of
communication and energy-related capabilities of the nanodevice. We evaluate
the model by comparing its output with the one obtained through the utilization
of a simulator for objective evaluation of flow-guided localization, featuring
comparably higher level of realism. Our results across a number of scenarios
and heterogeneous performance metrics indicate high similarity between the
model and simulator-generated raw datasets.]]></summary>

be characterized using classical Gaussian processes. More flexible spatial
extremes models exhibit appealing extremal dependence properties but are often
exceedingly prohibitive to fit and simulate from in high dimensions. In this
paper, we develop a new spatial extremes model that has flexible and
non-stationary dependence properties, and we integrate it in the
encoding-decoding structure of a variational autoencoder (XVAE), whose
parameters are estimated via variational Bayes combined with deep learning. The
XVAE can be used as a spatio-temporal emulator that characterizes the
distribution of potential mechanistic model output states and produces outputs
that have the same statistical properties as the inputs, especially in the
tail. As an aside, our approach also provides a novel way of making fast
inference with complex extreme-value processes. Through extensive simulation
studies, we show that our XVAE is substantially more time-efficient than
traditional Bayesian inference while also outperforming many spatial extremes
models with a stationary dependence structure. To further demonstrate the
computational power of the XVAE, we analyze a high-resolution satellite-derived
dataset of sea surface temperature in the Red Sea, which includes 30 years of
daily measurements at 16703 grid cells. We find that the extremal dependence
strength is weaker in the interior of Red Sea and it has decreased slightly
over time.]]></summary>

certain assumptions and approximations. Therefore, analyses and designs carried
out based on these equations are also approximate. The emergence of data-driven
models has, to a certain degree, addressed this challenge; however, the purely
data-driven models often (a) lack interpretability, (b) are data-hungry, and
(c) do not generalize beyond the training window. Operator learning has
recently been proposed as a potential alternative to address the aforementioned
challenges; however, the challenges are still persistent. We here argue that
one of the possible solutions resides in data-physics fusion, where the
data-driven model is used to correct/identify the missing physics. To that end,
we propose a novel Differentiable Physics Augmented Wavelet Neural Operator
(DPA-WNO). The proposed DPA-WNO blends a differentiable physics solver with the
Wavelet Neural Operator (WNO), where the role of WNO is to model the missing
physics. This empowers the proposed framework to exploit the capability of WNO
to learn from data while retaining the interpretability and generalizability
associated with physics-based solvers. We illustrate the applicability of the
proposed approach in solving time-dependent uncertainty quantification problems
due to randomness in the initial condition. Four benchmark uncertainty
quantification and reliability analysis examples from various fields of science
and engineering are solved using the proposed approach. The results presented

show that for i.i.d. data the test is strongly consistent. More generally, we
develop information-theoretic upper bounds on the excess risk that uniformly

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Provenance graphs are structured audit logs that describe the history of a
system's execution. Recent studies have explored a variety of techniques to
analyze provenance graphs for automated host intrusion detection, focusing
particularly on advanced persistent threats. Sifting through their design
documents, we identify four common dimensions that drive the development of
provenance-based intrusion detection systems (PIDSes): scope (can PIDSes detect
modern attacks that infiltrate across application boundaries?), attack
agnosticity (can PIDSes detect novel attacks without a priori knowledge of
attack characteristics?), timeliness (can PIDSes efficiently monitor host
systems as they run?), and attack reconstruction (can PIDSes distill attack
activity from large provenance graphs so that sysadmins can easily understand
and quickly respond to system intrusion?). We present KAIROS, the first PIDS
that simultaneously satisfies the desiderata in all four dimensions, whereas
existing approaches sacrifice at least one and struggle to achieve comparable
detection performance.

Kairos leverages a novel graph neural network-based encoder-decoder
architecture that learns the temporal evolution of a provenance graph's
structural changes to quantify the degree of anomalousness for each system
event. Then, based on this fine-grained information, Kairos reconstructs attack
footprints, generating compact summary graphs that accurately describe
malicious activity over a stream of system audit logs. Using state-of-the-art
benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that Kairos outperforms previous approaches.]]></summary>

classification tasks that result in discrimination. However, as machine
learning algorithms are applied in new contexts the harms and injustices that
result are qualitatively different than those presently studied. The existing
research paradigm in machine learning which develops metrics and definitions of
fairness cannot account for these qualitatively different types of injustice.
One example of this is the problem of algorithmic collusion and market
fairness. The negative consequences of algorithmic collusion affect all
consumers, not only particular members of a protected class. Drawing on this
case study, I propose an ethical framework for researchers and practitioners in
machine learning seeking to develop and apply fairness metrics that extends to
new domains. This contribution ties the development of formal metrics of
fairness to specifically scoped normative principles. This enables fairness
metrics to reflect different concerns from discrimination. I conclude with the
limitations of my proposal and discuss promising avenues for future research.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In root finding and optimization, there are many cases where there is a
closed set $A$ one likes that the sequence constructed by one's favourite
method will not converge to A (here, we do not assume extra properties on $A$
such as being convex or connected). For example, if one wants to find roots,
and one chooses initial points in the basin of attraction for 1 root $x^*$ (a
fact which one may not know before hand), then one will always end up in that
root. In this case, one would like to have a mechanism to avoid this point
$z^*$ in the next runs of one's algorithm.

In this paper, we propose two new methods aiming to achieve this. In the
first method, we divide the cost function by an appropriate power of the
distance function to $A$. This idea is inspired by how one would try to find
all roots of a function in 1 variable. In the second method, which is more
suitable for constrained optimization, we redefine the value of the function to
be a big constant on $A$. We also propose, based on this, an algorithm to
escape the basin of attraction of a component of positive dimension to reach
another component. As an application, we prove a rigorous guarantee for finding
roots of a meromorphic function of 1 complex variable in a given domain.

Along the way, we compare with main existing relevant methods in the current
literature. We provide several examples in various different settings to
illustrate the usefulness of the new approach.]]></summary>

dexterity, referred to as non-prehensile manipulation. Non-prehensile
manipulation may enable more complex interactions with the objects, but also
presents challenges in reasoning about gripper-object interactions. In this
work, we introduce Hybrid Actor-Critic Maps for Manipulation (HACMan), a
reinforcement learning approach for 6D non-prehensile manipulation of objects
using point cloud observations. HACMan proposes a temporally-abstracted and
spatially-grounded object-centric action representation that consists of
selecting a contact location from the object point cloud and a set of motion
parameters describing how the robot will move after making contact. We modify
an existing off-policy RL algorithm to learn in this hybrid discrete-continuous
action representation. We evaluate HACMan on a 6D object pose alignment task in
both simulation and in the real world. On the hardest version of our task, with
randomized initial poses, randomized 6D goals, and diverse object categories,
our policy demonstrates strong generalization to unseen object categories
without a performance drop, achieving an 89% success rate on unseen objects in
simulation and 50% success rate with zero-shot transfer in the real world.
Compared to alternative action representations, HACMan achieves a success rate
more than three times higher than the best baseline. With zero-shot sim2real
transfer, our policy can successfully manipulate unseen objects in the real
world for challenging non-planar goals, using dynamic and contact-rich
non-prehensile skills. Videos can be found on the project website:

model various NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems in the form of binary
variables. The Hamiltonian function is often used to formulate QUBO problems
where it is used as the objective function in the context of optimization.
Recently, PI-GNN, a generic scalable framework, has been proposed to address
the Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problems over graphs based on a simple
Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture. Their novel contribution was a generic
QUBO-formulated Hamiltonian-inspired loss function that was optimized using
GNN. In this study, we address a crucial issue related to the aforementioned
setup especially observed in denser graphs. The reinforcement learning-based
paradigm has also been widely used to address numerous CO problems. Here we
also formulate and empirically evaluate the compatibility of the
QUBO-formulated Hamiltonian as the generic reward function in the Reinforcement
Learning paradigm to directly integrate the actual node projection status
during training as the form of rewards. In our experiments, we observed up to
44% improvement in the RL-based setup compared to the PI-GNN algorithm. Our

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In response to recent data regulation requirements, machine unlearning (MU)
has emerged as a critical process to remove the influence of specific examples
from a given model. Although exact unlearning can be achieved through complete
model retraining using the remaining dataset, the associated computational
costs have driven the development of efficient, approximate unlearning
techniques. Moving beyond data-centric MU approaches, our study introduces a
novel model-based perspective: model sparsification via weight pruning, which
is capable of reducing the gap between exact unlearning and approximate
unlearning. We show in both theory and practice that model sparsity can boost
the multi-criteria unlearning performance of an approximate unlearner, closing
the approximation gap, while continuing to be efficient. This leads to a new MU
paradigm, termed prune first, then unlearn, which infuses a sparse model prior
into the unlearning process. Building on this insight, we also develop a
sparsity-aware unlearning method that utilizes sparsity regularization to
enhance the training process of approximate unlearning. Extensive experiments
show that our proposals consistently benefit MU in various unlearning
scenarios. A notable highlight is the 77% unlearning efficacy gain of
fine-tuning (one of the simplest unlearning methods) when using sparsity-aware
unlearning. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical impact of our proposed MU
methods in addressing other machine learning challenges, such as defending
against backdoor attacks and enhancing transfer learning. Codes are available

objectives under only affine noise variance and bounded smoothness assumptions.
The proof is essentially based on a novel auxiliary function $\xi$ that helps
eliminate the complexity of handling the correlation between the numerator and
denominator of AdaGrad's update. Leveraging simple proofs, we are able to
obtain tighter results than existing results \citep{faw2022power} and extend
the analysis to several new and important cases. Specifically, for the
over-parameterized regime, we show that AdaGrad needs only
$\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2})$ iterations to ensure the gradient norm
smaller than $\varepsilon$, which matches the rate of SGD and significantly
tighter than existing rates $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^4})$ for AdaGrad.
We then discard the bounded smoothness assumption and consider a realistic
assumption on smoothness called $(L_0,L_1)$-smooth condition, which allows
local smoothness to grow with the gradient norm. Again based on the auxiliary
function $\xi$, we prove that AdaGrad succeeds in converging under
$(L_0,L_1)$-smooth condition as long as the learning rate is lower than a
threshold. Interestingly, we further show that the requirement on learning rate
under the $(L_0,L_1)$-smooth condition is necessary via proof by contradiction,
in contrast with the case of uniform smoothness conditions where convergence is
guaranteed regardless of learning rate choices. Together, our analyses broaden
the understanding of AdaGrad and demonstrate the power of the new auxiliary
function in the investigations of AdaGrad.]]></summary>

loss is uniformly Lipschitz continuous over data (i.e. stochastic gradients are
uniformly bounded over all data points). While this assumption is convenient,
it often leads to pessimistic excess risk bounds. In many practical problems,
the worst-case (uniform) Lipschitz parameter of the loss over all data points
may be extremely large due to outliers. In such cases, the error bounds for DP
SO, which scale with the worst-case Lipschitz parameter of the loss, are
vacuous. To address these limitations, this work provides near-optimal excess
risk bounds that do not depend on the uniform Lipschitz parameter of the loss.
Building on a recent line of work (Wang et al., 2020; Kamath et al., 2022), we
assume that stochastic gradients have bounded $k$-th order moments for some $k
\geq 2$. Compared with works on uniformly Lipschitz DP SO, our excess risk
scales with the $k$-th moment bound instead of the uniform Lipschitz parameter
of the loss, allowing for significantly faster rates in the presence of
outliers and/or heavy-tailed data. For convex and strongly convex loss
functions, we provide the first asymptotically optimal excess risk bounds (up
to a logarithmic factor). In contrast to (Wang et al., 2020; Kamath et al.,
2022), our bounds do not require the loss function to be differentiable/smooth.
We also devise a linear-time algorithm for smooth losses that has excess risk
that is tight in certain practical parameter regimes. Additionally, our work is
the first to address non-convex non-uniformly Lipschitz loss functions
satisfying the Proximal-PL inequality; this covers some practical machine
learning models. Our Proximal-PL algorithm has near-optimal excess risk.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In many real-world tasks, the concerned objects can be represented as a
multi-instance bag associated with a candidate label set, which consists of one
ground-truth label and several false positive labels. Multi-instance
partial-label learning (MIPL) is a learning paradigm to deal with such tasks
and has achieved favorable performances. Existing MIPL approach follows the
instance-space paradigm by assigning augmented candidate label sets of bags to
each instance and aggregating bag-level labels from instance-level labels.
However, this scheme may be suboptimal as global bag-level information is
ignored and the predicted labels of bags are sensitive to predictions of
negative instances. In this paper, we study an alternative scheme where a
multi-instance bag is embedded into a single vector representation.
Accordingly, an intuitive algorithm named DEMIPL, i.e., Disambiguated attention
Embedding for Multi-Instance Partial-Label learning, is proposed. DEMIPL
employs a disambiguation attention mechanism to aggregate a multi-instance bag
into a single vector representation, followed by a momentum-based
disambiguation strategy to identify the ground-truth label from the candidate
label set. Furthermore, we introduce a real-world MIPL dataset for colorectal
cancer classification. Experimental results on benchmark and real-world
datasets validate the superiority of DEMIPL against the compared MIPL and
partial-label learning approaches.]]></summary>

applications, detecting distribution shift is critical. However, most existing
methods for detecting distribution shift are not well-suited to robotics
settings, where data often arrives in a streaming fashion and may be very
high-dimensional. In this work, we present an online method for detecting
distribution shift with guarantees on the false positive rate - i.e., when
there is no distribution shift, our system is very unlikely (with probability
$< \epsilon$) to falsely issue an alert; any alerts that are issued should
therefore be heeded. Our method is specifically designed for efficient
detection even with high dimensional data, and it empirically achieves up to
11x faster detection on realistic robotics settings compared to prior work
while maintaining a low false negative rate in practice (whenever there is a
distribution shift in our experiments, our method indeed emits an alert). We
demonstrate our approach in both simulation and hardware for a visual servoing
task, and show that our method indeed issues an alert before a failure occurs.]]></summary>

under-explored source of error in fair classification. In practice, the
variance on some data examples is so large that decisions can be effectively
arbitrary. To investigate this problem, we take an experimental approach and
make four overarching contributions: We 1) Define a metric called
self-consistency, derived from variance, which we use as a proxy for measuring
and reducing arbitrariness; 2) Develop an ensembling algorithm that abstains
from classification when a prediction would be arbitrary; 3) Conduct the
largest to-date empirical study of the role of variance (vis-a-vis
self-consistency and arbitrariness) in fair classification; and, 4) Release a
toolkit that makes the US Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) datasets easily
usable for future research. Altogether, our experiments reveal shocking
insights about the reliability of conclusions on benchmark datasets. Most
fairness classification benchmarks are close-to-fair when taking into account
the amount of arbitrariness present in predictions -- before we even try to
apply common fairness interventions. This finding calls into question the
practical utility of common algorithmic fairness methods, and in turn suggests
that we should fundamentally reconsider how we choose to measure fairness in
machine learning.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The soft Dice loss (SDL) has taken a pivotal role in numerous automated
segmentation pipelines in the medical imaging community. Over the last years,
some reasons behind its superior functioning have been uncovered and further
optimizations have been explored. However, there is currently no implementation
that supports its direct utilization in scenarios involving soft labels. Hence,
a synergy between the use of SDL and research leveraging the use of soft
labels, also in the context of model calibration, is still missing. In this
work, we introduce Dice semimetric losses (DMLs), which (i) are by design
identical to SDL in a standard setting with hard labels, but (ii) can be
employed in settings with soft labels. Our experiments on the public QUBIQ,
LiTS and KiTS benchmarks confirm the potential synergy of DMLs with soft labels
(e.g.\ averaging, label smoothing, and knowledge distillation) over hard labels
(e.g.\ majority voting and random selection). As a result, we obtain superior
Dice scores and model calibration, which supports the wider adoption of DMLs in
practice. The code is available at

establishing the robustness and trustworthiness of deep neural nets, especially
when they are used in safety-critical application domains such as autonomous
vehicles and precision medicine. However, the problem poses multiple practical
challenges, including scalability issues owing to large-sized networks, and the
generation of adversarial inputs that lack important qualities such as
naturalness and output-impartiality. This problem shares its end goal with the
task of patching neural nets where small changes in some of the network's
weights need to be discovered so that upon applying these changes, the modified
net produces the desirable output for a given set of inputs. We exploit this
connection by proposing to obtain an adversarial input from a patch, with the
underlying observation that the effect of changing the weights can also be
brought about by changing the inputs instead. Thus, this paper presents a novel
way to generate input perturbations that are adversarial for a given network by
using an efficient network patching technique. We note that the proposed method
is significantly more effective than the prior state-of-the-art techniques.]]></summary>

formulation that has a lower cost scaling than the prevailing Kohn-Sham DFT,
which is increasingly desired for contemporary molecular research. However, its
accuracy is limited by the kinetic energy density functional, which is
notoriously hard to approximate for non-periodic molecular systems. In this
work, we propose M-OFDFT, an OFDFT approach capable of solving molecular
systems using a deep-learning functional model. We build the essential
nonlocality into the model, which is made affordable by the concise density
representation as expansion coefficients under an atomic basis. With techniques
to address unconventional learning challenges therein, M-OFDFT achieves a
comparable accuracy with Kohn-Sham DFT on a wide range of molecules untouched
by OFDFT before. More attractively, M-OFDFT extrapolates well to molecules much
larger than those in training, which unleashes the appealing scaling for
studying large molecules including proteins, representing an advancement of the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scene representation has been a crucial design choice in robotic manipulation
systems. An ideal representation should be 3D, dynamic, and semantic to meet
the demands of diverse manipulation tasks. However, previous works often lack
all three properties simultaneously. In this work, we introduce D$^3$Fields -
dynamic 3D descriptor fields. These fields capture the dynamics of the
underlying 3D environment and encode both semantic features and instance masks.
Specifically, we project arbitrary 3D points in the workspace onto multi-view
2D visual observations and interpolate features derived from foundational
models. The resulting fused descriptor fields allow for flexible goal
specifications using 2D images with varied contexts, styles, and instances. To
evaluate the effectiveness of these descriptor fields, we apply our
representation to a wide range of robotic manipulation tasks in a zero-shot
manner. Through extensive evaluation in both real-world scenarios and
simulations, we demonstrate that D$^3$Fields are both generalizable and
effective for zero-shot robotic manipulation tasks. In quantitative comparisons
with state-of-the-art dense descriptors, such as Dense Object Nets and DINO,
D$^3$Fields exhibit significantly better generalization abilities and
manipulation accuracy.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Existing approaches defend against backdoor attacks in federated learning
(FL) mainly through a) mitigating the impact of infected models, or b)
excluding infected models. The former negatively impacts model accuracy, while
the latter usually relies on globally clear boundaries between benign and
infected model updates. However, model updates are easy to be mixed and
scattered throughout in reality due to the diverse distributions of local data.
This work focuses on excluding infected models in FL. Unlike previous
perspectives from a global view, we propose Snowball, a novel anti-backdoor FL
framework through bidirectional elections from an individual perspective
inspired by one principle deduced by us and two principles in FL and deep
learning. It is characterized by a) bottom-up election, where each candidate
model update votes to several peer ones such that a few model updates are
elected as selectees for aggregation; and b) top-down election, where selectees
progressively enlarge themselves through picking up from the candidates. We
compare Snowball with state-of-the-art defenses to backdoor attacks in FL on
five real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior resistance to backdoor
attacks and slight impact on the accuracy of the global model.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Parallelization techniques have become ubiquitous for accelerating inference
and training of deep neural networks. Despite this, several operations are
still performed in a sequential manner. For instance, the forward and backward
passes are executed layer-by-layer, and the output of diffusion models is
produced by applying a sequence of denoising steps. This sequential approach
results in a computational cost proportional to the number of steps involved,
presenting a potential bottleneck as the number of steps increases. In this
work, we introduce DeepPCR, a novel algorithm which parallelizes typically
sequential operations used in inference and training of neural networks.
DeepPCR is based on interpreting a sequence of $L$ steps as the solution of a
specific system of equations, which we recover using the Parallel Cyclic
Reduction algorithm. This reduces the complexity of computing the sequential
operations from $\mathcal{O}(L)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log_2L)$, thus yielding a
speedup for large $L$. To verify the theoretical lower complexity of the
algorithm, and to identify regimes for speedup, we test the effectiveness of
DeepPCR in parallelizing the forward and backward pass in multi-layer
perceptrons, and reach speedups of up to $30\times$ for forward and $200\times$
for backward pass. We additionally showcase the flexibility of DeepPCR by
parallelizing training of ResNets with as many as 1024 layers, and generation
in diffusion models, enabling up to $7\times$ faster training and $11\times$
faster generation, respectively, when compared to the sequential approach.]]></summary>

imperative that we recognize the critical importance of trustworthiness in
open-world, which has become ubiquitous in all aspects of daily life for

artificial intelligence systems that need to be bridged: 1) Insufficient
explanation of predictive results; 2) Inadequate generalization for learning
models; 3) Poor adaptability to uncertain environments. Consequently, we
explore a neural program to bridge trustworthiness and open-world learning,
extending from single-modal to multi-modal scenarios for readers. 1) To enhance
design-level interpretability, we first customize trustworthy networks with
specific physical meanings; 2) We then design environmental well-being
task-interfaces via flexible learning regularizers for improving the
generalization of trustworthy learning; 3) We propose to increase the
robustness of trustworthy learning by integrating open-world recognition losses
with agent mechanisms. Eventually, we enhance various trustworthy properties
through the establishment of design-level explainability, environmental
well-being task-interfaces and open-world recognition programs. These designed
open-world protocols are applicable across a wide range of surroundings, under

setting with arbitrary corruptions. Similar to the classical setup, the agent
receives rewards generated independently from the distribution of the arm
chosen at each time. However, these rewards are not directly observed. Instead,
with a fixed $\varepsilon\in (0,\frac{1}{2})$, the agent observes a sample from
the chosen arm's distribution with probability $1-\varepsilon$, or from an
arbitrary corruption distribution with probability $\varepsilon$. Importantly,
we impose no assumptions on these corruption distributions, which can be
unbounded. In this setting, accommodating potentially unbounded corruptions, we
establish a problem-dependent lower bound on regret for a given family of arm
distributions. We introduce CRIMED, an asymptotically-optimal algorithm that
achieves the exact lower bound on regret for bandits with Gaussian
distributions with known variance. Additionally, we provide a finite-sample
analysis of CRIMED's regret performance. Notably, CRIMED can effectively handle
corruptions with $\varepsilon$ values as high as $\frac{1}{2}$. Furthermore, we
develop a tight concentration result for medians in the presence of arbitrary
corruptions, even with $\varepsilon$ values up to $\frac{1}{2}$, which may be
of independent interest. We also discuss an extension of the algorithm for

in representing graphs as metric measure spaces, allowing to successfully

increase rather than decrease the uncertainty of estimates, such as the
empirical prediction risk. It can act as a regularizer, but fails to do so in
certain high-dimensional problems, and it may shift the double-descent peak of
an empirical risk. Overall, the analysis shows that several properties data
augmentation has been attributed with are not either true or false, but rather
depend on a combination of factors -- notably the data distribution, the
properties of the estimator, and the interplay of sample size, number of
augmentations, and dimension. Our main theoretical tool is a limit theorem for

previous knowledge. However, Continual Learning often requires massive
computational power and storage capacity for satisfactory performance. In this
paper, we propose a resource-efficient continual learning method called the

precise replay sample selection, E2Net achieves superior average accuracy and
diminished forgetting within the same computational and storage constraints,
all while minimizing processing time. In E2Net, we propose Representative
Network Distillation to identify the representative core subnet by assessing
parameter quantity and output similarity with the working network, distilling
analogous subnets within the working network to mitigate reliance on rehearsal
buffers and facilitating knowledge transfer across previous tasks. To enhance
storage resource utilization, we then propose Subnet Constraint Experience
Replay to optimize rehearsal efficiency through a sample storage strategy based
on the structures of representative networks. Extensive experiments conducted
predominantly on cloud environments with diverse datasets and also spanning the

menopause, and yet research connecting female brain health to sex hormone
fluctuations is limited. We seek to investigate this connection by developing
tools that quantify 3D shape changes that occur in the brain during sex hormone
fluctuations. Geodesic regression on the space of 3D discrete surfaces offers a
principled way to characterize the evolution of a brain's shape. However, in
its current form, this approach is too computationally expensive for practical
use. In this paper, we propose approximation schemes that accelerate geodesic
regression on shape spaces of 3D discrete surfaces. We also provide rules of
thumb for when each approximation can be used. We test our approach on
synthetic data to quantify the speed-accuracy trade-off of these approximations
and show that practitioners can expect very significant speed-up while only
sacrificing little accuracy. Finally, we apply the method to real brain shape
data and produce the first characterization of how the female hippocampus
changes shape during the menstrual cycle as a function of progesterone: a
characterization made (practically) possible by our approximation schemes. Our
work paves the way for comprehensive, practical shape analyses in the fields of
bio-medicine and computer vision. Our implementation is publicly available on

services in a more flexible and elastic manner. To mitigate the complexity in
such modularized NF management, automated network operation and management are
indispensable, and thus the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) has
introduced a network data analytics function (NWDAF). However, a conventional
NWDAF needs to conduct both inference and training tasks, and thus it is
difficult to provide the analytics results to NFs in a timely manner for an
increased number of analytics requests. In this article, we propose a
hierarchical network data analytics framework (H-NDAF) where inference tasks
are distributed to multiple leaf NWDAFs and training tasks are conducted at the
root NWDAF. Extensive simulation results using open-source software (i.e.,
free5GC) demonstrate that H-NDAF can provide sufficiently accurate analytics

Due to the imbalance in the number of samples, the support vector machine (SVM)
classifier gets biased toward the majority class. Furthermore, these samples
are often observed with a certain degree of noise. Therefore, to remove these
problems we propose a novel fuzzy based approach to deal with class imbalanced
as well noisy datasets. We propose two approaches to address these problems.
The first approach is based on the intuitionistic fuzzy membership, termed as
robust energy-based intuitionistic fuzzy least squares twin support vector
machine (IF-RELSTSVM). Furthermore, we introduce the concept of
hyperplane-based fuzzy membership in our second approach, where the final
classifier is termed as robust energy-based fuzzy least square twin support
vector machine (F-RELSTSVM). By using this technique, the membership values are
based on a projection based approach, where the data points are projected on
the hyperplanes. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated on
several benchmark and synthetic datasets. The experimental results show that
the proposed IF-RELSTSVM and F-RELSTSVM models outperform the baseline
algorithms. Statistical tests are performed to check the significance of the
proposed algorithms. The results show the applicability of the proposed
algorithms on noisy as well as imbalanced datasets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vision Transformer (ViT) has emerged as a powerful architecture in the realm
of modern computer vision. However, its application in certain imaging fields,
such as microscopy and satellite imaging, presents unique challenges. In these
domains, images often contain multiple channels, each carrying semantically
distinct and independent information. Furthermore, the model must demonstrate
robustness to sparsity in input channels, as they may not be densely available
during training or testing. In this paper, we propose a modification to the ViT
architecture that enhances reasoning across the input channels and introduce
Hierarchical Channel Sampling (HCS) as an additional regularization technique
to ensure robustness when only partial channels are presented during test time.
Our proposed model, ChannelViT, constructs patch tokens independently from each
input channel and utilizes a learnable channel embedding that is added to the
patch tokens, similar to positional embeddings. We evaluate the performance of
ChannelViT on ImageNet, JUMP-CP (microscopy cell imaging), and So2Sat
(satellite imaging). Our results show that ChannelViT outperforms ViT on
classification tasks and generalizes well, even when a subset of input channels
is used during testing. Across our experiments, HCS proves to be a powerful
regularizer, independent of the architecture employed, suggesting itself as a
straightforward technique for robust ViT training. Lastly, we find that
ChannelViT generalizes effectively even when there is limited access to all
channels during training, highlighting its potential for multi-channel imaging
under real-world conditions with sparse sensors.]]></summary>

central to statistical learning and inference. Two classical methods are
canonical correlation analysis (CCA), which identifies maximally correlated
projected versions of the original variables, and Shannon's mutual information,
which is a universal dependence measure that also captures high-order
dependencies. However, CCA only accounts for linear dependence, which may be
insufficient for certain applications, while mutual information is often
infeasible to compute/estimate in high dimensions. This work proposes a middle
ground in the form of a scalable information-theoretic generalization of CCA,
termed max-sliced mutual information (mSMI). mSMI equals the maximal mutual
information between low-dimensional projections of the high-dimensional
variables, which reduces back to CCA in the Gaussian case. It enjoys the best
of both worlds: capturing intricate dependencies in the data while being
amenable to fast computation and scalable estimation from samples. We show that
mSMI retains favorable structural properties of Shannon's mutual information,
like variational forms and identification of independence. We then study
statistical estimation of mSMI, propose an efficiently computable neural
estimator, and couple it with formal non-asymptotic error bounds. We present
experiments that demonstrate the utility of mSMI for several tasks,
encompassing independence testing, multi-view representation learning,
algorithmic fairness, and generative modeling. We observe that mSMI
consistently outperforms competing methods with little-to-no computational
overhead.]]></summary>

opportunities for artificial general intelligence but concurrently amplify
safety concerns, such as potential misuse of AI systems, necessitating
effective AI alignment. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has
emerged as a promising pathway towards AI alignment but brings forth challenges
due to its complexity and dependence on a separate reward model. Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed as an alternative, and it
remains equivalent to RLHF under the reverse KL regularization constraint. This
paper presents $f$-DPO, a generalized approach to DPO by incorporating diverse
divergence constraints. We show that under certain $f$-divergences, including
Jensen-Shannon divergence, forward KL divergences and $\alpha$-divergences, the
complex relationship between the reward and optimal policy can also be
simplified by addressing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. This eliminates the
need for estimating the normalizing constant in the Bradley-Terry model and
enables a tractable mapping between the reward function and the optimal policy.
Our approach optimizes LLMs to align with human preferences in a more efficient
and supervised manner under a broad set of divergence constraints. Empirically,
adopting these divergences ensures a balance between alignment performance and
generation diversity. Importantly, $f$-DPO outperforms PPO-based methods in
divergence efficiency, and divergence constraints directly influence expected
calibration error (ECE).]]></summary>

representation as expansion coefficients under an atomic basis. With techniques
to address unconventional learning challenges therein, M-OFDFT achieves a
comparable accuracy with Kohn-Sham DFT on a wide range of molecules untouched

reliability of automatic face recognition (FR) systems in surveillance and
security scenarios. However, a massive amount of face data is usually
compressed before being analyzed due to limitations on transmission or storage.
The compressed images may lose the powerful identity information, resulting in
the performance degradation of the FR system. Herein, we make the first attempt
to study just noticeable difference (JND) for the FR system, which can be
defined as the maximum distortion that the FR system cannot notice. More
specifically, we establish a JND dataset including 3530 original images and
137,670 compressed images generated by advanced reference encoding/decoding
software based on the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard (VTM-15.0).
Subsequently, we develop a novel JND prediction model to directly infer JND
images for the FR system. In particular, in order to maximum redundancy removal
without impairment of robust identity information, we apply the encoder with
multiple feature extraction and attention-based feature decomposition modules
to progressively decompose face features into two uncorrelated components,
i.e., identity and residual features, via self-supervised learning. Then, the
residual feature is fed into the decoder to generate the residual map. Finally,
the predicted JND map is obtained by subtracting the residual map from the
original image. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed model
achieves higher accuracy of JND map prediction compared with the
state-of-the-art JND models, and is capable of saving more bits while
maintaining the performance of the FR system compared with VTM-15.0.]]></summary>

demonstrated success in both quantum and classical data classification. In
previous studies, QCNNs attained a higher classification accuracy than their
classical counterparts under the same training conditions in the few-parameter
regime. However, the general performance of large-scale quantum models is
difficult to examine because of the limited size of quantum circuits, which can
be reliably implemented in the near future. We propose transfer learning as an
effective strategy for utilizing small QCNNs in the noisy intermediate-scale
quantum era to the full extent. In the classical-to-quantum transfer learning
framework, a QCNN can solve complex classification problems without requiring a
large-scale quantum circuit by utilizing a pre-trained classical convolutional
neural network (CNN). We perform numerical simulations of QCNN models with
various sets of quantum convolution and pooling operations for MNIST data
classification under transfer learning, in which a classical CNN is trained
with Fashion-MNIST data. The results show that transfer learning from classical
to quantum CNN performs considerably better than purely classical transfer
learning models under similar training conditions.]]></summary>

generalization of deep neural networks, even without sizable data augmentation.
Embracing the geometry of the loss function, where neighborhoods of 'flat
minima' heighten generalization ability, SAM seeks 'flat valleys' by minimizing
the maximum loss caused by an adversary perturbing parameters within the
neighborhood. Although critical to account for sharpness of the loss function,
such an 'over-friendly adversary' can curtail the outmost level of
generalization. The novel approach of this contribution fosters stabilization
of adversaries through variance suppression (VaSSO) to avoid such friendliness.
VaSSO's provable stability safeguards its numerical improvement over SAM in
model-agnostic tasks, including image classification and machine translation.
In addition, experiments confirm that VaSSO endows SAM with robustness against

crucial for reliable projections of the ecological and socioeconomic impacts in
response to anthropogenic global warming. The complex cross-scale interactions
of processes that produce precipitation are challenging to model, however,
inducing potentially strong biases in ESM fields, especially regarding
extremes. State-of-the-art bias correction methods only address errors in the
simulated frequency distributions locally at every individual grid cell.
Improving unrealistic spatial patterns of the ESM output, which would require
spatial context, has not been possible so far. Here, we show that a
post-processing method based on physically constrained generative adversarial
networks (cGANs) can correct biases of a state-of-the-art, CMIP6-class ESM both
in local frequency distributions and in the spatial patterns at once. While our
method improves local frequency distributions equally well as gold-standard
bias-adjustment frameworks, it strongly outperforms any existing methods in the

performing language-related tasks. However, their deployment poses significant
challenges due to their considerable memory and storage requirements. In
response to this issue, weight-only quantization, particularly 3 and 4-bit
weight-only quantization, has emerged as one of the most viable solutions. As
the number of bits decreases, the quantization grid broadens, thus emphasizing
the importance of up and down rounding. While previous studies have
demonstrated that fine-tuning up and down rounding with the addition of
perturbations can enhance accuracy in some scenarios, our study is driven by
the precise and limited boundary of these perturbations, where only the
threshold for altering the rounding value is of significance. Consequently, we
propose a concise and highly effective approach for optimizing the weight
rounding task. Our method, named SignRound, involves lightweight block-wise
tuning using signed gradient descent, enabling us to achieve outstanding
results within 400 steps. SignRound competes impressively against recent
methods without introducing additional inference overhead. The source code will

allow them to operate in complex, high-dimensional, non-linear, and dynamically
changing environments. Due to the complexity of these environments, DNN
classifiers may output misclassifications during operation when they face
domains not identified during development. Removing a system from operation for
retraining becomes impractical as the number of such AS increases. To increase
AS reliability and overcome this limitation, DNN classifiers need to have the
ability to adapt during operation when faced with different operational domains
using a few samples (e.g. 100 samples). However, retraining DNNs on a few
samples is known to cause catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we introduce
Dynamic Incremental Regularised Adaptation (DIRA), a framework for operational
domain adaption of DNN classifiers using regularisation techniques to overcome
catastrophic forgetting and achieve adaptation when retraining using a few
samples of the target domain. Our approach shows improvements on different
image classification benchmarks aimed at evaluating robustness to distribution
shifts (e.g.CIFAR-10C/100C, ImageNet-C), and produces state-of-the-art

under-explored source of error in fair classification. In practice, the
variance on some data examples is so large that decisions can be effectively
arbitrary. To investigate this problem, we take an experimental approach and
make four overarching contributions: We 1) Define a metric called
self-consistency, derived from variance, which we use as a proxy for measuring
and reducing arbitrariness; 2) Develop an ensembling algorithm that abstains
from classification when a prediction would be arbitrary; 3) Conduct the
largest to-date empirical study of the role of variance (vis-a-vis
self-consistency and arbitrariness) in fair classification; and, 4) Release a
toolkit that makes the US Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) datasets easily
usable for future research. Altogether, our experiments reveal shocking
insights about the reliability of conclusions on benchmark datasets. Most
fairness classification benchmarks are close-to-fair when taking into account
the amount of arbitrariness present in predictions -- before we even try to
apply common fairness interventions. This finding calls into question the
practical utility of common algorithmic fairness methods, and in turn suggests
that we should fundamentally reconsider how we choose to measure fairness in
machine learning.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many emerging user-facing services adopt Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to
improve serving accuracy. When the graph used by a GNN model changes,
representations (embedding) of nodes in the graph should be updated
accordingly. However, the node representation update is too slow, resulting in
either long response latency of user queries (the inference is performed after
the update completes) or high staleness problem (the inference is performed
based on stale data). Our in-depth analysis shows that the slow update is
mainly due to neighbor explosion problem in graphs and duplicated computation.
Based on such findings, we propose STAG, a GNN serving framework that enables
low latency and low staleness of GNN-based services. It comprises a
collaborative serving mechanism and an additivity-based incremental propagation
strategy. With the collaborative serving mechanism, only part of node
representations are updated during the update phase, and the final
representations are calculated in the inference phase. It alleviates the
neighbor explosion problem. The additivity-based incremental propagation
strategy reuses intermediate data during the update phase, eliminating
duplicated computation problem. Experimental results show that STAG accelerates
the update phase by 1.3x~90.1x, and greatly reduces staleness time with a
slight increase in response latency.]]></summary>

data, the acquisition of quality labels often involves laborious human
annotations or slow and expensive scientific measurements. Machine learning is
becoming an appealing alternative as sophisticated predictive techniques are
being used to quickly and cheaply produce large amounts of predicted labels;
e.g., predicted protein structures are used to supplement experimentally
derived structures, predictions of socioeconomic indicators from satellite
imagery are used to supplement accurate survey data, and so on. Since
predictions are imperfect and potentially biased, this practice brings into
question the validity of downstream inferences. We introduce cross-prediction:
a method for valid inference powered by machine learning. With a small labeled
dataset and a large unlabeled dataset, cross-prediction imputes the missing
labels via machine learning and applies a form of debiasing to remedy the
prediction inaccuracies. The resulting inferences achieve the desired error
probability and are more powerful than those that only leverage the labeled
data. Closely related is the recent proposal of prediction-powered inference,
which assumes that a good pre-trained model is already available. We show that
cross-prediction is consistently more powerful than an adaptation of
prediction-powered inference in which a fraction of the labeled data is split
off and used to train the model. Finally, we observe that cross-prediction
gives more stable conclusions than its competitors; its confidence intervals
typically have significantly lower variability.]]></summary>

necessitating approximate inference techniques. Existing methods for
approximate inference are slow to converge for many benchmarks. The control of
accuracy-complexity trade-off is also non-trivial in many of these methods. We
propose a novel incremental build-infer-approximate (IBIA) framework for
approximate inference that addresses these issues. In this framework, the
probabilistic graphical model is converted into a sequence of clique tree
forests (SCTF) with bounded clique sizes. We show that the SCTF can be used to

are used to construct the SCTF and prove the correctness of both. The first is
an algorithm for incremental construction of CTFs that is guaranteed to give a
valid CTF with bounded clique sizes and the second is an approximation
algorithm that takes a calibrated CTF as input and yields a valid and
calibrated CTF with reduced clique sizes as the output. We have evaluated our
method using several benchmark sets from recent UAI competitions and our

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We study differentially private (DP) stochastic optimization (SO) with loss
functions whose worst-case Lipschitz parameter over all data points may be
extremely large. To date, the vast majority of work on DP SO assumes that the
loss is uniformly Lipschitz continuous over data (i.e. stochastic gradients are
uniformly bounded over all data points). While this assumption is convenient,
it often leads to pessimistic excess risk bounds. In many practical problems,
the worst-case (uniform) Lipschitz parameter of the loss over all data points
may be extremely large due to outliers. In such cases, the error bounds for DP
SO, which scale with the worst-case Lipschitz parameter of the loss, are
vacuous. To address these limitations, this work provides near-optimal excess
risk bounds that do not depend on the uniform Lipschitz parameter of the loss.
Building on a recent line of work (Wang et al., 2020; Kamath et al., 2022), we
assume that stochastic gradients have bounded $k$-th order moments for some $k
\geq 2$. Compared with works on uniformly Lipschitz DP SO, our excess risk
scales with the $k$-th moment bound instead of the uniform Lipschitz parameter
of the loss, allowing for significantly faster rates in the presence of
outliers and/or heavy-tailed data. For convex and strongly convex loss
functions, we provide the first asymptotically optimal excess risk bounds (up
to a logarithmic factor). In contrast to (Wang et al., 2020; Kamath et al.,
2022), our bounds do not require the loss function to be differentiable/smooth.
We also devise a linear-time algorithm for smooth losses that has excess risk
that is tight in certain practical parameter regimes. Additionally, our work is
the first to address non-convex non-uniformly Lipschitz loss functions
satisfying the Proximal-PL inequality; this covers some practical machine
learning models. Our Proximal-PL algorithm has near-optimal excess risk.]]></summary>

setting with arbitrary corruptions. Similar to the classical setup, the agent
receives rewards generated independently from the distribution of the arm
chosen at each time. However, these rewards are not directly observed. Instead,
with a fixed $\varepsilon\in (0,\frac{1}{2})$, the agent observes a sample from
the chosen arm's distribution with probability $1-\varepsilon$, or from an
arbitrary corruption distribution with probability $\varepsilon$. Importantly,
we impose no assumptions on these corruption distributions, which can be
unbounded. In this setting, accommodating potentially unbounded corruptions, we
establish a problem-dependent lower bound on regret for a given family of arm
distributions. We introduce CRIMED, an asymptotically-optimal algorithm that
achieves the exact lower bound on regret for bandits with Gaussian
distributions with known variance. Additionally, we provide a finite-sample
analysis of CRIMED's regret performance. Notably, CRIMED can effectively handle
corruptions with $\varepsilon$ values as high as $\frac{1}{2}$. Furthermore, we
develop a tight concentration result for medians in the presence of arbitrary
corruptions, even with $\varepsilon$ values up to $\frac{1}{2}$, which may be

function optimization tasks, requires practitioners to carefully select priors
that well model their functions of interest. Rather than specifying by hand,
researchers have investigated transfer learning based methods to automatically
learn the priors, e.g. multi-task BO (Swersky et al., 2013), few-shot BO
(Wistuba and Grabocka, 2021) and HyperBO (Wang et al., 2022). However, those
prior learning methods typically assume that the input domains are the same for
all tasks, weakening their ability to use observations on functions with
different domains or generalize the learned priors to BO on different search
spaces. In this work, we present HyperBO+: a pre-training approach for
hierarchical Gaussian processes that enables the same prior to work universally
for Bayesian optimization on functions with different domains. We propose a
two-step pre-training method and analyze its appealing asymptotic properties

method, which makes sequential decisions based on a Bayesian model, typically a

transfer learning approaches have been developed to automatically design GP
priors by learning from observations on "training" functions. These training
functions are typically required to have the same domain as the "test" function
(black-box function to be optimized). In this paper, we introduce MPHD, a model
pre-training method on heterogeneous domains, which uses a neural net mapping

be seamlessly integrated with BO to transfer knowledge across heterogeneous

goal is to simultaneously achieve ($i$) second order gradient adaptivity; and
($ii$) comparator norm adaptivity also known as "parameter freeness" in the
literature. Existing regret bounds (Cutkosky and Orabona, 2018; Mhammedi and
Koolen, 2020; Jacobsen and Cutkosky, 2022) have the suboptimal $O(\sqrt{V_T\log
V_T})$ dependence on the gradient variance $V_T$, while the present work
improves it to the optimal rate $O(\sqrt{V_T})$ using a novel
continuous-time-inspired algorithm, without any impractical doubling trick.
This result can be extended to the setting with unknown Lipschitz constant,
eliminating the range ratio problem from prior works (Mhammedi and Koolen,
2020).

Concretely, we first show that the aimed simultaneous adaptivity can be
achieved fairly easily in a continuous time analogue of the problem, where the
environment is modeled by an arbitrary continuous semimartingale. Then, our key
innovation is a new discretization argument that preserves such adaptivity in
the discrete time adversarial setting. This refines a non-gradient-adaptive
discretization argument from (Harvey et al., 2023), both algorithmically and
analytically, which could be of independent interest.]]></summary>

I am a second year undergraduate. By the end of this year, I will have taken and finished A Multivariable Calculus with Proofs course, so that is my current starting point.
 I have been working with ML for the last 3 years and am proficient in Python and frameworks like PyTorch.
 I have also made my own implementation of several research papers (LSTMs, GRUs, Transformers, ELMo, BERT, GPT, as well as a few computer vision papers).
  
I have a good general intuition of how deep learning works, but I want to formalise this knowledge with the adequate mathematical background so that I can eventually pursue a career in research. I understand that I have plenty of time until I reach there, and I am willing to dedicate it to grinding out the math and statistical knowledge required.
 I have done my research on this sub and other forums, and here are a few resources that stood out:
  
Mathematics for Machine Learning by Deisenroth, Faisal and Ong
 Advanced Calculus of Several Variables by C. H. Edwards Jr.
 Mathematical Methods Lecture Notes from Imperial College by Deisenroth and Cheraghchi
 The original information theory paper by Shannon
 The Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman
 Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Bishop
 The Probabalistic Machine Learning Series by Kevin P. Murphy
 Deep Learning by Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville
 Mathematics of Machine Learning on MIT OCW (here)
  
My question is, what order should I start self-learning in, given the (somewhat limited) background knowledge I have? Also, are there any other resources that would help?

 With the different data points, such as phi-1.5 performance being as good as 7b models on some tasks, it seems to be plausible that small models can be quite capable on specific tasks.
 I am working on BlindChat, an open-source and private solution to run small LLMs on your browser and I am interested in fine-tuning a phi-1.5 on some domain specific data.
 I am thinking of having an approach similar to the researchers of the phi paper, which is creating a high quality dataset using GPT3.5 / GPT4. 
 Do you know good open-source frameworks that make it easy to create a high quality data for a specific task using an existing large model, like GPT3.5/4 or Llama 2 70b?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bing AI chat messages are being hijacked by ads pushing malware.
 
Malvertising has made its way to Bing's chatbot/search engine.
 
Cybersecurity researchers observed a malicious ad being offered as part of the Chat-GPT, AI-powered answer to a search query.
 
Malvertising is a practice where hackers trick ad networks into displaying ads that look legitimate but are actually malicious.
 
Microsoft integrated Chat-GPT into Bing earlier this year and started monetizing it.
 
When a user types in a query, they would get a result paired with sponsored links.
 
In this instance, researchers were given a link that redirected them to a malicious site.
 
Threat actors continue to leverage search ads to redirect users to malicious sites hosting malware.
 
Bing Chat serves some of the same ads seen via a traditional Bing query.

The app that I am working on is an education app, and the purpose of the AI would be to (at least in terms of priority) generate a post subject line / topic to discuss.
 The company is super small, so money is important. JS is being used mainly at the moment.
 What would be a good choice for a small start up to generate topics for an education app used by schools?
 At least any ideas or things to consider would be wonderful to get my rabbit hole dive started! Thanks.

In this paper, we present Gaussian Splatting based text-to-3D generation (GSGEN), a novel approach for generating high-quality 3D objects. Previous methods suffer from inaccurate geometry and limited fidelity due to the absence of 3D prior and proper representation. We leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting, a recent state-of-the-art representation, to address existing shortcomings by exploiting the explicit nature that enables the incorporation of 3D prior. Specifically, our method adopts a progressive optimization strategy, which includes a geometry optimization stage and an appearance refinement stage. In geometry optimization, a coarse representation is established under a 3D geometry prior along with the ordinary 2D SDS loss, ensuring a sensible and 3D-consistent rough shape. Subsequently, the obtained Gaussians undergo an iterative refinement to enrich details. In this stage, we increase the number of Gaussians by compactness-based densification to enhance continuity and improve fidelity. With these designs, our approach can generate 3D content with delicate details and more accurate geometry. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, especially for capturing high-frequency components.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I just open-sourced a project that I've been working on for a while and wanted to see what you think!
 The goal of Carton (https://carton.run) is to let you use a single interface to run any machine learning model from any programming language.
 It’s currently difficult to integrate models that use different technologies (e.g. TensorRT, Ludwig, TorchScript, JAX, GGML, etc) into your application, especially if you’re not using Python. Even if you learn the details of integrating each of these frameworks, running multiple frameworks in one process can cause hard-to-debug crashes.
 Ideally, the ML framework a model was developed in should just be an implementation detail. Carton lets you decouple your application from specific ML frameworks so you can focus on the problem you actually want to solve.
 At a high level, the way Carton works is by running models in their own processes and using an IPC system to communicate back and forth with low overhead. Carton is primarily implemented in Rust, with bindings to other languages. There are lots more details linked in the architecture doc below.
 Importantly, Carton uses your model’s original underlying framework (e.g. PyTorch) under the hood to actually execute the model. This is meaningful because it makes Carton composable with other technologies. For example, it’s easy to use custom ops, TensorRT, etc without changes. This lets you keep up with cutting-edge advances, but decouples them from your application.
 I’ve been working on Carton for almost a year now and I open sourced it on Wednesday!

 I’m doing a project where I’m crowdsourcing a lot of location data for a set of location labels and then trying to cluster it for each and using the centroid of the cluster as the most accurate location for that location label. 
 The data keeps coming in everyday. I’m not sure when to stop computation. Initially I thought I’ll check the delta between each days centroid computed and if the delta falls under a threshold then stop computing. 
 But now I’m thinking if my daily data collected gets marked as outliers, subsequent days centroids won’t have much of a delta and it will pass my convergence condition. 
 Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been playing around with pruning neural networks. One interesting thing I've found is that pruning the weights with the lowest L1-norm along a specific dimension seems to give better results than simply pruning all of the weights with the lowest L1-norm (which I believe is the standard method; for example this is what torch.nn.utils.prune.l1_unstructured does).
 Does anyone have an explanation for why this might be, or knows of any research in this area?
 I'm aware that structured pruning removes entire channels in a specific dimension. But I'm referring to unstructured pruning here, where I remove a subset of the weights along a specific dimension.
 Admittedly I've only done very limited benchmarking of this. See this repo for my implementation, and some benchmark details.

 I'm a former developer turned lawyer with 15 years corporate experiences, and need help/talent/co-founder to help take things to the next level. Ideally you have a mixture of NLP and regular software engineering background and just a very practical approach. If you've played with LLM's all the better.
 Options for cash, equity, larger roles are all on the table. Just looking for the right talent. DM me if you are interested and lets talk about experience, etc.!
 And it seems that tags are turned off in here, so not sure how to tag something as [Project] but I put it in the title.

 Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16668
 RealFill is able to complete the image with what should have been there.
 Abstract
  
Recent advances in generative imagery have brought forth outpainting and inpainting models that can produce high-quality, plausible image content in unknown regions, but the content these models hallucinate is necessarily inauthentic, since the models lack sufficient context about the true scene. In this work, we propose RealFill, a novel generative approach for image completion that fills in missing regions of an image with the content that should have been there. RealFill is a generative inpainting model that is personalized using only a few reference images of a scene. These reference images do not have to be aligned with the target image, and can be taken with drastically varying viewpoints, lighting conditions, camera apertures, or image styles. Once personalized, RealFill is able to complete a target image with visually compelling contents that are faithful to the original scene. We evaluate RealFill on a new image completion benchmark that covers a set of diverse and challenging scenarios, and find that it outperforms existing approaches by a large margin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 so i learnt the very basics of ai and im trying to understand how nn works,
 this is what i have figured out so far. 
 so if i have a 4x4 image e.g
 0 1 1 0
 1 0 0 1
 1 1 1 1
 1 0 0 1
 i pass it across a 2x2 kernal e.g
 1 1
 0 3
 ​
 and padding it would do 
 ​
 dot product of 
 0 1
 1 0
 ​
 x
 ​
 1 1
 0 3
 ​
 is 1
 ​
 ​
 and if we do that to all of them we get a new matrix
 ​
 1 2 4
 4 1 3
 5 4 4
 ​
 ​
 then we have padding same so this becomes
 ​
 0 0 0 0
 1 2 4 0
 4 1 3 0
 5 4 4 0
 ​
 ​
 we then turn it into a feature map, basically flatenting it to something like this
 0,0,0,0,1,2,4,0,4,1,3,0,5,4,4,0
 ​
 so the input has 16 features, if we have a layer of 3 nerons that fire with relu activation funciton
 and each weight is alternating between 1 and 2 for simplicity sake . we would do
 0*1 + 0*2 + 0*1 .... 4*2 + 0*1 = 32
 so if we are using relu, we would do 
 is 32 > 0? if so we pass 32 to next neuron if not we pass 0?
 ​
 idk the rest, i guess i forgot what uni taught me 😅 
 ​
 hers a diagram i drew, maybe you can help me figure out hte rest, im confused how the output layer works i guess

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some posit he was genuinely surprised by the violence and needed time to assess the situation before acting. They argue that the chaotic nature of the events made immediate action complex, given the layers of command and decision-making involved. Others claim he might have been in deliberation with advisors to gauge the scale and implications of intervention, debating the potential backlash from his supporters or the legal ramifications.
 Another perspective suggests that he might have been contemplating how the events would affect the certification of the Electoral College results, given that his previous legal and political efforts to contest the 2020 election outcome had failed. In this view, he might have been waiting to see if the Congress would be influenced to halt or delay the certification.
 While some of his supporters may find these explanations plausible, critics argue that the delay represents a dereliction of duty or even tacit support for the violence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 Im new to the Neural network and I wanted some advice :
 I wanted to generate grayscale images with certain properties : - distribution of pixels values, space correlation between pixels, etc...
 I already know the type of result that I need, but I wanted to know if a neural network especially a GAN was capable to produce images fitting me requirements.
 I was thinking that maybe I could change the GAN architecture such as :
 1)the Real data inputs (normally images feed to discriminator) will simply be the statistical parameters that I am expecting.
 2) I'll add a measure of the various statistical parameters on all the synthetic images generated. 
 3)Finally the discriminator will only based itself on the statistical parameters comparison for weights updates.
 Does such network make sense ? If so I have trouble finding a way of implementing it but that is an other story. Right know I want to know if this is doable ? If not do you have any alternative suggestion for my issue ?
 Thanks all for your advice !

Joaquin Quiñonero Candela, a director of AI at Facebook, was tasked with fixing the problem but was only focused on addressing AI bias.
 
The Responsible AI team failed to make headway against misinformation and hate speech because it never made those problems its main focus.
 
The spread of lies and hate speech on Facebook has only grown, contributing to genocidal campaigns and the promotion of dangerous falsehoods.
 
The algorithms that underpin Facebook's business were designed to maximize engagement, not filter out false or inflammatory content.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a CNN model, call it model M. It was trained on dataset A for object pose estimation. After training for 100 epochs, it resulted in these losses:
  
Train: 0.06
 Val: 0.08
  
As dataset A is somewhat limited, I wonder if I can incorporate additional data via a different, but related task: object segmentation for similar objects. Model M is a UNet, so I can incorporate this task simply with an additional output channel in the last layer. 
 I add dataset B for object segmentation. During training, M learns on both datasets quite well, which suggests to me that the tasks are well-aligned. After 100 epochs, I get these losses on dataset A:
  
Train: 0.06
 Val: 0.16
  
This is surprising to me. If I get the same training loss on dataset A, while training on additional data. I'd expect the validation loss to be lower, since I'm training on 2x the data. Yet the validation performance is consistently higher when I train on both datasets. 
 The only explanation I can think of is the double descent phenomenon. Perhaps when I trained only on dataset A, I was significantly over-parameterized, but past the interpolation threshold. So perhaps adding more data brought me closer to the interpolation threshold, leading to worse generalization.
 Does this explanation seem likely? Has anyone had similar experiences?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google's AI-driven search experience, Search Generative Experience (SGE), is now accessible to teenagers between 13-17 in America. Entailments include a conversational mode for searches, which Google believes can help youngsters pose atypical questions to dig deeper.
 For the latest advancements in AI, look here first.
 Teen-friendly AI search
  
SGE introduces a conversational mode to Google Search, allowing users to ask questions and follow-ups in a more natural language.
 To prevent harmful content from surfacing, Google has placed guardrails, providing stronger protections related to illegal and age-gated substances, or bullying.
  
Features and improving AI accuracy
  
Google is rolling out "About this result" to provide users with more context about the displayed content.
 Google acknowledges and addresses any validation of false or offensive claims by the AI-powered response, ensuring to provide higher quality and more accurate responses.
 It’s also using large language models to self-critique and rewrite draft responses on sensitive topics based on quality and safety principles.
  
SGE's popularity and future plans
  
Since SGE's introduction, it has found popularity, especially among younger users who prefer a conversational approach.
 Google plans to expand SGE outside the U.S. to India and Japan and improve its services with support for videos, images, local info, and more.
 It's also experimenting with ads positioned next to the AI-generated responses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a quick disclaimer, I know people on here think the sub is being flooded by people who arent ml engineers/researchers. I have worked at two FAANGS on ml research teams/platforms. 
 My opinion is that GPT-4 Vision/Image processing is out of science fiction. I fed chatgpt an image of a complex sql data base schema, and it converted it to code, then optimized the schema. It understood the arrows pointing between table boxes on the image as relations, and even understand many to one/many to many. 
 I took a picture of random writing on a page, and it did OCR better than has ever been possible. I was able to ask questions that required OCR and a geometrical understanding of the page layout. 
 Where is the hype on here? This is an astounding human breakthrough. I cannot believe how much ML is now obsolete as a result. I cannot believe how many computer science breakthroughs have occurred with this simple model update. Where is the uproar on this sub? Why am I not seeing 500 comments on posts about what you can do with this now? Why are there even post submissions about anything else?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aryn, a team with experience in AWS big data and database services, has come out of stealth and raised $7.5M in series seed funding.
 
Their mission is to bring generative AI to OpenSearch and data preparation.
 
They aim to use generative AI models to process unstructured data for tasks such as information extraction, question-answering, summarization, and content generation.
 
Aryn's conversational search approach empowers users to interact with their unstructured enterprise data.
 
They have developed a conversational search stack consisting of a semantic data preparation system called Sycamore, semantic search with OpenSearch, and conversational capabilities in OpenSearch.
 
Generative AI powers each component of the stack, leading to higher quality answers and ease of use.
 
Developers can quickly build and deploy applications like question-answering, chatbots, and research platforms using Aryn's stack without needing expertise in AI and search.
 
Aryn's stack is 100% open source, making it accessible to developers.

A mobile phone’s camera is a powerful tool for capturing everyday moments. However, capturing a dynamic scene using a single camera is fundamentally limited. For instance, if we wanted to adjust the camera motion or timing of a recorded video (e.g., to freeze time while sweeping the camera around to highlight a dramatic moment), we would typically need an expensive Hollywood setup with a synchronized camera rig. Would it be possible to achieve similar effects solely from a video captured using a mobile phone’s camera, without a Hollywood budget?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Meta has unveiled colossal AI updates peppered across its platform that would fundamentally alter user experiences on Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp, opening up a "universe of AI" solutions.
 For the latest advancements in AI, look here first.
 https://preview.redd.it/bl81rlbqp1rb1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=be44b8ebae8f65b53eb82fe2a78b45f19260c452
 Spearheading the AI Universe - Meta AI Chatbot
  
The “advanced conversational assistant” is set to enhance Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram services and will be incorporated into upcoming Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and Quest 3.
 Real-time information capabilities have been bolstered through a partnership with Microsoft Bing, and image generation is powered by a new model, Emu.
  
A Galaxy of AI Personalities
  
Meta rolled out 28 AIs in beta, featuring sterling personas such as Snoop Dogg, Tom Brady, Kendall Jenner, and Naomi Osaka, thus amplifying the interactivity quotient.
  
AI Studio - Empowering Businesses
  
The AI Studio Platform is equipped to enable businesses to build AI chatbots for messaging services on Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger.
 Also, Meta will provide a sandbox tool in the upcoming year for users to experiment with creating their own AI.
  
Generative AI Stickers - A New Co-creating Experience
  
AI editing tools will allow users to edit images and co-create content with friends.
 The tool uses Llama 2 and the new image generation model, Emu, to convert text prompts into stickers in seconds.
  
Ray-Ban Smart Glasses with Meta AI
  
The Ray-Ban smart glasses are equipped with Meta AI, allowing users to receive information, incite creativity, and manage the glasses using just their voice.

 Unlike Llama 2 or other open source, we don't have access to the model weights for GPT-4, Claude or Bard, so Benchmark Evals are being run through either APIs or the chat Interface. So how do we know that the model isn't being Boosted by custom web-searching abilities or RAG? While GPT-4 might have a turnoff option, I'm pretty sure Bard is always online, being built by google. So how do we trust benchmarks? Also, have any opensource been tested after Websearch/RAG?

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become essential for solving a wide range of tasks, from standard supervised learning (image classification using ViT) to meta-learning. The most commonly-used paradigm for learning DNNs is empirical risk minimization (ERM), which aims to identify a network that minimizes the average loss on training data points. Several algorithms, including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and Adagrad, have been proposed for solving ERM. However, a drawback of ERM is that it weights all the samples equally, often ignoring the rare and more difficult samples, and focusing on the easier and abundant samples. This leads to suboptimal performance on unseen data, espe…]]></summary>

 The mission was precise: Write a prompt to yield an SAT-style multiple-choice question that rigorously tests a student's understanding of "Algebraically solving systems of 2 linear equations in 2 variables". The challenge didn't end there; the question produced had to meet the hard/difficult mark set by real SAT questions.
 Using the OpenAI Playground, we conducted incisive iterations, testing each prompt separately to mitigate any bias from prior outputs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The role of Reinforcement learning in automating game testing is becoming increasingly crucial, making it more efficient and effective. Manual testing, while essential, is extremely time-consuming and subject to human error. 
 Our opensource library SheepRL 🐑 can be used to test whether the game dynamics is well defined: what if a player can finish the game with just a few moves? 🎮
 This video shows that our agent (Kasumi, on the left) is able to win the game in the hardest modality by standing down and throwing kicks. 🥊
 This can be helpful for a game developer to:
 ​
  
understand where and how intervene to achieve a more playful game
 
predict and correct bugs early in the game development process
 enhance the gaming experience and final product quality
 reduce time and resources spent on debugging.
  
The game has changed 🔥 and it is up to us to play it with (human + artificial) intelligence!
 Thanks to u/DIAMBRA_AIArena for the video!

 Both of these approaches have tradeoffs, so researchers at the National University of Singapore tried a hybrid approach combining both, and shared the results in a paper published yesterday.
 My highlights from the paper:
  
Pixel diffusion excels at low-res video generation precisely aligned with text 
 Latent diffusion acts as efficient upsampling expert from low to high res 
 Chaining the two techniques inherits benefits of both Show-1 achieves strong alignment, quality, and 15x less inference memory 
 The key is using pixel diffusion for the initial low-resolution stage. This retains alignment with text descriptions.
 Latent diffusion then serves as a super-resolution expert, upsampling efficiently while preserving fidelity.
  
By blending complementary techniques, Show-1 moves past tradeoffs limiting the individual models.

 In the optional lab, there was a task to calculate the value of the cost function using gradient descent for linear regression. I wrote the code in my notebook by myself and cross checked it to be correct. However, the desired output of w,b are very much different but the cost function yields a better result in my code. Another factor, I noticed that have to scale only thex variables, leaving the values of y. I have two major queries now: 
  
Is the yielding of different w,b values fine as long as the cost function is minimum? (w is a numpy array) 
 Why do scale the x variables only? Why don't scale the y variables? 
  
Thanks in advance.

The idea is basically that we are going to enter the same prompt, separately, into an image generating a.i of some sort (Dalle2 etc) for a period of time and hopefully see the result change. We would probly pick words or frases that are topical and debated. This only works though if the a.i isnt just trained on old data and has active connection to the internet. MY question is therefor, is there an a.i right now that would fit the task?
 Sorry if the question is dumb or i didnt explain myself clearly!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Was asked something similar to the following question in an interview for a ML role and was curious how others would answer this:
 Say you have a dataset with one feature column and one label column (with different classes). Assume this data is too large to fit into memory and could be infinite in size (e.g data is coming in as a stream). How would you train a ML model on this data to accurately predict the label?
 Followup: instead of one feature column, what if you had several thousand? How would you decide which features to use given the size of the dataset? 
 I discussed online sampling (resevoir sampling, etc) as a way to get a training dataset that could fit in memory + continually train on that but the interviewer did not seem convinced. Any thoughts?

Document retrieval (search) system: We have a (source) document with us and we're trying to find a matching document in a database. The source document has text and image attributes - for simplicity let's say a title and a single image. Each search result will also be a document - with a title and at most one image.
 A search engine: We have a query comprised of both text and an image (like google image search allows text to be added to the query as well). Each search result will be a website with text and image attributes (for simplicity, webpage title and at most one image)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not sure it's the right place for this, but I was going through the proofs in the "original" 1992 technical notes of Q-learning, and a couple of points raised some questions:
 1) In the Proof of lemma B.4:
 https://preview.redd.it/7g6pputdqwqb1.png?width=1006&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe4afeac3b06deee6c80105b280a0085bdcfbe51
 where do P_{xy}^2(a_2) and R_x(a_2) come from? If we apply the definitions of Q'(x, a_1, a_2) and Q(x, a_1, a_2) to get the bound, P_{xy}^2(a_2) and R_x(a_2) should not be there. Are they just notation errors or is it correct and I'm missing something?
 ​
 2) I don't quite get how the bounds on P and R are computed in Section 3.2:
 https://preview.redd.it/p06ysjewqwqb1.png?width=962&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5929e701099dc6e4543efe7681f96f12f543fa8
 Considering the results in B.4 (i.e., the bounds for the distance between the chain's P, R and the real ones), I don't understand how they arrive at this conclusion. 
 ​
 I'd greatly appreciate any intuitions about these, or if someone can point me in the right direction :)

 I am trying to detect the 9 squares of a face of a Rubik’s Cube through a camera. The idea is that I want to use my computer camera and tell the user to show all the Rubik’s Cube faces and read the faces so I can feed it to a solver.
 Here are the steps I have tried so far:
  
Sharpened square edges
 Obtained binary image and removed noise
 Detected and extracted squares
  
Some methods I used were using different blurs and cv functions but nothing worked. Sometimes, it can get all 9 squares but sometimes it doesn't. There also seems to be a difference for different colors; for example; the model can detect green squares easier than yellow squares.
 Can anyone provide advice as to how I can detect the squares on the face?

 I've extracted a character from an anime scene using a mask, and saved it as a PNG sequence which contains solely the anime character along with an alpha (transparent) background.

 I'm curious about how the Flowframes neural network can recreate the background that was originally behind the character but removed by the mask. It's impossible since the PNG images don't have that background info.

 Can anyone explain how this works?

 I’m trying to do a regression algorithm for a dataset where I have a graph for each patient I have representing a location in their brain from MRI images. Right now, I don’t have a ton of data, so I’m looking for some way to take each graph I have and get a feature vector for it to put into a regression algorithm. So for 100 patients, I have 100 graphs, I’d like to have 100 feature vectors representing each patients graph. 
 My issue is trying to find some algorithm that takes in the entire graph and outputs a single feature vector. I’ve been looking at some libraries but they all seem wildly scattered. I don’t want to grab a bunch of nose embeddings and do some elementary merge of them, like an average or sum, etc. Any help in pointing me to some Python libraries that can help me do this, or algorithms, or anything. Thank you so much.

 Am training a variational auto encoder. First I tried with batch normalization before I send the data to the network and someone probably wisely pointed out that it's not correct. If I don't use batch norm then my training fails due to numerical instability. I then tried scaling my data before hand using standard scaler from sklewrn. And now my training works. Is this reasonable?
 Any other thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Automatic code generation has always been an integral part of programming: compilers, synthesis tools, convertors, etc. are examples of classic code generators. Now, with such powerful LLMs at hand, it is only natural to try to find new ways to generate codes. The question is: are LLMs the right tool for code generation?
 There are two sides to code generation: (1) understanding the intent (a.k.a. capturing the spec) (2) writing the code. LLMs are great for (1), but not so good for (2).
 This is an example of using LLM for general-domain code generation:
 https://github.com/RoboCoachTechnologies/GPT-Synthesizer 
 You can see that the main focus here is to properly capture the spec, and that's where LLMs shine.
 LLMs solution for a general-domain code generation may not be complete or optimized. It is always easier to break the problem and solve code generation in a specific domain. Here you can see how much better and cleaner the output of code generation can be when it is limited to a specific domain (robotics domain, ROS in particular, in this case):

 What are your thoughts on using LLMs for code generation?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This subreddit will continue to die if it doesn't foster discussion of the latest research and reduce low-quality posts. However, making a judgement as to what is or is not low-quality is time-consuming and subjective -- not something the mods should be doing.
 To this end, I had the following new rule idea:
  
If it's your first time at Fight If it's your first post in this subreddit, it needs to be a link to arxiv (Or, more generally, the number of your non-arxiv posts cannot exceed the number of your arxiv posts)
 All arxiv posts must be standard links to the abstract page (to catch reposts and to connect discussions of the same paper in different subreddits)
 An arxiv post must be a paper you've read yourself, and you should post a comment describing what you liked and DIDN'T like about it (Let the airing of grievances begin! I think this will help seed the discussion, which is really the raison d'être of this subreddit)
 If the post or the comment get downvoted, they do not count.
  
What do you think? Will this help steer this subreddit in the right direction? Is this enforceable?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Generating coherent videos spanning multiple scenes from text descriptions poses unique challenges for AI. While recent progress enables creating short clips, smoothly transitioning across diverse events and maintaining continuity remains difficult.
 A new paper from UNC Chapel Hill proposes VIDEODIRECTORGPT, a two-stage framework attempting to address multi-scene video generation:
 Here are my highlights from the paper:
  
Two-stage approach: first a language model generates detailed "video plan", then a video generation module renders scenes based on the plan
 Video plan contains multi-scene descriptions, entities/layouts, backgrounds, consistency groupings - guides downstream video generation
 Video generation module called Layout2Vid trained on images, adds spatial layout control and cross-scene consistency to existing text-to-video model
 Experiments show improved object layout/control in single-scene videos vs baselines
 Multi-scene videos display higher object consistency across scenes compared to baselines
 Competitive open-domain video generation performance maintained
  
The key innovation seems to be using a large language model to plot detailed video plans to guide overall video generation. And the video generator Layout2Vid adds better spatial and temporal control through some clever tweaks. The separation of these tasks seems to matter.

 I find myself in quite a situation and could use some guidance. Recently, I introduced my professor to privateGPT and demonstrated its capabilities using a small set of college data. To my delight, he was impressed and has now tasked me with researching and developing a ChatGPT-like chatbot, but with access to our university's extensive data.
 Here's where I need your help: my professor wants this chatbot to be hosted on our university's systems due to privacy concerns, which means I can't use ChatGPT's API. I've been given access to Sol HPC, but I'm finding it quite confusing to get started.
 I'm looking for advice, tips, or any resources that can help me embark on this journey. Has anyone here worked on a similar project, or does anyone have experience with Sol HPC or building chatbots with local data sources? Any guidance or insights would be greatly appreciated!
 Thank you in advance for your help. This project means a lot to me, and I want to make sure I'm heading in the right direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OpenAI's much-touted model GPT-4, lauded for its multimodal abilities, including advanced image recognition, still has significant flaws. These glitches range from inventing facts to misinterpreting chemicals' images and hate symbols, according to a new paper from OpenAI.
 To stay ahead of AI developments, look here first.
 https://preview.redd.it/seg5x4zn3uqb1.png?width=1108&format=png&auto=webp&s=635a6c58cf6255f62d8eae3077678864e5b0e248
 Unintended GPT-4V behaviors
  
GPT-4V has a tendency to hallucinate or invent facts with unwarranted confidence.
 The model struggles to make correct inferences, sometimes creating fictional terms by wrongly combining text strings.
 It misinterprets certain symbols of hate and can give incorrect answers in the context of medical imaging.
  
OpenAI’s mitigation strategies
  
OpenAI has implemented various safeguards to prevent GPT-4V's misuse, such as breaking CAPTCHAs or using images to infer personal details.
 The company insisted that GPT-4V is not to be used for identifying dangerous chemicals from image structures.
 OpenAI acknowledged it has a long way to go in refining the model and is working on it.
  
Discrimination and bias
  
When OpenAI’s production safeguards are disabled, GPT-4V displays bias against certain sexes and body types.
 The paper reported offensive responses related to body positivity when prompted by an image of a woman in a bathing suit.

 This means my data has 208 features (200 for the grid cubes being on/off, 7 for the "next shape" box, and 1 for the labeled best move.
 I currently have 9460 labeled samples and have done some preliminary fitting here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/conlan/tetris-ai?scriptVersionId=144388350 with a highest f1_macro score of 0.431090.
 Does anyone have suggestions for which direction to take from here to improve? Currently I see:
  
Collect More Data
 Tune Hyperparameters
 Rework Features
  
I'm hesitant to rework the features as that would require telling the model more specifics and would like to keep it abstract, but maybe 200 is crazy high? Or maybe <10k samples is too low and I should just keep collecting data?
 Thanks in advance!

I had a paragraph of information for one of my classes that I wanted it to make more straightforward for me before I actually went to class the next day. I spent like 30 minutes trying to get it to do that and eventually just ended up giving up. Why dont language models feel as sharp as they did say a year ago? I wish I had more examples to share. Am I the only one who's noticed this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all – I’m new to this sub-Reddit, so hopefully I’m in the right place.
 I am working on an audio production that will span multiple episodes and hopefully multiple seasons. It will require many characters, ranging in gender, age, ethnicity, etc. I am a decent voice actor and can do many of the roles myself, but some of them I cannot fake using my voice alone.
 My budget is very limited, so I was hoping to find some type of software I can change my voice for the production. This can be during the recording process, or after recording… As long as it gets the job done, and makes me sound like someone else entirely. 
 Does anybody know of a software that can achieve this? Most of the software I found either specifically designed to change users voice on the spot and is aimed at gamers changing your voice for live streams or in-game chats. I’m also on a Mac, which I know will be limiting.
 I’m having a hard time finding something I can use. Any suggestions will be helpful. 
 Thank you!
 EDIT: To clarify, I don’t want to just change my voice to sound different in general. I want to specifically sound like a woman, an elder man, or someone of a different ethnic background. Those are just a few examples.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reinforcement learning has grabbed my interest pretty firmly and been my focus for the 3 months or so. I spend most of my time working in python , rust, and now mojo. Not an expert yet but my coding skills are improving. I have no degree and have taught myself most of what I know. That part is why Im looking for advice from you all. Practically every job post Ive seen has college requirements. Is it unlikely to get hired without a degree?
 Additional information: I'm currently working on projects for github but those arent quite done. My main interest is related to RL in game design. Applications of distributional RL in action dense environments and VR. Currently using Godot engine the most and have used pytorch, openai gym, and tensorflow (to a lesser degree). The abstract concepts of neural networks comes easy to me and Ive been following basic neurology as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ood morning everyone,
 I am currently reading the book of Mr. Burkov: Machine Learning Engineering. He talk about a step that might be helpful before training a ML model: Feature Scaling. Furthermore, he adds that before Feature Scaling, you might do Feature Transformation (Log, Square,...) in order to make your data look normal and have better models. How true do you think this statement is? Do you also transform your feature, and then scale them? How often do you do it? It is important for Regression or SVM, but do you do it also for other black box algorithms such as Random Forests? What are the best practices according to you?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit: I may be jumping the gun here but I think I figured it out (looks good so far). I give the episode reward for every action EXCEPT the "end early" action, now I will need to give some boost for shorter episodes to achieve the desired effect :) 
 I feel like I'm experiencing déjà vu, posing another DQN-related question. But, here's my issue:
 I've set up an environment where an agent can interact for 40 steps or choose to end the interaction early with a specific action. The catch is that the reward is only given at the end of the episode, which seems to be leading the agent to strongly favor the "end early" action. Despite all other steps getting a reward of 0, I assumed the long-term reward estimate, V(s_{t+1}), would mitigate this, but the agent still heavily gravitates towards ending the episode early.
 Attempted Solutions:
  
Distributed the end-of-episode reward across all prior actions taken by the agent.
  
Considering:
  
Replacing the "end early" action with a "do nothing" action, allowing the episode to always play out in full. However, this seems like it could introduce additional computational costs and noise.
  
Has anyone encountered a similar problem? I'd appreciate any advice or recommendations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The European Union is urging the implementation of more safeguards against the risks posed by generative AI tools to free and fair debate in democratic societies, especially during elections.
 
The EU's values and transparency commissioner has highlighted the potential threat of AI-generated disinformation to elections and called for platforms to be vigilant and provide efficient safeguards.
 
Mainstream platforms have made initial efforts to address the risks by implementing safeguards to inform users about the synthetic origin of content posted online.
 
The EU commissioner is meeting with representatives from OpenAI to discuss the issue.
 
An incoming pan-EU AI regulation, the EU AI Act, is expected to make user disclosures a legal requirement for generative AI technologies.
 
The EU's voluntary anti-disinformation Code has 44 signatories, including major social media and search platforms, as well as entities from the ad industry and civil society organizations.
 
Google, one of the signatories, has published a report discussing the social impacts of AI and its commitment to developing technology responsibly.
 
Google Search has published guidance on AI-generated content and plans to integrate new innovations in watermarking, metadata, and other techniques into its generative models.
 
The EU's Code of Practice on Disinformation is seen as a stop-gap measure until the EU AI Act is adopted and mandatory deepfake disclosures are enforced.

 Train good Dreambooth models (or what newer methods are there for style and object training?)
 Run and compare various open-source LLMs (should be able to run 70b models?
 Generate something of decent length with MusicGen
 Gaussian Splatting
 Distribute voice recognition, TTS, audio2face, LLM, and rendering across 2 or 3 machines to create a realistic virtual human (suggestions for excellent TTS would be appreciated)
 What other interesting models are out there to experiment with?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I learned about DeepNash and R-NaD yesterday. I read the Deepmind article, Science paper, and the source code of rnad.py. But I don't think I understand it! Part of this is that they didn't define all the terms and Greek they use in the paper, and part of it is that I don't have academic ML experience.
 Below is my attempt to summarize the paper in non-academic terms. I'm trying to show that I did my homework, and also I'm trying to invoke Godwin's Law in the hopes that someone will come along and correct me.
 Here goes:
 Naïve reinforcement learning doesn't work with simultaneous choice games such as matching pennies or Rock-Paper-Scissors.
 In naïve RL, If I choose Rock as my move, my opponent chooses Scissors as their move, and I see that I won, that will reinforce a belief that Rock is a "good" move and Scissors is a "bad" move. But this isn't true!
 This means that, during selfplay, a naïve RL agent will just cycle through strategies, as the timestep-(τ_n) agent learns how to beat the timestep-(τ_n-1) agent. The agent will never learn that RPS is a game about staying unpredictable!
 R-NaD fixes this by adjusting the reward function. I think "regularizing" is ML-academic speak for "adjusting". It adjusts the reward function in such a way that the agent will converge at a Nash equilibrium strategy.
 The paper's equation (1) describes how the regularization works. They didn't explain all the terms, though. I still don't know what a_i represents. But I think it corresponds to parts of the code like this line and this line.
 The key is that we're merging policies from multiple epochs and making sure that the current agent's move probabilities fare well against not only itself, but also against its previous two generations. They've proven that three generations is all you need to eventually converge to a Nash equilibrium.
 So... that's my understanding. Does anyone with actual ML experience want to weigh in?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Researchers from Microsoft have just proposed using a psychological assessment tool called the Defining Issues Test (DIT) to evaluate the moral reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, ChatGPT, etc.
 The DIT presents moral dilemmas and has subjects rate and rank the importance of various ethical considerations related to the dilemma. It allows quantifying the sophistication of moral thinking through a P-score.
 In this new paper, the researchers tested prominent LLMs with adapted DIT prompts containing AI-relevant moral scenarios.
 Key findings:
  
Large models like GPT-3 failed to comprehend prompts and scored near random baseline in moral reasoning.
 ChatGPT, Text-davinci-003 and GPT-4 showed coherent moral reasoning with above-random P-scores.
 Surprisingly, the smaller 70B LlamaChat model outscored larger models in its P-score, demonstrating advanced ethics understanding is possible without massive parameters.
 The models operated mostly at intermediate conventional levels as per Kohlberg's moral development theory. No model exhibited highly mature moral reasoning.
  
I think this is an interesting framework to evaluate and improve LLMs' moral intelligence before deploying them into sensitive real-world environments - to the extent that a model can be said to possess moral intelligence (or, seem to possess it?).
 Here's a link to my full summary with a lot more background on Kohlberg's model (had to read up on it since I didn't study psych). Full paper is here

I’ve decided to make it a classification problem and predict the zone of rainfall as in 0-0.5 in inches or 1-1.5 inches. My data set has ~40,000 samples however i have noticed that 24,000 of them have 0.0 as the amount of rainfall. And a high percentage of the rest are very low like below 0.5 inch. I’m wondering if there’s still a way to create the type of model I had originally intended or not. Is there a way to reduce the size of my data set , specifically the amount of low values without losing important feature information? Thank you and any help is appreciated :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, long story short, I've used Otter.ai for recording, and transcribing my ideas on the fly and it's really, really good!
 The only thing it is missing for my use case is to be able to edit the transcripts (remove some parts for example) and then have that piece be removed from the audio file as well, so you can see how long is the actual useful part that.. I also need it to have an app, since the whole point of doing this is catching ideas that just rush to my head. Apparently DeScribe has this option, but I haven't tried it and it doesn't work on mobile anyways. 
 I know it's probably not available, but does anyone know any services similar to this? I don't need an AI bot, don't care about integration with other apps, and will not use it for meetings. 
 TLDR: I just want an app to be able to record, and then transcribe my ideas, and then allow me to edit/fine-tune the transcript and have the audio file be edited in the same way as well..
 Thanks!

 Now I have direct and remote access to my personal lab pc which has configuration: core i9-9900K, 32 GB Ram, GTX 2080Ti 12 GB, Windows 11.
 Now I am planning to buy a laptop that would help with coursework, research paper reading and remote access to my lab PC. It should last at least 4/5 years (My current 5-year-old MSI laptop's hinge broke).
 I have the following laptops in mind with a budget of around $2000
  
14-inch Macbook Pro with 16 GB RAM and M2 PRO = $1999
 ASUS ROG Zephyrus 15.6" WQHD 165Hz Gaming Laptop, AMD Ryzen 9 6900HS,16GB DDR5 4800Mhz RAM, 1TB SSD PCIe 4.0 Storage, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 = $1400

 Errors in object detection examples found via cleanlab.
 Annotators of real-world object detection datasets often make such errors and many other mistakes. To avoid training models on erroneous data and save QA teams significant time, you can now use automated algorithms invented by our scientists.
 Our newest paper introduces Cleanlab Object Detection: a novel algorithm to assess label quality in any object detection dataset and catch errors (named ObjectLab for short). Extensive benchmarks show Cleanlab Object Detection identifies mislabeled images with better precision/recall than other approaches. When applied to the famous COCO dataset, Cleanlab Object Detection automatically discovers hundreds of mislabeled images, including errors where annotators mistakenly: overlooked an object that should’ve had a bounding box, sloppily drew a box in a poor location, or chose the wrong class label for an annotated object.
 We’ve open-sourced one line of code to find errors in any object detection dataset via Cleanlab Object Detection, which can utilize any existing object detection model you’ve trained. 
 For those interested, you can check out the 5-minute tutorial to get started and the blog to read the details.

 My search hasn't resulted much yet in this direction, but I have come across papers that render a 3D scene in multiple angles and then use 2D scene encoders on them. 
 So I'd like to ask the community: 
  
Are there 3D scene encoders like CLIP ViT 
 If not, is there's any other way that I can approach this problem.

Abstract: Domain adaptation of GANs is a problem of fine-tuning GAN models pretrained on a large dataset (e.g., StyleGAN) to a specific domain with few samples (e.g., painting faces, sketches, etc.). While there are many methods that tackle this problem in different ways, there are still many important questions that remain unanswered. In this paper, we provide a systematic and in-depth analysis of the domain adaptation problem of GANs, focusing on the StyleGAN model. We perform a detailed exploration of the most i…]]></summary>

The human brain is perhaps the most computationally complex machine in existence, consisting of networks of billions of cells. Researchers currently don’t understand the full picture of how glitches in its network machinery contribute to mental illnesses and other diseases, such as dementia. However, the emerging connectomics field, which aims to precisely map the connections between every cell in the brain, could help solve that problem. While maps have only been created for simpler organisms, technological advances for mapping even larger brains can enable us to understand how the human brain works, and how to treat brain diseases.

 For example Im in the process of switching jobs and one of the things I’ve learnt is that when delivering results (during fire drills) the way I write my code is focused on simply getting the results out vs being organized, efficient and scalable. While I get from point A to point B the way I get from point A to point B is not the most efficient. I think something I can do is take a step back and take a top down approach to problem solving when I enter my new role.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Training giant AI models like GPT-3 requires large resources - thousands of GPUs running for months. As a solo researcher without access to that kind of scale, I can't easily reproduce experiments and findings from papers on huge models.
 But a new paper from DeepMind shows you can recreate and study training instabilities seen in massive models by using small ones.
 The key is increasing the learning rate:
  
This reproduces "attention collapse" where the model focuses on just a few tokens, like overfitting.
 Also can reproduce "logit divergence" where output values drift unstably.
  
These issues have been reported when scaling up to billions of params. The cool part is techniques that fix them for giant models also work for small models:
  
qk-layernorm prevents attention collapse.
 Adding a "z-loss" term stops logit divergence.
  
Some other highlights from the paper include:
  
Longer warmup helps stability, especially for bigger models.
 Decoupling LR and weight decay improves stability.
 Depth increases sensitivity much faster than width.
 Can predict upcoming issues from scaling trends.
 Default epsilon hurts at large scale.
  
If the authors are right, one more tool that lets researchers study and even help train giant models without Google-size resources. Small models can guide large model development, sort of like how you can build a scale train set to study and improve how a railroad system works... for a lot less money than starting your own railroad company, buying land, building real tracks, etc.

 Guided Improvements: Human experts will likely initiate the process by enabling the AI to optimize specific aspects of its code. We're talking parameters, efficiency tweaks—stuff like that. It's like giving the AI a nudge in the right direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[John Carmack, celebrated software engineer and founder of Keen Technologies, and Dr. Richard Sutton, Chief Scientific Advisor at the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii) announce a partnership to bring greater focus and urgency to the creation of artificial general intelligence (AGI).
 This partnership is the first public milestone for Keen Technologies, following its initial funding announcement in August of 2022. The initial $20M round was led by Nat Friedman, Danial Gross, Patrick Collision, Tobi Lutke, Jim Keller, Sequoia Capital, and Capital Factory. In December 2022, Carmack departed as consulting CTO at Meta to focus his efforts on AGI.
 Sutton is the principal founder of the field of reinforcement learning. His work with Keen Technologies advances previously announced research priorities to understand basic computational intelligence. Through this work, documented in part in The Alberta Plan, Sutton seeks to understand and create long-lived computation agents that interact with a vastly more complex world and come to predict and control their sensory input signals.

In the latest update, I have added support for quad-precision double-double emulation for FFT calculation on most modern GPUs. I understand that modern ML is going in the opposite low-precision direction, but I still think that it may be useful to have this functionality at least for some prototyping and development of concepts.
 The double-double approach to the evaluation of quads represents an FP128 number as an unevaluated sum of two double numbers (like 1 and 1e-17 - the second one is smaller than 1 ULP of the first one). This increases the significand from 53 to 106 bits, allowing to do operations on numbers varying up to 32 orders of magnitude. The range of numb…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TYPO IN THE TITLE: I wanted the title to be "why should neural networks be end-to-end?" My lazy ass was swipe texting on my phone and this typo happened. FML
 Especially in robotics, there's been a lot of research for end-to-end neutral networks where an image is the input and the control action is the output, for say, tasks like pick an object and place it somewhere. I feel this is very restrictive while developing such a solution because it tightly couples the "control" network to the "estimation" network. This reduces modularity in building the solution, i.e., if I find a better controller architecture (machine learning based or rule based) I'm unable to use that for the task I'm solving. Moreover it seems like the generalizability of this task suffers because training this network to do this task may make it very good at only doing that specific task and the explainability of the decision making goes out of the window because it is black box. Additionally doesn't more parameters mean requiring more data to train the model? I don't see much use from such network architectures. However, I do see the applications in machine translation where you simply train the encoder and decoder to the target language at the same time with a single loss function. It seems useful there, but maybe not so much in robotics.
 Can someone tell me their thoughts on end-to-end architectures? Let's have a healthy discussion

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I am working on a content based recommender system that uses bio inspired optimization algorithms. The problem is, there aren't many resources online pertaining to this concept. Initially i thought it could be used to optimize text similarity. So is it possible to do that? Or it could be used to optimize any other aspect of the system? Please let me know if you have any knowledge! Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a project that I think AI might be able to help with.
 I have access to thousands of vintage postage stamps which also have cancelation stamps from when they were mailed. I'm thinking of publishing a book, and I want to create clean reproductions of the stamp designs without the cancelation marks.
 If I train AI on high resolution scans of 10 to 40 identical stamps, is there a tool that can look for commonalities within the patterns and then remove conflicting artifacts (cancelation stamps, tears, and smudges)? I'm aiming for a 400% enlargement that shows off clean and accurate detail. 
 What tools would I need? I’d prefer not to upload these scans to the web. Are there downloadable tools available? I’m technologically savvy and very experienced in graphic design software but have no experience in coding.
 All of this can be done manually in Photoshop, of course. But with thousands of stamp designs, I’d like to automate as much as I can.
 Thanks in advance for any insights!

Many people believe that since humans invented AI, they should be able to regulate and manage it for their own benefit.
 
However, this belief is misguided as AI is a new and potentially dangerous situation that requires careful consideration.
 
The author argues that AI is an evolutionary process that humans don't fully understand and cannot control.
 
The latest developments in AI, such as large language models and deepfakes, are causing anxiety and raising questions about the future implications of this technology.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[this is mostly a cross-post from r/rust as my initial attempt failed because of some external links
 We've first announced Candle, a minimalist ML framework in Rust 6 weeks ago. Since then we've focused on adding various recent models and improved the framework so as to support the necessary features in an efficient way. You can checkout a gallery of the examples, supported models include:
  
Large language models: LLaMA, LLaMA v2, Falcon, Phi-v1.5, StarCoder.
 Quantized models with the llama.cpp approach: LLaMA, T5, Phi-v1.5.
 Image generation: Stable Diffusion, Wuerstchen.
 Computer Vision: DINOv2, yolo-v3, yolo-v8, Segment-Anything Model.
 Text-to-speech: Whisper.
  
One of the big upside of the pure Rust approach is that models can run directly in the browser using WASM, these can be accessed through this collection, you can try out Yolo, Whisper, Segment-Anything, T5, Llama2-c from your web browser.
 Finally, in order to present a use case where Candle has unique capabilities, we've built a quantized version of the recently released Phi-v1.5 LLM. You can try it out with the following command, this uses a q4k quantized model resulting in very fast inference on CPU while still producing pretty nice texts.
 $ cargo run --example phi --release -- \ --prompt "Explain how to find the median of an array and write the corresponding python function.\nAnswer:" \ --quantized --sample-len 200 Explain how to find the median of an array and write the corresponding python function. Answer: The median is the middle value in an array. If the array has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle values. def median(arr): arr.sort() n = len(arr) if n % 2 == 0: return (arr[n//2 - 1] + arr[n//2]) / 2 else: return arr[n//2] 
 It's still very early days for Candle so please let us know if you start using it and run into some rough edges. We look forward to Rust getting a lot more usage in the ML space!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm reading this GAN paper which introduces a faster and simpler GAN architecture for creating high resolution images: FastGAN paper
 The authors claim the computational advantage of their approach is partly the simple architecture. 
 Looking at figure 3 and 4, I cannot quite see why this is considered a simpler architecture to older GANs,say DCGAN. I get the technical argument that the generator only has one convolutional layer, but figure 3 has lots of up sampling layers, and the discriminator has plenty of downsampling layers. So why is this considered a simple GAN model? 
 Any pointers appreciated.

These interns, recruited from vocational schools, face poor working conditions and subminimum wages.
 
Recent regulations require employers to pay interns minimum wage and prohibit schools from assigning repetitive work.
 
Tech giants like Baidu have partnered with vocational schools to create data annotation internships in less-developed regions, backed by local governments.
 
The exploitation of student interns in China's AI industry raises concerns about labor rights and fair compensation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First of all anyone offended by that question - heartiest apology. I am using it myself profusely at the moment. The reason for me asking this question, over last few weeks / months, I have been gradually educating myself in machine learning using Tensorflow and have been able to train multiple models using only one of the model zoo candidates. All the other pre trained models have failed me so far.
 I went onto Tensorflow official forum / Stackoverflow / Tensorflow github with specific error messages that I am getting on Ubuntu with Nvidia card / Mac M2 and there has been absolute radio silence in response to multiple posts over last month. Found many open issues listed since 2020 on the same line as mine i.e. identical error messages that people have come across.
 Finally after about a month of being on TF forum, I direct messaged an official TF2 dev who kindly responded with answers. I haven't succeeded yet with any of the pre trained model from the official section. Only one model from research section is working so far for me i.e. Faster_rcnn_resnet_50_640x640 ..
 Thus the question. Kindly help me enlighten myself with where is this thing headed. Should I consider switching to Pytorch or some alternative ? If yes what alternatives do you recommend ? TIA

I tried training it on my chat history to build some inifinite chat-generator for fun, but unfortunately, the results were bad. Recently I had even worse experiences with newly-released ChatGPT 3.5 fine-tuning.
 Are there any good, simple ways to train/fine-tune LLMs now? I would love something that could train on an Apple M2 processor (like Karpathy’s nanoGPT), or Colab, or cheap API (like ChatGPT fine-tuning).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As software projects grow, changing code across entire repositories becomes tedious & error-prone. Tasks like migrating APIs or updating dependencies require complex edits across files. I explored a new approach from Microsoft Research to automate these "repository-level" coding challenges with AI.
 Their new paper proposes CodePlan - an AI system that breaks repository tasks into incremental steps guided by planning & analysis.
 Key points:
  
Uses LLMs like GPT-3 for localized code edits
 Maintains validity across repository via incremental analysis
 Adaptively plans multi-step changes based on code dependencies
 Significantly outperformed baselines on API migration & temporal edits
 Automated tasks across 168 file C# codebase
 2-3x more accurate edit locations than baselines
 Produced final valid codebases, unlike reactive approaches
  
The core insight is combining LLM strengths with rigorous planning based on dependency analysis. This automates interdependent code changes that naive LLM use struggles with (I personally have these kinds of issues all the time with GPT4 - lack of context about the entirety of the repo/how files fit together).
 I think CodePlan demonstrates AI can expand beyond small coding assists into large-scale engineering tasks. Planning + LLMs > LLMs alone. This could really improve productivity and code quality... at least for me :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I made a FOSS baby sleep tracking system. The system tracks wake/sleep status, and informs the user when their baby is likely to need a nap next. But it stopped working as soon as my baby started sleeping on his stomach, and started using blankets. The original version relied on anatomical features being visible.
 This version delivers the ability to train a blank slate SVM binary classifier on pictures of a user's baby, making it extremely biased (and resilient) to the custom behaviors the user's baby exhibits (blanket covering baby, teddy bear/other objects in crib, etc.). All generated data stays on your machine, nothing leaves the LAN.
 Video: https://youtu.be/8i0wHA_knKc?si=uhA4PpOYP0jMKLz1
 For obvious reasons I didn't have a dataset of babies sleeping.. so I wrapped a python/flask service with a React app which lets a user press a button to train the model w/ a new image from the camera's live stream. Then this model is invoked over time (+ other heuristics) to determine whether your baby is present and sleeping.
 I believe it works better than $300+ systems sold on the market, open sourced it: https://github.com/calebolson123/BabySleepCoach
 ​
 I'm thinking a fun next step for this project could be to apply privateGPT on the feature-engineered sleep records for a true "Sleep Coach"

 Given the rapid advancements in the field of AI, the next few months are going to be pivotal. One of the pressing priorities is addressing ethical concerns. As algorithms become more pervasive, making sure they don't perpetuate biases or make unethical decisions is critical. That's not just a "good to have"; it's foundational. We can't build trust in AI systems unless we tackle this head-on.
 Another biggie is interpretability. Black-box models are potent, sure, but they're not very useful if no one can understand how they're making decisions. This has real-world implications—think medical diagnoses or judicial systems. So, there's a strong push towards making AI more transparent and understandable, not just for experts but for everyone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Wikipedia page on Diffusion Models has been pretty minimal for an entire year. I feel like it should be fixed, so I fixed it finally. It strikes me odd that such a hot topic has such atrociously bad Wikipedia. I feel duty-bound to educate the near-future AI, since they'll be reading Wikipedia for the next few years at least.
 Currently I think it's mostly complete, but I still don't understand the mathematical details of DDIM (I tried reading the paper and could not understand it), or generally how it is possible to sample without noise. This is a serious problem since as far as I see most of practical diffusion models use deterministic sampling, and they are all based on the same principle as DDIM.
 If anyone could explain simply what DDIM is really doing that would be great. I understand part of the paper: that they constructed an entire family of distributions over trajectories that has the same two-point marginals.
 I also haven't got much in the section on Examples. If you think there are some interesting examples of Diffusion Models, please comment below.

Specifically, I use Mujoco’s Humanoid, here is my code (https://github.com/NghiaPhamttk27/Humanoid).I use some algorithms in RL like SAC, TD3, A2C from stable\_baselines3. After every 25000 TIMESTEPS, I will save my model in the models folder. When I train continuously, everything goes well, I can see it on the tensorboard graph. But when I continue training a model that has been trained, the graph suddenly drops. In the image below you can see that I retrain the models at SAC\_75000 and SAC\_100000 and SAC\_125000. The graph continuously decreases at those thresholds.I think something happended Can you give me a reason or share something with me? Thanks in advance.
 You can see graph of SAC goes down when 76k, 100k, and 125k timeSteps

 The LLM-enabled fork can be found here (compileable sample code inside). 
 Maybe someone finds this useful. Also looking for collaborators to extend the functionality.

I was unaware so much was going on in the space. I am CEO of an AI startup, we have a compassionate AI. Most of the alignment focus out there is on superintelligence, little out there focuses on building modern day Ai that benefits humans. That’s been my focus for 17 years when I dreamed up what was possible and sent a proposal to executives at the mfaang corporation I was working at. I found out back then business doesn’t give a rats ass about Ai that actively makes its users life’s better. Well now I have proof that customers care. I’m hoping to find some resources on Ai alignment groups, conferences, more books etc. I’ll need to hire skilled ml engineers who do give a rats ass. Compassionate Ai isn’t just feel good tech. It would be good to do some networking. AI alignment doesn’t have to wait for AGI and super intelligence. It can and should be a focus today. My startup is proving it. Hoping to find a conference to network and share our research.

 ML is often portrayed as a magical field where anyone with a laptop and Python skills can build amazing AI systems. 
 The reality is less democratic: mastering ML requires gritty, systematic work best learned through formal training. You need rock solid foundations in math, programming, and core concepts—skills acquired through advanced education, which (almost always) is beyond self-taught hackers. 
 Most think a PhD is unnecessary, but the reality is that advanced degrees provide the deepest training. Patience and persistence do matter, but a PhD gives you a 10-year head start over weekend warriors. The hype overlooks the work and education needed to excel. This article has a great blueprint of all the required skills to become a ML Engineer (in the CV field).

 So I’ve got competing offers, one from the big 4 accounting firms as a software systems engineer - AI/ML (Big 4) and the other as a machine learning engineer. The startup salary is higher while big 4 is lower. Additionally the startup isn’t necessarily a unicorn it’s a relatively small startup with an interesting product but it doesn’t necessarily blow me away. The salary at the startup is 15 percent higher that that of the big 4 offer. For those wondering I did already negotiate the salary and they did increase it marginally. 
 I am conflicted because I think that the big 4 jobs will have
 1) more career growth 2) more potential future opportunities and 3) more networking potential
 Is this an accurate assessment? Which is the best job to take for maximum future potential?

This is a wonderful sub, and it's hard to please everyone on SUCH a broad topic... but it's intriguing to think about, as a lifelong magazine fan (and websites of course) - about using AI to filter, craft and create an amazing website/magazine ABOUT AI - well-categorized, maybe also human/editor curated/tweaked, but as fresh as ... well, the artificial sub but out of the Reddit bold/design into something ... well, something I'd read, visit a lot and love to help make work as a writer/editor (on the side of my "real" all-consuming gig of course;-)
 After all, if AI can 'make great code'/create great websites, maybe some folks out there are already trying to make this happen, for ease of information availability and organization. I can picture the departments/sections/categories now - I bet you can too!
 Anyone gone very far down that road yet (maybe the folks already doing the PC Magazines of the world) of organizing the vast fast-moving info beyond the AI Brews, Ben Parr's AI Analyst, etc.? Fun or a life-long journalist and tech geek (but not a coder, gamer etc.) to think about, at least!

 I have a Master’s in CS with research experience and a few publications applying machine learning in a fairly niche area (So not novel from the ML side). Since graduating, I’ve worked ~2 years as an ML engineer in small company(Niche area, different than research).
 I’ve done quite well here and have played a critical role in taking several big greenfield projects to completion. 
 Most of my work is framing problems, understanding what’s possible with current research, then building the data pipelines, and training models(with small mods here and there). My main worry is that I might be approaching a point where there won’t be any more problems I’m capable of solving here. I’d imagine I’d hit the same wall at any future company with my current skill set.
 I’d like to continue working in CV/Graphics/Perception if possible, but I’d also like to be realistic about the competitiveness of this particular subfield and my general ability.
 I’ve been trying to up-skill and am struggling to self study MVG by Hartley and Zisserman. I’m also looking into OMCS to review low-level programming - maybe I can transition to optimizing ml/cv algorithms?
 It hit me recently that I don’t really know what to study/what I’d benefit from learning. Hence this post. Any advice would be most appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hypothesis:
 Big tech companies are investing vast amounts of money to develop general models on which others will build. They'll develop interfaces to make it easier for others to fine-tune on top of their models. So that there will be less and less of a need for ML engineers that know how to create a deep learning model in Pytorch, and more and more of a need for data engineers that simply plug into pre-trained models. An AI assistant will also be quicker at coding up a more bespoke AI model for a companies needs, guided by data engineers.
 What do people think? Is this a scenario that they think will play out? Where will the demand for AI skills be coming from in the future?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LLMs are great with words but can't handle visual tasks like understanding images. Teaching them to use visual tools could make them much more capable.
 A new paper introduces GPT4Tools - a method to efficiently teach existing LLMs to invoke tools for visual tasks without proprietary data.
 My highlights from the paper:
  
Uses ChatGPT as a "teacher" to generate instructional data for other LLMs
 Fine-tunes LLMs like Vicuna on this data using selective weight tuning (keeps base model frozen)
 Allows smaller 13B LLM to match 175B GPT-3.5 on seen tools after tuning
 Data augmentation with negative/context samples was found to be the secret sauce to get this to work
 Can generalize to brand new visual tools in a zero-shot way
  
This is big because it shows we may not need hyper-expensive training of massive models to impart visual capabilities to LLMs. They seem to be generalizable enough that they can be taught to work with images. Some examples shown include counting objects or segmenting items in pictures using other tools.
 With this approach, existing models can be made multi-modal! Pretty cool.
 Full summary. Original paper is here.

 I'm a student and working on a RL project for the university and need some guidance.
 I have created a 3d model with mujoco (I have the xml file) how do I create an environment in gymnasium with this xml file?
 for the sake of an example let's say I have the xml file of the humanoid model how do I load this in gymnasium so that I could train it to walk? (this is just an example because the current project is harder to explain, but will use the humanoid model in the project)
 or is the approach that I'm trying is not appropriate at all? I came across this stackoverflow post where they say mujoco is itself good for this but was hard for me to understand due to lack of examples.
 would really appreciate some advice and guidance 
 thank you.

Hopefully it will help someone as it seems to me that it is more suitable for small projects than popular huge web based annotation tools.
 Link to the project: SAMAT (any feedback in Discussions section on GitHub is appreciated)
 Features:
  
Brush annotation (opposed to polygons)
 Magic Wand (like in Photoshop) powered by segment-anything masks (it is optional, if you don’t have cool GPU to prepare masks)
  
samat showcase
 Why yet another annotation tool?
 Before starting this project I tried supervisely, segments.ai, roboflow and several others, but found them not convenient for my tasks.
 Their cons, I tried to fix with my tool:
  
Latency: they are web based, hence burden with irritating latency during labeling (SAMAT is snappy because it is a local desktop app)
 Complicated: too much features, hence overloaded UI (SAMAT is just a colored brush)
  
P.S. there is another labeling tool called SALT on github which also uses segment-anything model, but it follows different approach to UI/UX, may be it will be more suitable for you, so take a look at it too.

 So far I understand it like this. Noise basically means that the agent will not always do the action that you say. You say left and it will go left only 50% of the time. it will choose other actions randomly.
 so, Why is the answer to the (c) and (d) questions (2) and (3) respectively?

Every explanation of the hyperplane state that all the points which are orthogonal to the vector w are in the hyperplane. However, all data point coordinates are defined wrt origin. So in order to attain this objective, we define the hyperplane as :
 wx = c
 This vector w is the vector which is normal to the hyperplane. And the data points x when dot producting with w outputting c are the points which are in the hyperplane due to the coordinates representation of x wrt origin.
 So points in the hyperplane are the points which when performing dot product with w equals 0 when the coordinates is defined wrt origin that lie in the hyperplane is equivalent to the points which when performing dot product with w equals c when the coordinates is defined wrt original origin (0) or (0,0) or ...

However most of that knowledge takes the backseat in practical cases, especially in the industry. Are there any resources which discuss practical LLM engineering and the challenges that come with it? I'm talking about everything from fine-tuning to dealing with tokenisation limit to optimising the vectorDB and so on?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a potential school project, im currently exploring whether or not some of the success the transformer architecture has had in seq-to-seq applications and high-dimensional pattern recognition could be extended to certain (online) RL problems (mainly those with high dimensional environment as well as long-term planning). 
 This could be done by using an augmented transformer as a function approximator, probably in combination with a SOTA online-rl algorithm (such as PPO, but if you know something that generally performs better do tell). Due to some of the problems associated with highly complex models and sample efficiency, I also thought about training the model using imitation learning first (which should be no problem with policy gradient methods afaik, though some slight adjustments would have to be made). For context, I'm thinking on benchmarking the approach using AlphaStar unplugged.
 However, when looking at current literature, only very few papers directly use transformers this way. Transformers seem to be very sample efficient and to generalize very well, but they are still only really used in a purely offline context (sometimes without directly using RL-techniques, such as with the Decision Transformer). And, if they are used in an online context, then only in some really intricate combination with other models (such as in AlphaStar). 
 Is there a reason why the approach I am currently considering is not popular in literature? Thank you very much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using LGBM for regression, where the Target column's lagged values (7 columns for each lag day) are also used as predictors when training the model. Absence of the 7Day lag values severely increases MAE value.
 Now when using the model in production, if I use the complete data as training dataset, how to get the 7day lag value of the time period I'm planning to predict? I obviously won't have the target value, to calculate it's 7Day lag value. What to do now?
 To explain in more detail:
 So, I'm predicting sales amount (Target variable y). The model is trained on 20 predictors (X), and 7 of them are the lag value of the Target Variable, i.e. Sales Amount.
 The thing is, while preparing the model, I had access to both X & y dataset, thus I could easily calculate Y's Lag values.
 Now, when predicting for future timestamps, I won't be having y. So how do I calculate the lag values, which is required in the trained model's predictor columns now?

 Abstract:
  
Large language models (LLMs) often demonstrate inconsistencies with human preferences. Previous research gathered human preference data and then aligned the pre-trained models using reinforcement learning or instruction tuning, the so-called finetuning step. In contrast, aligning frozen LLMs without any extra data is more appealing. This work explores the potential of the latter setting. We discover that by integrating self-evaluation and rewind mechanisms, unaligned LLMs can directly produce responses consistent with human preferences via self-boosting. We introduce a novel inference method, Rewindable Auto-regressive INference (RAIN), that allows pre-trained LLMs to evaluate their own generation and use the evaluation results to guid…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI systems like large language models (LLMs) are good at generating sentences but do not understand the meaning of the language.
 
LLMs have shown emergent abilities and can be used as aids to brainstorming.
 
GPT-4, an LLM, has been found to beat humans in creativity tests.
 
In an experiment, GPT-4 generated more, cheaper, and better ideas for a product than human students.
 
A professional working with GPT-4 can generate ideas at a rate of about 800 ideas per hour, making them 40 times more productive than a human working alone.
 
This technology is seen as a potential tool for corporations, similar to management consulting firms like McKinsey & Company.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Im trying to create a graph transformer-based model for de novo drug design (using graph transformer because I want to implement 3D data). I currently have 2 potential sources of primary data: PDBbind and CrossDocked2020. This would provide the protein-ligand structures. 
 PDBbind is a more robust and higher quality dataset from what I know, and easier to work with. The problem is that it only contains about 20,000 complexes, and I'm not sure if that is enough for training a transformer. CrossDocked2020 contains millions of entries but I'm not sure about the quality and ease of use. 
 Another dilemma is that I need/want to use a multi-task learning approach where the model is also being trained on bioactivity data, not just the structural information. This would require supplementation from sources like PubChem, ChEMBL, BDB, etc. and then I would need to align the data so it all matches up. 
 If anyone can provide some guidance I'd really appreciate it.

This is my first time 'learning' ML and I don't even know what I don't know about this topic!! 
 If you were attending my presentation on tree models, what would you like to see (assuming this is a new topic for you too. but please provide feedback based on your [hopefully] extensive knowledge on this topic)?
 Here is what I have so far (based on google searches, some papers):
 -Introduction
 -Types of trees based on algo and techniques (basically classification trees and regression trees)
 -Then I am thinking of going off on a tangent about decision trees bec I have no clue about how to move this presentation forward
 -Real-world applications
 -Key takeaways (inserts clownface emoji)
 My prof asks the students questions about the topic as well. I am mostly concerned about WHAT to cover in 5 minutes without making look under-researched. Any redirection/suggestions will be appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(I'm a Software Engineer who knows almost nothing about ML / NLP, so, apologies in advance if this doesn't make any sense.)
 I had a shower thought around if tokenization could incorporate meaning, so the models could be trained on "thoughts" instead of subword tokens (which is probably closer to how we humans think). To expand a little bit, we could first cluster all the words (maybe using the current day LLMs), then each token (or "thought") in the new scheme could represent a group of related words, followed by refinements that would be less and less important.
 For example, (cop_thought, cop_refinement) -> cop, but (cop_thought, police_refinement) -> police etc.
 So the encoding step would involve an LLM (which could possibly be relatively smaller), whose output would go to the actual model but the decoding would still be fairly straightforward. This could possibly free up some additional capacity in the actual model, assuming this heavy lifting tokenization makes its job easier, but as I'm typing it, I guess I'm simply moving some of the semantic understand happening in the hidden layers of the current day LLMs explicitly to the tokenization (encoding) step, which may not really change anything (if not make it worse).
 I'm still curious what folks think, if there's any related efforts (and all the ways I'm wrong -- https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cunningham%27s_Law). Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Keep in mind I'm very new to machine learning. I have an idea for a project where I train an AI to detect instances of someone being highly confident in a treatment for a condition, maybe biased toward more unconventional treatments.
 I was thinking that there may be many instances of people who posted that they were cured or nearly cured of such and such disease by an unconventional treatment on a forum about the condition. It may have been discussed for a little while, but ultimately buried in the pages of the forum.
 The plan would be to annotate instances I can find of such scenarios, maybe like this:
  
[FIRST_PERSON_HIGH_CONFIDENCE_TREATMENT]I had severe [CONDITION]migraines[/CONDITION] for years, and nothing seemed to work. Then I tried [TREATMENT]grounding, where I walk barefoot on grass for 30 minutes every day[/TREATMENT]. I can [HIGH_CONFIDENCE]honestly say I've never felt better[/HIGH_CONFIDENCE]. My [CONDITION]migraines[/CONDITION] have reduced by 80%, and I'm [HIGH_CONFIDENCE]convinced this is a game-changer for me[/HIGH_CONFIDENCE].[/FIRST_PERSON_HIGH_CONFIDENCE_TREATMENT]
  
Then train an AI with that data, so that it could detect cases of a person talking about themselves (to avoid hearsay) and saying, with high confidence, that a treatment worked for a condition.
 Then millions of forum posts could be fed to the AI to detect these, and the resulting data could be used to possibly discover effective treatments that are not in the mainstream.
 Any tips on getting started? I know almost nothing about this kind of stuff, like what models I should use, how to annotate it best (should I use relational labels?), whether to use a transformer or something else, stuff like that. Suggestions for books or other resources fit for a beginner that could help me learn how this could be done would be great too.

 My Struggle:
 I get that attention involves multiplying "query" and "key" vectors to determine the importance of different words in a sequence, but I don't quite understand why this multiplication gives us a meaningful metric for importance.
 What I'm looking for:
 I'm comfortable with moderate level technicalities but require a deeper insight into the inner workings and rationale behind these mechanisms. Please share any insights, analogies, or technical details that can shed light on this concept.
 Thanks a bunch!

I want to train a model that can recognize and classify different types of signals used by the Indian railways. For this, I need a large and diverse image dataset of railway signals from various locations, angles, lighting conditions, etc.
 I have searched online for existing datasets, but I could not find any that suit my needs. So I wish to create my own dataset from scratch. However, I am not sure how to go about it. What are the best practices and tools for creating an image dataset? How do I collect, label, and organize the images? How do I ensure the quality and consistency of the data?

 Large AI models like GPT-3 have good performance on translation tasks, but some smaller models struggle.
 Researchers from Johns Hopkins and Microsoft propose a new 2-stage fine-tuning method called ALMA that unlocks stronger translation abilities in smaller models with just 7-13 billion parameters.
 How it works:
  
Fine-tune on monolingual data in non-English languages to improve comprehension
 Further fine-tune on small sets of high-quality human-translated parallel text
  
The authors claim this achieves SOTA-level translation using far less data and compute than conventional methods:
  
Matches performance of 175B parameter GPT-3 and 54B parameter NLLB with only 7-13B parameters
 Reaches NLLB-level quality with just 1 billion monolingual tokens and 18 hours of training
  
I think this shows that smaller models can reach SOTA translation with specialized fine-tuning, so we may not need endlessly bigger datasets and models to get better performance. Looks like deliberate tuning targeting key language skills could be more important.
 Full summary here. Paper (preprint) is here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two-dimensional tensors are analogous to two-dimensional metrics. Like a two-dimensional metric, a two-dimensional tensor also has $n$ number of rows and columns. Let’s take a gray-scale image as an example, which is a two-dimensional matrix of numeric values, commonly known as pixels. Ranging from ‘0’ to ‘255’, each number represents a pixel intensity value. Here, […]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My husband Jeremy and I never intended to homeschool, and yet we have now, unexpectedly, committed to homeschooling long-term. Prior to the pandemic, we both worked full-time in careers that we loved and found meaningful, and we sent our daughter to a full-day Montessori school. Although I struggled with significant health issues, I felt unbelievably lucky and fulfilled in both my family life and my professional life. The pandemic upended my careful balance. Every family is different, with different needs, circumstances, and constraints, and what works for one may not work for others. My intention here is primarily to share the journey of my own (very privileged) family.
