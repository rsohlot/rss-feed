        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a project that I think AI might be able to help with.
 I have access to thousands of vintage postage stamps which also have cancelation stamps from when they were mailed. I'm thinking of publishing a book, and I want to create clean reproductions of the stamp designs without the cancelation marks.
 If I train AI on high resolution scans of 10 to 40 identical stamps, is there a tool that can look for commonalities within the patterns and then remove conflicting artifacts (cancelation stamps, tears, and smudges)? I'm aiming for a 400% enlargement that shows off clean and accurate detail. 
 What tools would I need? I’d prefer not to upload these scans to the web. Are there downloadable tools available? I’m technologically savvy and very experienced in graphic design software but have no experience in coding.
 All of this can be done manually in Photoshop, of course. But with thousands of stamp designs, I’d like to automate as much as I can.
 Thanks in advance for any insights!

Many people believe that since humans invented AI, they should be able to regulate and manage it for their own benefit.
 
However, this belief is misguided as AI is a new and potentially dangerous situation that requires careful consideration.
 
The author argues that AI is an evolutionary process that humans don't fully understand and cannot control.
 
The latest developments in AI, such as large language models and deepfakes, are causing anxiety and raising questions about the future implications of this technology.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[this is mostly a cross-post from r/rust as my initial attempt failed because of some external links
 We've first announced Candle, a minimalist ML framework in Rust 6 weeks ago. Since then we've focused on adding various recent models and improved the framework so as to support the necessary features in an efficient way. You can checkout a gallery of the examples, supported models include:
  
Large language models: LLaMA, LLaMA v2, Falcon, Phi-v1.5, StarCoder.
 Quantized models with the llama.cpp approach: LLaMA, T5, Phi-v1.5.
 Image generation: Stable Diffusion, Wuerstchen.
 Computer Vision: DINOv2, yolo-v3, yolo-v8, Segment-Anything Model.
 Text-to-speech: Whisper.
  
One of the big upside of the pure Rust approach is that models can run directly in the browser using WASM, these can be accessed through this collection, you can try out Yolo, Whisper, Segment-Anything, T5, Llama2-c from your web browser.
 Finally, in order to present a use case where Candle has unique capabilities, we've built a quantized version of the recently released Phi-v1.5 LLM. You can try it out with the following command, this uses a q4k quantized model resulting in very fast inference on CPU while still producing pretty nice texts.
 $ cargo run --example phi --release -- \ --prompt "Explain how to find the median of an array and write the corresponding python function.\nAnswer:" \ --quantized --sample-len 200 Explain how to find the median of an array and write the corresponding python function. Answer: The median is the middle value in an array. If the array has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle values. def median(arr): arr.sort() n = len(arr) if n % 2 == 0: return (arr[n//2 - 1] + arr[n//2]) / 2 else: return arr[n//2] 
 It's still very early days for Candle so please let us know if you start using it and run into some rough edges. We look forward to Rust getting a lot more usage in the ML space!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm reading this GAN paper which introduces a faster and simpler GAN architecture for creating high resolution images: FastGAN paper
 The authors claim the computational advantage of their approach is partly the simple architecture. 
 Looking at figure 3 and 4, I cannot quite see why this is considered a simpler architecture to older GANs,say DCGAN. I get the technical argument that the generator only has one convolutional layer, but figure 3 has lots of up sampling layers, and the discriminator has plenty of downsampling layers. So why is this considered a simple GAN model? 
 Any pointers appreciated.

These interns, recruited from vocational schools, face poor working conditions and subminimum wages.
 
Recent regulations require employers to pay interns minimum wage and prohibit schools from assigning repetitive work.
 
Tech giants like Baidu have partnered with vocational schools to create data annotation internships in less-developed regions, backed by local governments.
 
The exploitation of student interns in China's AI industry raises concerns about labor rights and fair compensation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First of all anyone offended by that question - heartiest apology. I am using it myself profusely at the moment. The reason for me asking this question, over last few weeks / months, I have been gradually educating myself in machine learning using Tensorflow and have been able to train multiple models using only one of the model zoo candidates. All the other pre trained models have failed me so far.
 I went onto Tensorflow official forum / Stackoverflow / Tensorflow github with specific error messages that I am getting on Ubuntu with Nvidia card / Mac M2 and there has been absolute radio silence in response to multiple posts over last month. Found many open issues listed since 2020 on the same line as mine i.e. identical error messages that people have come across.
 Finally after about a month of being on TF forum, I direct messaged an official TF2 dev who kindly responded with answers. I haven't succeeded yet with any of the pre trained model from the official section. Only one model from research section is working so far for me i.e. Faster_rcnn_resnet_50_640x640 ..
 Thus the question. Kindly help me enlighten myself with where is this thing headed. Should I consider switching to Pytorch or some alternative ? If yes what alternatives do you recommend ? TIA

I tried training it on my chat history to build some inifinite chat-generator for fun, but unfortunately, the results were bad. Recently I had even worse experiences with newly-released ChatGPT 3.5 fine-tuning.
 Are there any good, simple ways to train/fine-tune LLMs now? I would love something that could train on an Apple M2 processor (like Karpathy’s nanoGPT), or Colab, or cheap API (like ChatGPT fine-tuning).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As software projects grow, changing code across entire repositories becomes tedious & error-prone. Tasks like migrating APIs or updating dependencies require complex edits across files. I explored a new approach from Microsoft Research to automate these "repository-level" coding challenges with AI.
 Their new paper proposes CodePlan - an AI system that breaks repository tasks into incremental steps guided by planning & analysis.
 Key points:
  
Uses LLMs like GPT-3 for localized code edits
 Maintains validity across repository via incremental analysis
 Adaptively plans multi-step changes based on code dependencies
 Significantly outperformed baselines on API migration & temporal edits
 Automated tasks across 168 file C# codebase
 2-3x more accurate edit locations than baselines
 Produced final valid codebases, unlike reactive approaches
  
The core insight is combining LLM strengths with rigorous planning based on dependency analysis. This automates interdependent code changes that naive LLM use struggles with (I personally have these kinds of issues all the time with GPT4 - lack of context about the entirety of the repo/how files fit together).
 I think CodePlan demonstrates AI can expand beyond small coding assists into large-scale engineering tasks. Planning + LLMs > LLMs alone. This could really improve productivity and code quality... at least for me :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I made a FOSS baby sleep tracking system. The system tracks wake/sleep status, and informs the user when their baby is likely to need a nap next. But it stopped working as soon as my baby started sleeping on his stomach, and started using blankets. The original version relied on anatomical features being visible.
 This version delivers the ability to train a blank slate SVM binary classifier on pictures of a user's baby, making it extremely biased (and resilient) to the custom behaviors the user's baby exhibits (blanket covering baby, teddy bear/other objects in crib, etc.). All generated data stays on your machine, nothing leaves the LAN.
 Video: https://youtu.be/8i0wHA_knKc?si=uhA4PpOYP0jMKLz1
 For obvious reasons I didn't have a dataset of babies sleeping.. so I wrapped a python/flask service with a React app which lets a user press a button to train the model w/ a new image from the camera's live stream. Then this model is invoked over time (+ other heuristics) to determine whether your baby is present and sleeping.
 I believe it works better than $300+ systems sold on the market, open sourced it: https://github.com/calebolson123/BabySleepCoach
 ​
 I'm thinking a fun next step for this project could be to apply privateGPT on the feature-engineered sleep records for a true "Sleep Coach"

 Given the rapid advancements in the field of AI, the next few months are going to be pivotal. One of the pressing priorities is addressing ethical concerns. As algorithms become more pervasive, making sure they don't perpetuate biases or make unethical decisions is critical. That's not just a "good to have"; it's foundational. We can't build trust in AI systems unless we tackle this head-on.
 Another biggie is interpretability. Black-box models are potent, sure, but they're not very useful if no one can understand how they're making decisions. This has real-world implications—think medical diagnoses or judicial systems. So, there's a strong push towards making AI more transparent and understandable, not just for experts but for everyone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Wikipedia page on Diffusion Models has been pretty minimal for an entire year. I feel like it should be fixed, so I fixed it finally. It strikes me odd that such a hot topic has such atrociously bad Wikipedia. I feel duty-bound to educate the near-future AI, since they'll be reading Wikipedia for the next few years at least.
 Currently I think it's mostly complete, but I still don't understand the mathematical details of DDIM (I tried reading the paper and could not understand it), or generally how it is possible to sample without noise. This is a serious problem since as far as I see most of practical diffusion models use deterministic sampling, and they are all based on the same principle as DDIM.
 If anyone could explain simply what DDIM is really doing that would be great. I understand part of the paper: that they constructed an entire family of distributions over trajectories that has the same two-point marginals.
 I also haven't got much in the section on Examples. If you think there are some interesting examples of Diffusion Models, please comment below.

Specifically, I use Mujoco’s Humanoid, here is my code (https://github.com/NghiaPhamttk27/Humanoid).I use some algorithms in RL like SAC, TD3, A2C from stable\_baselines3. After every 25000 TIMESTEPS, I will save my model in the models folder. When I train continuously, everything goes well, I can see it on the tensorboard graph. But when I continue training a model that has been trained, the graph suddenly drops. In the image below you can see that I retrain the models at SAC\_75000 and SAC\_100000 and SAC\_125000. The graph continuously decreases at those thresholds.I think something happended Can you give me a reason or share something with me? Thanks in advance.
 You can see graph of SAC goes down when 76k, 100k, and 125k timeSteps

 The LLM-enabled fork can be found here (compileable sample code inside). 
 Maybe someone finds this useful. Also looking for collaborators to extend the functionality.

I was unaware so much was going on in the space. I am CEO of an AI startup, we have a compassionate AI. Most of the alignment focus out there is on superintelligence, little out there focuses on building modern day Ai that benefits humans. That’s been my focus for 17 years when I dreamed up what was possible and sent a proposal to executives at the mfaang corporation I was working at. I found out back then business doesn’t give a rats ass about Ai that actively makes its users life’s better. Well now I have proof that customers care. I’m hoping to find some resources on Ai alignment groups, conferences, more books etc. I’ll need to hire skilled ml engineers who do give a rats ass. Compassionate Ai isn’t just feel good tech. It would be good to do some networking. AI alignment doesn’t have to wait for AGI and super intelligence. It can and should be a focus today. My startup is proving it. Hoping to find a conference to network and share our research.

 ML is often portrayed as a magical field where anyone with a laptop and Python skills can build amazing AI systems. 
 The reality is less democratic: mastering ML requires gritty, systematic work best learned through formal training. You need rock solid foundations in math, programming, and core concepts—skills acquired through advanced education, which (almost always) is beyond self-taught hackers. 
 Most think a PhD is unnecessary, but the reality is that advanced degrees provide the deepest training. Patience and persistence do matter, but a PhD gives you a 10-year head start over weekend warriors. The hype overlooks the work and education needed to excel. This article has a great blueprint of all the required skills to become a ML Engineer (in the CV field).

 So I’ve got competing offers, one from the big 4 accounting firms as a software systems engineer - AI/ML (Big 4) and the other as a machine learning engineer. The startup salary is higher while big 4 is lower. Additionally the startup isn’t necessarily a unicorn it’s a relatively small startup with an interesting product but it doesn’t necessarily blow me away. The salary at the startup is 15 percent higher that that of the big 4 offer. For those wondering I did already negotiate the salary and they did increase it marginally. 
 I am conflicted because I think that the big 4 jobs will have
 1) more career growth 2) more potential future opportunities and 3) more networking potential
 Is this an accurate assessment? Which is the best job to take for maximum future potential?

This is a wonderful sub, and it's hard to please everyone on SUCH a broad topic... but it's intriguing to think about, as a lifelong magazine fan (and websites of course) - about using AI to filter, craft and create an amazing website/magazine ABOUT AI - well-categorized, maybe also human/editor curated/tweaked, but as fresh as ... well, the artificial sub but out of the Reddit bold/design into something ... well, something I'd read, visit a lot and love to help make work as a writer/editor (on the side of my "real" all-consuming gig of course;-)
 After all, if AI can 'make great code'/create great websites, maybe some folks out there are already trying to make this happen, for ease of information availability and organization. I can picture the departments/sections/categories now - I bet you can too!
 Anyone gone very far down that road yet (maybe the folks already doing the PC Magazines of the world) of organizing the vast fast-moving info beyond the AI Brews, Ben Parr's AI Analyst, etc.? Fun or a life-long journalist and tech geek (but not a coder, gamer etc.) to think about, at least!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been having a bit of an existential crisis as of late and wanted to ask for advice on how to move forward.
 I have a Master’s in CS with research experience and a few publications applying machine learning in a fairly niche area (So not novel from the ML side). Since graduating, I’ve worked ~2 years as an ML engineer in small company(Niche area, different than research).
 I’ve done quite well here and have played a critical role in taking several big greenfield projects to completion. 
 Most of my work is framing problems, understanding what’s possible with current research, then building the data pipelines, and training models(with small mods here and there). My main worry is that I might be approaching a point where there won’t be any more problems I’m capable of solving here. I’d imagine I’d hit the same wall at any future company with my current skill set.
 I’d like to continue working in CV/Graphics/Perception if possible, but I’d also like to be realistic about the competitiveness of this particular subfield and my general ability.
 I’ve been trying to up-skill and am struggling to self study MVG by Hartley and Zisserman. I’m also looking into OMCS to review low-level programming - maybe I can transition to optimizing ml/cv algorithms?
 It hit me recently that I don’t really know what to study/what I’d benefit from learning. Hence this post. Any advice would be most appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hypothesis:
 Big tech companies are investing vast amounts of money to develop general models on which others will build. They'll develop interfaces to make it easier for others to fine-tune on top of their models. So that there will be less and less of a need for ML engineers that know how to create a deep learning model in Pytorch, and more and more of a need for data engineers that simply plug into pre-trained models. An AI assistant will also be quicker at coding up a more bespoke AI model for a companies needs, guided by data engineers.
 What do people think? Is this a scenario that they think will play out? Where will the demand for AI skills be coming from in the future?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LLMs are great with words but can't handle visual tasks like understanding images. Teaching them to use visual tools could make them much more capable.
 A new paper introduces GPT4Tools - a method to efficiently teach existing LLMs to invoke tools for visual tasks without proprietary data.
 My highlights from the paper:
  
Uses ChatGPT as a "teacher" to generate instructional data for other LLMs
 Fine-tunes LLMs like Vicuna on this data using selective weight tuning (keeps base model frozen)
 Allows smaller 13B LLM to match 175B GPT-3.5 on seen tools after tuning
 Data augmentation with negative/context samples was found to be the secret sauce to get this to work
 Can generalize to brand new visual tools in a zero-shot way
  
This is big because it shows we may not need hyper-expensive training of massive models to impart visual capabilities to LLMs. They seem to be generalizable enough that they can be taught to work with images. Some examples shown include counting objects or segmenting items in pictures using other tools.
 With this approach, existing models can be made multi-modal! Pretty cool.
 Full summary. Original paper is here.

 I'm a student and working on a RL project for the university and need some guidance.
 I have created a 3d model with mujoco (I have the xml file) how do I create an environment in gymnasium with this xml file?
 for the sake of an example let's say I have the xml file of the humanoid model how do I load this in gymnasium so that I could train it to walk? (this is just an example because the current project is harder to explain, but will use the humanoid model in the project)
 or is the approach that I'm trying is not appropriate at all? I came across this stackoverflow post where they say mujoco is itself good for this but was hard for me to understand due to lack of examples.
 would really appreciate some advice and guidance 
 thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just open-sourced (MIT License) semantic segmentation annotation tool powered by segment-anything model that I used for a while in my projects. Hopefully it will help someone as it seems to me that it is more suitable for small projects than popular huge web based annotation tools.
 Link to the project: SAMAT (any feedback in Discussions section on GitHub is appreciated)
 Features:
  
Brush annotation (opposed to polygons)
 Magic Wand (like in Photoshop) powered by segment-anything masks (it is optional, if you don’t have cool GPU to prepare masks)
  
samat showcase
 Why yet another annotation tool?
 Before starting this project I tried supervisely, segments.ai, roboflow and several others, but found them not convenient for my tasks.
 Their cons, I tried to fix with my tool:
  
Latency: they are web based, hence burden with irritating latency during labeling (SAMAT is snappy because it is a local desktop app)
 Complicated: too much features, hence overloaded UI (SAMAT is just a colored brush)
  
P.S. there is another labeling tool called SALT on github which also uses segment-anything model, but it follows different approach to UI/UX, may be it will be more suitable for you, so take a look at it too.

By leveraging GPT-4's advanced capabilities, the study aimed to showcase the model's potential in understanding, decision-making, and interaction during game scenarios. Comparative analyses between GPT-4 and its predecessor, GPT-3.5-turbo, demonstrated GPT-4's enhanced adaptability to the game environment, with significant improvements in posing relevant questions and forming human-like responses.

 So far I understand it like this. Noise basically means that the agent will not always do the action that you say. You say left and it will go left only 50% of the time. it will choose other actions randomly.
 so, Why is the answer to the (c) and (d) questions (2) and (3) respectively?
 I understand the learning rate but not how risking the cliff is affected by the noise.

Every explanation of the hyperplane state that all the points which are orthogonal to the vector w are in the hyperplane. However, all data point coordinates are defined wrt origin. So in order to attain this objective, we define the hyperplane as :
 wx = c
 This vector w is the vector which is normal to the hyperplane. And the data points x when dot producting with w outputting c are the points which are in the hyperplane due to the coordinates representation of x wrt origin.
 So points in the hyperplane are the points which when performing dot product with w equals 0 when the coordinates is defined wrt origin that lie in the hyperplane is equivalent to the points which when performing dot product with w equals c when the coordinates is defined wrt original origin (0) or (0,0) or ...

However most of that knowledge takes the backseat in practical cases, especially in the industry. Are there any resources which discuss practical LLM engineering and the challenges that come with it? I'm talking about everything from fine-tuning to dealing with tokenisation limit to optimising the vectorDB and so on?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a potential school project, im currently exploring whether or not some of the success the transformer architecture has had in seq-to-seq applications and high-dimensional pattern recognition could be extended to certain (online) RL problems (mainly those with high dimensional environment as well as long-term planning). 
 This could be done by using an augmented transformer as a function approximator, probably in combination with a SOTA online-rl algorithm (such as PPO, but if you know something that generally performs better do tell). Due to some of the problems associated with highly complex models and sample efficiency, I also thought about training the model using imitation learning first (which should be no problem with policy gradient methods afaik, though some slight adjustments would have to be made). For context, I'm thinking on benchmarking the approach using AlphaStar unplugged.
 However, when looking at current literature, only very few papers directly use transformers this way. Transformers seem to be very sample efficient and to generalize very well, but they are still only really used in a purely offline context (sometimes without directly using RL-techniques, such as with the Decision Transformer). And, if they are used in an online context, then only in some really intricate combination with other models (such as in AlphaStar). 
 Is there a reason why the approach I am currently considering is not popular in literature? Thank you very much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using LGBM for regression, where the Target column's lagged values (7 columns for each lag day) are also used as predictors when training the model. Absence of the 7Day lag values severely increases MAE value.
 Now when using the model in production, if I use the complete data as training dataset, how to get the 7day lag value of the time period I'm planning to predict? I obviously won't have the target value, to calculate it's 7Day lag value. What to do now?
 To explain in more detail:
 So, I'm predicting sales amount (Target variable y). The model is trained on 20 predictors (X), and 7 of them are the lag value of the Target Variable, i.e. Sales Amount.
 The thing is, while preparing the model, I had access to both X & y dataset, thus I could easily calculate Y's Lag values.
 Now, when predicting for future timestamps, I won't be having y. So how do I calculate the lag values, which is required in the trained model's predictor columns now?

 Abstract:
  
Large language models (LLMs) often demonstrate inconsistencies with human preferences. Previous research gathered human preference data and then aligned the pre-trained models using reinforcement learning or instruction tuning, the so-called finetuning step. In contrast, aligning frozen LLMs without any extra data is more appealing. This work explores the potential of the latter setting. We discover that by integrating self-evaluation and rewind mechanisms, unaligned LLMs can directly produce responses consistent with human preferences via self-boosting. We introduce a novel inference method, Rewindable Auto-regressive INference (RAIN), that allows pre-trained LLMs to evaluate their own generation and use the evaluation results to guid…]]></summary>

LLMs have shown emergent abilities and can be used as aids to brainstorming.
 
GPT-4, an LLM, has been found to beat humans in creativity tests.
 
In an experiment, GPT-4 generated more, cheaper, and better ideas for a product than human students.
 
A professional working with GPT-4 can generate ideas at a rate of about 800 ideas per hour, making them 40 times more productive than a human working alone.
 
This technology is seen as a potential tool for corporations, similar to management consulting firms like McKinsey & Company.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Im trying to create a graph transformer-based model for de novo drug design (using graph transformer because I want to implement 3D data). I currently have 2 potential sources of primary data: PDBbind and CrossDocked2020. This would provide the protein-ligand structures. 
 PDBbind is a more robust and higher quality dataset from what I know, and easier to work with. The problem is that it only contains about 20,000 complexes, and I'm not sure if that is enough for training a transformer. CrossDocked2020 contains millions of entries but I'm not sure about the quality and ease of use. 
 Another dilemma is that I need/want to use a multi-task learning approach where the model is also being trained on bioactivity data, not just the structural information. This would require supplementation from sources like PubChem, ChEMBL, BDB, etc. and then I would need to align the data so it all matches up. 
 If anyone can provide some guidance I'd really appreciate it.

This is my first time 'learning' ML and I don't even know what I don't know about this topic!! 
 If you were attending my presentation on tree models, what would you like to see (assuming this is a new topic for you too. but please provide feedback based on your [hopefully] extensive knowledge on this topic)?
 Here is what I have so far (based on google searches, some papers):
 -Introduction
 -Types of trees based on algo and techniques (basically classification trees and regression trees)
 -Then I am thinking of going off on a tangent about decision trees bec I have no clue about how to move this presentation forward
 -Real-world applications
 -Key takeaways (inserts clownface emoji)
 My prof asks the students questions about the topic as well. I am mostly concerned about WHAT to cover in 5 minutes without making look under-researched. Any redirection/suggestions will be appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(I'm a Software Engineer who knows almost nothing about ML / NLP, so, apologies in advance if this doesn't make any sense.)
 I had a shower thought around if tokenization could incorporate meaning, so the models could be trained on "thoughts" instead of subword tokens (which is probably closer to how we humans think). To expand a little bit, we could first cluster all the words (maybe using the current day LLMs), then each token (or "thought") in the new scheme could represent a group of related words, followed by refinements that would be less and less important.
 For example, (cop_thought, cop_refinement) -> cop, but (cop_thought, police_refinement) -> police etc.
 So the encoding step would involve an LLM (which could possibly be relatively smaller), whose output would go to the actual model but the decoding would still be fairly straightforward. This could possibly free up some additional capacity in the actual model, assuming this heavy lifting tokenization makes its job easier, but as I'm typing it, I guess I'm simply moving some of the semantic understand happening in the hidden layers of the current day LLMs explicitly to the tokenization (encoding) step, which may not really change anything (if not make it worse).
 I'm still curious what folks think, if there's any related efforts (and all the ways I'm wrong -- https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cunningham%27s_Law). Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Keep in mind I'm very new to machine learning. I have an idea for a project where I train an AI to detect instances of someone being highly confident in a treatment for a condition, maybe biased toward more unconventional treatments.
 I was thinking that there may be many instances of people who posted that they were cured or nearly cured of such and such disease by an unconventional treatment on a forum about the condition. It may have been discussed for a little while, but ultimately buried in the pages of the forum.
 The plan would be to annotate instances I can find of such scenarios, maybe like this:
  
[FIRST_PERSON_HIGH_CONFIDENCE_TREATMENT]I had severe [CONDITION]migraines[/CONDITION] for years, and nothing seemed to work. Then I tried [TREATMENT]grounding, where I walk barefoot on grass for 30 minutes every day[/TREATMENT]. I can [HIGH_CONFIDENCE]honestly say I've never felt better[/HIGH_CONFIDENCE]. My [CONDITION]migraines[/CONDITION] have reduced by 80%, and I'm [HIGH_CONFIDENCE]convinced this is a game-changer for me[/HIGH_CONFIDENCE].[/FIRST_PERSON_HIGH_CONFIDENCE_TREATMENT]
  
Then train an AI with that data, so that it could detect cases of a person talking about themselves (to avoid hearsay) and saying, with high confidence, that a treatment worked for a condition.
 Then millions of forum posts could be fed to the AI to detect these, and the resulting data could be used to possibly discover effective treatments that are not in the mainstream.
 Any tips on getting started? I know almost nothing about this kind of stuff, like what models I should use, how to annotate it best (should I use relational labels?), whether to use a transformer or something else, stuff like that. Suggestions for books or other resources fit for a beginner that could help me learn how this could be done would be great too.

 My Struggle:
 I get that attention involves multiplying "query" and "key" vectors to determine the importance of different words in a sequence, but I don't quite understand why this multiplication gives us a meaningful metric for importance.
 What I'm looking for:
 I'm comfortable with moderate level technicalities but require a deeper insight into the inner workings and rationale behind these mechanisms. Please share any insights, analogies, or technical details that can shed light on this concept.

I want to train a model that can recognize and classify different types of signals used by the Indian railways. For this, I need a large and diverse image dataset of railway signals from various locations, angles, lighting conditions, etc.
 I have searched online for existing datasets, but I could not find any that suit my needs. So I wish to create my own dataset from scratch. However, I am not sure how to go about it. What are the best practices and tools for creating an image dataset? How do I collect, label, and organize the images? How do I ensure the quality and consistency of the data?

 Large AI models like GPT-3 have good performance on translation tasks, but some smaller models struggle.
 Researchers from Johns Hopkins and Microsoft propose a new 2-stage fine-tuning method called ALMA that unlocks stronger translation abilities in smaller models with just 7-13 billion parameters.
 How it works:
  
Fine-tune on monolingual data in non-English languages to improve comprehension
 Further fine-tune on small sets of high-quality human-translated parallel text
  
The authors claim this achieves SOTA-level translation using far less data and compute than conventional methods:
  
Matches performance of 175B parameter GPT-3 and 54B parameter NLLB with only 7-13B parameters
 Reaches NLLB-level quality with just 1 billion monolingual tokens and 18 hours of training
  
I think this shows that smaller models can reach SOTA translation with specialized fine-tuning, so we may not need endlessly bigger datasets and models to get better performance. Looks like deliberate tuning targeting key language skills could be more important.

 ​
 Figure 3 from the paper
 Maybe there's something more than just matrix multiplication, because the numbers don't add up. If there are two matrices, A & B, of size n,r and r,m, and r = 1, and you multiply them, then it implies that n + m = 386k, which seems to be a bit much for a number of parameters in a single layer.
 Then we have two matrices of size a,r and r,b, where a = 100, b = 50 and there are 28k variables, according to the figure - in 4.1 they say 30k. If there's 30k, that would imply r = 200, for matrices of shape 100,200 and 200,50.
 I guess 386k and 28k are for the whole models, n and m differ from layer to layer, and r stays at one. Quite surprising to me that approximating a n,m shaped matrix with a product of n,1 and 1,m vectors would work. Even more surprising that apparently you could squeeze it further to 100,1 and 50,1.

 Multi-part question.
  
I have scraped text (I repeat, text, and not structured data such as tables or something) from a medical site, and I want to know how to clean it. And when I say clean, I don't mean removal of html tags and such. I already have the paragraphs in plain text but there is a lot of spammy stuff like "You are not signed in; subscribe to this newsletter; by checking this box, I agree to the terms and conditions, etc." This text is not the exact same in all the paragraphs but there is high similarity. I would have thought there would be many tools to clean text and remove unrelated chunks like these but all I have been able to find has to do with cleaning html tags, changing date-time format and so on. Am I missing something or is this actually difficult?
  
Secondly, the spammy text I mentioned is from just one site. I will be eventually scaling to many sites and god knows what random text I'll have to clean then.
  
I used OpenAI embeddings and cosine similarity on the medical text to find similar paragraphs. The results were not great. Is there a way to improve the similarity search? I will be trying FAISS next but wanted to know what else I can do. It was suggested to me to use a pretrained embedding model specific to medical data. However, I found only one such model which is 20 gigs!
  
I'm just getting started with these, so, appreciate any help I can get.
 Thanks a ton!

 I have been asked to compare the top ten llms for research before we implement an llm for our company. So far my research has felt scattered because I’m not what directions to go in. I’ve been looking at things like open source vs closed source, parameters, tokens, what the license looks like (available for commercial use), and pricing. 
 If anyone has thoughts on resources to look at or better ways to approach this, I would really appreciate it!

My research is on various medical image segmentation problems, including brain 3D US (glioma), lung CT (interstitial lung disease in scleroderma patients), etc. using the PyTorch ecosystem (probably including frameworks such as MONAI)
 I'll have to conduct several experiments on various model architectures on parameters in the coming months. Specifically, these are what I'm gonna need:
  
Experiment tracking (model architecture, training configuration, hyperparameters, evaluation metrics)
 Model storage (would be nice if there's a better way to store my model's parameters other than storing tons of .pth file on my harddisk or google drive)
 (Optional) Visualization (sample predictions of the model on the training or validation sets, maybe every 20 epochs or sth)
 Would like to hear any suggestions from the community
  
I've found wandb, clearML, neptune, and Aim; but trying each of them individually would be too time-consuming considering my current schedule.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I've been taking a look at hypernetworks and noticed they've been used in some cool ways in RL with stuff like Qmix and this Metalearning paper.
 Quick recap:
  
f is our regular neural network: takes in input x and outputs y using weights \theta.
 g is the hypernetwork, it creates the weights \theta for f based on its own weights \phi and maybe the input x.
  
Original paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09106
 I watched this talk and it hinted that hypernetworks might even be better than our regular networks even for supervised learning regular tasks.
 So, I'm curious:
  
What's the deal with hypernetworks? What makes them good or not vs regular neural networks?
 I get that they're good for metalearning, but could they also be a game-changer for other things, like sample efficiency?
  
Does anyone have thoughts or reads on this? 
 Thanks!

Then, for scientific topics, I try to get a confirmation with Google using the keywords in the generated answer and google. For technical topics I can often check if it works.
 Some examples:
 For cooking, a topic I don't master enough to ask questions with the best keywords... 
 Are the spicy compounds of Ginger soluble in water or oil ? > I will get me to know that "the gingerol is liposoluble", what can be more easily checked in Google.
 Or for 3D geometry, a topic where I have complex questions... 
 I want to place a 3D frame B so that the Z axis of the B frame point towards the world origin A. I know the angle Alpha between the Z axis of the frame B and The X,Y plane of A. I know the angle Beta between the X axis of A and the vector that goes from the center of A towards the projection of the center of B on the X,Y plane of A. How do you compute the homogeneous rotation matrix of B relative to A, knowing Alpha, Beta and the distance between the center of A and the center of B ?
 Most of time, Bing and the free ChatGPT can answer. But sometimes they struggle or give incorrect answer. 
 Would ChatGPT plus paid subscription be helpful to find more accurate answers?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A fundamental shortcoming of the concept of Nash equilibrium is its
computational intractability: approximating Nash equilibria in normal-form
games is PPAD-hard. In this paper, inspired by the ideas of smoothed analysis,
we introduce a relaxed variant of Nash equilibrium called $\sigma$-smooth Nash
equilibrium, for a smoothness parameter $\sigma$. In a $\sigma$-smooth Nash
equilibrium, players only need to achieve utility at least as high as their
best deviation to a $\sigma$-smooth strategy, which is a distribution that does
not put too much mass (as parametrized by $\sigma$) on any fixed action. We
distinguish two variants of $\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibria: strong
$\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibria, in which players are required to play
$\sigma$-smooth strategies under equilibrium play, and weak $\sigma$-smooth
Nash equilibria, where there is no such requirement.

We show that both weak and strong $\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibria have
superior computational properties to Nash equilibria: when $\sigma$ as well as
an approximation parameter $\epsilon$ and the number of players are all
constants, there is a constant-time randomized algorithm to find a weak
$\epsilon$-approximate $\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibrium in normal-form games.
In the same parameter regime, there is a polynomial-time deterministic
algorithm to find a strong $\epsilon$-approximate $\sigma$-smooth Nash
equilibrium in a normal-form game. These results stand in contrast to the
optimal algorithm for computing $\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibria, which
cannot run in faster than quasipolynomial-time. We complement our upper bounds
by showing that when either $\sigma$ or $\epsilon$ is an inverse polynomial,
finding a weak $\epsilon$-approximate $\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibria becomes
computationally intractable.]]></summary>

to navigate, manipulate objects, and answer questions based on their
environment. While existing approaches often rely on extensive labeled data or
exhibit limitations in handling complex language queries, we propose
LLM-Grounder, a novel zero-shot, open-vocabulary, Large Language Model
(LLM)-based 3D visual grounding pipeline. LLM-Grounder utilizes an LLM to
decompose complex natural language queries into semantic constituents and
employs a visual grounding tool, such as OpenScene or LERF, to identify objects
in a 3D scene. The LLM then evaluates the spatial and commonsense relations
among the proposed objects to make a final grounding decision. Our method does
not require any labeled training data and can generalize to novel 3D scenes and
arbitrary text queries. We evaluate LLM-Grounder on the ScanRefer benchmark and
demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot grounding accuracy. Our findings
indicate that LLMs significantly improve the grounding capability, especially
for complex language queries, making LLM-Grounder an effective approach for 3D
vision-language tasks in robotics. Videos and interactive demos can be found on

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adversarial examples, deliberately crafted using small perturbations to fool
deep neural networks, were first studied in image processing and more recently
in NLP. While approaches to detecting adversarial examples in NLP have largely
relied on search over input perturbations, image processing has seen a range of
techniques that aim to characterise adversarial subspaces over the learned
representations.

In this paper, we adapt two such approaches to NLP, one based on nearest
neighbors and influence functions and one on Mahalanobis distances. The former
in particular produces a state-of-the-art detector when compared against
several strong baselines; moreover, the novel use of influence functions
provides insight into how the nature of adversarial example subspaces in NLP
relate to those in image processing, and also how they differ depending on the
kind of NLP task.]]></summary>

of black-box functions when function evaluations are expensive. Most prior
works use Gaussian processes to model the black-box function, however, the use
of kernels in Gaussian processes leads to two problems: first, the kernel-based
methods scale poorly with the number of data points and second, kernel methods
are usually not effective on complex structured high dimensional data due to
curse of dimensionality. Therefore, we propose a novel black-box optimization
algorithm where the black-box function is modeled using a neural network. Our
algorithm does not need a Bayesian neural network to estimate predictive
uncertainty and is therefore computationally favorable. We analyze the
theoretical behavior of our algorithm in terms of regret bound using advances
in NTK theory showing its efficient convergence. We perform experiments with
both synthetic and real-world optimization tasks and show that our algorithm is

capture the latent developer intent. We evaluate two well-known LLMs, Codex and

performance for speech synthesis. However, a large number of iterative steps
are required to achieve high sample quality, which restricts the inference
speed. Maintaining sample quality while increasing sampling speed has become a
challenging task. In this paper, we propose a "Co"nsistency "Mo"del-based
"Speech" synthesis method, CoMoSpeech, which achieve speech synthesis through a
single diffusion sampling step while achieving high audio quality. The
consistency constraint is applied to distill a consistency model from a
well-designed diffusion-based teacher model, which ultimately yields superior
performances in the distilled CoMoSpeech. Our experiments show that by
generating audio recordings by a single sampling step, the CoMoSpeech achieves
an inference speed more than 150 times faster than real-time on a single NVIDIA
A100 GPU, which is comparable to FastSpeech2, making diffusion-sampling based
speech synthesis truly practical. Meanwhile, objective and subjective
evaluations on text-to-speech and singing voice synthesis show that the
proposed teacher models yield the best audio quality, and the one-step sampling
based CoMoSpeech achieves the best inference speed with better or comparable
audio quality to other conventional multi-step diffusion model baselines. Audio

become a powerful tool for system identification. This paper presents a
physics-informed Gaussian process (GP) model for Timoshenko beam elements. The
model is constructed as a multi-output GP with covariance and cross-covariance
kernels analytically derived based on the differential equations for
deflections, rotations, strains, bending moments, shear forces and applied
loads. Stiffness identification is performed in a Bayesian format by maximising
a posterior model through a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, yielding a
stochastic model for the structural parameters. The optimised GP model is
further employed for probabilistic predictions of unobserved responses.
Additionally, an entropy-based method for physics-informed sensor placement
optimisation is presented, exploiting heterogeneous sensor position information
and structural boundary conditions built into the GP model. Results demonstrate
that the proposed approach is effective at identifying structural parameters
and is capable of fusing data from heterogeneous and multi-fidelity sensors.
Probabilistic predictions of structural responses and internal forces are in
closer agreement with measured data. We validate our model with an experimental
setup and discuss the quality and uncertainty of the obtained results. The
proposed approach has potential applications in the field of structural health
monitoring (SHM) for both mechanical and structural systems.]]></summary>

cardiovascular condition including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary

Language Processing (NLP) on radiology reports, automated methods have shown
promising advancements in identifying VTE events from retrospective data

novel method combinations of DL methods, along with data augmentation, adaptive

efficacy, achieving an impressive 97\% accuracy and 97\% F1 score in predicting
DVT, and an outstanding 98.3\% accuracy and 98.4\% F1 score in predicting PE.

person's identity. In this paper, we focus on solving this problem by
introducing PluGeN4Faces, a plugin to StyleGAN, which explicitly disentangles
face attributes from a person's identity. Our key idea is to perform training
on images retrieved from movie frames, where a given person appears in various

encourage the model to group images of the same person in similar regions of
latent space. Our experiments demonstrate that the modifications of face

gradual transitions among a finite number of states. We are particularly
motivated by applications such as human activity analysis where observed
accelerometer time series contains segments representing distinct activities,
which we call pure states, as well as periods characterized by continuous
transition among these pure states. To capture this transitory behavior, the
dynamical Wasserstein barycenter (DWB) model of Cheng et al. in 2021 [1]
associates with each pure state a data-generating distribution and models the
continuous transitions among these states as a Wasserstein barycenter of these
distributions with dynamically evolving weights. Focusing on the univariate
case where Wasserstein distances and barycenters can be computed in closed
form, we extend [1] specifically relaxing the parameterization of the pure
states as Gaussian distributions. We highlight issues related to the uniqueness
in identifying the model parameters as well as uncertainties induced when
estimating a dynamically evolving distribution from a limited number of
samples. To ameliorate non-uniqueness, we introduce regularization that imposes
temporal smoothness on the dynamics of the barycentric weights. A
quantile-based approximation of the pure state distributions yields a finite
dimensional estimation problem which we numerically solve using cyclic descent
alternating between updates to the pure-state quantile functions and the
barycentric weights. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed algorithm in
segmenting both simulated and real world human activity time series.]]></summary>

(PSMs), a novel solution to achieving real-time optimization, flexibility, and
fault tolerance in autonomous systems, particularly in transport-dominated
systems such as chemical, biomedical, and power plants. Traditional data-driven
methods fall short due to a lack of physical constraints like mass
conservation; PSMs address this issue by training deep neural networks with
sensor data and physics-informing using components' Partial Differential
Equations (PDEs), resulting in a physics-constrained, end-to-end differentiable
forward dynamics model. Through two in silico experiments - a heated channel
and a cooling system loop - we demonstrate that PSMs offer a more accurate
approach than purely data-driven models.

Beyond accuracy, there are several compelling use cases for PSMs. In this
work, we showcase two: the creation of a nonlinear supervisory controller
through a sequentially updated state-space representation and the proposal of a
diagnostic algorithm using residuals from each of the PDEs. The former
demonstrates the ability of PSMs to handle both constant and time-dependent
constraints, while the latter illustrates their value in system diagnostics and
fault detection. We further posit that PSMs could serve as a foundation for

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This study introduces a novel hierarchical divisive clustering approach with
stochastic splitting functions (SSFs) to enhance classification performance in
multi-class datasets through hierarchical classification (HC). The method has
the unique capability of generating hierarchy without requiring explicit
information, making it suitable for datasets lacking prior knowledge of
hierarchy. By systematically dividing classes into two subsets based on their
discriminability according to the classifier, the proposed approach constructs
a binary tree representation of hierarchical classes. The approach is evaluated
on 46 multi-class time series datasets using popular classifiers (svm and
rocket) and SSFs (potr, srtr, and lsoo). The results reveal that the approach
significantly improves classification performance in approximately half and a
third of the datasets when using rocket and svm as the classifier,
respectively. The study also explores the relationship between dataset features
and HC performance. While the number of classes and flat classification (FC)
score show consistent significance, variations are observed with different
splitting functions. Overall, the proposed approach presents a promising
strategy for enhancing classification by generating hierarchical structure in
multi-class time series datasets. Future research directions involve exploring
different splitting functions, classifiers, and hierarchy structures, as well
as applying the approach to diverse domains beyond time series data. The source
code is made openly available to facilitate reproducibility and further
exploration of the method.]]></summary>

is crucial to engage in hierarchical reasoning across spatial and temporal
scales. This entails planning abstract subgoal sequences, visually reasoning
about the underlying plans, and executing actions in accordance with the
devised plan through visual-motor control. We propose Compositional Foundation
Models for Hierarchical Planning (HiP), a foundation model which leverages
multiple expert foundation model trained on language, vision and action data
individually jointly together to solve long-horizon tasks. We use a large
language model to construct symbolic plans that are grounded in the environment
through a large video diffusion model. Generated video plans are then grounded
to visual-motor control, through an inverse dynamics model that infers actions
from generated videos. To enable effective reasoning within this hierarchy, we
enforce consistency between the models via iterative refinement. We illustrate
the efficacy and adaptability of our approach in three different long-horizon

next item click based on the information in a single session only even in the
presence of some random user's behavior, is a complex problem. This complex
problem requires a high-capability model of predicting the user's next action.
Most (if not all) existing models follow the encoder-predictor paradigm where
all studies focus on how to optimize the encoder module extensively in the
paradigm but they ignore how to optimize the predictor module. In this paper,
we discover the existing critical issue of the low-capability predictor module
among existing models. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework called
\emph{\underline{S}ession-based \underline{R}ecommendation with
\underline{Pred}ictor \underline{A}dd-\underline{O}n} (SR-PredictAO). In this
framework, we propose a high-capability predictor module which could alleviate
the effect of random user's behavior for prediction. It is worth mentioning
that this framework could be applied to any existing models, which could give
opportunities for further optimizing the framework. Extensive experiments on
two real benchmark datasets for three state-of-the-art models show that
\emph{SR-PredictAO} out-performs the current state-of-the-art model by up to
2.9\% in HR@20 and 2.3\% in MRR@20. More importantly, the improvement is
consistent across almost all the existing models on all datasets, which could
be regarded as a significant contribution in the field.]]></summary>

attention due to the rapid development of generative techniques. While many
recent works have taken essential steps on GAN-generated faces, more
threatening attacks related to identity swapping or expression transferring are
still overlooked. And the forgery traces hidden in unknown attacks from the
open-world unlabeled faces still remain under-explored. To push the related
frontier research, we introduce a new benchmark called Open-World DeepFake
Attribution (OW-DFA), which aims to evaluate attribution performance against
various types of fake faces under open-world scenarios. Meanwhile, we propose a
novel framework named Contrastive Pseudo Learning (CPL) for the OW-DFA task
through 1) introducing a Global-Local Voting module to guide the feature
alignment of forged faces with different manipulated regions, 2) designing a
Confidence-based Soft Pseudo-label strategy to mitigate the pseudo-noise caused
by similar methods in unlabeled set. In addition, we extend the CPL framework
with a multi-stage paradigm that leverages pre-train technique and iterative
learning to further enhance traceability performance. Extensive experiments
verify the superiority of our proposed method on the OW-DFA and also

Differential Equations, have long suffered from slow training due to their

sequential models by up to 3 orders of magnitude faster without compromising
output accuracy. The algorithm does not need any special structure in the
sequential models' architecture, making it applicable to a wide range of
architectures. Using our method, training sequential models can be more than 10
times faster than the common sequential method without any meaningful
difference in the training results. Leveraging this accelerated training, we
discovered the efficacy of the Gated Recurrent Unit in a long time series

information across multiple scales poses a significant challenge in digital
pathology. Multi-instance learning (MIL) is a common solution for working with
high resolution images by classifying bags of objects (i.e. sets of smaller
image patches). However, such processing is typically performed at a single
scale (e.g., 20x magnification) of WSIs, disregarding the vital inter-scale
information that is key to diagnoses by human pathologists. In this study, we
propose a novel cross-scale MIL algorithm to explicitly aggregate inter-scale
relationships into a single MIL network for pathological image diagnosis. The
contribution of this paper is three-fold: (1) A novel cross-scale MIL (CS-MIL)
algorithm that integrates the multi-scale information and the inter-scale
relationships is proposed; (2) A toy dataset with scale-specific morphological
features is created and released to examine and visualize differential
cross-scale attention; (3) Superior performance on both in-house and public
datasets is demonstrated by our simple cross-scale MIL strategy. The official
implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/hrlblab/CS-MIL.]]></summary>

diseases. Generative Adversarial Networks play a key role in addressing this
imbalance by enabling the generation of synthetic images to augment datasets.
It is important to generate synthetic images that incorporate a diverse range
of features to accurately represent the distribution of features present in the
training imagery. Furthermore, the absence of diverse features in synthetic
images can degrade the performance of machine learning classifiers. The mode
collapse problem impacts Generative Adversarial Networks' capacity to generate
diversified images. Mode collapse comes in two varieties: intra-class and
inter-class. In this paper, both varieties of the mode collapse problem are
investigated, and their subsequent impact on the diversity of synthetic X-ray
images is evaluated. This work contributes an empirical demonstration of the
benefits of integrating the adaptive input-image normalization with the Deep
Convolutional GAN and Auxiliary Classifier GAN to alleviate the mode collapse
problems. Synthetically generated images are utilized for data augmentation and
training a Vision Transformer model. The classification performance of the

demonstrate that the DCGAN and the ACGAN with adaptive input-image
normalization outperform the DCGAN and ACGAN with un-normalized X-ray images as

competition featured in the NeurIPS 2022 Competition Track, aimed at addressing
dexterous robotic manipulation tasks through learning from pre-collected
offline data. Participants were provided with two types of datasets for each
task: expert and mixed datasets with varying skill levels. While the simplest
offline policy learning algorithm, Behavioral Cloning (BC), performed
remarkably well when trained on expert datasets, it outperformed even the most
advanced offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. However, BC's
performance deteriorated when applied to mixed datasets, and the performance of
offline RL algorithms was also unsatisfactory. Upon examining the mixed
datasets, we observed that they contained a significant amount of expert data,
although this data was unlabeled. To address this issue, we proposed a
semi-supervised learning-based classifier to identify the underlying expert
behavior within mixed datasets, effectively isolating the expert data. To
further enhance BC's performance, we leveraged the geometric symmetry of the
RRC arena to augment the training dataset through mathematical transformations.
In the end, our submission surpassed that of all other participants, even those
who employed complex offline RL algorithms and intricate data processing and
feature engineering techniques.]]></summary>

emotional, and behavioral changes. Symptoms of SZ include hallucinations,
illusions, delusions, lack of motivation, and difficulties in concentration.
Diagnosing SZ involves employing various tools, including clinical interviews,
physical examinations, psychological evaluations, the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), and neuroimaging techniques.
Electroencephalography (EEG) recording is a significant functional neuroimaging
modality that provides valuable insights into brain function during SZ.
However, EEG signal analysis poses challenges for neurologists and scientists
due to the presence of artifacts, long-term recordings, and the utilization of
multiple channels. To address these challenges, researchers have introduced
artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, encompassing conventional machine
learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods, to aid in SZ diagnosis. This
study reviews papers focused on SZ diagnosis utilizing EEG signals and AI
methods. The introduction section provides a comprehensive explanation of SZ
diagnosis methods and intervention techniques. Subsequently, review papers in
this field are discussed, followed by an introduction to the AI methods
employed for SZ diagnosis and a summary of relevant papers presented in tabular
form. Additionally, this study reports on the most significant challenges
encountered in SZ diagnosis, as identified through a review of papers in this
field. Future directions to overcome these challenges are also addressed. The
discussion section examines the specific details of each paper, culminating in

discretization to resolve necessary spatiotemporal scales, which can be
computationally expensive. Recent advances in deep learning have provided a new
approach to solving partial differential equations that involves the use of
neural operators. Neural operators are neural network architectures that learn
mappings between function spaces and have the capability to solve partial
differential equations based on data. This study utilizes a novel neural
operator called Hyena, which employs a long convolutional filter that is
parameterized by a multilayer perceptron. The Hyena operator is an operation
that enjoys sub-quadratic complexity and state space model to parameterize long
convolution that enjoys a global receptive field. This mechanism enhances the
model's comprehension of the input's context and enables data-dependent weight
for different partial differential equations instances. To measure how
effective the layers are in solving partial differential equations, we conduct
experiments on Diffusion-Reaction equation and Navier Stokes equation. Our
findings indicate Hyena Neural operator can serve as an efficient and accurate
model for learning partial differential equations solution operator. The data

allows model training among multiple devices or organizations by sharing
training parameters instead of raw data. However, adversaries can still infer
individual information through inference attacks (e.g. differential attacks) on
these training parameters. As a result, Differential Privacy (DP) has been
widely used in FL to prevent such attacks. We consider differentially private
federated learning in a resource-constrained scenario, where both privacy
budget and communication round are constrained. By theoretically analyzing the
convergence, we can find the optimal number of differentially private local
iterations for clients between any two sequential global updates. Based on
this, we design an algorithm of differentially private federated learning with
adaptive local iterations (ALI-DPFL). We experiment our algorithm on the

opens a new era for the determination of crystal structure. However, the data
processing of those experiments is facing unprecedented challenge, because the
total number of diffraction patterns needed to determinate a high-resolution
structure is huge. Machine learning methods are very likely to play important
roles in dealing with such a large volume of data. Convolutional neural
networks have made a great success in the field of pattern classification,
however, training of the networks need very large datasets with labels. Th is
heavy dependence on labeled datasets will seriously restrict the application of
networks, because it is very costly to annotate a large number of diffraction
patterns. In this article we present our job on the classification of
diffraction pattern by weakly supervised algorithms, with the aim of reducing
as much as possible the size of the labeled dataset required for training. Our
result shows that weakly supervised methods can significantly reduce the need

modeling tasks like speech recognition, where it is necessary to preserve order
between the input and target sequences. However, CTC is only applied to
deterministic sequence models, where the latent space is discontinuous and
sparse, which in turn makes them less capable of handling data variability when
compared to variational models. In this paper, we integrate CTC with a
variational model and derive loss functions that can be used to train more
generalizable sequence models that preserve order. Specifically, we derive two
versions of the novel variational CTC based on two reasonable assumptions, the
first being that the variational latent variables at each time step are
conditionally independent; and the second being that these latent variables are
Markovian. We show that both loss functions allow direct optimization of the
variational lower bound for the model log-likelihood, and present

datasets and testing on data from the same domain that the model can train on.
Classification becomes more challenging when dealing with new data from a
different domain, where gathering and especially labeling a larger image
dataset for retraining a classification model requires a labor-intensive human
effort. Cross-domain classification frameworks were developed to handle this
data domain shift problem by utilizing unsupervised image-to-image translation
models to translate an input image from the unlabeled domain to the labeled
domain. The problem with these unsupervised models lies in their unsupervised
nature. For lack of annotations, it is not possible to use the traditional
supervised metrics to evaluate these translation models to pick the best-saved
checkpoint model. This paper introduces a new method called Domain-knowledge
Inspired Pseudo Supervision (DIPS) which utilizes domain-informed Gaussian
Mixture Models to generate pseudo annotations to enable the use of traditional
supervised metrics. This method was designed specifically to support
cross-domain classification applications contrary to other typically used
metrics such as the FID which were designed to evaluate the model in terms of
the quality of the generated image from a human-eye perspective. DIPS proves
its effectiveness by outperforming various GAN evaluation metrics, including
FID, when selecting the optimal saved checkpoint model. It is also evaluated
against truly supervised metrics. Furthermore, DIPS showcases its robustness
and interpretability by demonstrating a strong correlation with truly
supervised metrics, highlighting its superiority over existing state-of-the-art
alternatives. The code and data to replicate the results can be found on the
official Github repository: https://github.com/Hindawi91/DIPS]]></summary>

control involve dynamic behaviors in various granularity; task, model, and
layers within a model. Such dynamic behaviors introduce new challenges to the
system software in an ML system since the overall system load is not completely
predictable, unlike traditional ML workloads. In addition, RTMM workloads
require real-time processing, involve highly heterogeneous models, and target
resource-constrained devices. Under such circumstances, developing an effective
scheduler gains more importance to better utilize underlying hardware
considering the unique characteristics of RTMM workloads. Therefore, we propose
a new scheduler, DREAM, which effectively handles various dynamicity in RTMM
workloads targeting multi-accelerator systems. DREAM quantifies the unique
requirements for RTMM workloads and utilizes the quantified scores to drive
scheduling decisions, considering the current system load and other inference
jobs on different models and input frames. DREAM utilizes tunable parameters
that provide fast and effective adaptivity to dynamic workload changes. In our
evaluation of five scenarios of RTMM workload, DREAM reduces the overall
UXCost, which is an equivalent metric of the energy-delay product (EDP) for
RTMM defined in the paper, by 32.2% and 50.0% in the geometric mean (up to
80.8% and 97.6%) compared to state-of-the-art baselines, which shows the
efficacy of our scheduling methodology.]]></summary>

prioritizing scalability and the utilization of sparse representations. Many
algorithms in CLRS require global memory or information exchange, mirrored in
its execution model, which constructs fully connected (not sparse) graphs based
on the underlying problem. Despite CLRS's aim of assessing how effectively
learned algorithms can generalize to larger instances, the existing execution
model becomes a significant constraint due to its demanding memory requirements
and runtime (hard to scale). However, many important algorithms do not demand a
fully connected graph; these algorithms, primarily distributed in nature, align
closely with the message-passing paradigm employed by Graph Neural Networks.
Hence, we propose SALSA-CLRS, an extension of the current CLRS benchmark
specifically with scalability and sparseness in mind. Our approach includes
adapted algorithms from the original CLRS benchmark and introduces new problems
from distributed and randomized algorithms. Moreover, we perform a thorough
empirical evaluation of our benchmark. Code is publicly available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ultimate goal of artificial intelligence is to mimic the human brain to
perform decision-making and control directly from high-dimensional sensory
input. Diffractive optical networks provide a promising solution for
implementing artificial intelligence with high-speed and low-power consumption.
Most of the reported diffractive optical networks focus on single or multiple
tasks that do not involve environmental interaction, such as object recognition
and image classification. In contrast, the networks capable of performing
decision-making and control have not yet been developed to our knowledge. Here,
we propose using deep reinforcement learning to implement diffractive optical
networks that imitate human-level decision-making and control capability. Such
networks taking advantage of a residual architecture, allow for finding optimal
control policies through interaction with the environment and can be readily
implemented with existing optical devices. The superior performance of these
networks is verified by engaging three types of classic games, Tic-Tac-Toe,
Super Mario Bros., and Car Racing. Finally, we present an experimental
demonstration of playing Tic-Tac-Toe by leveraging diffractive optical networks
based on a spatial light modulator. Our work represents a solid step forward in
advancing diffractive optical networks, which promises a fundamental shift from
the target-driven control of a pre-designed state for simple recognition or
classification tasks to the high-level sensory capability of artificial
intelligence. It may find exciting applications in autonomous driving,
intelligent robots, and intelligent manufacturing.]]></summary>

single partition into clusters but a sequence of partitions describing the data
at different scales, or levels of coarseness. A natural problem then is to
analyse and compare the (not necessarily hierarchical) sequences of partitions
that underpin such multiscale descriptions of data. Here, we introduce a
filtration of abstract simplicial complexes, denoted the Multiscale Clustering
Filtration (MCF), which encodes arbitrary patterns of cluster assignments
across scales, and we prove that the MCF produces stable persistence diagrams.
We then show that the zero-dimensional persistent homology of the MCF measures
the degree of hierarchy in the sequence of partitions, and that the
higher-dimensional persistent homology tracks the emergence and resolution of
conflicts between cluster assignments across the sequence of partitions. To
broaden the theoretical foundations of the MCF, we also provide an equivalent
construction via a nerve complex filtration, and we show that in the
hierarchical case, the MCF reduces to a Vietoris-Rips filtration of an
ultrametric space. We briefly illustrate how the MCF can serve to characterise
multiscale clustering structures in numerical experiments on synthetic data.]]></summary>

key parameters are the number of data considered at each step or batch size
$B$, and the step size or learning rate $\eta$. For small $B$ and large $\eta$,
SGD corresponds to a stochastic evolution of the parameters, whose noise
amplitude is governed by the `temperature' $T\equiv \eta/B$. Yet this
description is observed to break down for sufficiently large batches $B\geq
B^*$, or simplifies to gradient descent (GD) when the temperature is
sufficiently small. Understanding where these cross-overs take place remains a
central challenge. Here we resolve these questions for a teacher-student
perceptron classification model, and show empirically that our key predictions
still apply to deep networks. Specifically, we obtain a phase diagram in the
$B$-$\eta$ plane that separates three dynamical phases: $\textit{(i)}$ a
noise-dominated SGD governed by temperature, $\textit{(ii)}$ a
large-first-step-dominated SGD and $\textit{(iii)}$ GD. These different phases
also corresponds to different regimes of generalization error. Remarkably, our
analysis reveals that the batch size $B^*$ separating regimes $\textit{(i)}$
and $\textit{(ii)}$ scale with the size $P$ of the training set, with an
exponent that characterizes the hardness of the classification problem.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A variety of different performance metrics are commonly used in the machine
learning literature for the evaluation of classification systems. Some of the
most common ones for measuring quality of hard decisions are standard and
balanced accuracy, standard and balanced error rate, F-beta score, and Matthews
correlation coefficient (MCC). In this document, we review the definition of
these and other metrics and compare them with the expected cost (EC), a metric
introduced in every statistical learning course but rarely used in the machine
learning literature. We show that both the standard and balanced error rates
are special cases of the EC. Further, we show its relation with F-beta score
and MCC and argue that EC is superior to these traditional metrics for being
based on first principles from statistics, and for being more general,
interpretable, and adaptable to any application scenario. The metrics mentioned
above measure the quality of hard decisions. Yet, most modern classification
systems output continuous scores for the classes which we may want to evaluate
directly. Metrics for measuring the quality of system scores include the area
under the ROC curve, equal error rate, cross-entropy, Brier score, and Bayes EC
or Bayes risk, among others. The last three metrics are special cases of a
family of metrics given by the expected value of proper scoring rules (PSRs).
We review the theory behind these metrics, showing that they are a principled
way to measure the quality of the posterior probabilities produced by a system.
Finally, we show how to use these metrics to compute a system's calibration
loss and compare this metric with the widely-used expected calibration error
(ECE), arguing that calibration loss based on PSRs is superior to the ECE for
being more interpretable, more general, and directly applicable to the
multi-class case, among other reasons.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In open-world semi-supervised learning, a machine learning model is tasked
with uncovering novel categories from unlabeled data while maintaining
performance on seen categories from labeled data. The central challenge is the
substantial learning gap between seen and novel categories, as the model learns
the former faster due to accurate supervisory information. To address this, we
introduce 1) an adaptive margin loss based on estimated class distribution,
which encourages a large negative margin for samples in seen classes, to
synchronize learning paces, and 2) pseudo-label contrastive clustering, which
pulls together samples which are likely from the same class in the output
space, to enhance novel class discovery. Our extensive evaluations on multiple
datasets demonstrate that existing models still hinder novel class learning,
whereas our approach strikingly balances both seen and novel classes, achieving
a remarkable 3% average accuracy increase on the ImageNet dataset compared to
the prior state-of-the-art. Additionally, we find that fine-tuning the
self-supervised pre-trained backbone significantly boosts performance over the
default in prior literature. After our paper is accepted, we will release the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The problem of non-monotone $k$-submodular maximization under a knapsack
constraint ($\kSMK$) over the ground set size $n$ has been raised in many
applications in machine learning, such as data summarization, information
propagation, etc. However, existing algorithms for the problem are facing
questioning of how to overcome the non-monotone case and how to fast return a
good solution in case of the big size of data. This paper introduces two
deterministic approximation algorithms for the problem that competitively
improve the query complexity of existing algorithms.

Our first algorithm, $\LAA$, returns an approximation ratio of $1/19$ within
$O(nk)$ query complexity. The second one, $\RLA$, improves the approximation
ratio to $1/5-\epsilon$ in $O(nk)$ queries, where $\epsilon$ is an input
parameter.

Our algorithms are the first ones that provide constant approximation ratios
within only $O(nk)$ query complexity for the non-monotone objective. They,
therefore, need fewer the number of queries than state-of-the-the-art ones by a
factor of $\Omega(\log n)$.

Besides the theoretical analysis, we have evaluated our proposed ones with
several experiments in some instances: Influence Maximization and Sensor
Placement for the problem. The results confirm that our algorithms ensure
theoretical quality as the cutting-edge techniques and significantly reduce the
number of queries.]]></summary>

significant implications for clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. One
major challenge in this field is the lack of continuous medical imaging
monitoring of individual patients over time. To address this issue, we develop
a novel framework termed Progressive Image Editing (PIE) that enables
controlled manipulation of disease-related image features, facilitating precise
and realistic disease progression simulation. Specifically, we leverage recent
advancements in text-to-image generative models to simulate disease progression
accurately and personalize it for each patient. We theoretically analyze the
iterative refining process in our framework as a gradient descent with an
exponentially decayed learning rate. To validate our framework, we conduct
experiments in three medical imaging domains. Our results demonstrate the
superiority of PIE over existing methods such as Stable Diffusion Walk and
Style-Based Manifold Extrapolation based on CLIP score (Realism) and Disease
Classification Confidence (Alignment). Our user study collected feedback from
35 veteran physicians to assess the generated progressions. Remarkably, 76.2%
of the feedback agrees with the fidelity of the generated progressions. To our
best knowledge, PIE is the first of its kind to generate disease progression
images meeting real-world standards. It is a promising tool for medical
research and clinical practice, potentially allowing healthcare providers to
model disease trajectories over time, predict future treatment responses, and
improve patient outcomes.]]></summary>

proprietary data in such a way that multiple clients retain exclusive control
over their data, while all benefit from improved model accuracy due to pooled
resources. Recently proposed Neural Graphical Models (NGMs) are Probabilistic
Graphical models that utilize the expressive power of neural networks to learn
complex non-linear dependencies between the input features. They learn to
capture the underlying data distribution and have efficient algorithms for
inference and sampling. We develop a FL framework which maintains a global NGM
model that learns the averaged information from the local NGM models while
keeping the training data within the client's environment. Our design, FedNGMs,
avoids the pitfalls and shortcomings of neuron matching frameworks like
Federated Matched Averaging that suffers from model parameter explosion. Our
global model size remains constant throughout the process. In the cases where
clients have local variables that are not part of the combined global
distribution, we propose a `Stitching' algorithm, which personalizes the global
NGM models by merging the additional variables using the client's data. FedNGM
is robust to data heterogeneity, large number of participants, and limited

automatic trading platforms based on real-time information acquisition have
become the main components of the stock trading market, so the topic of
quantitative trading has received widespread attention. And for non-strongly
efficient trading markets, human emotions and expectations always dominate
market trends and trading decisions. Therefore, this paper starts from the
theory of emotion, taking East Money as an example, crawling user comment
titles data from its corresponding stock bar and performing data cleaning.
Subsequently, a natural language processing model BERT was constructed, and the
BERT model was fine-tuned using existing annotated data sets. The experimental
results show that the fine-tuned model has different degrees of performance
improvement compared to the original model and the baseline model.
Subsequently, based on the above model, the user comment data crawled is
labeled with emotional polarity, and the obtained label information is combined
with the Alpha191 model to participate in regression, and significant
regression results are obtained. Subsequently, the regression model is used to
predict the average price change for the next five days, and use it as a signal
to guide automatic trading. The experimental results show that the
incorporation of emotional factors increased the return rate by 73.8\% compared
to the baseline during the trading period, and by 32.41\% compared to the
original alpha191 model. Finally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages
of incorporating emotional factors into quantitative trading, and give possible

applications. However, the majority of prior work has been parametric, for
example, focusing on exponential families. We develop a fundamentally new and
general framework for sequential change detection when the pre- and post-change
distributions are nonparametrically specified (and thus composite). Our
procedures come with clean, nonasymptotic bounds on the average run length
(frequency of false alarms). In certain nonparametric cases (like sub-Gaussian
or sub-exponential), we also provide near-optimal bounds on the detection delay
following a changepoint. The primary technical tool that we introduce is called
an \emph{e-detector}, which is composed of sums of e-processes -- a fundamental
generalization of nonnegative supermartingales -- that are started at
consecutive times. We first introduce simple Shiryaev-Roberts and CUSUM-style
e-detectors, and then show how to design their mixtures in order to achieve
both statistical and computational efficiency. Our e-detector framework can be
instantiated to recover classical likelihood-based procedures for parametric
problems, as well as yielding the first change detection method for many
nonparametric problems. As a running example, we tackle the problem of
detecting changes in the mean of a bounded random variable without i.i.d.

extremely high energy efficiency. By employing the distinct polarity of current
to denote logic `0' and `1', AQFP devices serve as excellent carriers for
binary neural network (BNN) computations. Although recent research has made
initial strides toward developing an AQFP-based BNN accelerator, several
critical challenges remain, preventing the design from being a comprehensive
solution. In this paper, we propose SupeRBNN, an AQFP-based randomized BNN
acceleration framework that leverages software-hardware co-optimization to
eventually make the AQFP devices a feasible solution for BNN acceleration.
Specifically, we investigate the randomized behavior of the AQFP devices and
analyze the impact of crossbar size on current attenuation, subsequently
formulating the current amplitude into the values suitable for use in BNN
computation. To tackle the accumulation problem and improve overall hardware
performance, we propose a stochastic computing-based accumulation module and a
clocking scheme adjustment-based circuit optimization method. We validate our
SupeRBNN framework across various datasets and network architectures, comparing
it with implementations based on different technologies, including CMOS, ReRAM,
and superconducting RSFQ/ERSFQ. Experimental results demonstrate that our
design achieves an energy efficiency of approximately 7.8x10^4 times higher
than that of the ReRAM-based BNN framework while maintaining a similar level of
model accuracy. Furthermore, when compared with superconductor-based
counterparts, our framework demonstrates at least two orders of magnitude

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We introduce the Bittensor Language Model, called "BTLM-3B-8K", a new
state-of-the-art 3 billion parameter open-source language model. BTLM-3B-8K was
trained on 627B tokens from the SlimPajama dataset with a mixture of 2,048 and
8,192 context lengths. BTLM-3B-8K outperforms all existing 3B parameter models
by 2-5.5% across downstream tasks. BTLM-3B-8K is even competitive with some 7B
parameter models. Additionally, BTLM-3B-8K provides excellent long context
performance, outperforming MPT-7B-8K and XGen-7B-8K on tasks up to 8,192
context length. We trained the model on a cleaned and deduplicated SlimPajama
dataset; aggressively tuned the \textmu P hyperparameters and schedule; used
ALiBi position embeddings; and adopted the SwiGLU nonlinearity.

On Hugging Face, the most popular models have 7B parameters, indicating that
users prefer the quality-size ratio of 7B models. Compacting the 7B parameter
model to one with 3B parameters, with little performance impact, is an
important milestone. BTLM-3B-8K needs only 3GB of memory with 4-bit precision
and takes 2.5x less inference compute than 7B models, helping to open up access
to a powerful language model on mobile and edge devices. BTLM-3B-8K is
available under an Apache 2.0 license on Hugging Face:

been considered separate disciplines. However, both contribute significantly to
user satisfaction, underpinning our assumption that it relies on both an item's

In response, we introduce the task of {\itshape Generative Creative

generation that incorporate user interests, and {\itshape AdBooster}, a model
for personalized ad creatives based on the Stable Diffusion outpainting
architecture. This model uniquely incorporates user interests both during
fine-tuning and at generation time. To further improve AdBooster's performance,
we also introduce an automated data augmentation pipeline. Through our

rewards that must individually accumulate to given thresholds. In this class of
problems, we show a simple example in which the desired optimal policy cannot
be induced by any weighted linear combination of rewards. Hence, there exist
constrained reinforcement learning problems for which neither regularized nor
classical primal-dual methods yield optimal policies. This work addresses this
shortcoming by augmenting the state with Lagrange multipliers and
reinterpreting primal-dual methods as the portion of the dynamics that drives
the multipliers evolution. This approach provides a systematic state
augmentation procedure that is guaranteed to solve reinforcement learning
problems with constraints. Thus, as we illustrate by an example, while previous
methods can fail at finding optimal policies, running the dual dynamics while
executing the augmented policy yields an algorithm that provably samples

treatment assignment policies across various domains, including healthcare and
e-commerce. However, it remains understudied in the contextual bandit setting.
We propose a new family of computationally efficient bandit algorithms for the
stochastic contextual bandit settings, with the flexibility to be adapted for
cumulative regret minimization (with near-optimal minimax guarantees) and
simple regret minimization (with SOTA guarantees). Furthermore, our algorithms
adapt to model misspecification and extend to the continuous arm settings.
These advantages come from constructing and relying on "conformal arm sets"
(CASs), which provide a set of arms at every context that encompass the
context-specific optimal arm with some probability across the context
distribution. Our positive results on simple and cumulative regret guarantees
are contrasted by a negative result, which shows that an algorithm can't
achieve instance-dependent simple regret guarantees while simultaneously
achieving minimax optimal cumulative regret guarantees.]]></summary>

using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In the Offline Nanosatellite Task
Scheduling (ONTS) problem, the goal is to find the optimal schedule for tasks
to be carried out in orbit while taking into account Quality-of-Service (QoS)
considerations such as priority, minimum and maximum activation events,
execution time-frames, periods, and execution windows, as well as constraints
on the satellite's power resources and the complexity of energy harvesting and
management. The ONTS problem has been approached using conventional
mathematical formulations and exact methods, but their applicability to
challenging cases of the problem is limited. This study examines the use of
GNNs in this context, which has been effectively applied to optimization
problems such as the traveling salesman, scheduling, and facility placement
problems. More specifically, we investigate whether GNNs can learn the complex
structure of the ONTS problem with respect to feasibility and optimality of
candidate solutions. Furthermore, we evaluate using GNN-based heuristic
solutions to provide better solutions (w.r.t. the objective value) to the ONTS
problem and reduce the optimization cost. Our experiments show that GNNs are
not only able to learn feasibility and optimality for instances of the ONTS
problem, but they can generalize to harder instances than those seen during
training. Furthermore, the GNN-based heuristics improved the expected objective
value of the best solution found under the time limit in 45%, and reduced the
expected time to find a feasible solution in 35%, when compared to the SCIP
(Solving Constraint Integer Programs) solver in its off-the-shelf configuration]]></summary>

non-speech audio-based approach for crowd analytics, leveraging a
transformer-based model. Our results demonstrate that non-speech audio alone
can be used to conduct such analysis with remarkable accuracy. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first time when non-speech audio signals are
proposed for predicting occupancy. As far as we know, there has been no other
similar approach of its kind prior to this. To accomplish this, we deployed our
sensor-based platform in the waiting room of a large hospital with IRB approval
over a period of several months to capture non-speech audio and thermal images
for the training and evaluation of our models. The proposed non-speech-based
approach outperformed the thermal camera-based model and all other baselines.
In addition to demonstrating superior performance without utilizing speech
audio, we conduct further analysis using differential privacy techniques to
provide additional privacy guarantees. Overall, our work demonstrates the
viability of employing non-speech audio data for accurate occupancy estimation,
while also ensuring the exclusion of speech-related content and providing

biometric verification to improve reliablity in the face of spoofing attacks.
Even though the two sub-systems operate in tandem to solve the single task of
reliable biometric verification, they address different detection tasks and are
hence typically evaluated separately. Evidence shows that this approach is
suboptimal. We introduce a new metric for the joint evaluation of PAD solutions
operating in situ with biometric verification. In contrast to the tandem
detection cost function proposed recently, the new tandem equal error rate
(t-EER) is parameter free. The combination of two classifiers nonetheless leads
to a \emph{set} of operating points at which false alarm and miss rates are
equal and also dependent upon the prevalence of attacks. We therefore introduce
the \emph{concurrent} t-EER, a unique operating point which is invariable to
the prevalence of attacks. Using both modality (and even application) agnostic
simulated scores, as well as real scores for a voice biometrics application, we
demonstrate application of the t-EER to a wide range of biometric system
evaluations under attack. The proposed approach is a strong candidate metric

predicts visual-force goals using a deep neural network. Given a single RGBD
image combined with a text prompt, ForceSight determines a target end-effector
pose in the camera frame (kinematic goal) and the associated forces (force
goal). Together, these two components form a visual-force goal. Prior work has
demonstrated that deep models outputting human-interpretable kinematic goals
can enable dexterous manipulation by real robots. Forces are critical to
manipulation, yet have typically been relegated to lower-level execution in
these systems. When deployed on a mobile manipulator equipped with an
eye-in-hand RGBD camera, ForceSight performed tasks such as precision grasps,
drawer opening, and object handovers with an 81% success rate in unseen
environments with object instances that differed significantly from the
training data. In a separate experiment, relying exclusively on visual servoing
and ignoring force goals dropped the success rate from 90% to 45%,
demonstrating that force goals can significantly enhance performance. The

expressivity of surface electromyography-based (sEMG) gesture recognition
systems. Approach: We use a problem transformation approach, in which actions
were subset into two biomechanically independent components - a set of wrist
directions and a set of finger modifiers. To maintain fast calibration time, we
train models for each component using only individual gestures, and extrapolate
to the full product space of combination gestures by generating synthetic data.
We collected a supervised dataset with high-confidence ground truth labels in
which subjects performed combination gestures while holding a joystick, and
conducted experiments to analyze the impact of model architectures, classifier
algorithms, and synthetic data generation strategies on the performance of the
proposed approach. Main Results: We found that a problem transformation
approach using a parallel model architecture in combination with a non-linear
classifier, along with restricted synthetic data generation, shows promise in
increasing the expressivity of sEMG-based gestures with a short calibration
time. Significance: sEMG-based gesture recognition has applications in
human-computer interaction, virtual reality, and the control of robotic and
prosthetic devices. Existing approaches require exhaustive model calibration.
The proposed approach increases expressivity without requiring users to
demonstrate all combination gesture classes. Our results may be extended to
larger gesture vocabularies and more complicated model architectures.]]></summary>

measuring and interpreting the calibration of probabilistic predictors.
Calibration measures quantify the degree of miscalibration, and reliability
diagrams visualize the structure of this miscalibration. However, the most
common constructions of reliability diagrams and calibration measures --
binning and ECE -- both suffer from well-known flaws (e.g. discontinuity). We
show that a simple modification fixes both constructions: first smooth the
observations using an RBF kernel, then compute the Expected Calibration Error
(ECE) of this smoothed function. We prove that with a careful choice of
bandwidth, this method yields a calibration measure that is well-behaved in the
sense of (B{\l}asiok, Gopalan, Hu, and Nakkiran 2023a) -- a consistent
calibration measure. We call this measure the SmoothECE. Moreover, the
reliability diagram obtained from this smoothed function visually encodes the
SmoothECE, just as binned reliability diagrams encode the BinnedECE.

We also provide a Python package with simple, hyperparameter-free methods for
measuring and plotting calibration: `pip install relplot\`.]]></summary>

named Estimated Mean Aggregation (EMA) that not only addresses these challenges

dual role: enhancing model security by effectively handling malicious outliers
through trimmed means and uncovering data heterogeneity to ensure that trained
models are adaptable across various client datasets. Through a wealth of
experiments, EMA consistently demonstrates high accuracy and area under the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We present LongLoRA, an efficient fine-tuning approach that extends the
context sizes of pre-trained large language models (LLMs), with limited
computation cost. Typically, training LLMs with long context sizes is
computationally expensive, requiring extensive training hours and GPU
resources. For example, training on the context length of 8192 needs 16x
computational costs in self-attention layers as that of 2048. In this paper, we
speed up the context extension of LLMs in two aspects. On the one hand,
although dense global attention is needed during inference, fine-tuning the
model can be effectively and efficiently done by sparse local attention. The
proposed shift short attention effectively enables context extension, leading
to non-trivial computation saving with similar performance to fine-tuning with
vanilla attention. Particularly, it can be implemented with only two lines of
code in training, while being optional in inference. On the other hand, we
revisit the parameter-efficient fine-tuning regime for context expansion.
Notably, we find that LoRA for context extension works well under the premise
of trainable embedding and normalization. LongLoRA demonstrates strong
empirical results on various tasks on LLaMA2 models from 7B/13B to 70B.
LongLoRA adopts LLaMA2 7B from 4k context to 100k, or LLaMA2 70B to 32k on a
single 8x A100 machine. LongLoRA extends models' context while retaining their
original architectures, and is compatible with most existing techniques, like
FlashAttention-2. In addition, to make LongLoRA practical, we collect a
dataset, LongQA, for supervised fine-tuning. It contains more than 3k long
context question-answer pairs.]]></summary>

differentiable channel model due to the backpropagation algorithm. This
requirement can be sidestepped by approximating either the channel distribution
or its gradient through pilot signals in real-world scenarios. The initial
approach draws upon the latest advancements in image generation, utilizing
generative adversarial networks (GANs) or their enhanced variants to generate
channel distributions. In this paper, we address this channel approximation
challenge with diffusion models, which have demonstrated high sample quality in
image generation. We offer an end-to-end channel coding framework underpinned
by diffusion models and propose an efficient training algorithm. Our
simulations with various channel models establish that our diffusion models
learn the channel distribution accurately, thereby achieving near-optimal
end-to-end symbol error rates (SERs). We also note a significant advantage of
diffusion models: A robust generalization capability in high signal-to-noise
ratio regions, in contrast to GAN variants that suffer from error floor.
Furthermore, we examine the trade-off between sample quality and sampling
speed, when an accelerated sampling algorithm is deployed, and investigate the
effect of the noise scheduling on this trade-off. With an apt choice of noise
scheduling, sampling time can be significantly reduced with a minor increase in
SER.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurological disease characterized by
difficulties with social interaction, communication, and repetitive activities.
The severity of these difficulties varies, and those with this diagnosis face
unique challenges. While its primary origin lies in genetics, identifying and
addressing it early can contribute to the enhancement of the condition. In
recent years, machine learning-driven intelligent diagnosis has emerged as a
supplement to conventional clinical approaches, aiming to address the potential
drawbacks of time-consuming and costly traditional methods. In this work, we
utilize different machine learning algorithms to find the most significant
traits responsible for ASD and to automate the diagnostic process. We study six
classification models to see which model works best to identify ASD and also
study five popular clustering methods to get a meaningful insight of these ASD
datasets. To find the best classifier for these binary datasets, we evaluate
the models using accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1-score, AUC, kappa
and log loss metrics. Our evaluation demonstrates that five out of the six
selected models perform exceptionally, achieving a 100% accuracy rate on the
ASD datasets when hyperparameters are meticulously tuned for each model. As
almost all classification models are able to get 100% accuracy, we become
interested in observing the underlying insights of the datasets by implementing
some popular clustering algorithms on these datasets. We calculate Normalized
Mutual Information (NMI), Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) & Silhouette Coefficient
(SC) metrics to select the best clustering models. Our evaluation finds that
spectral clustering outperforms all other benchmarking clustering models in
terms of NMI & ARI metrics and it also demonstrates comparability to the
optimal SC achieved by k-means.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper studies the problem of traffic flow forecasting, which aims to
predict future traffic conditions on the basis of road networks and traffic
conditions in the past. The problem is typically solved by modeling complex
spatio-temporal correlations in traffic data using spatio-temporal graph neural
networks (GNNs). However, the performance of these methods is still far from
satisfactory since GNNs usually have limited representation capacity when it
comes to complex traffic networks. Graphs, by nature, fall short in capturing
non-pairwise relations. Even worse, existing methods follow the paradigm of
message passing that aggregates neighborhood information linearly, which fails
to capture complicated spatio-temporal high-order interactions. To tackle these
issues, in this paper, we propose a novel model named Dynamic Hypergraph
Structure Learning (DyHSL) for traffic flow prediction. To learn non-pairwise
relationships, our DyHSL extracts hypergraph structural information to model
dynamics in the traffic networks, and updates each node representation by
aggregating messages from its associated hyperedges. Additionally, to capture
high-order spatio-temporal relations in the road network, we introduce an
interactive graph convolution block, which further models the neighborhood
interaction for each node. Finally, we integrate these two views into a
holistic multi-scale correlation extraction module, which conducts temporal
pooling with different scales to model different temporal patterns. Extensive
experiments on four popular traffic benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed DyHSL compared with a broad range of competing
baselines.]]></summary>

development of efficient cross-modal music retrieval systems. One of the
fundamental approaches toward this task is to learn a cross-modal embedding
space via deep neural networks that is able to connect short snippets of audio
and sheet music. However, the scarcity of annotated data from real musical
content affects the capability of such methods to generalize to real retrieval
scenarios. In this work, we investigate whether we can mitigate this limitation
with self-supervised contrastive learning, by exposing a network to a large
amount of real music data as a pre-training step, by contrasting randomly
augmented views of snippets of both modalities, namely audio and sheet images.
Through a number of experiments on synthetic and real piano data, we show that
pre-trained models are able to retrieve snippets with better precision in all
scenarios and pre-training configurations. Encouraged by these results, we
employ the snippet embeddings in the higher-level task of cross-modal piece
identification and conduct more experiments on several retrieval
configurations. In this task, we observe that the retrieval quality improves
from 30% up to 100% when real music data is present. We then conclude by
arguing for the potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for
alleviating the annotated data scarcity in multi-modal music retrieval models.]]></summary>

Additionally, we leverage the statistics for a novel self-training process to
stabilize the training. The framework is detector model-agnostic and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Audiovisual data is everywhere in this digital age, which raises higher
requirements for the deep learning models developed on them. To well handle the
information of the multi-modal data is the key to a better audiovisual modal.
We observe that these audiovisual data naturally have temporal attributes, such
as the time information for each frame in the video. More concretely, such data
is inherently multi-modal according to both audio and visual cues, which
proceed in a strict chronological order. It indicates that temporal information
is important in multi-modal acoustic event modeling for both intra- and
inter-modal. However, existing methods deal with each modal feature
independently and simply fuse them together, which neglects the mining of
temporal relation and thus leads to sub-optimal performance. With this
motivation, we propose a Temporal Multi-modal graph learning method for
Acoustic event Classification, called TMac, by modeling such temporal
information via graph learning techniques. In particular, we construct a
temporal graph for each acoustic event, dividing its audio data and video data
into multiple segments. Each segment can be considered as a node, and the
temporal relationships between nodes can be considered as timestamps on their
edges. In this case, we can smoothly capture the dynamic information in
intra-modal and inter-modal. Several experiments are conducted to demonstrate
TMac outperforms other SOTA models in performance. Our code is available at

technologies, like Virtual/Augmented reality and smart home. Traditional
model-based localization suffers from significant computational overhead, so
fingerprint localization is getting increasing attention, which needs lower
computation cost after the fingerprint database is built. However, the accuracy
of indoor localization is limited by the complicated indoor environment which
brings the multipath signal refraction. In this paper, we provided a scheme to
improve the accuracy of indoor fingerprint localization from the frequency
domain by predicting the channel state information (CSI) values from another
transmitting channel and spliced the multi-band information together to get
more precise localization results. We tested our proposed scheme on COST 2100

geographical locations with diverse conditions and rules of the road, e.g.,
left vs. right-hand traffic. In contrast, existing models for autonomous
driving have been thus far only deployed within restricted operational domains,
i.e., without accounting for varying driving behaviors across locations or
model scalability. In this work, we propose AnyD, a single geographically-aware
conditional imitation learning (CIL) model that can efficiently learn from
heterogeneous and globally distributed data with dynamic environmental,
traffic, and social characteristics. Our key insight is to introduce a
high-capacity geo-location-based channel attention mechanism that effectively
adapts to local nuances while also flexibly modeling similarities among regions
in a data-driven manner. By optimizing a contrastive imitation objective, our
proposed approach can efficiently scale across inherently imbalanced data
distributions and location-dependent events. We demonstrate the benefits of our
AnyD agent across multiple datasets, cities, and scalable deployment paradigms,
i.e., centralized, semi-supervised, and distributed agent training.
Specifically, AnyD outperforms CIL baselines by over 14% in open-loop
evaluation and 30% in closed-loop testing on CARLA.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep learning's immense capabilities are often constrained by the complexity
of its models, leading to an increasing demand for effective sparsification
techniques. Bayesian sparsification for deep learning emerges as a crucial
approach, facilitating the design of models that are both computationally
efficient and competitive in terms of performance across various deep learning
applications. The state-of-the-art -- in Bayesian sparsification of deep neural
networks -- combines structural shrinkage priors on model weights with an
approximate inference scheme based on black-box stochastic variational
inference. However, model inversion of the full generative model is
exceptionally computationally demanding, especially when compared to standard
deep learning of point estimates. In this context, we advocate for the use of
Bayesian model reduction (BMR) as a more efficient alternative for pruning of
model weights. As a generalization of the Savage-Dickey ratio, BMR allows a
post-hoc elimination of redundant model weights based on the posterior
estimates under a straightforward (non-hierarchical) generative model. Our
comparative study highlights the computational efficiency and the pruning rate
of the BMR method relative to the established stochastic variational inference
(SVI) scheme, when applied to the full hierarchical generative model. We
illustrate the potential of BMR to prune model parameters across various deep
learning architectures, from classical networks like LeNet to modern frameworks
such as Vision Transformers and MLP-Mixers.]]></summary>

importance in resolving expensive optimization problems~(EOPs). Extensive
efforts have been devoted to improving the efficacy of SAEAs through the
development of proficient model-assisted selection methods. However, generating
high-quality solutions is a prerequisite for selection. The fundamental
paradigm of evaluating a limited number of solutions in each generation within
SAEAs reduces the variance of adjacent populations, thus impacting the quality
of offspring solutions. This is a frequently encountered issue, yet it has not
gained widespread attention. This paper presents a framework using unevaluated
solutions to enhance the efficiency of SAEAs. The surrogate model is employed
to identify high-quality solutions for direct generation of new solutions
without evaluation. To ensure dependable selection, we have introduced two
tailored relation models for the selection of the optimal solution and the
unevaluated population. A comprehensive experimental analysis is performed on
two test suites, which showcases the superiority of the relation model over
regression and classification models in the selection phase. Furthermore, the
surrogate-selected unevaluated solutions with high potential have been shown to
significantly enhance the efficiency of the algorithm.]]></summary>

temporally successive point clouds. State-of-the-art methods use strong priors
and test-time optimization techniques, but require on the order of tens of
seconds to process large-scale point clouds, making them unusable as computer
vision primitives for real-time applications such as open world object
detection. Feed forward methods are considerably faster, running on the order
of tens to hundreds of milliseconds for large-scale point clouds, but require
expensive human supervision. To address both limitations, we propose Scene Flow
via Distillation, a simple, scalable distillation framework that uses a
label-free optimization method to produce pseudo-labels to supervise a feed
forward model. Our instantiation of this framework, ZeroFlow, achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Argoverse 2 Self-Supervised Scene Flow
Challenge while using zero human labels by simply training on large-scale,
diverse unlabeled data. At test-time, ZeroFlow is over 1000$\times$ faster than
label-free state-of-the-art optimization-based methods on large-scale point
clouds and over 1000$\times$ cheaper to train on unlabeled data compared to the

Tactile Adaptation from Visual Incentives (TAVI), a new framework that enhances

representations. Next, we construct a reward function using these visual
representations through optimal-transport based matching on one human
demonstration. Finally, we use online reinforcement learning on our robot to
optimize tactile-based policies that maximize the visual reward. On six
challenging tasks, such as peg pick-and-place, unstacking bowls, and flipping
slender objects, TAVI achieves a success rate of 73% using our four-fingered
Allegro robot hand. The increase in performance is 108% higher than policies
using tactile and vision-based rewards and 135% higher than policies without

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ensuring that analyses performed on a dataset are representative of the
entire population is one of the central problems in statistics. Most classical
techniques assume that the dataset is independent of the analyst's query and
break down in the common setting where a dataset is reused for multiple,
adaptively chosen, queries. This problem of \emph{adaptive data analysis} was
formalized in the seminal works of Dwork et al. (STOC, 2015) and Hardt and
Ullman (FOCS, 2014).

We identify a remarkably simple set of assumptions under which the queries
will continue to be representative even when chosen adaptively: The only
requirements are that each query takes as input a random subsample and outputs
few bits. This result shows that the noise inherent in subsampling is
sufficient to guarantee that query responses generalize. The simplicity of this
subsampling-based framework allows it to model a variety of real-world
scenarios not covered by prior work.

In addition to its simplicity, we demonstrate the utility of this framework
by designing mechanisms for two foundational tasks, statistical queries and
median finding. In particular, our mechanism for answering the broadly
applicable class of statistical queries is both extremely simple and state of
the art in many parameter regimes.]]></summary>

labeled by a hypothesis from the class, it is possible to retain only a small
subsample, using which the labels on the entire sample can be inferred. The
size of the compression scheme is an upper bound on the size of the subsample
produced. Every learnable binary hypothesis class (which must necessarily have
finite VC dimension) admits a sample compression scheme of size only a finite
function of its VC dimension, independent of the sample size. For multiclass
hypothesis classes, the analog of VC dimension is the DS dimension. We show
that the analogous statement pertaining to sample compression is not true for
multiclass hypothesis classes: every learnable multiclass hypothesis class,
which must necessarily have finite DS dimension, does not admit a sample

generalized linear models (GLMs) in the presence of additive oblivious noise.
We assume we have sample access to examples $(x, y)$ where $y$ is a noisy
measurement of $g(w^* \cdot x)$. In particular, \new{the noisy labels are of
the form} $y = g(w^* \cdot x) + \xi + \epsilon$, where $\xi$ is the oblivious
noise drawn independently of $x$ \new{and satisfies} $\Pr[\xi = 0] \geq o(1)$,
and $\epsilon \sim \mathcal N(0, \sigma^2)$. Our goal is to accurately recover
a \new{parameter vector $w$ such that the} function $g(w \cdot x)$ \new{has}
arbitrarily small error when compared to the true values $g(w^* \cdot x)$,
rather than the noisy measurements $y$.

We present an algorithm that tackles \new{this} problem in its most general
distribution-independent setting, where the solution may not \new{even} be
identifiable. \new{Our} algorithm returns \new{an accurate estimate of} the
solution if it is identifiable, and otherwise returns a small list of
candidates, one of which is close to the true solution. Furthermore, we
\new{provide} a necessary and sufficient condition for identifiability, which
holds in broad settings. \new{Specifically,} the problem is identifiable when
the quantile at which $\xi + \epsilon = 0$ is known, or when the family of
hypotheses does not contain candidates that are nearly equal to a translated
$g(w^* \cdot x) + A$ for some real number $A$, while also having large error
when compared to $g(w^* \cdot x)$.

This is the first \new{algorithmic} result for GLM regression \new{with
oblivious noise} which can handle more than half the samples being arbitrarily
corrupted. Prior work focused largely on the setting of linear regression, and
gave algorithms under restrictive assumptions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Privacy-preserving learning of gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) has
the potential for strong utility-privacy tradeoffs for tabular data, such as
census data or medical meta data: classical GBDT learners can extract
non-linear patterns from small sized datasets. The state-of-the-art notion for
provable privacy-properties is differential privacy, which requires that the
impact of single data points is limited and deniable. We introduce a novel
differentially private GBDT learner and utilize four main techniques to improve
the utility-privacy tradeoff. (1) We use an improved noise scaling approach
with tighter accounting of privacy leakage of a decision tree leaf compared to
prior work, resulting in noise that in expectation scales with $O(1/n)$, for
$n$ data points. (2) We integrate individual R\'enyi filters to our method to
learn from data points that have been underutilized during an iterative
training process, which -- potentially of independent interest -- results in a
natural yet effective insight to learning streams of non-i.i.d. data. (3) We
incorporate the concept of random decision tree splits to concentrate privacy
budget on learning leaves. (4) We deploy subsampling for privacy amplification.
Our evaluation shows for the Abalone dataset ($<4k$ training data points) a
$R^2$-score of $0.39$ for $\varepsilon=0.15$, which the closest prior work only
achieved for $\varepsilon=10.0$. On the Adult dataset ($50k$ training data
points) we achieve test error of $18.7\,\%$ for $\varepsilon=0.07$ which the
closest prior work only achieved for $\varepsilon=1.0$. For the Abalone dataset
for $\varepsilon=0.54$ we achieve $R^2$-score of $0.47$ which is very close to
the $R^2$-score of $0.54$ for the nonprivate version of GBDT. For the Adult
dataset for $\varepsilon=0.54$ we achieve test error $17.1\,\%$ which is very
close to the test error $13.7\,\%$ of the nonprivate version of GBDT.]]></summary>

the purpose of learning properties of quantum systems or of processing
classical or quantum data via quantum computing. As in classical learning,
quantum learning problems involve settings in which the mechanism generating
the data is unknown, and the main goal of a learning algorithm is to ensure
satisfactory accuracy levels when only given access to data and, possibly, side
information such as expert knowledge. This article reviews the complexity of
quantum learning using information-theoretic techniques by focusing on data
complexity, copy complexity, and model complexity. Copy complexity arises from
the destructive nature of quantum measurements, which irreversibly alter the
state to be processed, limiting the information that can be extracted about
quantum data. For example, in a quantum system, unlike in classical machine
learning, it is generally not possible to evaluate the training loss
simultaneously on multiple hypotheses using the same quantum data. To make the
paper self-contained and approachable by different research communities, we
provide extensive background material on classical results from statistical
learning theory, as well as on the distinguishability of quantum states.
Throughout, we highlight the differences between quantum and classical learning
by addressing both supervised and unsupervised learning, and we provide
extensive pointers to the literature.]]></summary>

candidates is one of the earliest steps in drug discovery. As the size of
commercially available compound collections grows exponentially to the scale of
billions, brute-force virtual screening using traditional tools such as docking
becomes infeasible in terms of time and computational resources. Active
learning and Bayesian optimization has recently been proven as effective
methods of narrowing down the search space. An essential component in those
methods is a surrogate machine learning model that is trained with a small
subset of the library to predict the desired properties of compounds. Accurate
model can achieve high sample efficiency by finding the most promising
compounds with only a fraction of the whole library being virtually screened.
In this study, we examined the performance of pretrained transformer-based
language model and graph neural network in Bayesian optimization active
learning framework. The best pretrained models identifies 58.97% of the
top-50000 by docking score after screening only 0.6% of an ultra-large library
containing 99.5 million compounds, improving 8% over previous state-of-the-art
baseline. Through extensive benchmarks, we show that the superior performance
of pretrained models persists in both structure-based and ligand-based drug
discovery. Such model can serve as a boost to the accuracy and sample
efficiency of active learning based molecule virtual screening.]]></summary>

In particular, this work investigates whether it is possible to build a
dictionary of IMUGait patterns and use it to launch an attack or find an
imitator who can actively reproduce IMUGait patterns that match the target's
IMUGait pattern. Nine physically and demographically diverse individuals walked
at various levels of four predefined controllable and adaptable gait factors
(speed, step length, step width, and thigh-lift), producing 178 unique IMUGait
patterns. Each pattern attacked a wide variety of user authentication models.

accurately capturing the complex dynamics of dynamic power systems remains a
challenge for traditional statistical models. For these reasons, time-series

deployed and often experience higher success. In this paper, we analyze the
efficacy of the recently developed Transformer-based Neural Network model in

from their Attention Mechanism. We apply several metaheuristics namely
Differential Evolution to find the optimal hyperparameters of the

Evolution provides scalable, robust, global solutions to non-differentiable,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial to modern deep learning
applications by identifying and alerting about the OOD samples that should not
be tested or used for making predictions. Current OOD detection methods have
made significant progress when in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples are drawn
from static distributions. However, this can be unrealistic when applied to
real-world systems which often undergo continuous variations and shifts in ID
and OOD distributions over time. Therefore, for an effective application in
real-world systems, the development of OOD detection methods that can adapt to
these dynamic and evolving distributions is essential. In this paper, we
propose a novel and more realistic setting called continuously adaptive
out-of-distribution (CAOOD) detection which targets on developing an OOD
detection model that enables dynamic and quick adaptation to a new arriving
distribution, with insufficient ID samples during deployment time. To address
CAOOD, we develop meta OOD learning (MOL) by designing a learning-to-adapt
diagram such that a good initialized OOD detection model is learned during the
training process. In the testing process, MOL ensures OOD detection performance
over shifting distributions by quickly adapting to new distributions with a few
adaptations. Extensive experiments on several OOD benchmarks endorse the
effectiveness of our method in preserving both ID classification accuracy and
OOD detection performance on continuously shifting distributions.]]></summary>

$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T d})$. The regret bound is the same as that of Soft-Bayes due
to Orseau et al. up to logarithmic terms. 3. For online learning quantum states

language models (LLMs). If a model is trained on a sentence of the form "A is
B", it will not automatically generalize to the reverse direction "B is A".
This is the Reversal Curse. For instance, if a model is trained on "Olaf Scholz
was the ninth Chancellor of Germany", it will not automatically be able to
answer the question, "Who was the ninth Chancellor of Germany?". Moreover, the
likelihood of the correct answer ("Olaf Scholz") will not be higher than for a
random name. Thus, models exhibit a basic failure of logical deduction and do
not generalize a prevalent pattern in their training set (i.e. if "A is B''
occurs, "B is A" is more likely to occur). We provide evidence for the Reversal
Curse by finetuning GPT-3 and Llama-1 on fictitious statements such as "Uriah
Hawthorne is the composer of 'Abyssal Melodies'" and showing that they fail to
correctly answer "Who composed 'Abyssal Melodies?'". The Reversal Curse is
robust across model sizes and model families and is not alleviated by data
augmentation. We also evaluate ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) on questions about
real-world celebrities, such as "Who is Tom Cruise's mother? [A: Mary Lee
Pfeiffer]" and the reverse "Who is Mary Lee Pfeiffer's son?". GPT-4 correctly
answers questions like the former 79% of the time, compared to 33% for the
latter. This shows a failure of logical deduction that we hypothesize is caused
by the Reversal Curse. Code is available at

real-world applications by relying on the fixed graph data as input. However,
the initial input graph might not be optimal in terms of specific downstream
tasks, because of information scarcity, noise, adversarial attacks, or
discrepancies between the distribution in graph topology, features, and
groundtruth labels. In this paper, we propose a bi-level optimization approach
for learning the optimal graph structure via directly learning the Personalized
PageRank propagation matrix as well as the downstream semi-supervised node
classification simultaneously. We also explore a low-rank approximation model
for further reducing the time complexity. Empirical evaluations show the
superior efficacy and robustness of the proposed model over all baseline

remarkable success in automatically generating descriptions for audio clips,
namely Automated Audio Captioning (AAC). However, it is labor-intensive and
time-consuming to collect a sufficient number of paired audio and captions.
Motivated by the recent advances in Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining
(CLAP), we propose a weakly-supervised approach to train an AAC model assuming
only text data and a pre-trained CLAP model, alleviating the need for paired
target data. Our approach leverages the similarity between audio and text
embeddings in CLAP. During training, we learn to reconstruct the text from the
CLAP text embedding, and during inference, we decode using the audio
embeddings. To mitigate the modality gap between the audio and text embeddings
we employ strategies to bridge the gap during training and inference stages. We
evaluate our proposed method on Clotho and AudioCaps datasets demonstrating its
ability to achieve a relative performance of up to ~$83\%$ compared to fully
supervised approaches trained with paired target data.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Structure learning is the crux of causal inference. Notably, causal discovery
(CD) algorithms are brittle when data is scarce, possibly inferring imprecise
causal relations that contradict expert knowledge -- especially when
considering latent confounders. To aggravate the issue, most CD methods do not
provide uncertainty estimates, making it hard for users to interpret results
and improve the inference process. Surprisingly, while CD is a human-centered
affair, no works have focused on building methods that both 1) output
uncertainty estimates that can be verified by experts and 2) interact with
those experts to iteratively refine CD. To solve these issues, we start by
proposing to sample (causal) ancestral graphs proportionally to a belief
distribution based on a score function, such as the Bayesian information
criterion (BIC), using generative flow networks. Then, we leverage the
diversity in candidate graphs and introduce an optimal experimental design to
iteratively probe the expert about the relations among variables, effectively
reducing the uncertainty of our belief over ancestral graphs. Finally, we
update our samples to incorporate human feedback via importance sampling.
Importantly, our method does not require causal sufficiency (i.e., unobserved
confounders may exist). Experiments with synthetic observational data show that
our method can accurately sample from distributions over ancestral graphs and
that we can greatly improve inference quality with human aid.]]></summary>

setting in which data from different tasks is presented to the learner in a
streaming fashion. A key challenge in this setting is the so-called
"catastrophic forgetting problem", in which the performance of the learner in
an "old task" decreases when subsequently trained on a "new task". Existing
continual learning methods, such as Averaged Gradient Episodic Memory (A-GEM)
and Orthogonal Gradient Descent (OGD), address catastrophic forgetting by
minimizing the loss for the current task without increasing the loss for
previous tasks. However, these methods assume the learner knows when the task
changes, which is unrealistic in practice. In this paper, we alleviate the need
to provide the algorithm with information about task changes by using an online
clustering-based approach on a dynamically updated finite pool of samples or
gradients. We thereby successfully counteract catastrophic forgetting in one of
the hardest settings, namely: domain-incremental learning, a setting for which
the problem was previously unsolved. We showcase the benefits of our approach
by applying these ideas to projection-based methods, such as A-GEM and OGD,
which lead to task-agnostic versions of them. Experiments on real datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy and its promising
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

previous deep forecasting models to generalize to new roads not seen in the
training data (unseen roads) are rarely explored. In this paper, we introduce a
novel setup called a spatio-temporal (ST) split to evaluate the models'
capabilities to generalize to unseen roads. In this setup, the models are
trained on data from a sample of roads, but tested on roads not seen in the
training data. Moreover, we also present a novel framework called Spatial
Contrastive Pre-Training (SCPT) where we introduce a spatial encoder module to
extract latent features from unseen roads during inference time. This spatial
encoder is pre-trained using contrastive learning. During inference, the
spatial encoder only requires two days of traffic data on the new roads and
does not require any re-training. We also show that the output from the spatial
encoder can be used effectively to infer latent node embeddings on unseen roads
during inference time. The SCPT framework also incorporates a new layer, named
the spatially gated addition (SGA) layer, to effectively combine the latent
features from the output of the spatial encoder to existing backbones.
Additionally, since there is limited data on the unseen roads, we argue that it
is better to decouple traffic signals to trivial-to-capture periodic signals
and difficult-to-capture Markovian signals, and for the spatial encoder to only
learn the Markovian signals. Finally, we empirically evaluated SCPT using the
ST split setup on four real-world datasets. The results showed that adding SCPT
to a backbone consistently improves forecasting performance on unseen roads.
More importantly, the improvements are greater when forecasting further into
the future. The codes are available on GitHub:

signals, this discrepancy results in new subjects need spend a amount of
calibration time for EEG-based motor imagery brain-computer interface. In order
to solve the above problems, we propose a Dynamic Domain Adaptation Based Deep
Learning Network (DADL-Net). First, the EEG data is mapped to the

through the 3D convolution module, and then the spatial-channel attention
mechanism is used to strengthen the features, and the final convolution module
can further learn the spatial-temporal information of the features. Finally, to
account for inter-subject and cross-sessions differences, we employ a dynamic
domain-adaptive strategy, the distance between features is reduced by
introducing a Maximum Mean Discrepancy loss function, and the classification
layer is fine-tuned by using part of the target domain data. We verify the
performance of the proposed method on BCI competition IV 2a and OpenBMI

around the problem of connecting large collections of sheet music (images) to

recent approaches to this task employs cross-modal deep learning architectures
to learn joint embedding spaces that link the two distinct modalities - audio
and sheet music images. While there has been steady improvement on this front
over the past years, a number of open problems still prevent large-scale
employment of this methodology. In this article we attempt to provide an
insightful examination of the current developments on audio-sheet music
retrieval via deep learning methods. We first identify a set of main challenges
on the road towards robust and large-scale cross-modal music retrieval in real
scenarios. We then highlight the steps we have taken so far to address some of
these challenges, documenting step-by-step improvement along several
dimensions. We conclude by analysing the remaining challenges and present ideas
for solving these, in order to pave the way to a unified and robust methodology

map as sparse as possible in the latent space. The latent space data is
transmitted to the receiver. The decoder module of the autoencoder is designed
using the inverse DCT and two fully connected linear layers to improve the

We propose a new family of computationally efficient bandit algorithms for the
stochastic contextual bandit settings, with the flexibility to be adapted for
cumulative regret minimization (with near-optimal minimax guarantees) and
simple regret minimization (with SOTA guarantees). Furthermore, our algorithms
adapt to model misspecification and extend to the continuous arm settings.
These advantages come from constructing and relying on "conformal arm sets"
(CASs), which provide a set of arms at every context that encompass the
context-specific optimal arm with some probability across the context
distribution. Our positive results on simple and cumulative regret guarantees
are contrasted by a negative result, which shows that an algorithm can't
achieve instance-dependent simple regret guarantees while simultaneously
achieving minimax optimal cumulative regret guarantees.]]></summary>

are altruistic about sharing their data with the server for the collective good
whenever needed. Despite their compelling theoretical guarantee on performance
and communication efficiency, this assumption is overly idealistic and
oftentimes violated in practice, especially when the algorithm is operated over
self-interested clients, who are reluctant to share data without explicit
benefits. Negligence of such self-interested behaviors can significantly affect
the learning efficiency and even the practical operability of federated bandit
learning. In light of this, we aim to spark new insights into this
under-explored research area by formally introducing an incentivized
communication problem for federated bandits, where the server shall motivate
clients to share data by providing incentives. Without loss of generality, we
instantiate this bandit problem with the contextual linear setting and propose
the first incentivized communication protocol, namely, Inc-FedUCB, that
achieves near-optimal regret with provable communication and incentive cost
guarantees. Extensive empirical experiments on both synthetic and real-world

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Federated learning is a distributed machine learning system that uses
participants' data to train an improved global model. In federated learning,
participants cooperatively train a global model, and they will receive the
global model and payments. Rational participants try to maximize their
individual utility, and they will not input their high-quality data truthfully
unless they are provided with satisfactory payments based on their data
quality. Furthermore, federated learning benefits from the cooperative
contributions of participants. Accordingly, how to establish an incentive
mechanism that both incentivizes inputting data truthfully and promotes stable
cooperation has become an important issue to consider. In this paper, we
introduce a data sharing game model for federated learning and employ
game-theoretic approaches to design a core-selecting incentive mechanism by
utilizing a popular concept in cooperative games, the core. In federated
learning, the core can be empty, resulting in the core-selecting mechanism
becoming infeasible. To address this, our core-selecting mechanism employs a
relaxation method and simultaneously minimizes the benefits of inputting false
data for all participants. However, this mechanism is computationally expensive
because it requires aggregating exponential models for all possible coalitions,
which is infeasible in federated learning. To address this, we propose an
efficient core-selecting mechanism based on sampling approximation that only
aggregates models on sampled coalitions to approximate the exact result.
Extensive experiments verify that the efficient core-selecting mechanism can
incentivize inputting high-quality data and stable cooperation, while it
reduces computational overhead compared to the core-selecting mechanism.]]></summary>

problem has not yet been achieved. This review article delves into the topic of
community detection in graphs, which serves as a crucial role in understanding
the organization and functioning of complex systems. We begin by introducing
the concept of community structure, which refers to the arrangement of vertices
into clusters, with strong internal connections and weaker connections between
clusters. Then, we provide a thorough exposition of various community detection
methods, including a new method designed by us. Additionally, we explore
real-world applications of community detection in diverse networks. In
conclusion, this comprehensive review provides a deep understanding of

in a variety of use cases, including journalistic news articles. Given the
potential malicious nature in which these LLMs can be used to generate
disinformation at scale, it is important to build effective detectors for such
AI-generated text. Given the surge in development of new LLMs, acquiring
labeled training data for supervised detectors is a bottleneck. However, there
might be plenty of unlabeled text data available, without information on which
generator it came from. In this work we tackle this data problem, in detecting
AI-generated news text, and frame the problem as an unsupervised domain
adaptation task. Here the domains are the different text generators, i.e. LLMs,
and we assume we have access to only the labeled source data and unlabeled
target data. We develop a Contrastive Domain Adaptation framework, called
ConDA, that blends standard domain adaptation techniques with the
representation power of contrastive learning to learn domain invariant
representations that are effective for the final unsupervised detection task.
Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, resulting in
average performance gains of 31.7% from the best performing baselines, and
within 0.8% margin of a fully supervised detector. All our code and data is

contrastive learning (CL) plays a key role. However, the recent development of
new non-CL frameworks has achieved comparable or better performance with high
improvement potential, prompting researchers to enhance these frameworks
further. Assimilating CL into non-CL frameworks has been thought to be
beneficial, but empirical evidence indicates no visible improvements. In view
of that, this paper proposes a strategy of performing CL along the dimensional
direction instead of along the batch direction as done in conventional
contrastive learning, named Dimensional Contrastive Learning (DimCL). DimCL
aims to enhance the feature diversity, and it can serve as a regularizer to
prior SSL frameworks. DimCL has been found to be effective, and the
hardness-aware property is identified as a critical reason for its success.
Extensive experimental results reveal that assimilating DimCL into SSL
frameworks leads to performance improvement by a non-trivial margin on various
datasets and backbone architectures.]]></summary>

optimization of quantum algorithms in the current era of noisy intermediate
scale quantum (NISQ) computers. A fundamental challenge in quantum machine
learning is generalization, as the designer targets performance under testing
conditions, while having access only to limited training data. Existing
generalization analyses, while identifying important general trends and scaling
laws, cannot be used to assign reliable and informative "error bars" to the
decisions made by quantum models. In this article, we propose a general
methodology that can reliably quantify the uncertainty of quantum models,
irrespective of the amount of training data, of the number of shots, of the
ansatz, of the training algorithm, and of the presence of quantum hardware
noise. The approach, which builds on probabilistic conformal prediction, turns
an arbitrary, possibly small, number of shots from a pre-trained quantum model
into a set prediction, e.g., an interval, that provably contains the true
target with any desired coverage level. Experimental results confirm the
theoretical calibration guarantees of the proposed framework, referred to as
quantum conformal prediction.]]></summary>

achieving goal directed behavior over long sequences of actions. However, it
has been challenging to implement in realistic or open-ended environments. A
main challenge has been to find the right space of sub-goals over which to
instantiate a hierarchy. We present a novel approach where we use data from
humans solving these tasks to softly supervise the goal space for a set of long
range tasks in a 3D embodied environment. In particular, we use unconstrained
natural language to parameterize this space. This has two advantages: first, it
is easy to generate this data from naive human participants; second, it is
flexible enough to represent a vast range of sub-goals in human-relevant tasks.
Our approach outperforms agents that clone expert behavior on these tasks, as
well as HRL from scratch without this supervised sub-goal space. Our work
presents a novel approach to combining human expert supervision with the
benefits and flexibility of reinforcement learning.]]></summary>

models in various applications. GAMs assume that the output can be represented
as a sum of univariate functions, referred to as components. However, this
assumption fails in ML problems where the output depends on multiple features
simultaneously. In these cases, GAMs fail to capture the interaction terms of
the underlying function, leading to subpar accuracy. To (partially) address
this issue, we propose Regionally Additive Models (RAMs), a novel class of
explainable-by-design models. RAMs identify subregions within the feature space
where interactions are minimized. Within these regions, it is more accurate to
express the output as a sum of univariate functions (components). Consequently,
RAMs fit one component per subregion of each feature instead of one component
per feature. This approach yields a more expressive model compared to GAMs
while retaining interpretability. The RAM framework consists of three steps.
Firstly, we train a black-box model. Secondly, using Regional Effect Plots, we
identify subregions where the black-box model exhibits near-local additivity.
Lastly, we fit a GAM component for each identified subregion. We validate the
effectiveness of RAMs through experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets. The results confirm that RAMs offer improved expressiveness compared
to GAMs while maintaining interpretability.]]></summary>

reinforcement learning, especially when only sparse reward signals are
available. While option discovery methods have been proposed for individual
agents, in multi-agent reinforcement learning settings, discovering
collaborative options that can coordinate the behavior of multiple agents and
encourage them to visit the under-explored regions of their joint state space
has not been considered. In this case, we propose Multi-agent Deep Covering
Option Discovery, which constructs the multi-agent options through minimizing
the expected cover time of the multiple agents' joint state space. Also, we
propose a novel framework to adopt the multi-agent options in the MARL process.
In practice, a multi-agent task can usually be divided into some sub-tasks,
each of which can be completed by a sub-group of the agents. Therefore, our
algorithm framework first leverages an attention mechanism to find
collaborative agent sub-groups that would benefit most from coordinated
actions. Then, a hierarchical algorithm, namely HA-MSAC, is developed to learn
the multi-agent options for each sub-group to complete their sub-tasks first,
and then to integrate them through a high-level policy as the solution of the
whole task. This hierarchical option construction allows our framework to
strike a balance between scalability and effective collaboration among the
agents. The evaluation based on multi-agent collaborative tasks shows that the
proposed algorithm can effectively capture the agent interactions with the
attention mechanism, successfully identify multi-agent options, and
significantly outperforms prior works using single-agent options or no options,
in terms of both faster exploration and higher task rewards.]]></summary>

based on large language models (LLMs). Given a goal described in natural
language, Text2Reward generates dense reward functions as an executable program
grounded in a compact representation of the environment. Unlike inverse RL and
recent work that uses LLMs to write sparse reward codes, Text2Reward produces
interpretable, free-form dense reward codes that cover a wide range of tasks,
utilize existing packages, and allow iterative refinement with human feedback.
We evaluate Text2Reward on two robotic manipulation benchmarks (ManiSkill2,
MetaWorld) and two locomotion environments of MuJoCo. On 13 of the 17
manipulation tasks, policies trained with generated reward codes achieve
similar or better task success rates and convergence speed than expert-written
reward codes. For locomotion tasks, our method learns six novel locomotion
behaviors with a success rate exceeding 94%. Furthermore, we show that the
policies trained in the simulator with our method can be deployed in the real
world. Finally, Text2Reward further improves the policies by refining their
reward functions with human feedback. Video results are available at

approach for the Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance, which has an intractable
expectation in its analytical form. However, the MC method is not optimal in
terms of minimizing the absolute approximation error. To provide a better class
of empirical SW, we propose quasi-sliced Wasserstein (QSW) approximations that
rely on Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. For a comprehensive investigation of
QMC for SW, we focus on the 3D setting, specifically computing the SW between

verify various ways of constructing QMC points sets on the 3D unit-hypersphere,
including Gaussian-based mapping, equal area mapping, generalized spiral
points, and optimizing discrepancy energies. Furthermore, to obtain an unbiased
estimation for stochastic optimization, we extend QSW into Randomized
Quasi-Sliced Wasserstein (RQSW) by introducing randomness to the discussed
low-discrepancy sequences. For theoretical properties, we prove the asymptotic
convergence of QSW and the unbiasedness of RQSW. Finally, we conduct
experiments on various 3D tasks, such as point-cloud comparison, point-cloud
interpolation, image style transfer, and training deep point-cloud
autoencoders, to demonstrate the favorable performance of the proposed QSW and

efforts of embedding such networks on end-user devices. However, current
quantization methods usually suffer from costly accuracy degradation. In this
paper, we propose a new method for Enhanced Post Training Quantization named
EPTQ. The method is based on knowledge distillation with an adaptive weighting
of layers. In addition, we introduce a new label-free technique for
approximating the Hessian trace of the task loss, named Label-Free Hessian.
This technique removes the requirement of a labeled dataset for computing the
Hessian. The adaptive knowledge distillation uses the Label-Free Hessian
technique to give greater attention to the sensitive parts of the model while
performing the optimization. Empirically, by employing EPTQ we achieve
state-of-the-art results on a wide variety of models, tasks, and datasets,
including ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and Pascal-VOC for
semantic segmentation. We demonstrate the performance and compatibility of EPTQ

generative model in which the parameters of a set of independent distributions
are modified with Bayesian inference in the light of noisy data samples, then
passed as input to a neural network that outputs a second, interdependent
distribution. Starting from a simple prior and iteratively updating the two
distributions yields a generative procedure similar to the reverse process of
diffusion models; however it is conceptually simpler in that no forward process
is required. Discrete and continuous-time loss functions are derived for
continuous, discretised and discrete data, along with sample generation
procedures. Notably, the network inputs for discrete data lie on the
probability simplex, and are therefore natively differentiable, paving the way
for gradient-based sample guidance and few-step generation in discrete domains
such as language modelling. The loss function directly optimises data
compression and places no restrictions on the network architecture. In our
experiments BFNs achieve competitive log-likelihoods for image modelling on
dynamically binarized MNIST and CIFAR-10, and outperform all known discrete
diffusion models on the text8 character-level language modelling task.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Structure learning is the crux of causal inference. Notably, causal discovery
(CD) algorithms are brittle when data is scarce, possibly inferring imprecise
causal relations that contradict expert knowledge -- especially when
considering latent confounders. To aggravate the issue, most CD methods do not
provide uncertainty estimates, making it hard for users to interpret results
and improve the inference process. Surprisingly, while CD is a human-centered
affair, no works have focused on building methods that both 1) output
uncertainty estimates that can be verified by experts and 2) interact with
those experts to iteratively refine CD. To solve these issues, we start by
proposing to sample (causal) ancestral graphs proportionally to a belief
distribution based on a score function, such as the Bayesian information
criterion (BIC), using generative flow networks. Then, we leverage the
diversity in candidate graphs and introduce an optimal experimental design to
iteratively probe the expert about the relations among variables, effectively
reducing the uncertainty of our belief over ancestral graphs. Finally, we
update our samples to incorporate human feedback via importance sampling.
Importantly, our method does not require causal sufficiency (i.e., unobserved
confounders may exist). Experiments with synthetic observational data show that
our method can accurately sample from distributions over ancestral graphs and
that we can greatly improve inference quality with human aid.]]></summary>

ecological civilization patterns for achieving Sustainable Development Goals
(namely, sustainable development patterns), are of utmost importance for
promoting ecological, economic, social, and resource sustainability in a
specific region. To achieve this, the recommendation process must carefully
consider the region's natural, environmental, resource, and economic
characteristics. However, current recommendation algorithms in the field of
computer science fall short in adequately addressing the spatial heterogeneity
related to environment and sparsity of regional historical interaction data,
which limits their effectiveness in recommending sustainable development
patterns. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a method called
User Graph after Pruning and Intent Graph (UGPIG). Firstly, we utilize the
high-density linking capability of the pruned User Graph to address the issue
of spatial heterogeneity neglect in recommendation algorithms. Secondly, we
construct an Intent Graph by incorporating the intent network, which captures
the preferences for attributes including environmental elements of target
regions. This approach effectively alleviates the problem of sparse historical
interaction data in the region. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate
that UGPIG outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms like KGCN,
KGAT, and KGIN in sustainable development pattern recommendations, with a
maximum improvement of 9.61% in Top-3 recommendation performance.]]></summary>

enables us to collect massive individual-level trajectory dataset from users.
Such trajectory big data bring new opportunities to human mobility research but
also raise public concerns with regard to location privacy. In this work, we
present the Conditional Adversarial Trajectory Synthesis (CATS), a
deep-learning-based GeoAI methodological framework for privacy-preserving
trajectory data generation and publication. CATS applies K-anonymity to the
underlying spatiotemporal distributions of human movements, which provides a
distributional-level strong privacy guarantee. By leveraging conditional
adversarial training on K-anonymized human mobility matrices, trajectory global
context learning using the attention-based mechanism, and recurrent bipartite
graph matching of adjacent trajectory points, CATS is able to reconstruct
trajectory topology from conditionally sampled locations and generate
high-quality individual-level synthetic trajectory data, which can serve as
supplements or alternatives to raw data for privacy-preserving trajectory data
publication. The experiment results on over 90k GPS trajectories show that our
method has a better performance in privacy preservation, spatiotemporal
characteristic preservation, and downstream utility compared with baseline

control problem whose state space is the $d$-dimensional positive orthant. The
controlled process $Z$ evolves as a reflected Brownian motion whose covariance
matrix is exogenously specified, as are its directions of reflection from the
orthant's boundary surfaces. A system manager chooses a drift vector
$\theta(t)$ at each time $t$ based on the history of $Z$, and the cost rate at
time $t$ depends on both $Z(t)$ and $\theta(t)$. In our initial problem
formulation, the objective is to minimize expected discounted cost over an
infinite planning horizon, after which we treat the corresponding ergodic
control problem. Extending earlier work by Han et al. (Proceedings of the

to public item features. Training with Differential Privacy (DP) offers strong
privacy guarantees, at the expense of loss in recommendation quality. We show
that incorporating public item features during training can help mitigate this
loss in quality. We propose a general approach based on collective matrix
factorization (CMF), that works by simultaneously factorizing two matrices: the
user feedback matrix (representing sensitive data) and an item feature matrix
that encodes publicly available (non-sensitive) item information.

The method is conceptually simple, easy to tune, and highly scalable. It can
be applied to different types of public item data, including: (1) categorical
item features; (2) item-item similarities learned from public sources; and (3)
publicly available user feedback. Furthermore, these data modalities can be
collectively utilized to fully leverage public data.

Evaluating our method on a standard DP recommendation benchmark, we find that
using public item features significantly narrows the quality gap between
private models and their non-private counterparts. As privacy constraints
become more stringent, models rely more heavily on public side features for
recommendation. This results in a smooth transition from collaborative
filtering to item-based contextual recommendations.]]></summary>

continuously provide content to their consumers. Sequential recommendation
consequently has seen considerable attention in current literature, where state
of the art approaches focus on self-attentive models leveraging contextual
information such as long and short-term user history and item features;
however, most of these studies focus on long-form content domains (retail,
movie, etc.) rather than short-form, such as music. Additionally, many do not
explore incorporating negative session-level feedback during training. In this
study, we investigate the use of transformer-based self-attentive architectures
to learn implicit session-level information for sequential music
recommendation. We additionally propose a contrastive learning task to
incorporate negative feedback (e.g skipped tracks) to promote positive hits and
penalize negative hits. This task is formulated as a simple loss term that can
be incorporated into a variety of deep learning architectures for sequential
recommendation. Our experiments show that this results in consistent
performance gains over the baseline architectures ignoring negative user

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A sequential pattern with negation, or negative sequential pattern, takes the
form of a sequential pattern for which the negation symbol may be used in front
of some of the pattern's itemsets. Intuitively, such a pattern occurs in a
sequence if negated itemsets are absent in the sequence. Recent work has shown
that different semantics can be attributed to these pattern forms, and that
state-of-the-art algorithms do not extract the same sets of patterns. This
raises the important question of the interpretability of sequential pattern
with negation. In this study, our focus is on exploring how potential users
perceive negation in sequential patterns. Our aim is to determine whether
specific semantics are more "intuitive" than others and whether these align
with the semantics employed by one or more state-of-the-art algorithms. To
achieve this, we designed a questionnaire to reveal the semantics' intuition of
each user. This article presents both the design of the questionnaire and an
in-depth analysis of the 124 responses obtained. The outcomes indicate that two
of the semantics are predominantly intuitive; however, neither of them aligns
with the semantics of the primary state-of-the-art algorithms. As a result, we
provide recommendations to account for this disparity in the conclusions drawn.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep learning's immense capabilities are often constrained by the complexity
of its models, leading to an increasing demand for effective sparsification
techniques. Bayesian sparsification for deep learning emerges as a crucial
approach, facilitating the design of models that are both computationally
efficient and competitive in terms of performance across various deep learning
applications. The state-of-the-art -- in Bayesian sparsification of deep neural
networks -- combines structural shrinkage priors on model weights with an
approximate inference scheme based on black-box stochastic variational
inference. However, model inversion of the full generative model is
exceptionally computationally demanding, especially when compared to standard
deep learning of point estimates. In this context, we advocate for the use of
Bayesian model reduction (BMR) as a more efficient alternative for pruning of
model weights. As a generalization of the Savage-Dickey ratio, BMR allows a
post-hoc elimination of redundant model weights based on the posterior
estimates under a straightforward (non-hierarchical) generative model. Our
comparative study highlights the computational efficiency and the pruning rate
of the BMR method relative to the established stochastic variational inference
(SVI) scheme, when applied to the full hierarchical generative model. We
illustrate the potential of BMR to prune model parameters across various deep
learning architectures, from classical networks like LeNet to modern frameworks

recent years, most developed methods rely on the assumption that the training
and test data have similar distributions. In the presence of distribution
shifts, fair models may behave unfairly on test data. There have been some
developments for fair learning robust to distribution shifts to address this
shortcoming. However, most proposed solutions are based on the assumption of
having access to the causal graph describing the interaction of different
features. Moreover, existing algorithms require full access to data and cannot
be used when small batches are used (stochastic/batch implementation). This
paper proposes the first stochastic distributionally robust fairness framework
with convergence guarantees that do not require knowledge of the causal graph.
More specifically, we formulate the fair inference in the presence of the
distribution shift as a distributionally robust optimization problem under
$L_p$ norm uncertainty sets with respect to the Exponential Renyi Mutual
Information (ERMI) as the measure of fairness violation. We then discuss how
the proposed method can be implemented in a stochastic fashion. We have
evaluated the presented framework's performance and efficiency through
extensive experiments on real datasets consisting of distribution shifts.]]></summary>

modalities (especially vision) have achieved unprecedented performance in
various multimodal tasks. However, due to the unsolved adversarial robustness
problem of vision models, MLLMs can have more severe safety and security risks
by introducing the vision inputs. In this work, we study the adversarial
robustness of Google's Bard, a competitive chatbot to ChatGPT that released its
multimodal capability recently, to better understand the vulnerabilities of
commercial MLLMs. By attacking white-box surrogate vision encoders or MLLMs,
the generated adversarial examples can mislead Bard to output wrong image
descriptions with a 22% success rate based solely on the transferability. We
show that the adversarial examples can also attack other MLLMs, e.g., a 26%
attack success rate against Bing Chat and a 86% attack success rate against
ERNIE bot. Moreover, we identify two defense mechanisms of Bard, including face
detection and toxicity detection of images. We design corresponding attacks to
evade these defenses, demonstrating that the current defenses of Bard are also
vulnerable. We hope this work can deepen our understanding on the robustness of
MLLMs and facilitate future research on defenses. Our code is available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Self-supervised representation learning has seen remarkable progress in the
last few years, with some of the recent methods being able to learn useful
image representations without labels. These methods are trained using
backpropagation, the de facto standard. Recently, Geoffrey Hinton proposed the
forward-forward algorithm as an alternative training method. It utilizes two
forward passes and a separate loss function for each layer to train the network
without backpropagation.

In this study, for the first time, we study the performance of
forward-forward vs. backpropagation for self-supervised representation learning
and provide insights into the learned representation spaces. Our benchmark
employs four standard datasets, namely MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR-10, and
three commonly used self-supervised representation learning techniques, namely
rotation, flip and jigsaw.

Our main finding is that while the forward-forward algorithm performs
comparably to backpropagation during (self-)supervised training, the transfer
performance is significantly lagging behind in all the studied settings. This
may be caused by a combination of factors, including having a loss function for
each layer and the way the supervised training is realized in the
forward-forward paradigm. In comparison to backpropagation, the forward-forward
algorithm focuses more on the boundaries and drops part of the information
unnecessary for making decisions which harms the representation learning goal.
Further investigation and research are necessary to stabilize the
forward-forward strategy for self-supervised learning, to work beyond the
datasets and configurations demonstrated by Geoffrey Hinton.]]></summary>

sheet music images to audio recordings. A typical and recent approach to this
is to learn, via deep neural networks, a joint embedding space that correlates
short fixed-size snippets of audio and sheet music by means of an appropriate
similarity structure. However, two challenges that arise out of this strategy
are the requirement of strongly aligned data to train the networks, and the
inherent discrepancies of musical content between audio and sheet music
snippets caused by local and global tempo differences. In this paper, we
address these two shortcomings by designing a cross-modal recurrent network
that learns joint embeddings that can summarize longer passages of
corresponding audio and sheet music. The benefits of our method are that it
only requires weakly aligned audio-sheet music pairs, as well as that the
recurrent network handles the non-linearities caused by tempo variations
between audio and sheet music. We conduct a number of experiments on synthetic
and real piano data and scores, showing that our proposed recurrent method
leads to more accurate retrieval in all possible configurations.]]></summary>

of the intermediate activation maps down to using INT2 precision. They showed
little to no reduction in performance while achieving large reductions in GPU
memory consumption. In this work, we present an improvement to the EXACT
strategy by using block-wise quantization of the intermediate activation maps.
We experimentally analyze different block sizes and show further reduction in
memory consumption (>15%), and runtime speedup per epoch (about 5%) even when
performing extreme extents of quantization with similar performance trade-offs
as with the original EXACT. Further, we present a correction to the assumptions
on the distribution of intermediate activation maps in EXACT (assumed to be

rendezvous due to their small form factor and inexpensive power, mass, and
volume costs. When it comes to docking, however, they typically serve a
secondary role, whereas the main work is done by active sensors such as lidar.
This paper documents the development of a proposed AI-based (artificial
intelligence) navigation algorithm intending to mature the use of on-board
visible wavelength cameras as a main sensor for docking and on-orbit servicing
(OOS), reducing the dependency on lidar and greatly reducing costs.
Specifically, the use of AI enables the expansion of the relative navigation
solution towards multiple classes of scenarios, e.g., in terms of targets or
illumination conditions, which would otherwise have to be crafted on a
case-by-case manner using classical image processing methods. Multiple
convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone architectures are benchmarked on
synthetically generated data of docking manoeuvres with the International Space
Station (ISS), achieving position and attitude estimates close to 1%
range-normalised and 1 deg, respectively. The integration of the solution with
a physical prototype of the refuelling mechanism is validated in laboratory
using a robotic arm to simulate a berthing procedure.]]></summary>

recent years, most developed methods rely on the assumption that the training
and test data have similar distributions. In the presence of distribution
shifts, fair models may behave unfairly on test data. There have been some
developments for fair learning robust to distribution shifts to address this
shortcoming. However, most proposed solutions are based on the assumption of
having access to the causal graph describing the interaction of different
features. Moreover, existing algorithms require full access to data and cannot
be used when small batches are used (stochastic/batch implementation). This
paper proposes the first stochastic distributionally robust fairness framework
with convergence guarantees that do not require knowledge of the causal graph.
More specifically, we formulate the fair inference in the presence of the
distribution shift as a distributionally robust optimization problem under
$L_p$ norm uncertainty sets with respect to the Exponential Renyi Mutual
Information (ERMI) as the measure of fairness violation. We then discuss how
the proposed method can be implemented in a stochastic fashion. We have
evaluated the presented framework's performance and efficiency through

particularly in the context of social media platforms, where the goal is to
maximize user engagement and revenue while maintaining a satisfactory user
experience. This requires the optimization of conflicting objectives, such as
user satisfaction and ads revenue. Traditional approaches to ad-load balancing
rely on static allocation policies, which fail to adapt to changing user
preferences and contextual factors. In this paper, we present an approach that
leverages off-policy learning and evaluation from logged bandit feedback. We
start by presenting a motivating analysis of the ad-load balancing problem,
highlighting the conflicting objectives between user satisfaction and ads
revenue. We emphasize the nuances that arise due to user heterogeneity and the
dependence on the user's position within a session. Based on this analysis, we
define the problem as determining the optimal ad-load for a particular feed
fetch. To tackle this problem, we propose an off-policy learning framework that
leverages unbiased estimators such as Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) and
Doubly Robust (DR) to learn and estimate the policy values using offline
collected stochastic data. We present insights from online A/B experiments
deployed at scale across over 80 million users generating over 200 million
sessions, where we find statistically significant improvements in both user
satisfaction metrics and ads revenue for the platform.]]></summary>

platforms, users are becoming more concerned about their privacy. And
recommender system is the core component of online platforms for providing
personalized service, consequently, its privacy preservation has attracted
great attention. As the gold standard of privacy protection, differential
privacy has been widely adopted to preserve privacy in recommender systems.
However, existing differentially private recommender systems only consider
static and independent interactions, so they cannot apply to sequential
recommendation where behaviors are dynamic and dependent. Meanwhile, little
attention has been paid on the privacy risk of sensitive user features, most of
them only protect user feedbacks. In this work, we propose a novel
DIfferentially Private Sequential recommendation framework with a noisy Graph
Neural Network approach (denoted as DIPSGNN) to address these limitations. To
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to achieve differential privacy in
sequential recommendation with dependent interactions. Specifically, in
DIPSGNN, we first leverage piecewise mechanism to protect sensitive user
features. Then, we innovatively add calibrated noise into aggregation step of
graph neural network based on aggregation perturbation mechanism. And this
noisy graph neural network can protect sequentially dependent interactions and
capture user preferences simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our method over state-of-the-art differentially private
recommender systems in terms of better balance between privacy and accuracy.]]></summary>

revolutionized generative modeling, enabling high-quality image generation
tailored to user needs. This paper proposes a framework for the generative
design of structural components. Specifically, we employ a Latent Diffusion
model to generate potential designs of a component that can satisfy a set of
problem-specific loading conditions. One of the distinct advantages our
approach offers over other generative approaches, such as generative
adversarial networks (GANs), is that it permits the editing of existing
designs. We train our model using a dataset of geometries obtained from
structural topology optimization utilizing the SIMP algorithm. Consequently,
our framework generates inherently near-optimal designs. Our work presents
quantitative results that support the structural performance of the generated
designs and the variability in potential candidate designs. Furthermore, we
provide evidence of the scalability of our framework by operating over voxel
domains with resolutions varying from $32^3$ to $128^3$. Our framework can be
used as a starting point for generating novel near-optimal designs similar to
topology-optimized designs.]]></summary>

approach for the Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance, which has an intractable
expectation in its analytical form. However, the MC method is not optimal in
terms of minimizing the absolute approximation error. To provide a better class
of empirical SW, we propose quasi-sliced Wasserstein (QSW) approximations that
rely on Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. For a comprehensive investigation of
QMC for SW, we focus on the 3D setting, specifically computing the SW between
probability measures in three dimensions. In greater detail, we empirically
verify various ways of constructing QMC points sets on the 3D unit-hypersphere,
including Gaussian-based mapping, equal area mapping, generalized spiral
points, and optimizing discrepancy energies. Furthermore, to obtain an unbiased
estimation for stochastic optimization, we extend QSW into Randomized
Quasi-Sliced Wasserstein (RQSW) by introducing randomness to the discussed
low-discrepancy sequences. For theoretical properties, we prove the asymptotic
convergence of QSW and the unbiasedness of RQSW. Finally, we conduct
experiments on various 3D tasks, such as point-cloud comparison, point-cloud
interpolation, image style transfer, and training deep point-cloud
autoencoders, to demonstrate the favorable performance of the proposed QSW and
RQSW variants.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We demonstrate the first algorithms for the problem of regression for
generalized linear models (GLMs) in the presence of additive oblivious noise.
We assume we have sample access to examples $(x, y)$ where $y$ is a noisy
measurement of $g(w^* \cdot x)$. In particular, \new{the noisy labels are of
the form} $y = g(w^* \cdot x) + \xi + \epsilon$, where $\xi$ is the oblivious
noise drawn independently of $x$ \new{and satisfies} $\Pr[\xi = 0] \geq o(1)$,
and $\epsilon \sim \mathcal N(0, \sigma^2)$. Our goal is to accurately recover
a \new{parameter vector $w$ such that the} function $g(w \cdot x)$ \new{has}
arbitrarily small error when compared to the true values $g(w^* \cdot x)$,
rather than the noisy measurements $y$.

We present an algorithm that tackles \new{this} problem in its most general
distribution-independent setting, where the solution may not \new{even} be
identifiable. \new{Our} algorithm returns \new{an accurate estimate of} the
solution if it is identifiable, and otherwise returns a small list of
candidates, one of which is close to the true solution. Furthermore, we
\new{provide} a necessary and sufficient condition for identifiability, which
holds in broad settings. \new{Specifically,} the problem is identifiable when
the quantile at which $\xi + \epsilon = 0$ is known, or when the family of
hypotheses does not contain candidates that are nearly equal to a translated
$g(w^* \cdot x) + A$ for some real number $A$, while also having large error
when compared to $g(w^* \cdot x)$.

This is the first \new{algorithmic} result for GLM regression \new{with
oblivious noise} which can handle more than half the samples being arbitrarily
corrupted. Prior work focused largely on the setting of linear regression, and
gave algorithms under restrictive assumptions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Modern deep networks are trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) whose
key parameters are the number of data considered at each step or batch size
$B$, and the step size or learning rate $\eta$. For small $B$ and large $\eta$,
SGD corresponds to a stochastic evolution of the parameters, whose noise
amplitude is governed by the `temperature' $T\equiv \eta/B$. Yet this
description is observed to break down for sufficiently large batches $B\geq
B^*$, or simplifies to gradient descent (GD) when the temperature is
sufficiently small. Understanding where these cross-overs take place remains a
central challenge. Here we resolve these questions for a teacher-student
perceptron classification model, and show empirically that our key predictions
still apply to deep networks. Specifically, we obtain a phase diagram in the
$B$-$\eta$ plane that separates three dynamical phases: $\textit{(i)}$ a
noise-dominated SGD governed by temperature, $\textit{(ii)}$ a
large-first-step-dominated SGD and $\textit{(iii)}$ GD. These different phases
also corresponds to different regimes of generalization error. Remarkably, our
analysis reveals that the batch size $B^*$ separating regimes $\textit{(i)}$
and $\textit{(ii)}$ scale with the size $P$ of the training set, with an
exponent that characterizes the hardness of the classification problem.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are widely used explainable-by-design
models in various applications. GAMs assume that the output can be represented
as a sum of univariate functions, referred to as components. However, this
assumption fails in ML problems where the output depends on multiple features
simultaneously. In these cases, GAMs fail to capture the interaction terms of
the underlying function, leading to subpar accuracy. To (partially) address
this issue, we propose Regionally Additive Models (RAMs), a novel class of
explainable-by-design models. RAMs identify subregions within the feature space
where interactions are minimized. Within these regions, it is more accurate to
express the output as a sum of univariate functions (components). Consequently,
RAMs fit one component per subregion of each feature instead of one component
per feature. This approach yields a more expressive model compared to GAMs
while retaining interpretability. The RAM framework consists of three steps.
Firstly, we train a black-box model. Secondly, using Regional Effect Plots, we
identify subregions where the black-box model exhibits near-local additivity.
Lastly, we fit a GAM component for each identified subregion. We validate the
effectiveness of RAMs through experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets. The results confirm that RAMs offer improved expressiveness compared
to GAMs while maintaining interpretability.]]></summary>

Relying on Stone-Weierstrass theorems on weighted spaces, we can prove a global
universal approximation result for generalizations of continuous functions
going beyond the usual approximation on compact sets. This then applies in
particular to approximation of (non-anticipative) path space functionals via
functional input neural networks. As a further application of the weighted
Stone-Weierstrass theorem we prove a global universal approximation result for
linear functions of the signature. We also introduce the viewpoint of Gaussian
process regression in this setting and show that the reproducing kernel Hilbert
space of the signature kernels are Cameron-Martin spaces of certain Gaussian

kernel regression.]]></summary>

 When I take a prerecorded voice clip and feed it through the voice profile I created, it’s just silent for all 15 seconds that it grants you before you upgrade.
 Then it has the little 2 second audio watermark at the end, where it says “voice AI,” and that I can hear perfectly fine!
 I’ve searched all over for others who might have had this problem, but it seems like the main problem people have reported difficulties with audio are/were tend to center around the live mode failing to function properly.
 Has anyone had this issue before?
 Should I add more audio to the voice profile to make it more well rounded perhaps?
 If so, how much audio do you typically need to create a solid custom voice profile?
 Should I just update to the paid version? I don’t really think that would fix it, and I wanted to wait to upgrade until I had some proof that it worked, yanno?
 I’m not sure what to do…
 Any ideas?

 I am re-reading the LoRA paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) to get a deeper understanding of some of the analysis the authors perform at the end and saw this line
  
Note that the relationship between model size and the optimal rank for adaptation is still an open question. 
  
Does anybody know of any resources out there that looked into this question, given that LoRA has been around for a little bit now? Perhaps someone has performed similar subspace overlap / optimal "r" value studies on some of the LLMs that fall in-between GPT2 and 3, i.e. some of the ~7B, ~15B, ~40B and ~70B models?

 I've been diving deep into the world of neural networks, and recently, I've been particularly intrigued by the dynamicity of attention head parameters (weights). These weights play a crucial role in transformers, and understanding how they change during training and inference can provide valuable insights into model behavior. 
 The question is, what does dynamic mean in this context? Is it input-adaptive? Do weights change at inference time according to inputs? 
 I have a hard time understanding this concept, for me, weights are static and pre-established at training time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As AI models get bigger, training them requires more and more computing power. Researchers are looking for ways to train these large AI models without needing Google-scale resources.
 A new paper proposes LongLoRA, a fine-tuning approach that can extend LLaMA2 7B to 100k context length and 70B model to 32k context length on a single 8× A100 machine.
 Here are my highlights from the paper:
 Big one of course: LongLoRA efficiently fine-tunes large AI models on longer texts
 Key points:
  
Approximates standard attention via "shift short attention" during training
 Tuning only a subset of weights (LoRA) plus some embeddings & norms
 Fine-tuned 7B parameter model on 100k tokens with 1 machine
 Way lower training cost than full fine-tuning for large contexts
 Close to full fine-tuning performance
  
The core insight is that an approximation of full attention enables efficient training while retaining standard attention for final inference. Combined with selective weight tuning, this really reduces compute needs.
 I think this demonstrates the potential to train more capable AI without unreasonable resources. Efficient training techniques = more powerful LLMs for the same resources.
 Full summary here.

Each program has its own duration. Say Program A last for 50 minutes, Program B is 30 minutes, etc.
 Each project manager has qualifications on what program he/she can handle. This constraint is a hard constraint.
 Time slots start from 6AM to 6PM. This means that if Program A which lasts for 30 minutes is assigned to start at 6:00AM, then it will end at 6:30AM. Only one program can be assigned in each station, so there should be no overlap in programs in terms of day and time per station.

 Last week I saw a LinkedIn article on anomaly detection. In that post, Tail movement of a running mice on rotating rod ( roller) is captured with CV and plotted as a time series. Then based on the tail movement time series , anomalities in that time series are detected where mice loose the balance in rotating rod. 
 I am trying to find this post in linkedIn but still didnt able get any clue. If you have seen this research article or have any clue please let me know. It will be great help. Appriciate you time and help.Thank You very much ! ❤️

 RNN is thought to be non-parallelizable because of its inherent sequential nature: its state depends on its previous state. This makes training RNN for long sequence usually takes long time compared to other architecture classes (like CNN).
 What we present is an algorithm based on Newton's method to evaluate and train RNN in parallel. In one of our experiment, we can achieve >1000x faster evaluation of a small GRU compared to common sequential method on a very long sequence. Training RNNs with our algorithm could also be more than 10x faster than training with sequential method.
 However, it's not without flaws. There are 2 major drawbacks we noticed: non-convergence and sca…]]></summary>

 I'm a newbie for the domain of reinforcement learning (RL). My main research on various software systems, mainly on multi-agent system (MAS). AAMAS, a conference focusing on Multi-agent system, I think is the good conference to study in MAS. Recently, there are many researchers for MAS that is great combination with reinforecement learning to do some interesting things. Also, game theory is a
 interesting knowledge what I'm curious about how to do within RL and agents.
 Does any recommended conference or journal for RL? don't mind for just only RL algorithm, that's enough great, whereas I prefer to the conference concerning RL applied some software system for some problem.
 Thanks all.

 Briefly their idea for self-supervised learning is to reconstruct a corrupted image (e.g., random masking) using Langevin step of a learned energy function and the reconstructed image is compared to the clean image for supervision.
 i.e.,
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/q9e1pd9yarpb1.png?width=953&format=png&auto=webp&s=528e654d3ae4db1435aa3c11e5edc787876fd9ac
 This should work because going along the decreasing energy value ensures that corrupted images have high energy and clean images have low energy.
 Everything made sense to me until I tried to implement it.
 ​
 In order to optimize the parameters (\theta), we have to take the gradient of the loss w.r.t \theta and by the chain the chain rule we will compute the gradient of the reconstructed x (\tilde x) w.r.t \theta.
 ​

 Is this even correct? What am I even talking about I am confused.
 Anyways ...
 They provided the following PyTorch pseudocode and I have provided the actual PyTorch code.
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/m4wd7pq2frpb1.png?width=1266&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5febf258f0c92fc90116a996367b605cd597128
 Actually the model parameters never change no matter what what the values of step size (alpha) or the learning rate are.
 I am missing something?

Large language models (LLMs) have enabled a new data-efficient learning paradigm wherein they can be used to solve unseen new tasks via zero-shot or few-shot prompting. However, LLMs are challenging to deploy for real-world applications due to their sheer size. For instance, serving a single 175 billion LLM requires at least 350GB of GPU memory using specialized infrastructure, not to mention that today's state-of-the-art LLMs are composed of over 500 billion parameters. Such computational requirements are inaccessible for many research teams, especially for applications that require low latency performance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Copyright Office has ruled that AI-generated art cannot be copyrighted, raising questions about whether AI-generated art should be excluded from copyright protection.
 
The Copyright Office argues that AI-generated art is a 'merely mechanical' process with no novelty, invention, or originality, and therefore does not deserve copyright protection.
 
Critics, however, argue that this approach is not scalable and fails to consider the creative choices made by AI artists.
 
They suggest that AI-generated art should be treated similarly to photography, where even though the image is captured mechanically, it still reflects the creative choices of the photographer and is eligible for copyright protection.
 
Photographers are able to own the copyright in their photographs because they make creative judgments about where to point the camera, when to snap the image, and how to adjust camera settings.
 
Similarly, AI artists explore the 'latent space' of images that AI software can produce, making creative judgments about which images to select and explore.
 
While the actual image is produced by the software, the important point is that a human being is making creative decisions about the art.
 
Therefore, critics argue that AI-generated art should be eligible for copyright protection, as it reflects the creative choices and judgments of the AI artist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi world
 I'm trying to implement dqn and ddqn on various playgrounds with Matlab, from scratch. I use dqn and ddqn with replay buffer. I tried to used gradient clipping. But I find it very difficult to tune.
 I mean I tuned and programmed successfully various algorithm such as different GAN that are not necessarily very easy to tune. RL algorithm seems even worse.
 I tried several grid world problems, cart pole and even a very simple second order system regulation (integrator + 1 st order pôle). 
 Even the Matlab cart pole demo with ddqn does not provide a very satisfactory result (after training, the contrôler keep the pendulum in uprigth position, but the cart slowly drift).
 On the second order system, the learning seems ok for about 200 épisode(test shows that the expected behavior is almost learnt) and then suddenly the average episode score has a kind of inflection and everything blowns up, despite a very large replay buffer.
 So my question : is it possible to make dqn and ddqn work well with a reasonable tuning session length? Are policy optimization easier to tune (and/or more efficient)? So far, it seems to me that these action-vzlue based algorithms are highly unstable and the training may only works for a 'miraculous' tunning. What are you thought?

 The irony here is that I mostly agree with this theory - but the article reflects how little we really know about consciousness and how it works, and how what's considered the "expert opinion" that AI can't possess consciousness is arguably influenced more by popularity than real empirical evidence.
 By whatever mechanism, they can respond to their treatment in unexpectedly humanlike ways. 
 Oh, and by the way, did you think that "sentient Bing" was finally dead? Think again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there,
 I'll provide a quick introduction first. I am a mechatronics engineer student who is graduating this semester, I have been also privately studying ML, DL, CV for the past year because that's when I decided that I want to make an autonomous drone as my thesis/graduation project and oh my god, little did I know. I have aquired so much knowledge in the data science field and truth be told I love it, it engages my mind like crazy so I've decided that i would like my career to be revolved around electronics and programming/ data science.
 Back to the topic, I am working on object detection (I got it figured out), and reinforcement learning, so what I would like to do is to train the model on reaching it's destination using collision avoidance, I have a PIX4, RPI 4B 4GBs since I'm also building my drone from scratch, so let's say I have all the hardware which ofcourse includes the GPS + Compass and 5 ultrasonic sensors, 1 at each side and 1 down to hold the altitude accurately. I was thinking of HITL, making a virtual environment to train my model there because this is what logic says, ofcourse( I could also fly it using the RC controller and for example test if the obstacle avoidance is going to overrule the manual drive, which is also my objective). The question is: how can I make sure virtual drone is going to be equipped with the real-life sensors and in the needed positions? How can I feed all the sensors data during the training? Which type of reinforcement learning models should I implement? 
 I just feel like I dragged myself into an incredibly amazing and complex project which is going to end up fucking my semester and I won't be able to graduate, it's just that my stress now is skyrocketing. 
 Please feel free to throw any advice or opinions my way, and thank you for keeping up with this long post. 😁

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are happy to share with you BlindChat, the open-source and privacy-by-design alternative to ChatGPT for a fully in-browser, yet private, Conversational AI!
 You can play with it on our Gradio demo.
 Our philosophy is that Conversational AI should be easily accessible, and privacy should not be a luxury but a given.
 By leveraging local models running in the browser, with transformers.js, we make it possible to have a fully transparent and private AI that works on your browser without any extra setup. Because all the logic is offloaded to users’ devices, data never leaves and there is no risk of it being used for finetuning by third parties.
 For now, we only support inference with LaMini-Flan-T5, so you might see modest performance. We plan to integrate Microsoft phi-1.5 for better performance once the 370M is out.
 We are also working on LlamaIndex-TS integration on the client side to have in-browser RAG for local querying of private documents.
 As our roadmap is quite dense, with RAG, internet search, improved inference, we welcome warmly contributors! If you want to contribute, or have questions, ping us on Discord and GitHub!

 I read the new paper from DeepMind so you don't have to. Here are the key highlights:
  
Despite training on text, langauge models compressed images 43% better than PNG, and audio nearly 2x better than flac.
 Confirmation of scaling laws - bigger models compressed better. But model size must match dataset size.
 There are tradeoffs between model scale, data size, and compression performance. More data enables bigger models.
 Tokenization (like BPE) generally hurts compression slightly by making prediction harder.
 Longer contexts let models exploit more sequential dependencies.
  
Implications:
  
Models have learned very general capabilities beyond just text. Their strong compression reflects deep understanding of images, audio etc statistically.
 I got some new perspective on model scaling laws and links between prediction and generalization.
 There's potential for practical applications compressing images, video etc. But large model size an issue.
 Overall it shows these models are very capable general purpose learners, not just for language.

 At its core, Prompt Engineering is all about commanding the conversation with AI. Wanna write a poem, draft a project plan, or break down complex scientific terms? The right prompt can do that for you. If you want to learn more about Prompt Engineering feel free to join r/PromptWizards.
 Let's dive into some Prompt Engineering concepts:
 Let's start with the basics:
  
Reductive operations: These yield responses that are smaller in size than the input prompt. Essentially, they distill information. 
 Example: If the input prompt is a long article, and the task is to provide a summary, the operation used is reductive as the output (summary) is smaller than the input (the entire article).
 
 Transformational operations: These make sure the output maintains a relative balance w…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been playing around with transformers since following Karpathy's shakespeare model on youtube and found it really cool. Thought I should write a Tree-of-Thoughts model as my next project which will be somewhat similar, given what we're doing is learning the meaning behind words and phrases and then using that knowledge to generate a sequence based on a seed token or sequence of tokens.
 Here's how I was thinking it should go: I write a next token in sequence prediction model and write a generate function that generates a sequence of tokens on top of a seed token. Then I write a tree model that takes in whatever this bigram has learned and adds onto it some kind of knowledge about where one thought about the seed has been generated and stop there. Then iteratively generate a few more such thoughts based on the same seed.
 This is how I initially thought it would go but now when I'm writing, I've already written the bigram(next token prediction and generation), I don't know what to do next. I am kind of stuck.
 It will be interesting to see how you, if you've ever written a similar model or are good at NLP, would attempt this. Looking at a variety of different approaches to the same problem I am trying to solve would be great.
 So I decided to post here. Would be great to hear from you guys!

 GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke spoke on stage at TC Disrupt today and made several statements regarding the development of artificial intelligence and programming:
  
Dohmke believes that AI won't replace software developers but will make them more efficient.
 Despite AI advancements, the demand for software developers will continue to exceed the supply.
 The growth in software usage is expected to be exponential, with every company becoming a software company.
 Legacy code maintenance remains crucial, especially in industries like finance with outdated codebases.
 Generative AI is creating more demand for technical talent as companies seek to adopt innovative AI solutions.
 There is a shortage of computer science students, leading to increased demand for developers with AI skills.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone
 I have a doubt regarding GANs for tabular data, more specifically for time-series generation. Looking at the TimeGAN paper (code) and other implementations such as the one by YData, considering that the training dataset is divided into slices (like a rolling window) of N length and that the generated sequence will follow the same format, that is [batch size, N, n_features], what we are effectively generating are slices and not a fully synthetic time-series.
 ​
 To clarify my question, the output of a TimeGAN is only a set of slices, although there is no guarantee that generated slice(N-1) is the one before slice(N), and so the true use of a TimeGAN is generating slices that can be used to train a predictive TS model but not reconstructing a complete time series like the one used for training.
 ​
 I suspect that's the case (useful only to generate good slices for training predictive models) as there is no fully generated time series in the paper or any of the codes, while the quality of the generated data is partially measured by training a model on original data and generated data and comparing their predictive performance. If anyone can confirm/develop upon these thoughts I would be extremely grateful.

 To my surprise, it not only worked efficiently but also took only a few minutes for fine-tuning. The best part is its adaptability. You can easily switch it up for different image classes.
 Maybe you like it. Let me know what you think or if you have any suggestions to improve!
 Install with
 pip install renumics-spotlight sliceguard[all] 
 Imports
 from renumics import spotlight from sliceguard.data import create_imagedataset_from_bing from sliceguard.models.huggingface import finetune_image_classifier, generate_image_pred_probs_embeddings from sliceguard.embeddings import generate_image_embeddings 
 ​
 Create an Image Dataset from Bing
 class_names = [ "Blue Tang", "Clownfish", "Spotted Eagle Ray", "Longnose Butterfly Fish", "Moorish Idol", "Royal Gramma Fish", ] df = create_imagedataset_from_bing( class_names, 25, "data", test_split=0.2, license="Free to share and use" ) 
 Fine-tune a ViT Model with the data (in 1-2 minutes on a GPU)
 finetune_image_classifier( df[df["split"] == "train"], model_name="google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k", output_model_folder="./model_folder", epochs=15, ) 
 Enrich the DataFrame with Predictions, Probabilities and Embeddings and visualize it:
 df["prediction"], df["probs"], df["embeddings"] = generate_image_pred_probs_embeddings( df["image"].values, model_name="./model_folder" ) # Check the result and detect problematic clusters spotlight.show( df, layout="https://spotlight.renumics.com/resources/image_classification_v1.0.json" )

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[75% of Americans believe that AI will decrease the total number of jobs in the next 10 years, according to a survey by Bentley-Gallup Business in Society study.
 
Younger Americans are less pessimistic about AI compared to older age groups.
 
Majorities believe that AI performs as well as or better than humans in customizing online content, recommending products or services, and assisting students with coursework.
 
However, Americans are skeptical about AI's ability to recommend employees, its self-driving capabilities, and its ability to recommend medical advice.
 
79% of Americans have little trust in businesses to use AI responsibly.
 
40% of Americans think AI does more harm than good, while only 10% believe it contributes more good than harm.
 
Black and Asian Americans have a more positive view of AI's impact on society compared to Hispanic and White Americans.
 
While most Americans are wary of AI's impact on the job market, younger people are more optimistic about its future.
 
Businesses need to affirm their commitment to using AI responsibly and address the knowledge deficit and lack of confidence among Americans.

 This technique has been implemented into catboost. My question is why hasn't this been implemented into xgboost? The technique looks easily applicable but I would have expected it to be implemented already as it is 2 years old.
 Is this for some reason not applicable to Xgboost?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to build intuition on why the actor update equation actually help the actor improving its policy. From what I understand, the update is proportional to the Critic's TD error. A better than expected reward will lead the actor to increase the prob of taking the associated action, and a disappointing reward will make the actor to move away from the given action.
 Here's where I feel like I'm missing a piece of the puzzle. Between a good state/action pair accurately valued by the Critic and a bad state/action pair undervalued by the Critic, the actor's update will favor the bad action more. Could we not conceive a scenario in which the agent gets stuck in a suboptimal policy because of that particular behavior?
 What triggers this questioning is that I have implemented a standard AC algo for Pixelcopter and found my agent getting stuck easily on a suboptimal policy (i.e. constantly getting higher, or lower until crash, while the critics assign good values on center squares and bad values to squares close to the wall's edge). For TD0, this is pretty marginal, but gets more significant for n-step TD as n increases.
 Any thoughts?

 No need to be a prompt engineering grand master - DALL-E 3 enables you to use the ChatGPT conversational interface to improve the images you generate. This means that if you didn't like what it produced, you can simply talk with ChatGPT and ask for the changes you'd like to make. This removes the complexity associated with prompt engineering, which requires you to iterate over the prompt.
 Majure improvement in the quality of products compared to DALL-E 2. This is a very vague statement provided by OpenAI, which is also hard to measure, but personally, they haven't failed me so far, so I'm really excited to see the results.

 One of the most time-resources-energy-consuming tasks we face when we build internal projects is setting up an instance for ML training.
 It's a repetitive process as we run multiple experiments over the project life cycle, with many steps and configurations that are usually documented poorly and scattered around different places.
 As good engineers, we decided to automate the process using CI/CD pipelines. 
 But how?
 We had ZERO ideas on how to do it, so we had to go through the rigorous process of using AWS guides and tutorials to figure it out.
 Usually, when this happens, we extend the project lifecycle and have a team member document the process so we can refer back to it when we need to do it again.
 Knowing this can benefit the community, we decided to share a series of blogs that guide you through building CI/CD pipelines for continuous training with AWS SageMaker.
 We published the first blog, which covers the configuration part a month ago, and we are happy to share the second one which explains how to build a continuous training pipeline for ML.

 How to build CI/CD pipeline with AWS SageMaker for ML training: https://dagshub.com/blog/ci-cd-for-continuous-training-with-sagemaker/
 I'm sure we can improve these tutorials, and would love to learn from your experience on how we can do it! 🤗

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi redditors!
 I've been tasked with an technical homework that asks me to "productionize" a Jupyter notebook. The notebook's workflow is as follows:
  
Reads data from a CSV.
 Pre-processes the data.
 Trains a machine learning model.
 Makes predictions.
  
My initial thoughts are:
  
Separation of Concerns: Break the notebook down into distinct components - data processing, model training, and inference.
 Containerization: Write a Dockerfile to ensure the environment is reproducible and isolated.
 API for Prediction: Set up a Flask-based service to expose the model's prediction capability.
  
However, I'm grappling with a few challenges:
  
I'm not seeing a stark difference between the Jupyter notebook setup and the production setting. Becuase the model is small and training is not complicated. If I were to deploy to Kubernetes pods, it seems wasteful that many pods are doing the same thing( prediction for the same model, maybe just as high availability guarantee?) .
 Does the training phrase or data cleansing phase need to be containerized and deployed? Because this seems like a one-off process.
 How to deploy a scalable service? I am new to this. Each container may have a HTTP service. How to load balance them on Kubernetes from outside?
 What kind of CI/CD do you recommend for this task? What kind of testing or pipeline are needed?

 I mainly code in python with AI and deep learning as a core focus and recently started doing a bit of c++ and thus far have used only bard and ChatGPT 3.5. With this experience of my I can confidently say that GPT outperforms Bard by a huge margin
 There are usually some minor modifications that need to be done and that is part of a devs life isn't it? recently a lot of new models are picking up steam hence was wondering if there exits a model which is better than GPT
 what are your views?

 Abstract:
  
Event cameras offer many advantages over standard cameras due to their distinctive principle of operation: low power, low latency, high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. Nonetheless, the success of many downstream visual applications also hinges on an efficient and effective scene representation, where Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is seen as the leading candidate. Such promise and potential of event cameras and NeRF inspired recent works to investigate on the reconstruction of NeRF from moving event cameras. However, these works are mainly limited in terms of the dependence on dense and low-noise event streams, as well as generalization to arbitrary contrast threshold values and camera speed profiles. In this work, we propose Robust e-NeRF, a novel method to directly and robustly reconstruct NeRFs from moving event cameras under various real-world conditions, especially from sparse and noisy events generated under non-uniform motion. It consists of two key components: a realistic event generation model that accounts for various intrinsic parameters (e.g. time-independent, asymmetric threshold and refractory period) and non-idealities (e.g. pixel-to-pixel threshold variation), as well as a complementary pair of normalized reconstruction losses that can effectively generalize to arbitrary speed profiles and intrinsic parameter values without such prior knowledge. Experiments on real and novel realistically simulated sequences verify our effectiveness. Our code, synthetic dataset and improved event simulator are public.

 I am trying to tune a second order Transfer Function to fit X to Y( has 3 parameters) and gives Y’ as output.
 So I currently consider the error between Y and Y’ as the “State” and try to minimise the error by modelling a reward function that checks for instability and unreasonable values. I am trying to do this using TD3 but the model does not learn. I am wondering if there are any approaches that I should consider.
 I chose TD3 since my action space is continuous. 
 I am sorry if I don’t understand something basic since I’m a noob to this. Thanks for your help in advance. :) 
 Some more details: the dataset values don’t change. I give the same values for every time step. So I am not understanding how episodes and time steps work in this context.

 I hope this webinar finds you well. I suppose that this topic can be interesting for business and AI engineers.
 Speakers: OpenCV CEO Dr. Satya Mallick and Phil Nelson are joined by Anna Kogan CEO at OpenCV.ai
 Topics of webinar are:
  
How to search for vendors that understand your business needs (not all AI is the same.)
 What questions to ask when picking a vendor (not everybody really is an AI expert they claim)
 Three signs to watch for during the project (progress indicators and red-flags)
 How best to scope technical tasks (off-the-shelf vs. custom algorithm development)
 How to set up for long-term success (deployment, documentation, training pipeline)
  
Date: Thursday, September 21st, 2023 at 9am Pacific time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The paper introduces improved performance by prompting LLMs with "natural language embedded programs (NLEP)". No task-specific prompt is needed.
 Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10814 
 An automatic NLEP generation toolkit is opensourced: https://github.com/luohongyin/langcode
 Example Colab notebook is included in the Github repo.
 This work introduces the following features of NLEP:
  
NLEP is a full python program that prints the target response of LLMs.
 
Task-general NLEP prompting outperforms task-specific chain-of-thought prompting on math, symbolic, and natural language.
 
Enable the chain-of-thought reasoning ability of small models (RoBERTa) on text classification
 
Hierarchical instructing via program completion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am reading the following article on SpinningUp but can't get my head around policy collapse - 
 "This is different from normal policy gradient, which keeps new and old policies close in parameter space. But even seemingly small differences in parameter space can have very large differences in performance—so a single bad step can collapse the policy performance. This makes it dangerous to use large step sizes with vanilla policy gradients, thus hurting its sample efficiency. TRPO nicely avoids this kind of collapse, and tends to quickly and monotonically improve performance." 
 Why would updating the parameters lead to a policy collapse? The parameters are updated based on the performance of the RL system and therefore, I don't see the point of constraints.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m working on a project where I initially split my dataset into k equally sized folds for cross-validation. However, I want to perform some additional sampling operations on the training set within each fold, which would result in varying fold sizes.
 Is this practice acceptable, or does it violate the premises of traditional cross-validation? If so, are there any papers or resources that explore the implications of varying fold sizes in cross-validation?
 Thank you for your insights!

 There is so much noise in the reviews every year. Some good work that the authors are proud of might get rejected because of the noisy system, given that NeurIPS is growing so large these years. We should keep in mind that the work is still valuable no matter what the final result is.

I employed a two-stream architecture, where one is a Transformer that takes in a sequence of skeleton trajectory, and the latter is a pre-trained Vision Transformer. When I train the model, and investigate the attention weights for the Transformer which takes in skeleton trajectories, I noticed that all of them are approximately the same (~0.029). I'm not really sure what is going on here, I've tried changing the learning rate, tried different optimizers(SGD, Adam). But still I'm not really sure what is causing this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder of DeepMind, believes that concerns about the existential risks of AI are a distraction from more practical issues such as privacy and bias.
 
He is confident that governments can effectively regulate AI using frameworks that have been successful in the past, citing the regulation of aviation and the internet as examples.
 
Suleyman emphasizes the importance of setting boundaries and limits for AI to ensure human oversight and enforceable laws.
 
He calls for a combination of broad, international regulation and smaller, more granular policies at the micro level.
 
Suleyman suggests limiting AI's ability to improve itself as a critical first step in ensuring human oversight.
 
He also highlights the need for governments to have direct access to AI developers to enforce boundaries and establish clear regulations.
 
Governments worldwide, including the European Union and China, are already working on AI regulations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using ppo action masking in sb3, which works well in training and masking the illegal / invalid actions according to my criteria. However, I have 2 problems during testing.
 ​
  
I use the same code for masking the actions in testing too since the model was unable to learn by itself during training action masking criteria and when enforcing it in code, it still doesn't mask anything.
  
​
  
The model converges to just one action in testing phase after 500k steps, the episode reward still increasing the training phase though. I don't know why? maybe overfitting!
  
Code for training with action masking:
 def mask_fn(env: gym.Env) -> np.ndarray:
 return env.valid_action_mask()
 env = StockEnv(train)
 # Wrap the environment with ActionMasker and the mask_fn function
 env = ActionMasker(env, mask_fn)
 model = MaskablePPO(MaskableActorCriticPolicy, env, tensorboard_log="./tensorboard" ,n_steps=2048 )
 for i in range (1,52):
 model.learn(total_timesteps=TIMESTEPS , tb_log_name = 'PPO2' , reset_num_timesteps=False)
 Code for testing with action masking:
 def mask_fn(env: gym.Env) -> np.ndarray:
 return env.valid_action_mask()
 env = ActionMasker(env, mask_fn)
 model_path = f"{models_dir}/700000.zip"
 model = MaskablePPO.load(model_path, env=env)
 episodes = 1
 for ep in range(episodes):
 obs = env.reset()
 done = False
 while not done:
 action, _states = model.predict(obs)
 obs, rewards, done, info = env.step(action)
 env.render()

 so now my basic setting is,i use the action mask to invalid some forbidden action. When a node is routing to the edge of the map,i give +10 reward,if it's not obey the clockwise rule,i give -200 reward, if the whole node is routed success,i give +200 reward,and each steps does'n make any node routed, i give -1 reward.
 I am new to this area,i don't know the way i set reward if is good,may i have some advide?

 To stay on top of the latest advancements in AI, look here first.
 https://preview.redd.it/s1ivsummzbpb1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8fc3262ba542b950de3c8a85b9a987763270ada
 Bard Extensions and Google Applications Integration
  
Bard can now tap into individualized data from Google apps such as Gmail, Drive, and Docs, with user permission.
 Google reassured users that personal data accessed by Bard will not be used for reinforcement learning, providing another on their transparency, choice, and control tenets.
 Prompts can direct Bard to search for specific information within Gmail, but it does not store the entire inbox content.
  
Collaborative Characteristics and Fact-Checking Capabilities
  
Users can employ Bard to summarize emails or gather trip details from email threads, and then research real-time travel information, surface YouTube recommendations for the destination, and provide Maps directions to the airport.
 Google's chatbot can also double-check its responses against Google search, improving user trust and enhancing Bard's model through user feedback on incorrect answers.
 The new extensions using non-personal data – YouTube, Flights, Hotels, and Maps – are automatically opted-in but users can choose to opt-out.
  
Collaboration and Language Availability
  
Bard now lets users share an ongoing chat with others through a public link.
 Google plans to expand Bard's feature set to over 40 new languages beyond its existing English language capabilities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all.
 I have been tinkering with a project to get quicker learning for CNNs. 
 The idea came after reading the SDProp paper. Algorithms using adaptive learning rate can be interpeted as muliplying the gradient(with or without momentum) with the inverse square-root of the covariance matrix. Using a diagonal estimate of the covariance matrix.
 Which begs the question: what happens if we use a fuller estimate? I chose to include covariances between the elements of convolutional filters. I.e. a conv.weight of size [n_out,n_in,5,5] needs a tensor of size [n_out,n_int,25,25] to store its contribution to the covariance matrix.
 for 3x3 filters and 5x5 filters, torch.linalg.eigh could be used to calculate the square root of the covariance matrices. For 7x7, I used newtons method to approximate the square root.
 In the figure below are some results for a 6 layer CNN on CIFAR 100. Huge gains iteration for iteration. But is it quicker? Not a lot. A bit for the smaller 3x3 filter. More optimizations could still be made. And it will obviously depend on network architecture and computer hardware. 
 I'm sure there could be some use-cases. The computation of the square-root calculations is invariant to batch_size and image_size (unless number of filters also is increased).
 If anyone is interested I can also link to my torch implementation of the optimizer, once I get it up on github.
 Not sure if this, or something like it, has been done before? Would love to have some papers linked if so...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I am currently working on a project where my team and I have collected a rich dataset of biomedical sensor data from clinical trials earlier this year. Our aim is to use this sensor data to predict changes in specific biomarkers over time. The data's tensor shape is B,T,F,C, where:
  
B = batch size
 T = sequence length
 F = sampled frequencies
 C = features at each frequency
  
Currently, my approach involves flattening this tensor to B,T,−1 and then feeding it to a transformer model. While this has yielded reasonable results, I'm contemplating whether there are more effective ways to prepare the data for the transformer model.
 Here are my specific concerns:
  
Flattening the tensor might dilute the information specific to each frequency across various features.
 I could potentially miss the chance to capture frequency-related variations within the features.
  
To address these, I've considered a few options:
  
Self-attention over individual features or frequencies: Although this could be effective, it might make the model too large given my medium-sized dataset.
 Using convolutional layers: Preliminary experiments with this approach have not led to any significant improvements.
  
I'm particularly interested in any thoughts on how to make my transformer more receptive to the multi-dimensional nature of my dataset. Increasing the number of attention heads to better accommodate all features is also on the table.
 Does anyone have any insights or can point me to relevant papers or codebases for handling such multi-dimensional data with transformers?
 Thank you for your help!

Self-supervised pre-training of language models usually consists in predicting probability distributions over extensive token vocabularies. In this study, we propose an innovative method that shifts away from probability prediction and instead focuses on reconstructing input embeddings in a contrastive fashion via Constrastive Weight Tying (CWT). We apply this approach to pretrain Headless Language Models in both monolingual and multilingual contexts. Our method offers practical advantages, substantially reducing training computational requirements by up to 20 times, while simultaneously enhancing downstream performance and data efficiency. We observe a significant +1.6 GLUE score increase and a notable +2.7 LAMBADA accuracy improvement compared to classical LMs within similar compute budgets.

The company suggests reevaluating the way datacenters are built to optimize them for AI.
 
The challenges include the need for liquid-cooled servers, higher voltage power distribution, and efficient heat rejection.
 
Schneider provides guidance on changes to power, cooling, rack configuration, and software management to mitigate the demands of AI adoption.
 
Liquid cooling is recommended for high-density racks, with direct liquid cooling favored over immersion cooling systems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 Let me preface this by saying that I am not well-versed in the ML/AI literature. Please excuse my ignorance.
 I am trying to create a system to detect whether some given data is spam or not. Is there a good, out-of-the-box solution for this? I imagine there would be. I am currently using heuristics but I'm wondering if there is a better, ML-y solution.
 My ideal solution would have the following attributes:
  
Simple
 Open-source
 Very cheap to test whether something is spam (less than $0.00001 per test)
 Very fast to test (less than 50ms per test)
 Quick to "figure out" what is spam and what is not (less than 100,000 labeled data)
 Does not require a lot of set-up or up-keep (less than 5 days set up; less than 1 hr up-keep per month)
  
It doesn't have to be perfect. I'm just looking to set up something quickly for now and gauge it vs heuristics.
 Thank you.
 ---
 Edit: To clarify, I'm looking for something I can ideally build myself with open source software. And not specifically email.
 Just looking for the right direction. Names of OSS, techniques, etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I read the Arxiv paper on CulturaX so you don't have to. Here's my highlights:
  
New open dataset called CulturaX contains text data for 167 languages - far more than previous datasets.
 With over 6 trillion words, it's the largest multilingual dataset ever released.
 Freely available for anyone to use for research and AI development.
 Created by combining and extensively cleaning two other large datasets - mC4 and OSCAR.
 Could allow developing AI systems that work much better across many more languages.
 Helps democratize access to data to build fairer, less biased AI models.
 Allows training of new multilingual AI applications, like universal translators and assistants.
 But still requires thoughtfulness to avoid issues like bias amplification.
  
Overall, CulturaX is going to be part of a broader global trend (I think) to advance multilingual AI and spread its benefits more equally. So far they've been concentrated in English-speaking applications.
 Full summary here if you'd like to read more. Original paper is here.

 Graduated under grad with Bachelor’s in CS. In school took a ton of stats, ai classes, algorithms classes, data science and linear algebra and did well but my school didn’t really use python or do a ton of programming for hw or exams. (Data science was the one class that used python)
 My programming is pretty good nonetheless. I currently work as a full stack devops engineer for a cybersecurity startup and regularly work with python, Django MySQL, etc on the backend and JavaScript and various frontend frameworks for the front end. 
 I really appreciate yall’s help.
 In particular I’m looking for good ai/ml/deep learning books that teach concepts and also teach with python code and have some coding projects. 
 Thank you!

 i intend to use large data samples,
 due to board limitations (ASRock Taichi X399 TR4, CPU: AMD Threadripper 1950x),
 i can either buy:
 2 x nVidia Tesla T4 (16G GDDR6 / 2560 CUDA / 0.585 GHz / ~800$)
 -- or --
 2 x nVidia Tesla M10 (4 x 8G GDDR5 / 2560 CUDA / 1.03 GHz / ~780$)
 -- or --
 4 x nVidia Tesla P40 (24G GDDR5X / 3840 CUDA / 3.5 GHz / ~120$)
 -- or --
 4 x nVidia Tesla K80 (2 x 12G GDDR5 / 4992 CUDA / 2.7 GHz / ~200$)
 -- or --
 1 x nVidia RTX 4080 (16G GDDR6X / 9728 CUDA / 2.51 GHz / ~1450$)
 i know that i will need to air vent the Tesla models, the question is what is faster for training time (i have read all the Tflops / OPS / int / 16float / 32float / 64float ... i got to admit it is all very confusing)
 what would you do and for what reason ?
 any advice will be appreciated

 I’m getting offered a 3090 for around 700 usd. However, I have to rebuild my entire PC which will end up costing 2-2.5K. I’m from Costa Rica so my KWh is around 0.23 usd. For me seems like a big investment, im not sure if im getting the desired returns.
 I was thinking about using cloud instances for my experiments. However, lambda labs is not yet available in my country. I’m not sure if there are any other options worthwhile considering. 
 Thanks :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/machinelearning community,
 I'm currently working on a project where I need to track and count specific features of objects using multiple monocular views with available intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. As an example, I'm interested in detecting and counting different graffiti instances in images of a kiosk.
 ​
 I've already tried various tracking algorithms, but they have struggled with the task due to the significant changes in perspective across the views. It has become apparent that simply relying on tracking without considering the camera positions is insufficient for accurate results. Therefore, I'm now exploring methods that take into account information about the camera positions and potentially use this data to improve feature tracking and counting. 
 ​
 If you have any knowledge of such methods, oresearch directions or if you're aware of resources, papers, or code implementations that tackle similar problems, I would greatly appreciate your insights and recommendations. Additionally, if you have any tips or best practices for handling such tasks in the context of machine learning, I'd love to hear them. 
 ​
 Thank you in advance for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI is poised to transform our world like never before. Scientific discoveries, technological improvements, and medical advancements will be how much of this change will take place.
 Since health is so important to our well-being, AI finding cures for illnesses like obesity, cancer, diabetes and heart disease will be a godsend to all. But curing diseases is not how medical AIs can help us the most. 
 It has been estimated that well over 50% of the illnesses we humans fall prey to result from our ethical choices. We eat too much, drink too much, eat too many animal foods, don't exercise enough and don't keep ourselves as emotionally healthy as we could.
 Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could respect our lives and our health enough to make the kinds of choices that keep us much healthier? That is how AI will probably be more helpful to us than in any other way. 
 We humans have not been able to figure out how to become better, more ethical, people because we are simply not intelligent enough to make that all-important change. Now consider an AI that is two or three times more intelligent than the most intelligent person who has ever lived. This could easily happen before 2030. Imagine that intelligence dedicated to the task of helping us all become better people. 
 These AIs would motivate us to make better health choices, have healthier relationships, and have healthier thoughts and feelings. Beyond the amazing technological changes that are just around the corner, that is probably how AIs will help us the most.
 This is why alignment is so important. It's not enough to align AIs to always be truthful and serve humanity's interests. We must train them to help us become better people. It wouldn't surprise me if by 2030 the whole of humanity experiences a profound ethical reformation that leads us all to enjoy much happier and healthier lives.

 Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14711
 GitHub: https://github.com/pbelcak/fastfeedforward
 PyPI: pip install fastfeedforward
 Abstract:
  
We break the linear link between the layer size and its inference cost by introducing the fast feedforward (FFF) architecture, a log-time alternative to feedforward networks. We demonstrate that FFFs are up to 220x faster than feedforward networks, up to 6x faster than mixture-of-experts networks, and exhibit better training properties than mixtures of experts thanks to noiseless conditional execution. Pushing FFFs to the limit, we show that they can use as little as 1% of layer neurons for inference in vision transformers while preserving 94.2% of predictive performance.
  
Fast feedforward networks can be used anywhere where feedforward and mixture-of-experts networks are used, delivering a significant speedup.

The ARM uses artificial intelligence to analyze tissue samples and provide pathologists with information about the location and severity of cancer.
 
There are currently 13 ARMs in existence, and initial research shows promising results.
 
The ARM is designed to support pathologists in smaller labs who may not have easy access to a second opinion.
 
It is not meant to replace digital pathology systems but can help health organizations bypass the need for them.
 
The ARM is expected to cost health systems between $90,000 to $100,000.

 Hugging Face datasets: https://huggingface.co/datasets/uonlp/CulturaX
 Abstract:
  
The driving factors behind the development of large language models (LLMs) with impressive learning capabilities are their colossal model sizes and extensive training datasets. Along with the progress in natural language processing, LLMs have been frequently made accessible to the public to foster deeper investigation and applications. However, when it comes to training datasets for these LLMs, especially the recent state-of-the-art models, they are often not fully disclosed. Creating training data for high-performing LLMs involves extensive cleaning and deduplication to ensure the necessary level of quality. The lack of transparency for training data has thus hampered research on attributing and addressing hallucination and bias issues in LLMs, hindering replication efforts and further advancements in the community. These challenges become even more pronounced in multilingual learning scenarios, where the available multilingual text datasets are often inadequately collected and cleaned. Consequently, there is a lack of open-source and readily usable dataset to effectively train LLMs in multiple languages. To overcome this issue, we present CulturaX, a substantial multilingual dataset with 6.3 trillion tokens in 167 languages, tailored for LLM development. Our dataset undergoes meticulous cleaning and deduplication through a rigorous pipeline of multiple stages to accomplish the best quality for model training, including language identification, URL-based filtering, metric-based cleaning, document refinement, and data deduplication. CulturaX is fully released to the public in HuggingFace to facilitate research and advancements in multilingual LLMs: this https URL.

For example, the x,y location of a player would be a continuous data point where (1,1) and (2,1) would be similar in values. Where the character ID would intuitively require very different strategy (for example lets say a barbarian and a wizard). Would a CNN have issues with this data because it isn't continuous?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow researchers! I'm in the exciting yet challenging phase of choosing a PhD topic in the realm of meta-learning optimization, and I could use some advice and insights.
 I've extensively researched existing meta-learning optimization algorithms like MAML and its various adaptations. I need advice and guidance on the following topics:
  
First I want to implement and compare 8-10 state-of-the-art meta-learning methods on benchmark datasets. This would involve in-depth simulation and performance evaluations to provide a comprehensive understanding of their strengths and weaknesses. Could you please guide me here if there are review papers which implement and compare different algorithms. 
 
Then I want to delve into developing a novel optimization algorithm that considers the curvature of loss functions. The idea here is to enhance the performance of existing meta-learning techniques by leveraging insights from the loss landscape.
 
Further, I'm considering exploring new loss functions or new improvements to loss functions tailored to the context of meta-learning. These could potentially lead to improvements in the learning process and generalization capabilities of meta-learning models.
 
 I'm reaching out to the community to gather opinions, suggestions, or any insights you might have. If you've worked in meta-learning or optimization, your experiences and advice would be invaluable in helping me choose the right direction for my PhD research. Thank you in advance for your guidance!

 Hello!
 I thought people on this subreddit might be interested in how I went about inferring Zonai device draw chances for each dispenser in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
 In this Switch game there are devices that can be glued together to create different machines. For instance, you can make a snowmobile from a fan, sled, and steering stick.
 There are dispensers that dispense 3-6 of about 30 or so possible devices when you feed it a construct horn (dropped by defeated robot enemies) or a regular (also dropped from defeated enemies) or large Zonai charge (Found in certain chests, dropped by certain boss enemies, obtained from completing certain challenges, etc…]]></summary>

 Blog: https://xizaoqu.github.io/unihsi/ Code coming soon!
 Abstract:
  
Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) is a vital component of fields like embodied AI and virtual reality. Despite advancements in motion quality and physical plausibility, two pivotal factors, versatile interaction control and the development of a user-friendly interface, require further exploration before the practical application of HSI. This paper presents a unified HSI framework, UniHSI, which supports unified control of diverse interactions through language commands. This framework is built upon the definition of interaction as Chain of Contacts (CoC): steps of human joint-object part pairs, which is inspired by the strong correlation between interaction types and human-object contact regions. Based on the definition, UniHSI constitutes a Large Language Model (LLM) Planner to translate language prompts into task plans in the form of CoC, and a Unified Controller that turns CoC into uniform task execution. To facilitate training and evaluation, we collect a new dataset named ScenePlan that encompasses thousands of task plans generated by LLMs based on diverse scenarios. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in versatile task execution and generalizability to real scanned scenes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We know that AI is great when studying subjects that depend on simply memorizing facts (like high school biology), but we also know that AI is usually bad when studying subjects that depend on logic (like mathematics and physics).
 What I need the AI for is to explain very complex mathematical concepts to me simply, thoroughly, and accurately. I can't rely on ChatGPT because it's known for not being very reliable when it comes logical things like mathematics or physics. The best AI I know of right now is Bing AI, because it uses GPT-4 and because it prefers searching the web before deducing an answer from its data. I heard that AI agents that run on your computer like Auto-GPT and search from the web are also good at this kind of stuff, but I'm not really sure about that. Do you have any better suggestions?

I am about to start a new project with Python probably using Machine Learning to parse resumes, the data is in a pdf/docx format then returned in a json format to later be used in an API or so. I am seeking advice on how to proceed, so far I am trying to collect data which will be provided to me, but not really sure how to go about it as I have found people talking about using Spacy for NLP, pyresparser which is for parsing resumes, but i was wondering if i should make everything from scratch. appreciate your time and opinion in advance

I am looking for (as possible) a scalable solution, where I could pay only for inference time, at the beginning suitable for 1/2 user's at the same time occasionally, but which could be scaled to dozens of user at the same time.
 As it is for real-time usage Indeed lag to be lowest as possible. According to my current test, I can fit maximum 6 users on T400.
 Is it possible to achieve that using HuggingFace? Thank you to anyone who could help me

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Years ago, we showed the world it was possible to automatically detect label errors in classification datasets via machine learning. Since that moment, folks have asked whether the same is possible for regression datasets?
 Figuring out this question required extensive research since properly accounting for uncertainty (critical to decide when to trust machine learning predictions over the data itself) poses unique challenges in the regression setting.
 Today I have published a new paper introducing an effective method for “Detecting Errors in Numerical Data via any Regression Model”. Our method can find likely incorrect values in any numerical column of a dataset by utilizing a regression model trained to predict this column based on the other data features.
 We’ve added our new algorithm to our open-source cleanlab library for you to algorithmically audit your own datasets for errors. Use this code for applications like detecting: data entry errors, sensor noise, incorrect invoices/prices in your company’s / client’s records, mis-estimated counts (eg. of cells in biological experiments).
 Find errors in regression data in just a few lines of code.
 Extensive benchmarks reveal cleanlab’s algorithm detects erroneous values in real numeric datasets better than alternative methods like RANSAC and conformal inference.
 If you'd like to learn more, you can check out the blogpost, research paper, code, and tutorial to run this on your data.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent work shows transformers are capable of performing multi-step gradient descent of mesa objectives inside of their transformer layers. This is even possible for linear transformers, which effectively perform linear optimization on deep representations of features calculated by earlier layers.
 https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.05858.pdf
 For those unfamiliar, instrumental convergence is the idea that entities with different goals will tend towards different subgoals. Examples could include gathering power, not dying, acquiring resources, etc. A famous thought experiment, known as the paperclip maximizer, is the idea of an AI that is optimized for paperclip production taking over the world so it can build as many paperclips as possible.
 However, if models are dynamically pursuing different objectives at runtime via generated mesa-optimizers, even if instrumental convergence is real, would we still expect it to happen? Without a constant objective given subgoals might start to conflict with each other. On the other hand, since instrumental convergence implies that different goals benefit from similar sub-objectives, perhaps the varying mesa objective doesn't really matter.

This trend appears to indicate a growing interest in these areas when compared to the relatively reduced attention given to Reinforcement Learning. It begs the question: Are researchers shifting their focus away from Reinforcement Learning towards these domains? Because in the past I have seen many people complaining about RL on its efficiency and it's impact which have often fallen short of expectations.

With N<5 I can easily flatten the matrix and put it into a simple FNN, which works quite well. Once hitting N=5 (the point where things actually get interesting), however, we already have 1024 matrix elements and the method struggles a lot. Still converging to something but very suboptimal. Sure, increasing N hardens the problem in general, but the performance degradation is so abrupt that I suspect some model issues, maybe caused by the curse of dimensionality or something similar.

 Trump says that he asked his mob to peacefully walk to the Capitol building gates. How would this have stopped the certification? Did he expect them to storm in? His waiting three hours to stop the violence that followed suggests that he did.
 Bard:
 Trump's request to walk peacefully to the Capitol building gates would not have stopped the certification of the election results. The certification process is a joint session of Congress, and it would have required a majority vote in both the House and the Senate to overturn the results. Even if Trump's supporters had peacefully marched to the Capitol, they would not have been able to prevent Congress from certifying the results.
 It is possible that Trump did not fully understand the certification process, or that he was simply trying to appease his supporters. However, it is also possible that he expected his supporters to storm the Capitol and prevent Congress from certifying the results. This is supported by the fact that he waited over three hours to call off the violence. During that time, he continued to tweet messages of encouragement to his supporters, and he even praised them for their patriotism.
 It is also worth noting that Trump had been repeatedly warned by his advisors about the possibility of violence on January 6. However, he ignored these warnings and continued to urge his supporters to fight to overturn the election results.
 In conclusion, it is impossible to say for sure whether Trump expected his supporters to storm the Capitol on January 6. However, the evidence suggests that he was at least aware of the possibility of violence, and that he was willing to allow it to happen in order to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another alternative to the regular $L_p$-constrained adversarial examples that is additionally less visible than adversarial patches or frames are adversarial transformations such as small crops, rotations and translations. Similar to $L_p$ adversarial examples, adversarial transformations are often less visible unless the original image is available for direct comparison. In this article, I will include a PyTorch implementation and some results against adversarial training.

I can do it perfectly fine in the Stable Diffusion web UI, but the API for that is only accessible locally. Anyone have any ideas or can guide me in the right direction for building a "server" to do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The hardware accelerators for LLM-powered applications can be costly. Enter vLLM, an open-source machine learning library designed to enhance the throughput of LLM serving systems.
 To stay on top of the latest advancements in AI, look here first.
 https://preview.redd.it/hzctjc0xvwob1.png?width=1660&format=png&auto=webp&s=866eb39745ec760ea0c1b9d84d303c63bcdceb7a
 Challenges with existing systems
  
High throughput serving of LLMs requires numerous requests, and current systems struggle with the bulky sequence memory.
 Inefficient memory management results in system hindrances such as fragmentation and redundant duplication.
  
The revolutionary answer: vLLM & PagedAttention
  
Researchers have introduced vLLM and PagedAttention, a newly designed attention algorithm, to resolve these issues.
 vLLM allows for minimal memory waste and efficiently manages attention keys and values. It provides up to 24 times more throughput than former systems.
  
The Mechanics of PagedAttention
  
PagedAttention offers a novel approach to memory management by permitting continuous storage in non-contiguous memory spaces.
 It enhances memory efficiency resulting in better GPU utilization, with practically only 4% inefficiency.
  
Improved memory sharing and system performance
  
PagedAttention significantly improves memory sharing, resulting in a 2.2 times speed gain while lowering memory usage by 55%.
 With vLLM, the throughput of known LLMs can be increased by 2-4 times without impacting accuracy or causing delay.

 I'am trying to get the 3D keypoints coordinates from an image or video and then map it to SMPL model. It's pretty easy to get the keypoints from an image or video using the mediapipe library. But the mapping of it with the SMPL model is something that I can't figure out. mainly because the skeleton structure is different. Some already had a similar issue but the answers were not clear and he didn't even ask futher. Is it possible to do this?? if it's not possible with mediapipe is there some other library that I could use?? I heard about openPose too but when I tried it didn't work someone was saying it works only on windows 11. There are some other parts also to this project which will mostly be dealt with Pytorch. There are some pose estimators in TensorFlow but I want to stick to pytorch hence would like some pose estimators in that framwork, or a library or somehing inside opencv

 ​
 I just read the paper named " SELF-ATTENTION DOES NOT NEED O(n 2 ) MEMORY" from Google.
 I understood that it requires O(1) for a single query, but still cannot understand why it requires O(log N) for self-attention and different order input.
 ​
 It seems like adding one index into a sequence requires O(log N) (The paper's saying this).
 But why does it take O(log N)? Isn't it just O(1)? Because it is just adding a single datapoint for the index.
 ​
 I really hope someone understands why it is and leaves any comment on this. 
 Here's the paper.
 https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05682
 ​
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google is rolling out its third iteration of the Helpful Content Update, which aims to classify content as either 'written for search engines' or 'written for people'.
 
The update reflects Google's realization that it can't accurately police AI-generated content and emphasizes the importance of creating content for people-first, regardless of the means used to create it.
 
Detecting AI content is challenging, as AI detection tools often classify content based on tone, leading to false positives.
 
Google's change in stance is not surprising, considering their heavy investment in AI, including chatbot Bard and new search features like the Search Generative Experience.
 
The majority of brands now openly share articles and guides on how to use AI tools to enhance marketing strategies and create actionable content plans quickly.
 
However, the quality and value of AI-generated content remain important factors for success, as poorly generated content can harm a brand's reputation and ranking.

 Abstract:
  
For a long time, humanity has pursued artificial intelligence (AI) equivalent to or surpassing the human level, with AI agents considered a promising vehicle for this pursuit. AI agents are artificial entities that sense their environment, make decisions, and take actions. Many efforts have been made to develop intelligent AI agents since the mid-20th century. However, these efforts have mainly focused on advancement in algorithms or training strategies to enhance specific capabilities or performance on particular tasks. Actually, what the community lacks is a sufficiently general and powerful model to serve as a starting point for designing AI agents that can adapt to diverse …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I am training a small model (120k params) on a custom grid-world environment I built with JAX.
 I was able to train the model very well with PPO on 1 GPU, but when I scaled to multiple GPUs (tried with 6 in parallel), the training curves showed a lot more variance than what I was seeing on 1 GPU.
 I did not change the hyperparams, I just spawned the same number of environments (~7000 per GPU) on multiple devices. 
 The multi-GPU setup works in the following way:
 - I keep parallel independent buffers, one on each device
 - I initialize identical models on each device
 - I get independent gradients on each device at the update step, then I take the mean of the gradients across the devices and then I backpropagate the same gradients on each device independently. (I checked that after some time the models are still identical, and that is the case). 
 Now the question is, what could be the reason for such an increase in variance? What can I try to mitigate the problem?
 Here's a comparison of the entropy curves... 
 P.S. The model still trains quite well, but I guess that if I manage to make the curves smoother it is going to train much faster and to a better performance.

 They break down this LLM-AI into three parts: 
  
the thinky bit (brain), 
 what they sense (perception),

They chat about how these AI can work solo, in teams, or buddy up with humans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I noticed that the default argument for `deterministic` in DQN is false. But how would that work? Typically DQN is trained with a deterministic function approximator. How would the algorithm become stochastic during inference time? In DQN the final layer activation is linear and therefore I don't see how one could even make this algorithm stochastic, unlike policy gradient where the final layer is softmax or Normal.

 I have been working on scalable GNN training for a while and noticed that the bottleneck of training GNNs is the graph sampling and feature fetching stages. GNN training frameworks PyG and DGL that most people use seem to default to using Neighbor Sampling for minibatch training. I am hoping that with my new paper Layer-Neighbor Sampling -- Defusing Neighborhood Explosion in GNNs, this default might be due to change.
 My new approach combines the layer sampling approach with the neighbor sampling approach. The result is that there is more overlap in the sampled neighborhoods and one still gets a fixed number of neighbors per seed vertex. It is even possible to turn it into a subgraph sampling approach by fixing the random seed used for sampling across all layers of the GNN m…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is no one definitive answer to this question, as the percentage of our thoughts that come to us on their own without our consciously choosing them can vary depending on the individual and the situation. However, some estimates suggest that up to 95% of our thoughts may be involuntary.
 This is because our thoughts are constantly being influenced by a variety of factors, both external and internal. For example, our environment, our emotions, and our physical state can all play a role in determining what thoughts pop into our heads.
 In addition, our brains are constantly processing information and making predictions, even when we are not actively thinking about anything. This process can sometimes lead to spontaneous thoughts, such as when we suddenly remember something that we had forgotten or when we come up with a new idea.
 While some of our spontaneous thoughts may be negative or intrusive, many of them can also be helpful or creative. For example, a spontaneous thought may help us to solve a problem, come up with a new solution, or simply make us smile.
 Overall, it is clear that a significant portion of our thoughts come to us without our consciously choosing them. This is a natural part of the human cognitive process and can be both beneficial and detrimental.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today we live in a world of multi-model LLMs. How will the following technologies fare against these LLM-based models? 
  
Neural VQA
 
Semantic Scene Segmentation
 
 Multi-model LLM are emerging quickly now, (such as NExT-GPT https://next-gpt.github.io/ ) . When you consider the kind of "understanding" of a visual scene these models are capable of, what will happen to prior approaches like Neural VQA? The nagging feeling that Neural VQA is going to be completely superseded by LLMs is palpable. The only vestige left for the older technology may have something to do with reasoning about the objects , such as properly counting the number of objects of a category that are present. But even that is getting sketchy. 
 On the topic of scene understanding, we can turn to semantic scene segmentation. SSS is a more complicated topic than Neural VQA. SOTA SSS algorithms are still largely employing DeConv Nets, and still require fully labelled datasets. With multi-model LLMs, there is a nagging question : Why go through the complexity/mess of first segmenting a scene very accurately, when an LLM can do better at identifying the entire scene's category in one fail swoop? 
 One might suggest that SSS still has a use in regards to interacting with the segmented objects of an environment, where one such "interaction" would be avoiding collisions with pedestrians, trees, or other cars. But honestly, SSS does not really make this connection with planning and action, it really only gives you the categories of the segments. THe autonomous vehicle's next moves are still an open problem. 
 What technologies do you expect that multi-model LLMs will supersede, if any?

I couldn't understand how an RNN with only fixed activations act as RL? Can someone help?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey. First of all I'm not a researcher on this area, so pardon my ignorance.
 I'm looking to employ a GAN on a dataset. The goals are still a bit unclear, but it's mainly to improve classification by either data augmentation and class balancing, or understanding the data through the latent representations.
 I'm really keen on InfoGAN at the moment. I trained one on the MNIST and the continuous variables learned the rotation and width, as in the paper and other peoples code.
 But at this point I think I need some help. I have labels, which means that maybe I should use a conditional GAN. But how will I learn similar representations as those in InfoGAN? I know StyleGAN is the current big thing in this area, but my images are limited to similar pixel-range as MNIST, and StyleGAN seems dependant on the ProGAN idea of increasing resolution for training.
 I'm a bit confused on the whole topic and would love a pointer to any discussion etc., as I can't seem to find anything but papers and they seem to be only focused on human faces, my data is unnatural not unsimilar again to MNIST. I don't have semantical information either as I see many papers employing that.
 I see many papers employing semi-supervision in this area, but honestly I'm just a bit lost and overwhelmed as this is not my area and GAN papers are still not stopping (I read a post here from 2017 about a GAN making GANs...).
 If you read this far: thank you and any pointers and discussion are very welcome. I would post on /r/learnmachinelearning but I feel the discussion in there is very different from this. My main goal is data exploration, but also to prove effectiveness some classification will be necessary and here the generative approach may help to augment data efficiently.

academic and applied machine learning. On the other hand, these steps are
becoming ever increasingly delicate due to the extensive rise in the number,
diversity, and distributedness of machine learning resources. Multi-agent
systems, when applied to the design of machine learning platforms, bring about
several distinctive characteristics such as scalability, flexibility, and
robustness, just to name a few. This paper proposes a fully automatic and
collaborative agent-based mechanism for selecting distributedly organized
machine learning algorithms and simultaneously tuning their hyperparameters.
Our method builds upon an existing agent-based hierarchical machine-learning
platform and augments its query structure to support the aforementioned
functionalities without being limited to specific learning, selection, and
tuning mechanisms. We have conducted theoretical assessments, formal
verification, and analytical study to demonstrate the correctness, resource
utilization, and computational efficiency of our technique. According to the
results, our solution is totally correct and exhibits linear time and space
complexity in relation to the size of available resources. To provide concrete
examples of how the proposed methodologies can effectively adapt and perform
across a range of algorithmic options and datasets, we have also conducted a
series of experiments using a system comprised of 24 algorithms and 9 datasets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Traffic prediction is a crucial topic because of its broad scope of
applications in the transportation domain. Recently, various studies have
achieved promising results. However, most studies assume the prediction
locations have complete or at least partial historical records and cannot be
extended to non-historical recorded locations. In real-life scenarios, the
deployment of sensors could be limited due to budget limitations and
installation availability, which makes most current models not applicable.
Though few pieces of literature tried to impute traffic states at the missing
locations, these methods need the data simultaneously observed at the locations
with sensors, making them not applicable to prediction tasks. Another drawback
is the lack of measurement of uncertainty in prediction, making prior works
unsuitable for risk-sensitive tasks or involving decision-making. To fill the
gap, inspired by the previous inductive graph neural network, this work
proposed an uncertainty-aware framework with the ability to 1) extend
prediction to missing locations with no historical records and significantly
extend spatial coverage of prediction locations while reducing deployment of
sensors and 2) generate probabilistic prediction with uncertainty
quantification to help the management of risk and decision making in the
down-stream tasks. Through extensive experiments on real-life datasets, the
result shows our method achieved promising results on prediction tasks, and the
uncertainty quantification gives consistent results which highly correlated
with the locations with and without historical data. We also show that our
model could help support sensor deployment tasks in the transportation field to
achieve higher accuracy with a limited sensor deployment budget.]]></summary>

single precision IEEE 754 floating point numbers (binary32), can also work
using lower precision. Therefore, 16-bit and 8-bit compressed format have
attracted considerable attention. In this paper, we focused on two families of
formats that have already achieved interesting results in compressing binary32
numbers in machine learning applications, without sensible degradation of the
accuracy: bfloat and posit. Even if 16-bit and 8-bit bfloat/posit are routinely
used for reducing the storage of the weights/biases of trained DNNs, the
inference still often happens on the 32-bit FPU of the CPU (especially if GPUs
are not available). In this paper we propose a way to decompress a tensor of
bfloat/posits just before computations, i.e., after the compressed operands
have been loaded within the vector registers of a vector capable CPU, in order
to save bandwidth usage and increase cache efficiency. Finally, we show the
architectural parameters and considerations under which this solution is

performance on many complex language tasks, there is a great interest in
bringing these LLMs to mobile devices for faster responses and better privacy
protection. However, the size of LLMs (i.e., billions of parameters) requires
highly effective compression to fit into storage-limited devices. Among many
compression techniques, weight-clustering, a form of non-linear quantization,
is one of the leading candidates for LLM compression, and supported by modern
smartphones. Yet, its training overhead is prohibitively significant for LLM
fine-tuning. Especially, Differentiable KMeans Clustering, or DKM, has shown
the state-of-the-art trade-off between compression ratio and accuracy
regression, but its large memory complexity makes it nearly impossible to apply
to train-time LLM compression. In this paper, we propose a memory-efficient DKM
implementation, eDKM powered by novel techniques to reduce the memory footprint
of DKM by orders of magnitudes. For a given tensor to be saved on CPU for the
backward pass of DKM, we compressed the tensor by applying uniquification and
sharding after checking if there is no duplicated tensor previously copied to
CPU. Our experimental results demonstrate that \prjname can fine-tune and
compress a pretrained LLaMA 7B model from 12.6 GB to 2.5 GB (3bit/weight) with
the Alpaca dataset by reducing the train-time memory footprint of a decoder
layer by 130$\times$, while delivering good accuracy on broader LLM benchmarks
(i.e., 77.7% for PIQA, 66.1% for Winograde, and so on).]]></summary>

important step in the drug discovery pipeline. Graph neural fingerprint is a
promising method for developing molecular docking surrogates with high
throughput and great fidelity. In this study, we built a COVID-19 drug docking
dataset of about 300,000 drug candidates on 23 coronavirus protein targets.
With this dataset, we trained graph neural fingerprint docking models for
high-throughput virtual COVID-19 drug screening. The graph neural fingerprint
models yield high prediction accuracy on docking scores with the mean squared
error lower than $0.21$ kcal/mol for most of the docking targets, showing
significant improvement over conventional circular fingerprint methods. To make
the neural fingerprints transferable for unknown targets, we also propose a
transferable graph neural fingerprint method trained on multiple targets. With
comparable accuracy to target-specific graph neural fingerprint models, the
transferable model exhibits superb training and data efficiency. We highlight
that the impact of this study extends beyond COVID-19 dataset, as our approach

the pixel space by adding adversarial perturbations. By contrast, semantic
adversarial attacks focus on changing semantic attributes of clean examples,
such as color, context, and features, which are more feasible in the real
world. In this paper, we propose a framework to quickly generate a semantic
adversarial attack by leveraging recent diffusion models since semantic
information is included in the latent space of well-trained diffusion models.
Then there are two variants of this framework: 1) the Semantic Transformation
(ST) approach fine-tunes the latent space of the generated image and/or the
diffusion model itself; 2) the Latent Masking (LM) approach masks the latent
space with another target image and local backpropagation-based interpretation
methods. Additionally, the ST approach can be applied in either white-box or
black-box settings. Extensive experiments are conducted on CelebA-HQ and AFHQ
datasets, and our framework demonstrates great fidelity, generalizability, and
transferability compared to other baselines. Our approaches achieve
approximately 100% attack success rate in multiple settings with the best FID
as 36.61. Code is available at

challenging task due to the unknown physical properties such as mass
distribution and coefficient of friction. In this study, we propose a
meta-learning algorithm called ConDex, which incorporates Conditional Neural
Processes (CNP) with DexNet-2.0 to autonomously discern the underlying physical
properties of objects using depth images. ConDex efficiently acquires physical
embeddings from limited trials, enabling precise grasping point estimation.
Furthermore, ConDex is capable of updating the predicted grasping quality
iteratively from new trials in an online fashion. To the best of our knowledge,
we are the first who generate two object datasets focusing on inhomogeneous
physical properties with varying mass distributions and friction coefficients.
Extensive evaluations in simulation demonstrate ConDex's superior performance
over DexNet-2.0 and existing meta-learning-based grasping pipelines.
Furthermore, ConDex shows robust generalization to previously unseen real-world
objects despite training solely in the simulation. The synthetic and real-world
datasets will be published as well.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spatial-temporal data contains rich information and has been widely studied
in recent years due to the rapid development of relevant applications in many
fields. For instance, medical institutions often use electrodes attached to
different parts of a patient to analyse the electorencephal data rich with
spatial and temporal features for health assessment and disease diagnosis.
Existing research has mainly used deep learning techniques such as
convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN) to extract
hidden spatial-temporal features. Yet, it is challenging to incorporate both
inter-dependencies spatial information and dynamic temporal changes
simultaneously. In reality, for a model that leverages these spatial-temporal
features to fulfil complex prediction tasks, it often requires a colossal
amount of training data in order to obtain satisfactory model performance.
Considering the above-mentioned challenges, we propose an adaptive federated
relevance framework, namely FedRel, for spatial-temporal graph learning in this
paper. After transforming the raw spatial-temporal data into high quality
features, the core Dynamic Inter-Intra Graph (DIIG) module in the framework is
able to use these features to generate the spatial-temporal graphs capable of
capturing the hidden topological and long-term temporal correlation information
in these graphs. To improve the model generalization ability and performance
while preserving the local data privacy, we also design a relevance-driven
federated learning module in our framework to leverage diverse data
distributions from different participants with attentive aggregations of their
models.]]></summary>

discriminative representation space.A generated feature is meaningful when the
generated feature is from a feature pair with inherent feature interaction. In
the real world, experienced data scientists can identify potentially useful

exponentially large search space, in an optimal crossing form over an optimal

such learning tasks as self-optimizing feature generation. Self-optimizing
feature generation imposes several under-addressed challenges on existing
systems: meaningful, robust, and efficient generation. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a principled and generic representation-crossing
framework to solve self-optimizing feature generation.To achieve hashing
representation, we propose a three-step approach: feature discretization,
feature hashing, and descriptive summarization. To achieve reinforcement
crossing, we develop a hierarchical reinforcement feature crossing approach.We

driving technologies where the entire driving pipeline is replaced with a
single neural network because of its simpler structure and faster inference

safety issues arXiv:2003.06404. The trained policy is not always compliant with
the traffic rules and it is also hard to discover the reason for the
misbehavior because of the lack of intermediate outputs. Meanwhile, Sensors are
also critical to autonomous driving's security and feasibility to perceive the
surrounding environment under complex driving scenarios. In this paper, we
proposed P-CSG, a novel penalty-based imitation learning approach with cross
semantics generation sensor fusion technologies to increase the overall
performance of End-to-End Autonomous Driving. We conducted an assessment of our

scientific knowledge graphs such as molecular interaction or chemical reaction
networks that define cellular signaling relationships. In these situations,
source nodes typically have distinct biophysical properties from sinks. Due to
their ordered and unidirectional relationships, many such networks also have
hierarchical and multiscale structure. However, the majority of methods
performing node- and edge-level tasks in machine learning do not take these
properties into account, and thus have not been leveraged effectively for
scientific tasks such as cellular signaling network inference. We propose a new
framework called Directed Scattering Autoencoder (DSAE) which uses a directed
version of a geometric scattering transform, combined with the non-linear
dimensionality reduction properties of an autoencoder and the geometric
properties of the hyperbolic space to learn latent hierarchies. We show this
method outperforms numerous others on tasks such as embedding directed graphs

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Accurately labeling biomedical data presents a challenge. Traditional
semi-supervised learning methods often under-utilize available unlabeled data.
To address this, we propose a novel reliability-based training data cleaning
method employing inductive conformal prediction (ICP). This method capitalizes
on a small set of accurately labeled training data and leverages ICP-calculated
reliability metrics to rectify mislabeled data and outliers within vast
quantities of noisy training data. The efficacy of the method is validated
across three classification tasks within distinct modalities: filtering
drug-induced-liver-injury (DILI) literature with title and abstract, predicting
ICU admission of COVID-19 patients through CT radiomics and electronic health
records, and subtyping breast cancer using RNA-sequencing data. Varying levels
of noise to the training labels were introduced through label permutation.
Results show significant enhancements in classification performance: accuracy
enhancement in 86 out of 96 DILI experiments (up to 11.4%), AUROC and AUPRC
enhancements in all 48 COVID-19 experiments (up to 23.8% and 69.8%), and
accuracy and macro-average F1 score improvements in 47 out of 48 RNA-sequencing
experiments (up to 74.6% and 89.0%). Our method offers the potential to
substantially boost classification performance in multi-modal biomedical
machine learning tasks. Importantly, it accomplishes this without necessitating
an excessive volume of meticulously curated training data.]]></summary>

essential to various downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis, sarcasm

In this work, we aim to directly model this by proposing the use of two
auxiliary losses jointly with the main task when fine-tuning any pre-trained
multimodal model. Image-Text Contrastive (ITC) brings image-text
representations of a post closer together and separates them from different
posts, capturing underlying dependencies. Image-Text Matching (ITM) facilitates
the understanding of semantic correspondence between images and text by
penalizing unrelated pairs. We combine these objectives with five multimodal

detectors, a weakly supervised video-based deep learning model called Robust

blooms of water bodies, and is an important indicator for evaluating water
quality. The prediction of chlorophyll concentration change trend is of great
significance to environmental protection and aquaculture. However, there is a
complex and indistinguishable nonlinear relationship between many factors
affecting chlorophyll concentration. In order to effectively mine the nonlinear

adaptive graph-time convolutional network ( AGTCNSD ) prediction model.
Firstly, the original sequence is decomposed into trend component and periodic
component by moving average method. Secondly, based on the graph convolutional
neural network, the water quality parameter data is modeled, and a parameter
embedding matrix is defined. The idea of matrix decomposition is used to assign
weight parameters to each node. The adaptive graph convolution learns the
relationship between different water quality parameters, updates the state
information of each parameter, and improves the learning ability of the update
relationship between nodes. Finally, time dependence is captured by time
convolution to achieve multi-step prediction of chlorophyll concentration. The
validity of the model is verified by the water quality data of the coastal city
Beihai. The results show that the prediction effect of this method is better

used by journalists and fact-checkers to assess the veracity of online content.
Automating the task of credibility signal extraction, however, is very
challenging as it requires high-accuracy signal-specific extractors to be
trained, while there are currently no sufficiently large datasets annotated
with all credibility signals. This paper investigates whether large language
models (LLMs) can be prompted effectively with a set of 18 credibility signals
to produce weak labels for each signal. We then aggregate these potentially
noisy labels using weak supervision in order to predict content veracity. We
demonstrate that our approach, which combines zero-shot LLM credibility signal
labeling and weak supervision, outperforms state-of-the-art classifiers on two
misinformation datasets without using any ground-truth labels for training. We
also analyse the contribution of the individual credibility signals towards
predicting content veracity, which provides new valuable insights into their
role in misinformation detection.]]></summary>

is complicated by the fact that trial eligibility is stated in natural
language. A potential solution to this problem is to employ text classification
methods for common types of eligibility criteria. In this study, we focus on
seven common exclusion criteria in cancer trials: prior malignancy, human
immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, psychiatric illness,
drug/substance abuse, and autoimmune illness. Our dataset consists of 764 phase
III cancer trials with these exclusions annotated at the trial level. We
experiment with common transformer models as well as a new pre-trained clinical
trial BERT model. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of automatically
classifying common exclusion criteria. Additionally, we demonstrate the value
of a pre-trained language model specifically for clinical trials, which yields
the highest average performance across all criteria.]]></summary>

multidimensional signal and image processing, most traditional neural networks
process data represented by (multidimensional) arrays of real numbers. The
intercorrelation between feature channels is usually expected to be learned
from the training data, requiring numerous parameters and careful training. In
contrast, vector-valued neural networks are conceived to process arrays of
vectors and naturally consider the intercorrelation between feature channels.
Consequently, they usually have fewer parameters and often undergo more robust
training than traditional neural networks. This paper aims to present a broad
framework for vector-valued neural networks, referred to as V-nets. In this
context, hypercomplex-valued neural networks are regarded as vector-valued
models with additional algebraic properties. Furthermore, this paper explains
the relationship between vector-valued and traditional neural networks.
Precisely, a vector-valued neural network can be obtained by placing
restrictions on a real-valued model to consider the intercorrelation between
feature channels. Finally, we show how V-nets, including hypercomplex-valued
neural networks, can be implemented in current deep-learning libraries as
real-valued networks.]]></summary>

learning (ML) model for diagnosing and monitoring Parkinson's disease (PD) in
an Internet of Things (IoT) environment using rest-state EEG signals (rs-EEG).
We computed different types of entropy from EEG signals and found that Fuzzy
Entropy performed the best in diagnosing and monitoring PD using rs-EEG. We
also investigated different combinations of signal frequency ranges and EEG
channels to accurately diagnose PD. Finally, with a fewer number of features
(11 features), we achieved a maximum classification accuracy (ARKF) of ~99.9%.
The most prominent frequency range of EEG signals has been identified, and we
have found that high classification accuracy depends on low-frequency signal
components (0-4 Hz). Moreover, the most informative signals were mainly
received from the right hemisphere of the head (F8, P8, T8, FC6). Furthermore,
we assessed the accuracy of the diagnosis of PD using three different lengths
of EEG data (150-1000 samples). Because the computational complexity is reduced
by reducing the input data. As a result, we have achieved a maximum mean
accuracy of 99.9% for a sample length (LEEG) of 1000 (~7.8 seconds), 98.2% with
a LEEG of 800 (~6.2 seconds), and 79.3% for LEEG = 150 (~1.2 seconds). By
reducing the number of features and segment lengths, the computational cost of
classification can be reduced. Lower-performance smart ML sensors can be used
in IoT environments for enhances human resilience to PD.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive disease preceded by Mild Cognitive
Impairment (MCI). Early detection of AD is crucial for making treatment
decisions. However, most of the literature on computer-assisted detection of AD
focuses on classifying brain images into one of three major categories:
healthy, MCI, and AD; or categorizing MCI patients into (1) progressive: those
who progress from MCI to AD at a future examination time, and (2) stable: those
who stay as MCI and never progress to AD. This misses the opportunity to
accurately identify the trajectory of progressive MCI patients. In this paper,
we revisit the brain image classification task for AD identification and
re-frame it as an ordinal classification task to predict how close a patient is
to the severe AD stage. To this end, we select progressive MCI patients from
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset and construct an
ordinal dataset with a prediction target that indicates the time to progression
to AD. We train a Siamese network model to predict the time to onset of AD
based on MRI brain images. We also propose a Weighted variety of Siamese
network and compare its performance to a baseline model. Our evaluations show
that incorporating a weighting factor to Siamese networks brings considerable
performance gain at predicting how close input brain MRI images are to
progressing to AD. Moreover, we complement our results with an interpretation
of the learned embedding space of the Siamese networks using a model
explainability technique.]]></summary>

punishments as central to explaining goal-directed behavior. However, over a
life, organisms will need to learn about many different aspects of the world's
structure: the states of the world and state-vector transition dynamics. The
number of combinations of states grows exponentially as an agent incorporates
new knowledge, and there is no obvious weighted combination of pre-existing
rewards or costs defined for a given combination of states, as such a weighting
would need to encode information about good and bad combinations prior to an
agent's experience in the world. Therefore, we must develop more naturalistic
accounts of behavior and motivation in large state-spaces. We show that it is
possible to use only the intrinsic motivation metric of empowerment, which
measures the agent's capacity to realize many possible futures under a
transition operator. We propose to scale empowerment to hierarchical
state-spaces by using Operator Bellman Equations. These equations produce
state-time feasibility functions, which are compositional hierarchical
state-time transition operators that map an initial state and time when an
agent begins a policy to the final states and times of completing a goal.
Because these functions are hierarchical operators we can define hierarchical
empowerment measures on them. An agent can then optimize plans to distant
states and times to maximize its hierarchical empowerment-gain, allowing it to
discover goals that bring about a more favorable coupling of its internal
structure (physiological states) to its external environment (world structure &
spatial state). Life-long agents could therefore be primarily animated by
principles of compositionality and empowerment, exhibiting self-concern for the
growth & maintenance of their own structural integrity without recourse to
reward-maximization.]]></summary>

https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-36363-w (2023)], the authors present a deep
reinforced learning approach to augment combinatorial optimization heuristics.
In particular, they present results for several spin glass ground state
problems, for which instances on non-planar networks are generally NP-hard, in
comparison with several Monte Carlo based methods, such as simulated annealing
(SA) or parallel tempering (PT). Indeed, those results demonstrate that the
reinforced learning improves the results over those obtained with SA or PT, or
at least allows for reduced runtimes for the heuristics before results of
comparable quality have been obtained relative to those other methods. To
facilitate the conclusion that their method is ''superior'', the authors pursue
two basic strategies: (1) A commercial GUROBI solver is called on to procure a
sample of exact ground states as a testbed to compare with, and (2) a
head-to-head comparison between the heuristics is given for a sample of larger
instances where exact ground states are hard to ascertain. Here, we put these
studies into a larger context, showing that the claimed superiority is at best
marginal for smaller samples and becomes essentially irrelevant with respect to
any sensible approximation of true ground states in the larger samples. For
example, this method becomes irrelevant as a means to determine stiffness
exponents $\theta$ in $d>2$, as mentioned by the authors, where the problem is
not only NP-hard but requires the subtraction of two almost equal ground-state
energies and systemic errors in each of $\approx 1\%$ found here are
unacceptable. This larger picture on the method arises from a straightforward
finite-size corrections study over the spin glass ensembles the authors employ,
using data that has been available for decades.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The marketplace system connecting demands and supplies has been explored to
develop unbiased decision-making in valuing properties. Real estate appraisal
serves as one of the high-cost property valuation tasks for financial
institutions since it requires domain experts to appraise the estimation based
on the corresponding knowledge and the judgment of the market. Existing
automated valuation models reducing the subjectivity of domain experts require
a large number of transactions for effective evaluation, which is predominantly
limited to not only the labeling efforts of transactions but also the
generalizability of new developing and rural areas. To learn representations
from unlabeled real estate sets, existing self-supervised learning (SSL) for
tabular data neglects various important features, and fails to incorporate
domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose DoRA, a Domain-based
self-supervised learning framework for low-resource Real estate Appraisal. DoRA
is pre-trained with an intra-sample geographic prediction as the pretext task
based on the metadata of the real estate for equipping the real estate
representations with prior domain knowledge. Furthermore, inter-sample
contrastive learning is employed to generalize the representations to be robust
for limited transactions of downstream tasks. Our benchmark results on three
property types of real-world transactions show that DoRA significantly
outperforms the SSL baselines for tabular data, the graph-based methods, and
the supervised approaches in the few-shot scenarios by at least 7.6% for MAPE,
11.59% for MAE, and 3.34% for HR10%. We expect DoRA to be useful to other
financial practitioners with similar marketplace applications who need general
models for properties that are newly built and have limited records. The source

(ML) based systems raise major evaluation challenges that are amplified by the
large-scale deployment of models in many hardware platforms. Until recently,
most of research works focused on API-based attacks that consider a ML model as
a pure algorithmic abstraction. However, new implementation-based threats have
been revealed, emphasizing the urgency to propose both practical and
simulation-based methods to properly evaluate the robustness of models. A major
concern is parameter-based attacks (such as the Bit-Flip Attack, BFA) that
highlight the lack of robustness of typical deep neural network models when
confronted by accurate and optimal alterations of their internal parameters
stored in memory. Setting in a security testing purpose, this work practically
reports, for the first time, a successful variant of the BFA on a 32-bit
Cortex-M microcontroller using laser fault injection. It is a standard fault
injection means for security evaluation, that enables to inject spatially and
temporally accurate faults. To avoid unrealistic brute-force strategies, we
show how simulations help selecting the most sensitive set of bits from the
parameters taking into account the laser fault model.]]></summary>

global score functions. However, if local variables have direct and indirect
dependence simultaneously, the global optimization on score functions misses
edges between variables with indirect dependent relationship, of which scores
are smaller than those with direct dependent relationship. In this paper, we
present an identifiability condition based on a determined subset of parents to
identify the underlying DAG. By the identifiability condition, we develop a
two-phase algorithm namely optimal-tuning (OT) algorithm to locally amend the
global optimization. In the optimal phase, an optimization problem based on
first-order Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) gives an estimated
skeleton as the initial determined parents subset. In the tuning phase, the
skeleton is locally tuned by deletion, addition and DAG-formalization
strategies using the theoretically proved incremental properties of high-order
HSIC. Numerical experiments for different synthetic datasets and real-world
datasets show that the OT algorithm outperforms existing methods. Especially in
Sigmoid Mix model with the size of the graph being ${\rm\bf d=40}$, the
structure intervention distance (SID) of the OT algorithm is 329.7 smaller than
the one obtained by CAM, which indicates that the graph estimated by the OT
algorithm misses fewer edges compared with CAM.Source code of the OT algorithm
is available at https://github.com/YafeiannWang/optimal-tune-algorithm.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Focus in Explainable AI is shifting from explanations defined in terms of
low-level elements, such as input features, to explanations encoded in terms of
interpretable concepts learned from data. How to reliably acquire such concepts
is, however, still fundamentally unclear. An agreed-upon notion of concept
interpretability is missing, with the result that concepts used by both
post-hoc explainers and concept-based neural networks are acquired through a
variety of mutually incompatible strategies. Critically, most of these neglect
the human side of the problem: a representation is understandable only insofar
as it can be understood by the human at the receiving end. The key challenge in
Human-interpretable Representation Learning (HRL) is how to model and
operationalize this human element. In this work, we propose a mathematical
framework for acquiring interpretable representations suitable for both
post-hoc explainers and concept-based neural networks. Our formalization of HRL
builds on recent advances in causal representation learning and explicitly
models a human stakeholder as an external observer. This allows us to derive a
principled notion of alignment between the machine representation and the
vocabulary of concepts understood by the human. In doing so, we link alignment
and interpretability through a simple and intuitive name transfer game, and
clarify the relationship between alignment and a well-known property of
representations, namely disentanglment. We also show that alignment is linked
to the issue of undesirable correlations among concepts, also known as concept
leakage, and to content-style separation, all through a general
information-theoretic reformulation of these properties. Our conceptualization
aims to bridge the gap between the human and algorithmic sides of
interpretability and establish a stepping stone for new research on
human-interpretable representations.]]></summary>

its flexibility, in that it can predict a warm start for fixed-point algorithms
run for any number of steps, without being limited to the number of steps it

interpretability. Despite the advancements in interpretable machine learning
(IML) methods, they frequently assign importance to features which lack causal
influence on the outcome variable. Selecting causally relevant features among
those identified as relevant by these methods, or even before model training,
would offer a solution. Feature selection methods utilizing information
theoretical quantities have been successful in identifying statistically
relevant features. However, the information theoretical quantities they are
based on do not incorporate causality, rendering them unsuitable for such
scenarios. To address this challenge, this article proposes information
theoretical quantities that incorporate the causal structure of the system,
which can be used to evaluate causal importance of features for some given
outcome variable. Specifically, we introduce causal versions of entropy and
mutual information, termed causal entropy and causal information gain, which
are designed to assess how much control a feature provides over the outcome
variable. These newly defined quantities capture changes in the entropy of a
variable resulting from interventions on other variables. Fundamental results
connecting these quantities to the existence of causal effects are derived. The
use of causal information gain in feature selection is demonstrated,
highlighting its superiority over standard mutual information in revealing
which features provide control over a chosen outcome variable. Our
investigation paves the way for the development of methods with improved

work, by transforming the original EEG channels into a two-dimensional (2D)
spatial topological map, the EEG data is transformed into a three-dimensional
(3D) arrangement containing spatial-temporal information. And then a 3D deep
convolutional neural network (DenseNet-3D) is used to extract temporal and
spatial features of the neural representation for the attended locations. The
results show that the proposed method achieves higher decoding accuracy than
the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method (94.4% compared to XANet's 90.6%) with
1-second decision window for the widely used KULeuven (KUL) dataset, and the

robustness and spatial robustness, plays an integral part in achieving robust
generalization. In this paper, we endeavor to design strategies to achieve
universal adversarial robustness. To achieve this, we first investigate the
relatively less-explored realm of spatial robustness. Then, we integrate the
existing spatial robustness methods by incorporating both local and global
spatial vulnerability into a unified spatial attack and adversarial training
approach. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive relationship between natural
accuracy, sensitivity-based robustness, and spatial robustness, supported by
strong evidence from the perspective of robust representation. Crucially, to
reconcile the interplay between the mutual impacts of various robustness
components into one unified framework, we incorporate the \textit{Pareto
criterion} into the adversarial robustness analysis, yielding a novel strategy
called Pareto Adversarial Training for achieving universal robustness. The
resulting Pareto front, which delineates the set of optimal solutions, provides
an optimal balance between natural accuracy and various adversarial robustness.
This sheds light on solutions for achieving universal robustness in the future.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to consider universal
adversarial robustness via multi-objective optimization.]]></summary>

goal representation as they offer ways to structure knowledge for efficient and
transferable learning. However, the existing Hierarchical Reinforcement
Learning (HRL) approaches relying on symbolic reasoning are often limited as
they require a manual goal representation. The challenge in autonomously
discovering a symbolic goal representation is that it must preserve critical
information, such as the environment dynamics. In this paper, we propose a
developmental mechanism for goal discovery via an emergent representation that
abstracts (i.e., groups together) sets of environment states that have similar
roles in the task. We introduce a Feudal HRL algorithm that concurrently learns
both the goal representation and a hierarchical policy. The algorithm uses
symbolic reachability analysis for neural networks to approximate the
transition relation among sets of states and to refine the goal representation.
We evaluate our approach on complex navigation tasks, showing the learned

applications due to the high cost of data labeling. To this end,
semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) on graphs aims to leverage the
knowledge of a labeled source graph to aid in node classification on a target
graph with limited labels. SSDA tasks need to overcome the domain gap between
the source and target graphs. However, to date, this challenging research
problem has yet to be formally considered by the existing approaches designed
for cross-graph node classification. To tackle the SSDA problem on graphs, a
novel method called SemiGCL is proposed, which benefits from graph contrastive
learning and minimax entropy training. SemiGCL generates informative node
representations by contrasting the representations learned from a graph's local
and global views. Additionally, SemiGCL is adversarially optimized with the
entropy loss of unlabeled target nodes to reduce domain divergence.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemiGCL outperforms
the state-of-the-art baselines on the SSDA tasks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We introduce beta diffusion, a novel generative modeling method that
integrates demasking and denoising to generate data within bounded ranges.
Using scaled and shifted beta distributions, beta diffusion utilizes
multiplicative transitions over time to create both forward and reverse
diffusion processes, maintaining beta distributions in both the forward
marginals and the reverse conditionals, given the data at any point in time.
Unlike traditional diffusion-based generative models relying on additive
Gaussian noise and reweighted evidence lower bounds (ELBOs), beta diffusion is
multiplicative and optimized with KL-divergence upper bounds (KLUBs) derived
from the convexity of the KL divergence. We demonstrate that the proposed KLUBs
are more effective for optimizing beta diffusion compared to negative ELBOs,
which can also be derived as the KLUBs of the same KL divergence with its two
arguments swapped. The loss function of beta diffusion, expressed in terms of
Bregman divergence, further supports the efficacy of KLUBs for optimization.
Experimental results on both synthetic data and natural images demonstrate the
unique capabilities of beta diffusion in generative modeling of range-bounded
data and validate the effectiveness of KLUBs in optimizing diffusion models,
thereby making them valuable additions to the family of diffusion-based
generative models and the optimization techniques used to train them.]]></summary>

events that put physical fitness and endurance of riders to the test. The
coaches of Team Jumbo-Visma have long been responsible for predicting the
energy needs of each rider of the Dutch team for every race on the calendar.
Those must be estimated to ensure riders have the energy and resources
necessary to maintain a high level of performance throughout a race. This task,
however, is both time-consuming and challenging, as it requires precise
estimates of race speed and power output. Traditionally, the approach to
predicting energy needs has relied on judgement and experience of coaches, but
this method has its limitations and often leads to inaccurate predictions. In
this paper, we propose a new, more effective approach to predicting energy
needs for cycling races. By predicting the speed and power with regression
models, we provide the coaches with calorie needs estimates for each individual
rider per stage instantly. In addition, we compare methods to quantify
uncertainty using conformal prediction. The empirical analysis of the
jackknife+, jackknife-minmax, jackknife-minmax-after-bootstrap, CV+, CV-minmax,
conformalized quantile regression, and inductive conformal prediction methods
in conformal prediction reveals that all methods achieve valid prediction
intervals. All but minmax-based methods also produce sufficiently narrow
prediction intervals for decision-making. Furthermore, methods computing
prediction intervals of fixed size produce tighter intervals for low
significance values. Among the methods computing intervals of varying length
across the input space, inductive conformal prediction computes narrower
prediction intervals at larger significance level.]]></summary>

On the one hand, the first considers adapting multiple heterogeneous labeled

attacks the problem of synthesizing a small summary containing all the
information about the datasets. We thus consider a new problem called MSDA-DD.
To solve it, we adapt previous works in the MSDA literature, such as
Wasserstein Barycenter Transport and Dataset Dictionary Learning, as well as DD

on four benchmarks (Caltech-Office 10, Tennessee-Eastman Process, Continuous

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Purpose: Common to most MRSI techniques, the spatial resolution and the
minimal scan duration of Deuterium Metabolic Imaging (DMI) are limited by the
achievable SNR. This work presents a deep learning method for sensitivity
enhancement of DMI.

Methods: A convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed to estimate the
2H-labeled metabolite concentrations from low SNR and distorted DMI FIDs. The
CNN was trained with synthetic data that represent a range of SNR levels
typically encountered in vivo. The estimation precision was further improved by
fine-tuning the CNN with MRI-based edge-preserving regularization for each DMI
dataset. The proposed processing method, PReserved Edge ConvolutIonal neural
network for Sensitivity Enhanced DMI (PRECISE-DMI), was applied to simulation
studies and in vivo experiments to evaluate the anticipated improvements in SNR
and investigate the potential for inaccuracies.

Results: PRECISE-DMI visually improved the metabolic maps of low SNR
datasets, and quantitatively provided higher precision than the standard
Fourier reconstruction. Processing of DMI data acquired in rat brain tumor
models resulted in more precise determination of 2H-labeled lactate and
glutamate + glutamine levels, at increased spatial resolution (from >8 to 2
$\mu$L) or shortened scan time (from 32 to 4 min) compared to standard
acquisitions. However, rigorous SD-bias analyses showed that overuse of the
edge-preserving regularization can compromise the accuracy of the results.

Conclusion: PRECISE-DMI allows a flexible trade-off between enhancing the
sensitivity of DMI and minimizing the inaccuracies. With typical settings, the
DMI sensitivity can be improved by 3-fold while retaining the capability to
detect local signal variations.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Benign overfitting, the phenomenon where interpolating models generalize well
in the presence of noisy data, was first observed in neural network models
trained with gradient descent. To better understand this empirical observation,
we consider the generalization error of two-layer neural networks trained to
interpolation by gradient descent on the logistic loss following random
initialization. We assume the data comes from well-separated class-conditional
log-concave distributions and allow for a constant fraction of the training
labels to be corrupted by an adversary. We show that in this setting, neural
networks exhibit benign overfitting: they can be driven to zero training error,
perfectly fitting any noisy training labels, and simultaneously achieve minimax
optimal test error. In contrast to previous work on benign overfitting that
require linear or kernel-based predictors, our analysis holds in a setting
where both the model and learning dynamics are fundamentally nonlinear.]]></summary>

genomic studies to identify differentially expressed genes. However, due to
unmeasured confounders, many standard statistical approaches may be
substantially biased. This paper investigates the large-scale hypothesis
testing problem for multivariate generalized linear models in the presence of
confounding effects. Under arbitrary confounding mechanisms, we propose a
unified statistical estimation and inference framework that harnesses
orthogonal structures and integrates linear projections into three key stages.
It first leverages multivariate responses to separate marginal and uncorrelated
confounding effects, recovering the confounding coefficients' column space.
Subsequently, latent factors and primary effects are jointly estimated,
utilizing $\ell_1$-regularization for sparsity while imposing orthogonality
onto confounding coefficients. Finally, we incorporate projected and weighted
bias-correction steps for hypothesis testing. Theoretically, we establish
various effects' identification conditions and non-asymptotic error bounds. We
show effective Type-I error control of asymptotic $z$-tests as sample and
response sizes approach infinity. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method controls the false discovery rate by the Benjamini-Hochberg
procedure and is more powerful than alternative methods. By comparing
single-cell RNA-seq counts from two groups of samples, we demonstrate the
suitability of adjusting confounding effects when significant covariates are
absent from the model.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Auditory Attention Detection (AAD) aims to detect target speaker from brain
signals in a multi-speaker environment. Although EEG-based AAD methods have
shown promising results in recent years, current approaches primarily rely on
traditional convolutional neural network designed for processing Euclidean data
like images. This makes it challenging to handle EEG signals, which possess
non-Euclidean characteristics. In order to address this problem, this paper
proposes a dynamical graph self-distillation (DGSD) approach for AAD, which
does not require speech stimuli as input. Specifically, to effectively
represent the non-Euclidean properties of EEG signals, dynamical graph
convolutional networks are applied to represent the graph structure of EEG
signals, which can also extract crucial features related to auditory spatial
attention in EEG signals. In addition, to further improve AAD detection
performance, self-distillation, consisting of feature distillation and
hierarchical distillation strategies at each layer, is integrated. These
strategies leverage features and classification results from the deepest
network layers to guide the learning of shallow layers. Our experiments are
conducted on two publicly available datasets, KUL and DTU. Under a 1-second
time window, we achieve results of 90.0\% and 79.6\% accuracy on KUL and DTU,
respectively. We compare our DGSD method with competitive baselines, and the
experimental results indicate that the detection performance of our proposed
DGSD method is not only superior to the best reproducible baseline but also
significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters by approximately 100
times.]]></summary>

(EEG)-based cognitive workload (CWL) estimation. The focus of the article is
twofold: identify the disparate experimental paradigms used for reliably
eliciting discreet and quantifiable levels of cognitive load and the specific
nature and representational structure of the commonly used input formulations
in deep neural networks (DNNs) used for signal classification. The analysis
revealed a number of studies using EEG signals in its native representation of
a two-dimensional matrix for offline classification of CWL. However, only a few
studies adopted an online or pseudo-online classification strategy for
real-time CWL estimation. Further, only a couple of interpretable DNNs and a
single generative model were employed for cognitive load detection till date
during this review. More often than not, researchers were using DNNs as
black-box type models. In conclusion, DNNs prove to be valuable tools for
classifying EEG signals, primarily due to the substantial modeling power
provided by the depth of their network architecture. It is further suggested
that interpretable and explainable DNN models must be employed for cognitive
workload estimation since existing methods are limited in the face of the
non-stationary nature of the signal.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pushing the boundaries of machine learning often requires exploring different
hardware and software combinations. However, the freedom to experiment across
different tooling stacks can be at odds with the drive for efficiency, which
has produced increasingly specialized AI hardware and incentivized
consolidation around a narrow set of ML frameworks. Exploratory research can be
restricted if software and hardware are co-evolving, making it even harder to
stray away from mainstream ideas that work well with popular tooling stacks.
While this friction increasingly impacts the rate of innovation in machine
learning, to our knowledge the lack of portability in tooling has not been
quantified. In this work, we ask: How portable are popular ML software
frameworks? We conduct a large-scale study of the portability of mainstream ML
frameworks across different hardware types. Our findings paint an uncomfortable
picture -- frameworks can lose more than 40% of their key functions when ported
to other hardware. Worse, even when functions are portable, the slowdown in
their performance can be extreme and render performance untenable.
Collectively, our results reveal how costly straying from a narrow set of
hardware-software combinations can be - and suggest that specialization of
hardware impedes innovation in machine learning research.]]></summary>

outperforming traditional statistical techniques. However, to establish ML as a
reliable tool in clinical practice, adherence to best practices regarding data
handling, experimental design, and model evaluation is crucial. This work
summarizes and strictly observes such practices to ensure reproducible and
reliable ML. Specifically, we focus on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection,
which serves as a paradigmatic example of challenging problem in healthcare. We
investigate the impact of different data augmentation techniques and model
complexity on the overall performance. We consider MRI data from ADNI dataset
to address a classification problem employing 3D Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). The experiments are designed to compensate for data scarcity and initial
random parameters by utilizing cross-validation and multiple training trials.
Within this framework, we train 15 predictive models, considering three
different data augmentation strategies and five distinct 3D CNN architectures,
each varying in the number of convolutional layers. Specifically, the
augmentation strategies are based on affine transformations, such as zoom,
shift, and rotation, applied concurrently or separately. The combined effect of
data augmentation and model complexity leads to a variation in prediction
performance up to 10% of accuracy. When affine transformation are applied
separately, the model is more accurate, independently from the adopted
architecture. For all strategies, the model accuracy followed a concave
behavior at increasing number of convolutional layers, peaking at an
intermediate value of layers. The best model (8 CL, (B)) is the most stable
across cross-validation folds and training trials, reaching excellent
performance both on the testing set and on an external test set.]]></summary>

complex monotonic-increasing shapes that change the distribution of the data so
that the linear transformation that follows is more effective. Because a D-PBN
operates by "backing up", the TCAs are inverted in the reconstruction process,
restoring the original distribution of the data, thus taking advantage of a
given TCA in both analysis and reconstruction. In this paper, we show that a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Variable importance assessment has become a crucial step in machine-learning
applications when using complex learners, such as deep neural networks, on
large-scale data. Removal-based importance assessment is currently the
reference approach, particularly when statistical guarantees are sought to
justify variable inclusion. It is often implemented with variable permutation
schemes. On the flip side, these approaches risk misidentifying unimportant
variables as important in the presence of correlations among covariates. Here
we develop a systematic approach for studying Conditional Permutation
Importance (CPI) that is model agnostic and computationally lean, as well as
reusable benchmarks of state-of-the-art variable importance estimators. We show
theoretically and empirically that $\textit{CPI}$ overcomes the limitations of
standard permutation importance by providing accurate type-I error control.
When used with a deep neural network, $\textit{CPI}$ consistently showed top
accuracy across benchmarks. An empirical benchmark on real-world data analysis
in a large-scale medical dataset showed that $\textit{CPI}$ provides a more
parsimonious selection of statistically significant variables. Our results
suggest that $\textit{CPI}$ can be readily used as drop-in replacement for

medicine and decision support systems through the analysis of whole slide
images. It has the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of
cancer. However, a major challenge to this objective is that for many specific
computational pathology tasks the amount of data is inadequate for development.
To address this challenge, we created Virchow, a 632 million parameter deep
neural network foundation model for computational pathology. Using
self-supervised learning, Virchow is trained on 1.5 million hematoxylin and
eosin stained whole slide images from diverse tissue groups, which is orders of
magnitude more data than previous works. When evaluated on downstream tasks
including tile-level pan-cancer detection and subtyping and slide-level
biomarker prediction, Virchow outperforms state-of-the-art systems both on
internal datasets drawn from the same population as the pretraining data as
well as external public datasets. Virchow achieves 93% balanced accuracy for
pancancer tile classification, and AUCs of 0.983 for colon microsatellite
instability status prediction and 0.967 for breast CDH1 status prediction. The
gains in performance highlight the importance of pretraining on massive
pathology image datasets, suggesting pretraining on even larger datasets could
continue improving performance for many high-impact applications where limited

potential in zero-shot transferability to downstream tasks. However, to attain
optimal performance, the manual selection of prompts is necessary to improve
alignment between the downstream image distribution and the textual class
descriptions. This manual prompt engineering is the major challenge for
deploying such models in practice since it requires domain expertise and is
extremely time-consuming. To avoid non-trivial prompt engineering, recent work
Context Optimization (CoOp) introduced the concept of prompt learning to the
vision domain using learnable textual tokens. While CoOp can achieve
substantial improvements over manual prompts, its learned context is worse
generalizable to wider unseen classes within the same dataset. In this work, we
present Prompt Learning with Reparameterization Encoder (PRE) - a simple and
efficient method that enhances the generalization ability of the learnable
prompt to unseen classes while maintaining the capacity to learn Base classes.
Instead of directly optimizing the prompts, PRE employs a prompt encoder to
reparameterize the input prompt embeddings, enhancing the exploration of
task-specific knowledge from few-shot samples. Experiments and extensive
ablation studies on 8 benchmarks demonstrate that our approach is an efficient
method for prompt learning. Specifically, PRE achieves a notable enhancement of
5.60% in average accuracy on New classes and 3% in Harmonic mean compared to
CoOp in the 16-shot setting, all achieved within a good training time.]]></summary>

Transformer-level performance in natural language modeling and long-range
modeling while offering rapid parallel training and constant inference costs.
With the resurged interest in LRNNs, we study whether they can learn the hidden
rules in training sequences, such as the grammatical structures of regular
language. We theoretically analyze some existing LRNNs and discover their
limitations on regular language. Motivated by the analysis, we propose a new
LRNN equipped with a block-diagonal and input-dependent transition matrix.

Learning (SSL) methods for time series analysis have demonstrated their
effectiveness in encoding the inherent static characteristics of temporal data.

diseases within a confined subject cohort. Introducing Distilled Encoding
Beyond Similarities (DEBS), this paper pioneers an SSL approach that transcends
mere similarities by integrating dissimilarities among positive pairs. The
framework is applied to electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, leading to a notable
enhancement of +10\% in the detection accuracy of Atrial Fibrillation (AFib)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The main premise of federated learning (FL) is that machine learning model
updates are computed locally to preserve user data privacy. This approach
avoids by design user data to ever leave the perimeter of their device. Once
the updates aggregated, the model is broadcast to all nodes in the federation.
However, without proper defenses, compromised nodes can probe the model inside
their local memory in search for adversarial examples, which can lead to
dangerous real-world scenarios. For instance, in image-based applications,
adversarial examples consist of images slightly perturbed to the human eye
getting misclassified by the local model. These adversarial images are then
later presented to a victim node's counterpart model to replay the attack.
Typical examples harness dissemination strategies such as altered traffic signs
(patch attacks) no longer recognized by autonomous vehicles or seemingly
unaltered samples that poison the local dataset of the FL scheme to undermine
its robustness. Pelta is a novel shielding mechanism leveraging Trusted
Execution Environments (TEEs) that reduce the ability of attackers to craft
adversarial samples. Pelta masks inside the TEE the first part of the
back-propagation chain rule, typically exploited by attackers to craft the
malicious samples. We evaluate Pelta on state-of-the-art accurate models using
three well-established datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet. We show the
effectiveness of Pelta in mitigating six white-box state-of-the-art adversarial
attacks, such as Projected Gradient Descent, Momentum Iterative Method, Auto
Projected Gradient Descent, the Carlini & Wagner attack. In particular, Pelta
constitutes the first attempt at defending an ensemble model against the
Self-Attention Gradient attack to the best of our knowledge. Our code is

them to a new family of weighted adjacency matrices. We prove that when a

corresponding CSOs converge to that of the limit complexon. These results hint
at learning transferability on large simplicial complexes or simplicial complex

multiple machine learning models able to classify different health conditions.
Our method combines Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and spectral analysis to

cardiovascular and respiratory patterns, making our approach apart in its
departure from conventional audio feature extraction practices. We use Power
Spectral Density analysis and filtering techniques to select Intrinsic Mode
Functions (IMFs) strongly correlated with underlying physiological phenomena.
These biosignals undergo a comprehensive feature extraction process for
predictive modeling. Initially, we deploy a binary classification model that
demonstrates a balanced accuracy of 87% in distinguishing between healthy and
diseased individuals. Subsequently, we employ a six-class classification model
that achieves a balanced accuracy of 72% in diagnosing specific respiratory
conditions like pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). For
the first time, we also introduce regression models that estimate age and body

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unsupervised contrastive learning methods have recently seen significant
improvements, particularly through data augmentation strategies that aim to
produce robust and generalizable representations. However, prevailing data
augmentation methods, whether hand designed or based on foundation models, tend
to rely heavily on prior knowledge or external data. This dependence often
compromises their effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the applicability
of most existing data augmentation strategies is limited when transitioning to
other research domains, especially science-related data. This limitation stems
from the paucity of prior knowledge and labeled data available in these
domains. To address these challenges, we introduce DiffAug-a novel and
efficient Diffusion-based data Augmentation technique. DiffAug aims to ensure
that the augmented and original data share a smoothed latent space, which is
achieved through diffusion steps. Uniquely, unlike traditional methods, DiffAug
first mines sufficient prior semantic knowledge about the neighborhood. This
provides a constraint to guide the diffusion steps, eliminating the need for
labels, external data/models, or prior knowledge. Designed as an
architecture-agnostic framework, DiffAug provides consistent improvements.
Specifically, it improves image classification and clustering accuracy by
1.6%~4.5%. When applied to biological data, DiffAug improves performance by up
to 10.1%, with an average improvement of 5.8%. DiffAug shows good performance

grid operation. In this work, we propose a practical yet robust detection
approach that utilizes only readily available voltage magnitudes, eliminating

many existing detection methods based on change-point detection require prior
knowledge of outage patterns, which are unknown for real-world outage
scenarios. To remove this impractical requirement, we propose a data-driven
method to learn the parameters of the post-outage distribution through gradient
descent. However, directly using gradient descent presents feasibility issues.
To address this, we modify our approach by adding a Bregman divergence
constraint to control the trajectory of the parameter updates, which eliminates
the feasibility problems. As timely operation is the key nowadays, we prove
that the optimal parameters can be learned with convergence guarantees via
leveraging the statistical and physical properties of voltage data. We evaluate
our approach using many representative distribution grids and real load
profiles with 17 outage configurations. The results show that we can detect and
localize the outage in a timely manner with only voltage magnitudes and without

synergistically combines domain-aware and interpretable models with agnostic
machine learning techniques. In this work, we introduce GOKU-UI, an evolution

model's spectrum to incorporate other classes of differential equations, such
as Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), but also integrates attention
mechanisms and a novel multiple shooting training strategy in the latent space.
These modifications have led to a significant increase in its performance in
both reconstruction and forecast tasks, as demonstrated by our evaluation of
simulated and empirical data. Specifically, GOKU-UI outperformed all baseline
models on synthetic datasets even with a training set 16-fold smaller,
underscoring its remarkable data efficiency. Furthermore, when applied to
empirical human brain data, while incorporating stochastic Stuart-Landau
oscillators into its dynamical core, our proposed enhancements markedly
increased the model's effectiveness in capturing complex brain dynamics. This
augmented version not only surpassed all baseline methods in the reconstruction
task, but also demonstrated lower prediction error of future brain activity up
to 15 seconds ahead. By training GOKU-UI on resting state fMRI data, we encoded
whole-brain dynamics into a latent representation, learning a low-dimensional
dynamical system model that could offer insights into brain functionality and
open avenues for practical applications such as the classification of mental

behaviors, which are more suitable to be described by stochastic differential
equations under non-Gaussian L\'evy noise. Among these complex phenomena, the
most likely transition paths between metastable states are important since
these rare events may have a high impact in certain scenarios. Based on the
large deviation principle, the most likely transition path could be treated as
the minimizer of the rate function upon paths that connect two points. One of
the challenges to calculate the most likely transition path for stochastic
dynamical systems under non-Gaussian L\'evy noise is that the associated rate
function can not be explicitly expressed by paths. For this reason, we
formulate an optimal control problem to obtain the optimal state as the most
likely transition path. We then develop a neural network method to solve this
issue. Several experiments are investigated for both Gaussian and non-Gaussian
cases.]]></summary>

thriving research domain, particularly in the context of brain-computer
interfaces. Our study presents an innovative method that employs to classify
and reconstruct images from the ImageNet dataset using electroencephalography
(EEG) data from subjects that had viewed the images themselves (i.e. "brain
decoding"). We analyzed EEG recordings from 6 participants, each exposed to 50
images spanning 40 unique semantic categories. These EEG readings were
converted into spectrograms, which were then used to train a convolutional
neural network (CNN), integrated with a knowledge distillation procedure based
on a pre-trained Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP)-based image
classification teacher network. This strategy allowed our model to attain a
top-5 accuracy of 80%, significantly outperforming a standard CNN and various
RNN-based benchmarks. Additionally, we incorporated an image reconstruction
mechanism based on pre-trained latent diffusion models, which allowed us to
generate an estimate of the images which had elicited EEG activity. Therefore,
our architecture not only decodes images from neural activity but also offers a
credible image reconstruction from EEG only, paving the way for e.g. swift,
individualized feedback experiments. Our research represents a significant step
forward in connecting neural signals with visual cognition.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quantile Regression (QR) can be used to estimate aleatoric uncertainty in
deep neural networks and can generate prediction intervals. Quantifying
uncertainty is particularly important in critical applications such as clinical
diagnosis, where a realistic assessment of uncertainty is essential in
determining disease status and planning the appropriate treatment. The most
common application of quantile regression models is in cases where the
parametric likelihood cannot be specified. Although quantile regression is
quite robust to outlier response observations, it can be sensitive to outlier
covariate observations (features). Outlier features can compromise the
performance of deep learning regression problems such as style translation,
image reconstruction, and deep anomaly detection, potentially leading to
misleading conclusions. To address this problem, we propose a robust solution
for quantile regression that incorporates concepts from robust divergence. We
compare the performance of our proposed method with (i) least trimmed quantile
regression and (ii) robust regression based on the regularization of
case-specific parameters in a simple real dataset in the presence of outlier.
These methods have not been applied in a deep learning framework. We also
demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method by applying it to a
medical imaging translation task using diffusion models.]]></summary>

high-dimensional data in one domain, e.g., genetic data, to high dimensional
data in a second domain, e.g., brain imaging data. The standard approach in the
area are mass univariate analyses across genetic factors and imaging
phenotypes. That entails executing one genome-wide association study (GWAS) for
each pre-defined imaging measure. Although this approach has been tremendously
successful, one shortcoming is that phenotypes must be pre-defined.
Consequently, effects that are not confined to pre-selected regions of interest
or that reflect larger brain-wide patterns can easily be missed. In this work
we introduce a Partial Least Squares (PLS)-based framework, which we term
Cluster-Bootstrap PLS (CLUB-PLS), that can work with large input dimensions in
both domains as well as with large sample sizes. One key factor of the
framework is to use cluster bootstrap to provide robust statistics for single
input features in both domains. We applied CLUB-PLS to investigating the
genetic basis of surface area and cortical thickness in a sample of 33,000
subjects from the UK Biobank. We found 107 genome-wide significant
locus-phenotype pairs that are linked to 386 different genes. We found that a
vast majority of these loci could be technically validated at a high rate:
using classic GWAS or Genome-Wide Inferred Statistics (GWIS) we found that 85
locus-phenotype pairs exceeded the genome-wide suggestive (P<1e-05) threshold.]]></summary>

Models others propose are often time-consuming and lack sufficient accuracy,

global score functions. However, if local variables have direct and indirect
dependence simultaneously, the global optimization on score functions misses
edges between variables with indirect dependent relationship, of which scores
are smaller than those with direct dependent relationship. In this paper, we
present an identifiability condition based on a determined subset of parents to
identify the underlying DAG. By the identifiability condition, we develop a
two-phase algorithm namely optimal-tuning (OT) algorithm to locally amend the
global optimization. In the optimal phase, an optimization problem based on
first-order Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) gives an estimated
skeleton as the initial determined parents subset. In the tuning phase, the
skeleton is locally tuned by deletion, addition and DAG-formalization
strategies using the theoretically proved incremental properties of high-order
HSIC. Numerical experiments for different synthetic datasets and real-world
datasets show that the OT algorithm outperforms existing methods. Especially in
Sigmoid Mix model with the size of the graph being ${\rm\bf d=40}$, the
structure intervention distance (SID) of the OT algorithm is 329.7 smaller than
the one obtained by CAM, which indicates that the graph estimated by the OT

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sleep, a fundamental physiological process, occupies a significant portion of
our lives. Accurate classification of sleep stages serves as a crucial tool for
evaluating sleep quality and identifying probable sleep disorders. This work
introduces a novel methodology that utilises a SE-Resnet-Bi-LSTM architecture
to classify sleep into five separate stages. The classification process is
based on the analysis of single-channel electroencephalograms (EEGs). The
framework that has been suggested consists of two fundamental elements: a
feature extractor that utilises SE-ResNet, and a temporal context encoder that
use stacks of Bi-LSTM units.The effectiveness of our approach is substantiated
by thorough assessments conducted on three different datasets, namely
SLeepEDF-20, SleepEDF-78, and SHHS. Significantly, our methodology attains
notable levels of accuracy, specifically 87.5\%, 83.9\%, and 87.8\%, along with
macro-F1 scores of 82.5, 78.9, and 81.9 for the corresponding datasets.
Notably, we introduce the utilization of 1D-GradCAM visualization to shed light
on the decision-making process of our model in the realm of sleep stage
classification. This visualization method not only provides valuable insights
into the model's classification rationale but also aligns its outcomes with the
annotations made by sleep experts. One notable feature of our research is the
integration of an expedited training approach, which effectively preserves the
model's resilience in terms of performance. The experimental evaluations
conducted provide a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of our
proposed model in comparison to existing approaches, highlighting its potential
for practical applications.]]></summary>

acoustic units. This framework employs text in different source languages as
input to generate speech in the target language without the need for text

previous works for direct speech to speech translation systems, we use the same
pipeline to extract the acoustic units using a speech encoder combined with a
clustering algorithm. Once units are obtained, an encoder-decoder architecture
is trained to predict them. Then a vocoder generates speech from units. Our
approach for direct text to speech translation was tested on the new CVSS
corpus with two different text mBART models employed as initialisation. The
systems presented report competitive performance for most of the language pairs
evaluated. Besides, results show a remarkable improvement when initialising our
proposed architecture with a model pre-trained with more languages.]]></summary>

requires skilled content creators. There have been impressive improvements in
using machine learning to address different aspects of generating 3D content,
such as generating meshes, arranging geometry, synthesizing textures, etc. In
this paper we develop a model to generate Bidirectional Reflectance
Distribution Functions (BRDFs) from descriptive textual prompts. BRDFs are four
dimensional probability distributions that characterize the interaction of
light with surface materials. They are either represented parametrically, or by
tabulating the probability density associated with every pair of incident and
outgoing angles. The former lends itself to artistic editing while the latter
is used when measuring the appearance of real materials. Numerous works have
focused on hypothesizing BRDF models from images of materials. We learn a
mapping from textual descriptions of materials to parametric BRDFs. Our model
is first trained using a semi-supervised approach before being tuned via an
unsupervised scheme. Although our model is general, in this paper we
specifically generate parameters for MDL materials, conditioned on natural
language descriptions, within NVIDIA's Omniverse platform. This enables use
cases such as real-time text prompts to change materials of objects in 3D
environments such as "dull plastic" or "shiny iron". Since the output of our
model is a parametric BRDF, rather than an image of the material, it may be
used to render materials using any shape under arbitrarily specified viewing
and lighting conditions.]]></summary>

prevails to deliver high-performance task-specific models and can even learn
general task-agnostic representations for efficient finetuning to downstream
tasks. However, deep learning in resource-limited domains still faces multiple
challenges including (i) limited data, (ii) constrained model development cost,
and (iii) lack of adequate pre-trained models for effective finetuning. This
paper provides an overview of model reprogramming to bridge this gap. Model
reprogramming enables resource-efficient cross-domain machine learning by
repurposing and reusing a well-developed pre-trained model from a source domain
to solve tasks in a target domain without model finetuning, where the source
and target domains can be vastly different. In many applications, model
reprogramming outperforms transfer learning and training from scratch. This
paper elucidates the methodology of model reprogramming, summarizes existing
use cases, provides a theoretical explanation of the success of model
reprogramming, and concludes with a discussion on open-ended research questions
and opportunities. A list of model reprogramming studies is actively maintained

research for decades. One widely used methodology for this purpose is sparse
regression for nonlinear dynamics, known as SINDy. Despite several attempts,
noisy and scarce data still pose a severe challenge to the success of the SINDy
approach. In this work, we discuss a robust method to discover nonlinear
governing equations from noisy and scarce data. To do this, we make use of
neural networks to learn an implicit representation based on measurement data
so that not only it produces the output in the vicinity of the measurements but
also the time-evolution of output can be described by a dynamical system.
Additionally, we learn such a dynamic system in the spirit of the SINDy
framework. Leveraging the implicit representation using neural networks, we
obtain the derivative information -- required for SINDy -- using an automatic
differentiation tool. To enhance the robustness of our methodology, we further
incorporate an integral condition on the output of the implicit networks.
Furthermore, we extend our methodology to handle data collected from multiple
initial conditions. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methodology
to discover governing equations under noisy and scarce data regimes by means of
several examples and compare its performance with existing methods.]]></summary>

event-driven neural dynamics whose energy consumption depends on the number of
spikes exchanged between neurons over the course of the input presentation. In
typical implementations of an SNN classifier, decisions are produced after the
entire input sequence has been processed, resulting in latency and energy
consumption levels that are fairly uniform across inputs. Recently introduced
delay-adaptive SNNs tailor the inference latency -- and, with it, the energy
consumption -- to the difficulty of each example, by producing an early
decision when the SNN model is sufficiently ``confident''. In this paper, we
start by observing that, as an SNN processes input samples, its classification
decisions tend to be first under-confident and then over-confident with respect
to the decision's ground-truth, unknown, test accuracy. This makes it difficult
to determine a stopping time that ensures a desired level of accuracy. To
address this problem, we introduce a novel delay-adaptive SNN-based inference
methodology that, wrapping around any pre-trained SNN classifier, provides
guaranteed reliability for the decisions produced at input-dependent stopping
times. The approach entails minimal added complexity as compared to the
underlying SNN, requiring only thresholding and counting operations at run
time, and it leverages tools from conformal prediction (CP).]]></summary>

advancements in allowing Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason through
foresight and backtracking for global decision-making, it has overlooked the

These local uncertainties, intrinsic to LLMs given their potential for diverse
responses, remain a significant concern in the reasoning process. Addressing
this pivotal gap, we introduce the Tree of Uncertain Thoughts (TouT) - a
reasoning framework tailored for LLMs. Our TouT effectively leverages Monte
Carlo Dropout to quantify uncertainty scores associated with LLMs' diverse
local responses at these intermediate steps. By marrying this local uncertainty
quantification with global search algorithms, TouT enhances the model's
precision in response generation. We substantiate our approach with rigorous
experiments on two demanding planning tasks: Game of 24 and Mini Crosswords.

attacks, but are often tailored to one type of model or attack. The lack of
information on unknown potential attacks makes detecting adversarial examples
challenging. Additionally, attackers do not need to follow the rules made by
the defender. To address this problem, we take inspiration from the concept of
Applicability Domain in cheminformatics. Cheminformatics models struggle to
make accurate predictions because only a limited number of compounds are known
and available for training. Applicability Domain defines a domain based on the
known compounds and rejects any unknown compound that falls outside the domain.
Similarly, adversarial examples start as harmless inputs, but can be
manipulated to evade reliable classification by moving outside the domain of
the classifier. We are the first to identify the similarity between
Applicability Domain and adversarial detection. Instead of focusing on unknown
attacks, we focus on what is known, the training data. We propose a simple yet
robust triple-stage data-driven framework that checks the input globally and
locally, and confirms that they are coherent with the model's output. This
framework can be applied to any classification model and is not limited to
specific attacks. We demonstrate these three stages work as one unit,
effectively detecting various attacks, even for a white-box scenario.]]></summary>

setting where distributional shift exists among clients and some have unlabeled
data. The proposed framework, FedDaDiL, tackles the resulting challenge through
dictionary learning of empirical distributions. In our setting, clients'
distributions represent particular domains, and FedDaDiL collectively trains a
federated dictionary of empirical distributions. In particular, we build upon
the Dataset Dictionary Learning framework by designing collaborative
communication protocols and aggregation operations. The chosen protocols keep
clients' data private, thus enhancing overall privacy compared to its
centralized counterpart. We empirically demonstrate that our approach
successfully generates labeled data on the target domain with extensive
experiments on (i) Caltech-Office, (ii) TEP, and (iii) CWRU benchmarks.
Furthermore, we compare our method to its centralized counterpart and other

optimization tasks involving unknown high-dimensional (black-box) functions
that map a set of controllable variables to the outcomes of an expensive
experiment. Bayesian Optimization (BO) techniques are known to be effective in
tackling global optimization problems using a relatively small number objective
function evaluations, but their performance suffers when dealing with
high-dimensional outputs. To overcome the major challenge of dimensionality,
here we propose a deep learning framework for BO and sequential decision making
based on bootstrapped ensembles of neural architectures with randomized priors.
Using appropriate architecture choices, we show that the proposed framework can
approximate functional relationships between design variables and quantities of
interest, even in cases where the latter take values in high-dimensional vector
spaces or even infinite-dimensional function spaces. In the context of BO, we
augmented the proposed probabilistic surrogates with re-parameterized Monte
Carlo approximations of multiple-point (parallel) acquisition functions, as
well as methodological extensions for accommodating black-box constraints and
multi-fidelity information sources. We test the proposed framework against
state-of-the-art methods for BO and demonstrate superior performance across
several challenging tasks with high-dimensional outputs, including a
constrained multi-fidelity optimization task involving shape optimization of

remains a significant challenge, especially when encountering noisy
observations and no prior knowledge available. This study proposes R-DISCOVER,
a framework designed to robustly uncover open-form partial differential
equations (PDEs) from limited and noisy data. The framework operates through
two alternating update processes: discovering and embedding. The discovering
phase employs symbolic representation and a reinforcement learning (RL)-guided
hybrid PDE generator to efficiently produce diverse open-form PDEs with tree
structures. A neural network-based predictive model fits the system response
and serves as the reward evaluator for the generated PDEs. PDEs with superior
fits are utilized to iteratively optimize the generator via the RL method and
the best-performing PDE is selected by a parameter-free stability metric. The
embedding phase integrates the initially identified PDE from the discovering
process as a physical constraint into the predictive model for robust training.
The traversal of PDE trees automates the construction of the computational
graph and the embedding process without human intervention. Numerical
experiments demonstrate our framework's capability to uncover governing
equations from nonlinear dynamic systems with limited and highly noisy data and
outperform other physics-informed neural network-based discovery methods. This
work opens new potential for exploring real-world systems with limited

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance
in various vision-related tasks. The success of ViTs motivates adversaries to
perform backdoor attacks on ViTs. Although the vulnerability of traditional
CNNs to backdoor attacks is well-known, backdoor attacks on ViTs are
seldom-studied. Compared to CNNs capturing pixel-wise local features by
convolutions, ViTs extract global context information through patches and
attentions. Na\"ively transplanting CNN-specific backdoor attacks to ViTs
yields only a low clean data accuracy and a low attack success rate. In this
paper, we propose a stealth and practical ViT-specific backdoor attack
$TrojViT$. Rather than an area-wise trigger used by CNN-specific backdoor
attacks, TrojViT generates a patch-wise trigger designed to build a Trojan
composed of some vulnerable bits on the parameters of a ViT stored in DRAM
memory through patch salience ranking and attention-target loss. TrojViT
further uses minimum-tuned parameter update to reduce the bit number of the
Trojan. Once the attacker inserts the Trojan into the ViT model by flipping the
vulnerable bits, the ViT model still produces normal inference accuracy with
benign inputs. But when the attacker embeds a trigger into an input, the ViT
model is forced to classify the input to a predefined target class. We show
that flipping only few vulnerable bits identified by TrojViT on a ViT model
using the well-known RowHammer can transform the model into a backdoored one.
We perform extensive experiments of multiple datasets on various ViT models.
TrojViT can classify $99.64\%$ of test images to a target class by flipping
$345$ bits on a ViT for ImageNet.Our codes are available at

network control algorithms as one of its core capabilities. Data-driven
applications incorporate such algorithms to optimize radio access network (RAN)
functions via RAN intelligent controllers (RICs). Deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) algorithms are among the main approaches adopted in the O-RAN literature
to solve dynamic radio resource management problems. However, despite the
benefits introduced by the O-RAN RICs, the practical adoption of DRL algorithms
in real network deployments falls behind. This is primarily due to the slow
convergence and unstable performance exhibited by DRL agents upon deployment
and when facing previously unseen network conditions. In this paper, we address
these challenges by proposing transfer learning (TL) as a core component of the
training and deployment workflows for the DRL-based closed-loop control of
O-RAN functionalities. To this end, we propose and design a hybrid TL-aided
approach that leverages the advantages of both policy reuse and distillation TL
methods to provide safe and accelerated convergence in DRL-based O-RAN slicing.
We conduct a thorough experiment that accommodates multiple services, including
real VR gaming traffic to reflect practical scenarios of O-RAN slicing. We also
propose and implement policy reuse and distillation-aided DRL and non-TL-aided
DRL as three separate baselines. The proposed hybrid approach shows at least:
7.7% and 20.7% improvements in the average initial reward value and the
percentage of converged scenarios, and a 64.6% decrease in reward variance
while maintaining fast convergence and enhancing the generalizability compared
with the baselines.]]></summary>

On the one hand, the first considers adapting multiple heterogeneous labeled

attacks the problem of synthesizing a small summary containing all the
information about the datasets. We thus consider a new problem called MSDA-DD.
To solve it, we adapt previous works in the MSDA literature, such as
Wasserstein Barycenter Transport and Dataset Dictionary Learning, as well as DD
method Distribution Matching. We thoroughly experiment with this novel problem
on four benchmarks (Caltech-Office 10, Tennessee-Eastman Process, Continuous

unlike the usual regularization parameters, can induce posterior collapse
regardless of the dataset size. Thus, beta is a risky parameter that requires

mixture without prior knowledge of the sources or the mixing system. This is a
challenging problem that often requires making restrictive assumptions about
both the mixing system and the sources. In this paper, we propose a novel
method for addressing BSS of non-linear mixtures by leveraging the natural
feature subspace specialization ability of multi-encoder autoencoders with
fully self-supervised learning without strong priors. During the training
phase, our method unmixes the input into the separate encoding spaces of the
multi-encoder network and then remixes these representations within the decoder
for a reconstruction of the input. Then to perform source inference, we
introduce a novel encoding masking technique whereby masking out all but one of
the encodings enables the decoder to estimate a source signal. To this end, we
also introduce a so-called pathway separation loss that encourages sparsity
between the unmixed encoding spaces throughout the decoder's layers and a
so-called zero reconstruction loss on the decoder for coherent source
estimations. In order to carefully evaluate our method, we conduct experiments
on a toy dataset and with real-world biosignal recordings from a
polysomnography sleep study for extracting respiration.]]></summary>

beta. As the beta increases, the length of the plateau extends and then becomes
infinite beyond a certain beta threshold. This implies that the choice of beta,
unlike the usual regularization parameters, can induce posterior collapse
regardless of the dataset size. Thus, beta is a risky parameter that requires
careful tuning. Furthermore, considering the dataset-size dependence on the
rate-distortion curve, a relatively large dataset is required to obtain a
rate-distortion curve with high rates. Extensive numerical experiments support
our analysis.]]></summary>

sequential decision-making tasks, showcasing empirical quantum advantages. A
notable development is through quantum recurrent neural networks (QRNNs) for
memory-intensive tasks such as partially observable environments. However, QRL
models incorporating QRNN encounter challenges such as inefficient training of
QRL with QRNN, given that the computation of gradients in QRNN is both
computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work presents a novel
approach to address this challenge by constructing QRL agents utilizing
QRNN-based reservoirs, specifically employing quantum long short-term memory
(QLSTM). QLSTM parameters are randomly initialized and fixed without training.
The model is trained using the asynchronous advantage actor-aritic (A3C)
algorithm. Through numerical simulations, we validate the efficacy of our
QLSTM-Reservoir RL framework. Its performance is assessed on standard
benchmarks, demonstrating comparable results to a fully trained QLSTM RL model
with identical architecture and training settings.]]></summary>

shown to belong to the powerful Hilbertian family of (firmly) nonexpansive

experimental data will speed up the pace of scientific discovery. Previous
randomized algorithms exploit sparsity in PDE updates for acceleration. However
such methods are applicable to a limited class of decomposable PDEs, which have
sparse features in the value domain. We propose Reel, which accelerates the
learning of PDEs via random projection and has much broader applicability. Reel
exploits the sparsity by decomposing dense updates into sparse ones in both the
value and frequency domains. This decomposition enables efficient learning when
the source of the updates consists of gradually changing terms across large
areas (sparse in the frequency domain) in addition to a few rapid updates
concentrated in a small set of "interfacial" regions (sparse in the value
domain). Random projection is then applied to compress the sparse signals for
learning. To expand the model applicability, Taylor series expansion is used in
Reel to approximate the nonlinear PDE updates with polynomials in the
decomposable form. Theoretically, we derive a constant factor approximation
between the projected loss function and the original one with poly-logarithmic
number of projected dimensions. Experimentally, we provide empirical evidence
that our proposed Reel can lead to faster learning of PDE models (70-98%
reduction in training time when the data is compressed to 1% of its original

genomic studies to identify differentially expressed genes. However, due to
unmeasured confounders, many standard statistical approaches may be
substantially biased. This paper investigates the large-scale hypothesis
testing problem for multivariate generalized linear models in the presence of
confounding effects. Under arbitrary confounding mechanisms, we propose a
unified statistical estimation and inference framework that harnesses
orthogonal structures and integrates linear projections into three key stages.
It first leverages multivariate responses to separate marginal and uncorrelated
confounding effects, recovering the confounding coefficients' column space.
Subsequently, latent factors and primary effects are jointly estimated,
utilizing $\ell_1$-regularization for sparsity while imposing orthogonality
onto confounding coefficients. Finally, we incorporate projected and weighted
bias-correction steps for hypothesis testing. Theoretically, we establish
various effects' identification conditions and non-asymptotic error bounds. We
show effective Type-I error control of asymptotic $z$-tests as sample and
response sizes approach infinity. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method controls the false discovery rate by the Benjamini-Hochberg
procedure and is more powerful than alternative methods. By comparing
single-cell RNA-seq counts from two groups of samples, we demonstrate the
suitability of adjusting confounding effects when significant covariates are

multi-label scenario (MLZSL), wherein, the model is trained to recognize
multiple unseen classes within a sample (e.g., an image) based on seen classes
and auxiliary knowledge, e.g., semantic information. Existing methods usually
resort to analyzing the relationship of various seen classes residing in a
sample from the dimension of spatial or semantic characteristics, and transfer
the learned model to unseen ones. But they ignore the effective integration of
local and global features. That is, in the process of inferring unseen classes,
global features represent the principal direction of the image in the feature
space, while local features should maintain uniqueness within a certain range.
This integrated neglect will make the model lose its grasp of the main
components of the image. Relying only on the local existence of seen classes
during the inference stage introduces unavoidable bias. In this paper, we
propose a novel and effective group bi-enhancement framework for MLZSL, dubbed
GBE-MLZSL, to fully make use of such properties and enable a more accurate and
robust visual-semantic projection. Specifically, we split the feature maps into
several feature groups, of which each feature group can be trained
independently with the Local Information Distinguishing Module (LID) to ensure
uniqueness. Meanwhile, a Global Enhancement Module (GEM) is designed to
preserve the principal direction. Besides, a static graph structure is designed
to construct the correlation of local features. Experiments on large-scale
MLZSL benchmark datasets NUS-WIDE and Open-Images-v4 demonstrate that the
proposed GBE-MLZSL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods with large

quantum circuits with SU$(d)$-symmetry, building on and significantly
generalizing Jordan's Permutational Quantum Computing (PQC) formalism based on
Schur-Weyl duality connecting both SU$(d)$ and $S_n$ actions on qudits. In
particular, we utilize the Okounkov-Vershik approach to prove Harrow's
statement (Ph.D. Thesis 2005 p.160) on the equivalence between
$\operatorname{SU}(d)$ and $S_n$ irrep bases and to establish the
$S_n$-equivariant Convolutional Quantum Alternating Ans\"atze ($S_n$-CQA) using
Young-Jucys-Murphy (YJM) elements. We prove that $S_n$-CQA is able to generate
any unitary in any given $S_n$ irrep sector, which may serve as a universal
model for a wide array of quantum machine learning problems with the presence
of SU($d$) symmetry. Our method provides another way to prove the universality
of Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and verifies that 4-local
SU($d$) symmetric unitaries are sufficient to build generic SU($d$) symmetric
quantum circuits up to relative phase factors. We present numerical simulations
to showcase the effectiveness of the ans\"atze to find the ground state energy
of the $J_1$--$J_2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the rectangular and
Kagome lattices. Our work provides the first application of the celebrated
Okounkov-Vershik's $S_n$ representation theory to quantum physics and machine
learning, from which to propose quantum variational ans\"atze that strongly
suggests to be classically intractable tailored towards a specific optimization

executing action sequences for robots to accomplish long-horizon tasks in
physical environments. In this work, we introduce EmbodiedGPT, an end-to-end
multi-modal foundation model for embodied AI, empowering embodied agents with
multi-modal understanding and execution capabilities. To achieve this, we have
made the following efforts: (i) We craft a large-scale embodied planning
dataset, termed EgoCOT. The dataset consists of carefully selected videos from
the Ego4D dataset, along with corresponding high-quality language instructions.
Specifically, we generate a sequence of sub-goals with the "Chain of Thoughts"
mode for effective embodied planning. (ii) We introduce an efficient training
approach to EmbodiedGPT for high-quality plan generation, by adapting a 7B
large language model (LLM) to the EgoCOT dataset via prefix tuning. (iii) We
introduce a paradigm for extracting task-related features from LLM-generated
planning queries to form a closed loop between high-level planning and
low-level control. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of EmbodiedGPT
on embodied tasks, including embodied planning, embodied control, visual
captioning, and visual question answering. Notably, EmbodiedGPT significantly
enhances the success rate of the embodied control task by extracting more
effective features. It has achieved a remarkable 1.6 times increase in success
rate on the Franka Kitchen benchmark and a 1.3 times increase on the Meta-World
benchmark, compared to the BLIP-2 baseline fine-tuned with the Ego4D dataset.]]></summary>

individuals globally, and continuous monitoring coupled with automated seizure
detection appears as a necessity for effective patient treatment. To enable
long-term care in daily-life conditions, comfortable and smart wearable devices
with long battery life are required, which in turn set the demand for
resource-constrained and energy-efficient computing solutions. In this context,
the development of machine learning algorithms for seizure detection faces the
challenge of heavily imbalanced datasets. This paper introduces EpiDeNet, a new
lightweight seizure detection network, and Sensitivity-Specificity Weighted
Cross-Entropy (SSWCE), a new loss function that incorporates sensitivity and
specificity, to address the challenge of heavily unbalanced datasets. The
proposed EpiDeNet-SSWCE approach demonstrates the successful detection of
91.16% and 92.00% seizure events on two different datasets (CHB-MIT and
PEDESITE, respectively), with only four EEG channels. A three-window majority
voting-based smoothing scheme combined with the SSWCE loss achieves 3x
reduction of false positives to 1.18 FP/h. EpiDeNet is well suited for
implementation on low-power embedded platforms, and we evaluate its performance
on two ARM Cortex-based platforms (M4F/M7) and two parallel ultra-low power
(PULP) systems (GAP8, GAP9). The most efficient implementation (GAP9) achieves
an energy efficiency of 40 GMAC/s/W, with an energy consumption per inference
of only 0.051 mJ at high performance (726.46 MMAC/s), outperforming the best
ARM Cortex-based solutions by approximately 160x in energy efficiency. The
EpiDeNet-SSWCE method demonstrates effective and accurate seizure detection
performance on heavily imbalanced datasets, while being suited for
implementation on energy-constrained platforms.]]></summary>

avenues for cybersecurity challenges and underscoring the need for robust
intrusion detection systems. However, traditional security systems are designed
with a closed-world perspective and often face challenges in dealing with the
ever-evolving threat landscape, where new and unfamiliar attacks are constantly
emerging. In this paper, we introduce a framework aimed at mitigating the open
set recognition (OSR) problem in the realm of Network Intrusion Detection
Systems (NIDS) tailored for IoT environments. Our framework capitalizes on
image-based representations of packet-level data, extracting spatial and
temporal patterns from network traffic. Additionally, we integrate stacking and
sub-clustering techniques, enabling the identification of unknown attacks by
effectively modeling the complex and diverse nature of benign behavior. The
empirical results prominently underscore the framework's efficacy, boasting an
impressive 88\% detection rate for previously unseen attacks when compared
against existing approaches and recent advancements. Future work will perform
extensive experimentation across various openness levels and attack scenarios,
further strengthening the adaptability and performance of our proposed solution

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In many randomized experiments, the treatment effect of the long-term metric
(i.e. the primary outcome of interest) is often difficult or infeasible to
measure. Such long-term metrics are often slow to react to changes and
sufficiently noisy they are challenging to faithfully estimate in short-horizon
experiments. A common alternative is to measure several short-term proxy
metrics in the hope they closely track the long-term metric -- so they can be
used to effectively guide decision-making in the near-term. We introduce a new
statistical framework to both define and construct an optimal proxy metric for
use in a homogeneous population of randomized experiments. Our procedure first
reduces the construction of an optimal proxy metric in a given experiment to a
portfolio optimization problem which depends on the true latent treatment
effects and noise level of experiment under consideration. We then denoise the
observed treatment effects of the long-term metric and a set of proxies in a
historical corpus of randomized experiments to extract estimates of the latent
treatment effects for use in the optimization problem. One key insight derived
from our approach is that the optimal proxy metric for a given experiment is
not apriori fixed; rather it should depend on the sample size (or effective
noise level) of the randomized experiment for which it is deployed. To
instantiate and evaluate our framework, we employ our methodology in a large
corpus of randomized experiments from an industrial recommendation system and
construct proxy metrics that perform favorably relative to several baselines.]]></summary>

convolution has been applied in a wide range of fields such as traffic flow
prediction. However, current popular works of graph convolution cannot

would limit predictive accuracy. In this paper, a novel Attention-based Dynamic
Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (ADGCRNN) is proposed to improve
traffic flow prediction in highway transportation. Three temporal resolutions
of data sequence are effectively integrated by self-attention to extract
characteristics; multi-dynamic graphs and their weights are dynamically created
to compliantly combine the varying characteristics; a dedicated gated kernel
emphasizing highly relative nodes is introduced on these complete graphs to
reduce overfitting for graph convolution operations. Experiments on two public

of a real Web system prove practical benefit in highway transportation.]]></summary>

evaluated in a series of minigames, in which subjects were required to use
eight gestures to manipulate their game avatar to complete a task. Experimental
results indicated that, relative to baseline, the modified feedback condition

take treatment, so that optimal policy rules are merely suggestions in the
presence of human non-adherence to treatment recommendations. In these same
domains, there may be heterogeneity both in who responds in taking-up
treatment, and heterogeneity in treatment efficacy. While optimal treatment
rules can maximize causal outcomes across the population, access parity
constraints or other fairness considerations can be relevant in the case of
encouragement. For example, in social services, a persistent puzzle is the gap
in take-up of beneficial services among those who may benefit from them the
most. When in addition the decision-maker has distributional preferences over
both access and average outcomes, the optimal decision rule changes. We study
causal identification, statistical variance-reduced estimation, and robust
estimation of optimal treatment rules, including under potential violations of
positivity. We consider fairness constraints such as demographic parity in
treatment take-up, and other constraints, via constrained optimization. Our
framework can be extended to handle algorithmic recommendations under an
often-reasonable covariate-conditional exclusion restriction, using our
robustness checks for lack of positivity in the recommendation. We develop a
two-stage algorithm for solving over parametrized policy classes under general
constraints to obtain variance-sensitive regret bounds. We illustrate the
methods in two case studies based on data from randomized encouragement to

approach is a challenging problem for many data-driven applications. Existing
state-of-the-art methods for unsupervised clustering use different similarity
and distance functions but focus on either spatial or temporal features of the
data. Concentrating on joint deep representation learning of spatial and
temporal features, we propose Deep Spatiotemporal Clustering (DSC), a novel
algorithm for the temporal clustering of high-dimensional spatiotemporal data
using an unsupervised deep learning method. Inspired by the U-net architecture,
DSC utilizes an autoencoder integrating CNN-RNN layers to learn latent
representations of the spatiotemporal data. DSC also includes a unique layer
for cluster assignment on latent representations that uses the Student's
t-distribution. By optimizing the clustering loss and data reconstruction loss
simultaneously, the algorithm gradually improves clustering assignments and the
nonlinear mapping between low-dimensional latent feature space and
high-dimensional original data space. A multivariate spatiotemporal climate
dataset is used to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method. Our extensive
experiments show our approach outperforms both conventional and deep
learning-based unsupervised clustering algorithms. Additionally, we compared
the proposed model with its various variants (CNN encoder, CNN autoencoder,
CNN-RNN encoder, CNN-RNN autoencoder, etc.) to get insight into using both the
CNN and RNN layers in the autoencoder, and our proposed technique outperforms
these variants in terms of clustering results.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In deep learning, the load data with non-temporal factors are difficult to
process by sequence models. This problem results in insufficient precision of
the prediction. Therefore, a short-term load forecasting method based on
convolutional neural network (CNN), self-attention encoder-decoder network
(SAEDN) and residual-refinement (Res) is proposed. In this method, feature
extraction module is composed of a two-dimensional convolutional neural
network, which is used to mine the local correlation between data and obtain
high-dimensional data features. The initial load fore-casting module consists
of a self-attention encoder-decoder network and a feedforward neural network
(FFN). The module utilizes self-attention mechanisms to encode high-dimensional
features. This operation can obtain the global correlation between data.
Therefore, the model is able to retain important information based on the
coupling relationship between the data in data mixed with non-time series
factors. Then, self-attention decoding is per-formed and the feedforward neural
network is used to regression initial load. This paper introduces the residual
mechanism to build the load optimization module. The module generates residual
load values to optimize the initial load. The simulation results show that the
proposed load forecasting method has advantages in terms of prediction accuracy
and prediction stability.]]></summary>

raw signals of nanopore sequencers are converted into nucleotide sequences,
i.e., reads. State-of-the-art basecallers employ complex deep learning models
to achieve high basecalling accuracy. This makes basecalling
computationally-inefficient and memory-hungry; bottlenecking the entire genome
analysis pipeline. However, for many applications, the majority of reads do no
match the reference genome of interest (i.e., target reference) and thus are
discarded in later steps in the genomics pipeline, wasting the basecalling
computation. To overcome this issue, we propose TargetCall, the first
pre-basecalling filter to eliminate the wasted computation in basecalling.
TargetCall's key idea is to discard reads that will not match the target
reference (i.e., off-target reads) prior to basecalling. TargetCall consists of
two main components: (1) LightCall, a lightweight neural network basecaller
that produces noisy reads; and (2) Similarity Check, which labels each of these
noisy reads as on-target or off-target by matching them to the target
reference. TargetCall aims to filter out all off-target reads before
basecalling. The highly-accurate but slow basecalling is performed only on the
raw signals whose noisy reads are labeled as on-target. Our thorough
experimental evaluations using both real and simulated data show that
TargetCall 1) improves the end-to-end basecalling performance while maintaining
high sensitivity in keeping on-target reads, 2) maintains high accuracy in
downstream analysis, 3) precisely filters out up to 94.71% of off-target reads,
and 4) achieves better performance, throughput, sensitivity, precision, and
generality compared to prior works. We open-source TargetCall at

efficiently learn a rich representation of the input. However, for adapting to
downstream tasks, they require a sufficient amount of labeled data since their
rich features code not only objects but also less relevant image background. In
contrast, Instance Discrimination (ID) methods focus on objects. In this work,
we study how to combine the efficiency and scalability of MIM with the ability
of ID to perform downstream classification in the absence of large amounts of
labeled data. To this end, we introduce Masked Autoencoder Contrastive Tuning
(MAE-CT), a sequential approach that utilizes the implicit clustering of the
Nearest Neighbor Contrastive Learning (NNCLR) objective to induce abstraction
in the topmost layers of a pre-trained MAE. MAE-CT tunes the rich features such
that they form semantic clusters of objects without using any labels. Notably,
MAE-CT does not rely on hand-crafted augmentations and frequently achieves its
best performances while using only minimal augmentations (crop & flip).
Further, MAE-CT is compute efficient as it requires at most 10% overhead
compared to MAE re-training. Applied to large and huge Vision Transformer (ViT)
models, MAE-CT excels over previous self-supervised methods trained on ImageNet
in linear probing, k-NN and low-shot classification accuracy as well as in
unsupervised clustering accuracy. With ViT-H/16 MAE-CT achieves a new
state-of-the-art in linear probing of 82.2%.]]></summary>

optimisation space to run efficiently. In geometric quantum machine learning,
one achieves this by encoding group structure into parameterised quantum
circuits to include the symmetries of a problem as an inductive bias. However,
constructing such circuits is challenging as a concrete guiding principle has
yet to emerge. In this paper, we propose the use of spin networks, a form of
directed tensor network invariant under a group transformation, to devise SU(2)
equivariant quantum circuit ans\"atze -- circuits possessing spin rotation
symmetry. By changing to the basis that block diagonalises SU(2) group action,
these networks provide a natural building block for constructing parameterised
equivariant quantum circuits. We prove that our construction is mathematically
equivalent to other known constructions, such as those based on twirling and
generalised permutations, but more direct to implement on quantum hardware. The
efficacy of our constructed circuits is tested by solving the ground state
problem of SU(2) symmetric Heisenberg models on the one-dimensional triangular
lattice and on the Kagome lattice. Our results highlight that our equivariant
circuits boost the performance of quantum variational algorithms, indicating

influences precipitation prediction. It can facilitate accurate and expeditious
forecasting of short-term heavy rainfall bypassing the need for complex
Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models. In comparison to conventional
models, Deep Learning (DL)-based radar echo extrapolation algorithms exhibit
higher effectiveness and efficiency. Nevertheless, the development of reliable
and generalized echo extrapolation algorithm is impeded by three primary
challenges: cumulative error spreading, imprecise representation of sparsely
distributed echoes, and inaccurate description of non-stationary motion
processes. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel radar echo
extrapolation algorithm called Temporal-Spatial Parallel Transformer, referred
to as TempEE. TempEE avoids using auto-regression and instead employs a
one-step forward strategy to prevent cumulative error spreading during the
extrapolation process. Additionally, we propose the incorporation of a
Multi-level Temporal-Spatial Attention mechanism to improve the algorithm's
capability of capturing both global and local information while emphasizing
task-related regions, including sparse echo representations, in an efficient
manner. Furthermore, the algorithm extracts spatio-temporal representations
from continuous echo images using a parallel encoder to model the
non-stationary motion process for echo extrapolation. The superiority of our
TempEE has been demonstrated in the context of the classic radar echo
extrapolation task, utilizing a real-world dataset. Extensive experiments have
further validated the efficacy and indispensability of various components
within TempEE.]]></summary>

programs without actually running them with concrete data, and presents such
information as functions of input data sizes. Most of the analysis tools for
logic programs (and other languages) are based on setting up recurrence
relations representing (bounds on) the computational cost of predicates, and
solving them to find closed-form functions that are equivalent to (or a bound
on) them. Such recurrence solving is a bottleneck in current tools: many of the
recurrences that arise during the analysis cannot be solved with current
solvers, such as Computer Algebra Systems (CASs), so that specific methods for
different classes of recurrences need to be developed. We address such a
challenge by developing a novel, general approach for solving arbitrary,
constrained recurrence relations, that uses machine-learning sparse regression
techniques to guess a candidate closed-form function, and a combination of an
SMT-solver and a CAS to check whether such function is actually a solution of
the recurrence. We have implemented a prototype and evaluated it with
recurrences generated by a cost analysis system (the one in CiaoPP). The
experimental results are quite promising, showing that our approach can find
closed-form solutions, in a reasonable time, for classes of recurrences that
cannot be solved by such a system, nor by current CASs.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Historically, much of machine learning research has focused on the
performance of the algorithm alone, but recently more attention has been
focused on optimizing joint human-algorithm performance. Here, we analyze a
specific type of human-algorithm collaboration where the algorithm has access
to a set of $n$ items, and presents a subset of size $k$ to the human, who
selects a final item from among those $k$. This scenario could model content
recommendation, route planning, or any type of labeling task. Because both the
human and algorithm have imperfect, noisy information about the true ordering
of items, the key question is: which value of $k$ maximizes the probability
that the best item will be ultimately selected? For $k=1$, performance is
optimized by the algorithm acting alone, and for $k=n$ it is optimized by the
human acting alone. Surprisingly, we show that for multiple of noise models, it
is optimal to set $k \in [2, n-1]$ - that is, there are strict benefits to
collaborating, even when the human and algorithm have equal accuracy
separately. We demonstrate this theoretically for the Mallows model and
experimentally for the Random Utilities models of noisy permutations. However,
we show this pattern is reversed when the human is anchored on the algorithm's
presented ordering - the joint system always has strictly worse performance. We
extend these results to the case where the human and algorithm differ in their
accuracy levels, showing that there always exist regimes where a more accurate
agent would strictly benefit from collaborating with a less accurate one, but
these regimes are asymmetric between the human and the algorithm's accuracy.]]></summary>

domains, and methods based on machine learning have been widely adopted in the
field to monitor wear and spot defects before they lead to failures. Few
studies, however, have addressed the problem of censored data, in which failure
is not observed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to predict the time
to failure in ball bearings using survival analysis. First, we analyze bearing
data in the frequency domain and annotate when a bearing fails by comparing the
Kullback-Leibler divergence and the standard deviation between its break-in
frequency bins and its break-out frequency bins. Second, we train several
survival models to estimate the time to failure based on the annotated data and
covariates extracted from the time domain, such as skewness, kurtosis and
entropy. The models give a probabilistic prediction of risk over time and allow
us to compare the survival function between groups of bearings. We demonstrate
our approach on the XJTU and PRONOSTIA datasets. On XJTU, the best result is a
0.70 concordance-index and 0.21 integrated Brier score. On PRONOSTIA, the best
is a 0.76 concordance-index and 0.19 integrated Brier score. Our work motivates
further work on incorporating censored data in models for predictive
maintenance.]]></summary>

neural networks and gradient-based optimization. Understanding the behavior of
gradient descent however, and particularly its instability, has lagged behind
its empirical success. To add to the theoretical tools available to study
gradient descent we propose the principal flow (PF), a continuous time flow
that approximates gradient descent dynamics. To our knowledge, the PF is the
only continuous flow that captures the divergent and oscillatory behaviors of
gradient descent, including escaping local minima and saddle points. Through
its dependence on the eigendecomposition of the Hessian the PF sheds light on
the recently observed edge of stability phenomena in deep learning. Using our

specific facets of human-object interactions, a comprehensive physics-based
approach remains a challenge. Existing methods often focus on isolated segments
of the interaction process and rely on data-driven techniques that may result
in artifacts. In contrast, our proposed method embraces reinforcement learning
(RL) and physics simulation to mitigate the limitations of data-driven
approaches. Through a hierarchical framework, we first learn skill priors for
both body and hand movements in a decoupled setting. The generic skill priors
learn to decode a latent skill embedding into the motion of the underlying
part. A high-level policy then controls hand-object interactions in these
pretrained latent spaces, guided by task objectives of grasping and 3D target
trajectory following. It is trained using a novel reward function that combines
an adversarial style term with a task reward, encouraging natural motions while
fulfilling the task incentives. Our method successfully accomplishes the
complete interaction task, from approaching an object to grasping and
subsequent manipulation. We compare our approach against kinematics-based
baselines and show that it leads to more physically plausible motions.]]></summary>

techniques allows development of relatively complex monitoring systems in many
domains. Besides the traditional industrial domain, new application appears
also in biology and agriculture, where we could speak about the detection of
infections, parasites and weeds, but also about automated monitoring and early
warning systems. This is also connected with the introduction of the easily
accessible hardware and development kits such as Arduino, or RaspberryPi
family. In this paper, we survey 50 existing papers focusing on the methods of
automated beehive monitoring methods using the computer vision techniques,
particularly on the pollen and Varroa mite detection together with the bee
traffic monitoring. Such systems could also be used for the monitoring of the
honeybee colonies and for the inspection of their health state, which could
identify potentially dangerous states before the situation is critical, or to
better plan periodic bee colony inspections and therefore save significant
costs. Later, we also include analysis of the research trends in this
application field and we outline the possible direction of the new
explorations. Our paper is aimed also at veterinary and apidology professionals
and experts, who might not be familiar with machine learning to introduce them
to its possibilities, therefore each family of applications is opened by a
brief theoretical introduction and motivation related to its base method. We
hope that this paper will inspire other scientists to use machine learning
techniques for other applications in beehive monitoring.]]></summary>

unobserved confounders. Sensitivity analysis methods are commonly used to
estimate the policy value under the worst-case confounding over a given

of the uncertainty set for the sake of tractability, leading to overly
conservative estimation of the policy value. In this paper, we propose a
general estimator that provides a sharp lower bound of the policy value. It can
be shown that our estimator contains the recently proposed sharp estimator by
Dorn and Guo (2022) as a special case, and our method enables a novel extension
of the classical marginal sensitivity model using f-divergence. To construct
our estimator, we leverage the kernel method to obtain a tractable
approximation to the conditional moment constraints, which traditional
non-sharp estimators failed to take into account. In the theoretical analysis,
we provide a condition for the choice of the kernel which guarantees no
specification error that biases the lower bound estimation. Furthermore, we
provide consistency guarantees of policy evaluation and learning. In the
experiments with synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate the

pixel level over a five month test set horizon, out-performing simple
phase-folded models based on historical averaging. We also demonstrate that
embeddings learnt by EarthPT hold semantically meaningful information and could
be exploited for downstream tasks such as highly granular, dynamic land use
classification. Excitingly, we note that the abundance of EO data provides us
with -- in theory -- quadrillions of training tokens. Therefore, if we assume

the security and robustness of RL systems are worthy of more attention and
exploration. In particular, recent works have revealed that, in a multi-agent
RL environment, backdoor trigger actions can be injected into a victim agent
(a.k.a. Trojan agent), which can result in a catastrophic failure as soon as it
sees the backdoor trigger action. To ensure the security of RL agents against
malicious backdoors, in this work, we propose the problem of Backdoor Detection
in a multi-agent competitive reinforcement learning system, with the objective
of detecting Trojan agents as well as the corresponding potential trigger
actions, and further trying to mitigate their Trojan behavior. In order to
solve this problem, we propose PolicyCleanse that is based on the property that
the activated Trojan agents accumulated rewards degrade noticeably after
several timesteps. Along with PolicyCleanse, we also design a machine
unlearning-based approach that can effectively mitigate the detected backdoor.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods can accurately
detect Trojan agents, and outperform existing backdoor mitigation baseline
approaches by at least 3% in winning rate across various types of agents and

identically distributed (IID) data. They, on the other hand, suffer greatly
from heterogeneous environments, i.e., Non-IID data. Despite the fact that many
research projects have been done to address this issue, recent findings
indicate that they are still sub-optimal when compared to training on IID data.
In this work, we carefully analyze the existing methods in heterogeneous
environments. Interestingly, we find that regularizing the classifier's outputs
is quite effective in preventing performance degradation on Non-IID data.
Motivated by this, we propose Learning from Drift (LfD), a novel method for
effectively training the model in heterogeneous settings. Our scheme
encapsulates two key components: drift estimation and drift regularization.
Specifically, LfD first estimates how different the local model is from the
global model (i.e., drift). The local model is then regularized such that it
does not fall in the direction of the estimated drift. In the experiment, we
evaluate each method through the lens of the five aspects of federated
learning, i.e., Generalization, Heterogeneity, Scalability, Forgetting, and
Efficiency. Comprehensive evaluation results clearly support the superiority of
LfD in federated learning with Non-IID data.]]></summary>

our proposed model retains the benefits of using an utterance-level bottleneck,

SVQ-VAE achieves a statistically significant improvement in naturalness over

Wearable device-based prediction models allow for continuous health monitoring
under normal living conditions and could offer an alternative to identifying
older adults with cognitive impairments for early interventions. In this study,
we first derived novel wearable-based features related to circadian rhythms,
ambient light exposure, physical activity levels, sleep, and signal processing.
Then, we quantified the ability of wearable-based machine-learning models to
predict poor cognition based on outcomes from the Digit Symbol Substitution
Test (DSST), the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimers Disease
Word-Learning subtest (CERAD-WL), and the Animal Fluency Test (AFT). We found
that the wearable-based models had significantly higher AUCs when predicting
all three cognitive outcomes compared to benchmark models containing age, sex,
education, marital status, household income, diabetic status, depression
symptoms, and functional independence scores. In addition to uncovering
previously unidentified wearable-based features that are predictive of poor
cognition such as the standard deviation of the midpoints of each persons most
active 10-hour periods and least active 5-hour periods, our paper provides
proof-of-concept that wearable-based machine learning models can be used to
autonomously screen older adults for possible cognitive impairments. Such
models offer cost-effective alternatives to conducting initial screenings
manually in clinical settings.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A growing body of research has focused on the Reinforcement Learning (RL)
methods which allow the agent to learn from trial-and-error experiences
gathered during the interaction with the environment. Recently, offline RL
becomes a popular RL paradigm because it saves the interactions with
environments. In offline RL, data providers share large pre-collected datasets,
and others can train high-quality agents without interacting with the
environments. This paradigm has demonstrated effectiveness in critical tasks
like robot control, autonomous driving, etc. However, less attention is paid to
investigating the security threats to the offline RL system. This paper focuses
on backdoor attacks, where some perturbations are added to the data
(observations) such that given normal observations, the agent takes
high-rewards actions, and low-reward actions on observations injected with
triggers. In this paper, we propose Baffle (Backdoor Attack for Offline
Reinforcement Learning), an approach that automatically implants backdoors to
RL agents by poisoning the offline RL dataset, and evaluate how different
offline RL algorithms react to this attack. Our experiments conducted on four
tasks and four offline RL algorithms expose a disquieting fact: none of the
existing offline RL algorithms is immune to such a backdoor attack. Baffle
modifies $10\%$ of the datasets for four tasks. Agents trained on the poisoned
datasets perform well in normal settings. However, when triggers are presented,
the agents' performance decreases drastically by $63.2\%$, $53.9\%$, $64.7\%$,
and $47.4\%$ in the four tasks on average. The backdoor still persists after
fine-tuning poisoned agents on clean datasets. We further show that the
inserted backdoor is also hard to be detected by a popular defensive method.
This paper calls attention to developing more effective protection for the
open-source offline RL dataset.]]></summary>

systems makes it hard to decide what architecture and algorithm to use for a

replaces a complex system with a simpler, more interpretable surrogate. Drawing
inspiration from this, we construct a class of surrogate models for neural
networks using Gaussian processes. Rather than deriving kernels for infinite
neural networks, we learn kernels empirically from the naturalistic behavior of
finite neural networks. We demonstrate our approach captures existing phenomena
related to the spectral bias of neural networks, and then show that our

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent years, precision agriculture has gradually oriented farming closer
to automation processes to support all the activities related to field
management. Service robotics plays a predominant role in this evolution by
deploying autonomous agents that can navigate fields while performing tasks
without human intervention, such as monitoring, spraying, and harvesting. To
execute these precise actions, mobile robots need a real-time perception system
that understands their surroundings and identifies their targets in the wild.
Generalizing to new crops and environmental conditions is critical for
practical applications, as labeled samples are rarely available. In this paper,
we investigate the problem of crop segmentation and propose a novel approach to
enhance domain generalization using knowledge distillation. In the proposed
framework, we transfer knowledge from an ensemble of models individually
trained on source domains to a student model that can adapt to unseen target
domains. To evaluate the proposed method, we present a synthetic multi-domain
dataset for crop segmentation containing plants of variegate shapes and
covering different terrain styles, weather conditions, and light scenarios for
more than 50,000 samples. We demonstrate significant improvements in
performance over state-of-the-art methods and superior sim-to-real
generalization. Our approach provides a promising solution for domain
generalization in crop segmentation and has the potential to enhance a wide

\mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$ in $L^p(\mu)$ norm by sequentially querying its
values, for known compact real intervals $\mathcal{X}$, $\mathcal{Y}$ and a
known probability measure $\mu$ on $\cX$. For any function~$f$ we characterize
the minimum number of evaluations of $f$ that algorithms need to guarantee an
approximation $\hat{f}$ with an $L^p(\mu)$ error below $\epsilon$ after
stopping. Unlike worst-case results that hold uniformly over all $f$, our
complexity measure is dependent on each specific function $f$. To address this
problem, we introduce GreedyBox, a generalization of an algorithm originally
proposed by Novak (1992) for numerical integration. We prove that GreedyBox
achieves an optimal sample complexity for any function $f$, up to logarithmic
factors. Additionally, we uncover results regarding piecewise-smooth functions.
Perhaps as expected, the $L^p(\mu)$ error of GreedyBox decreases much faster
for piecewise-$C^2$ functions than predicted by the algorithm (without any
knowledge on the smoothness of $f$). A simple modification even achieves
optimal minimax approximation rates for such functions, which we compute
explicitly. In particular, our findings highlight multiple performance gaps
between adaptive and non-adaptive algorithms, smooth and piecewise-smooth

are distant in time from each other and from the final reward. These critical
steps are challenging to identify with traditional reinforcement learning (RL)
methods that rely on the Bellman equation for credit assignment. Here, we
present a new RL algorithm that uses offline contrastive learning to hone in on
critical steps. This algorithm, which we call contrastive introspection
(ConSpec), can be added to any existing RL algorithm. ConSpec learns a set of
prototypes for the critical steps in a task by a novel contrastive loss and
delivers an intrinsic reward when the current state matches one of these
prototypes. The prototypes in ConSpec provide two key benefits for credit
assignment: (1) They enable rapid identification of all the critical steps. (2)
They do so in a readily interpretable manner, enabling out-of-distribution
generalization when sensory features are altered. Distinct from other
contemporary RL approaches to credit assignment, ConSpec takes advantage of the
fact that it is easier to retrospectively identify the small set of steps that
success is contingent upon than it is to prospectively predict reward at every
step taken in the environment. Altogether, ConSpec improves learning in a
diverse set of RL tasks, including both those with explicit, discrete critical
steps and those with complex, continuous critical steps.]]></summary>

various facets of our daily existence. Solving attention regression is a
fundamental task in optimizing LLMs. In this work, we focus on giving a
provable guarantee for the one-layer attention network objective function
$L(X,Y) = \sum_{j_0 = 1}^n \sum_{i_0 = 1}^d ( \langle \langle \exp(
\mathsf{A}_{j_0} x ) , {\bf 1}_n \rangle^{-1} \exp( \mathsf{A}_{j_0} x ), A_{3}
Y_{*,i_0} \rangle - b_{j_0,i_0} )^2$. Here $\mathsf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n^2
\times d^2}$ is Kronecker product between $A_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ and
$A_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$. $A_3$ is a matrix in $\mathbb{R}^{n \times
d}$, $\mathsf{A}_{j_0} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d^2}$ is the $j_0$-th block of
$\mathsf{A}$. The $X, Y \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ are variables we want to
learn. $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ and $b_{j_0,i_0} \in \mathbb{R}$ is one
entry at $j_0$-th row and $i_0$-th column of $B$, $Y_{*,i_0} \in \mathbb{R}^d$
is the $i_0$-column vector of $Y$, and $x \in \mathbb{R}^{d^2}$ is the
vectorization of $X$.

In a multi-layer LLM network, the matrix $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ can
be viewed as the output of a layer, and $A_1= A_2 = A_3 \in \mathbb{R}^{n

be viewed as $QK^\top$ and $Y$ can be viewed as $V$. We provide an iterative
greedy algorithm to train loss function $L(X,Y)$ up $\epsilon$ that runs in
$\widetilde{O}( ({\cal T}_{\mathrm{mat}}(n,n,d) + {\cal

T}_{\mathrm{mat}}(a,b,c)$ denotes the time of multiplying $a \times b$ matrix
another $b \times c$ matrix, and $\omega\approx 2.37$ denotes the exponent of

impacts. Mitigating these risks is important, and the insurance industry is
central in this effort, using intricate statistical models for risk assessment.
However, these models often neglect key temporal and spatial hurricane patterns
and are limited by data scarcity. This study introduces a refined approach
combining the ARIMA model and K-MEANS to better capture hurricane trends, and
an Autoencoder for enhanced hurricane simulations. Our experiments show that
this hybrid methodology effectively simulate historical hurricane behaviors
while providing detailed projections of potential future trajectories and
intensities. Moreover, by leveraging a comprehensive yet selective dataset, our
simulations enrich the current understanding of hurricane patterns and offer
actionable insights for risk management strategies.]]></summary>

network can get the generalized function through training with a finite
dataset. The degree of generalization is a realization of the proximity scale
in the data space. Specifically, the scale is not clear if the dataset is
complicated. Here we consider a network for the distribution estimation of the
dataset. We show the estimation is unstable and the instability depends on the
data density and training duration. We derive the kernel-balanced equation,
which gives a short phenomenological description of the solution. The equation
tells us the reason for the instability and the mechanism of the scale. The

attraction (ROA) of an asymptotically stable equilibrium point without an
explicit model of the dynamics. Rather than leveraging approximate models with
bounded uncertainty to find a (robust) invariant set contained in the ROA, we
propose to learn sets that satisfy a more relaxed notion of containment known
as recurrence. We define a set to be $\tau$-recurrent (resp. $k$-recurrent) if
every trajectory that starts within the set, returns to it after at most $\tau$
seconds (resp. $k$ steps). We show that under mild assumptions a
$\tau$-recurrent set containing a stable equilibrium must be a subset of its
ROA. We then leverage this property to develop algorithms that compute inner
approximations of the ROA using counter-examples of recurrence that are
obtained by sampling finite-length trajectories. Our algorithms process samples
sequentially, which allow them to continue being executed even after an initial
offline training stage. We further provide an upper bound on the number of
counter-examples used by the algorithm, and almost sure convergence guarantees.]]></summary>

effectiveness in generating naturalistic behaviors. In this paper, we propose a
new learning framework in this paradigm for controlling physics-based
characters with significantly improved motion quality and diversity over
existing state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method uses reinforcement
learning (RL) to initially track and imitate life-like movements from
unstructured motion clips using the discrete information bottleneck, as adopted
in the Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE). This structure
compresses the most relevant information from the motion clips into a compact
yet informative latent space, i.e., a discrete space over vector quantized
codes. By sampling codes in the space from a trained categorical prior
distribution, high-quality life-like behaviors can be generated, similar to the
usage of VQ-VAE in computer vision. Although this prior distribution can be
trained with the supervision of the encoder's output, it follows the original
motion clip distribution in the dataset and could lead to imbalanced behaviors
in our setting. To address the issue, we further propose a technique named
prior shifting to adjust the prior distribution using curiosity-driven RL. The
outcome distribution is demonstrated to offer sufficient behavioral diversity
and significantly facilitates upper-level policy learning for downstream tasks.
We conduct comprehensive experiments using humanoid characters on two
challenging downstream tasks, sword-shield striking and two-player boxing game.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed framework is capable of controlling
the character to perform considerably high-quality movements in terms of
behavioral strategies, diversity, and realism. Videos, codes, and data are

in automated CQA ranking systems where similar questions (and answers) are

investigate a few aspects of this domain. Firstly, in addition to traditional
features like TF-IDF, BM25 etc., we introduce a BERT-based feature that
captures the semantic similarity between the question and answer. Secondly,
most of the existing research works have focused on features extracted only
from the question part; features extracted from answers have not been explored
extensively. We combine both types of features in a linear fashion. Thirdly,
using our proposed concepts, we conduct an empirical investigation with
different rank-learning algorithms, some of which have not been used so far in
CQA domain. On three standard CQA datasets, our proposed framework achieves

radar intelligently targets ice storms based on information collected by a
lookahead radiometer. Critical to the intelligent targeting is accurate
identification of storm/cloud types from eight bands of radiance collected by
the radiometer. The cloud types of interest are: clear sky, thin cirrus,
cirrus, rainy anvil, and convection core.

We describe multi-step use of Machine Learning and Digital Twin of the
Earth's atmosphere to derive such a classifier. First, a digital twin of
Earth's atmosphere called a Weather Research Forecast (WRF) is used generate
simulated lookahead radiometer data as well as deeper "science" hidden
variables. The datasets simulate a tropical region over the Caribbean and a
non-tropical region over the Atlantic coast of the United States. A K-means
clustering over the scientific hidden variables was utilized by human experts
to generate an automatic labelling of the data - mapping each physical data
point to cloud types by scientists informed by mean/centroids of hidden
variables of the clusters. Next, classifiers were trained with the inputs of
the simulated radiometer data and its corresponding label. The classifiers of a
random decision forest (RDF), support vector machine (SVM), Gaussian na\"ive
bayes, feed forward artificial neural network (ANN), and a convolutional neural
network (CNN) were trained. Over the tropical dataset, the best performing
classifier was able to identify non-storm and storm clouds with over 80%
accuracy in each class for a held-out test set. Over the non-tropical dataset,
the best performing classifier was able to classify non-storm clouds with over
90% accuracy and storm clouds with over 40% accuracy. Additionally both sets of
classifiers were shown to be resilient to instrument noise.]]></summary>

accuracy, managing risks, and fostering strategic financial decision-making.
Despite the development of financial market simulation methodologies, existing
frameworks often struggle with adapting to specialized simulation context. We
pinpoint the challenges as i) current financial datasets do not contain context
labels; ii) current techniques are not designed to generate financial data with
context as control, which demands greater precision compared to other
modalities; iii) the inherent difficulties in generating context-aligned,
high-fidelity data given the non-stationary, noisy nature of financial data. To
address these challenges, our contributions are: i) we proposed the Contextual
Market Dataset with market dynamics, stock ticker, and history state as
context, leveraging a market dynamics modeling method that combines linear
regression and Dynamic Time Warping clustering to extract market dynamics; ii)
we present Market-GAN, a novel architecture incorporating a Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN) for the controllable generation with context, an
autoencoder for learning low-dimension features, and supervisors for knowledge
transfer; iii) we introduce a two-stage training scheme to ensure that
Market-GAN captures the intrinsic market distribution with multiple objectives.
In the pertaining stage, with the use of the autoencoder and supervisors, we
prepare the generator with a better initialization for the adversarial training
stage. We propose a set of holistic evaluation metrics that consider alignment,
fidelity, data usability on downstream tasks, and market facts. We evaluate
Market-GAN with the Dow Jones Industrial Average data from 2000 to 2023 and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Accurately labeling biomedical data presents a challenge. Traditional
semi-supervised learning methods often under-utilize available unlabeled data.
To address this, we propose a novel reliability-based training data cleaning
method employing inductive conformal prediction (ICP). This method capitalizes
on a small set of accurately labeled training data and leverages ICP-calculated
reliability metrics to rectify mislabeled data and outliers within vast
quantities of noisy training data. The efficacy of the method is validated
across three classification tasks within distinct modalities: filtering
drug-induced-liver-injury (DILI) literature with title and abstract, predicting
ICU admission of COVID-19 patients through CT radiomics and electronic health
records, and subtyping breast cancer using RNA-sequencing data. Varying levels
of noise to the training labels were introduced through label permutation.
Results show significant enhancements in classification performance: accuracy
enhancement in 86 out of 96 DILI experiments (up to 11.4%), AUROC and AUPRC
enhancements in all 48 COVID-19 experiments (up to 23.8% and 69.8%), and
accuracy and macro-average F1 score improvements in 47 out of 48 RNA-sequencing
experiments (up to 74.6% and 89.0%). Our method offers the potential to
substantially boost classification performance in multi-modal biomedical
machine learning tasks. Importantly, it accomplishes this without necessitating
an excessive volume of meticulously curated training data.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In many randomized experiments, the treatment effect of the long-term metric
(i.e. the primary outcome of interest) is often difficult or infeasible to
measure. Such long-term metrics are often slow to react to changes and
sufficiently noisy they are challenging to faithfully estimate in short-horizon
experiments. A common alternative is to measure several short-term proxy
metrics in the hope they closely track the long-term metric -- so they can be
used to effectively guide decision-making in the near-term. We introduce a new
statistical framework to both define and construct an optimal proxy metric for
use in a homogeneous population of randomized experiments. Our procedure first
reduces the construction of an optimal proxy metric in a given experiment to a
portfolio optimization problem which depends on the true latent treatment
effects and noise level of experiment under consideration. We then denoise the
observed treatment effects of the long-term metric and a set of proxies in a
historical corpus of randomized experiments to extract estimates of the latent
treatment effects for use in the optimization problem. One key insight derived
from our approach is that the optimal proxy metric for a given experiment is
not apriori fixed; rather it should depend on the sample size (or effective
noise level) of the randomized experiment for which it is deployed. To
instantiate and evaluate our framework, we employ our methodology in a large
corpus of randomized experiments from an industrial recommendation system and
construct proxy metrics that perform favorably relative to several baselines.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We introduce beta diffusion, a novel generative modeling method that
integrates demasking and denoising to generate data within bounded ranges.
Using scaled and shifted beta distributions, beta diffusion utilizes
multiplicative transitions over time to create both forward and reverse
diffusion processes, maintaining beta distributions in both the forward
marginals and the reverse conditionals, given the data at any point in time.
Unlike traditional diffusion-based generative models relying on additive
Gaussian noise and reweighted evidence lower bounds (ELBOs), beta diffusion is
multiplicative and optimized with KL-divergence upper bounds (KLUBs) derived
from the convexity of the KL divergence. We demonstrate that the proposed KLUBs
are more effective for optimizing beta diffusion compared to negative ELBOs,
which can also be derived as the KLUBs of the same KL divergence with its two
arguments swapped. The loss function of beta diffusion, expressed in terms of
Bregman divergence, further supports the efficacy of KLUBs for optimization.
Experimental results on both synthetic data and natural images demonstrate the
unique capabilities of beta diffusion in generative modeling of range-bounded
data and validate the effectiveness of KLUBs in optimizing diffusion models,
thereby making them valuable additions to the family of diffusion-based
generative models and the optimization techniques used to train them.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Large language models (LLMs) have played a pivotal role in revolutionizing
various facets of our daily existence. Solving attention regression is a
fundamental task in optimizing LLMs. In this work, we focus on giving a
provable guarantee for the one-layer attention network objective function
$L(X,Y) = \sum_{j_0 = 1}^n \sum_{i_0 = 1}^d ( \langle \langle \exp(
\mathsf{A}_{j_0} x ) , {\bf 1}_n \rangle^{-1} \exp( \mathsf{A}_{j_0} x ), A_{3}
Y_{*,i_0} \rangle - b_{j_0,i_0} )^2$. Here $\mathsf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n^2
\times d^2}$ is Kronecker product between $A_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ and
$A_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$. $A_3$ is a matrix in $\mathbb{R}^{n \times
d}$, $\mathsf{A}_{j_0} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d^2}$ is the $j_0$-th block of
$\mathsf{A}$. The $X, Y \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ are variables we want to
learn. $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ and $b_{j_0,i_0} \in \mathbb{R}$ is one
entry at $j_0$-th row and $i_0$-th column of $B$, $Y_{*,i_0} \in \mathbb{R}^d$
is the $i_0$-column vector of $Y$, and $x \in \mathbb{R}^{d^2}$ is the
vectorization of $X$.

In a multi-layer LLM network, the matrix $B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ can
be viewed as the output of a layer, and $A_1= A_2 = A_3 \in \mathbb{R}^{n
\times d}$ can be viewed as the input of a layer. The matrix version of $x$ can
be viewed as $QK^\top$ and $Y$ can be viewed as $V$. We provide an iterative
greedy algorithm to train loss function $L(X,Y)$ up $\epsilon$ that runs in
$\widetilde{O}( ({\cal T}_{\mathrm{mat}}(n,n,d) + {\cal
T}_{\mathrm{mat}}(n,d,d) + d^{2\omega}) \log(1/\epsilon) )$ time. Here ${\cal
T}_{\mathrm{mat}}(a,b,c)$ denotes the time of multiplying $a \times b$ matrix
another $b \times c$ matrix, and $\omega\approx 2.37$ denotes the exponent of
matrix multiplication.]]></summary>

unobserved confounders. Sensitivity analysis methods are commonly used to
estimate the policy value under the worst-case confounding over a given
uncertainty set. However, existing work often resorts to some coarse relaxation
of the uncertainty set for the sake of tractability, leading to overly
conservative estimation of the policy value. In this paper, we propose a
general estimator that provides a sharp lower bound of the policy value. It can
be shown that our estimator contains the recently proposed sharp estimator by
Dorn and Guo (2022) as a special case, and our method enables a novel extension
of the classical marginal sensitivity model using f-divergence. To construct
our estimator, we leverage the kernel method to obtain a tractable
approximation to the conditional moment constraints, which traditional
non-sharp estimators failed to take into account. In the theoretical analysis,
we provide a condition for the choice of the kernel which guarantees no
specification error that biases the lower bound estimation. Furthermore, we
provide consistency guarantees of policy evaluation and learning. In the
experiments with synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.]]></summary>

optimisation space to run efficiently. In geometric quantum machine learning,
one achieves this by encoding group structure into parameterised quantum
circuits to include the symmetries of a problem as an inductive bias. However,
constructing such circuits is challenging as a concrete guiding principle has
yet to emerge. In this paper, we propose the use of spin networks, a form of
directed tensor network invariant under a group transformation, to devise SU(2)
equivariant quantum circuit ans\"atze -- circuits possessing spin rotation
symmetry. By changing to the basis that block diagonalises SU(2) group action,
these networks provide a natural building block for constructing parameterised
equivariant quantum circuits. We prove that our construction is mathematically
equivalent to other known constructions, such as those based on twirling and
generalised permutations, but more direct to implement on quantum hardware. The
efficacy of our constructed circuits is tested by solving the ground state
problem of SU(2) symmetric Heisenberg models on the one-dimensional triangular
lattice and on the Kagome lattice. Our results highlight that our equivariant
circuits boost the performance of quantum variational algorithms, indicating

that bypasses the restrictions on covariate distributions imposed by modern
debiasing technology. We study the prevalent setting where the number of
features and samples are both large and comparable. In this context,
state-of-the-art debiasing technology uses a degrees-of-freedom correction to
remove shrinkage bias of regularized estimators and conduct inference. However,
this method requires that the observed samples are i.i.d., the covariates
follow a mean zero Gaussian distribution, and reliable covariance matrix
estimates for observed features are available. This approach struggles when (i)
covariates are non-Gaussian with heavy tails or asymmetric distributions, (ii)
rows of the design exhibit heterogeneity or dependencies, and (iii) reliable
feature covariance estimates are lacking.

To address these, we develop a new strategy where the debiasing correction is
a rescaled gradient descent step (suitably initialized) with step size
determined by the spectrum of the sample covariance matrix. Unlike prior work,
we assume that eigenvectors of this matrix are uniform draws from the
orthogonal group. We show this assumption remains valid in diverse situations
where traditional debiasing fails, including designs with complex row-column
dependencies, heavy tails, asymmetric properties, and latent low-rank
structures. We establish asymptotic normality of our proposed estimator
(centered and scaled) under various convergence notions. Moreover, we develop a
consistent estimator for its asymptotic variance. Lastly, we introduce a
debiased Principal Component Regression (PCR) technique using our
Spectrum-Aware approach. In varied simulations and real data experiments, we
observe that our method outperforms degrees-of-freedom debiasing by a margin.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Several fundamental problems in science and engineering consist of global
optimization tasks involving unknown high-dimensional (black-box) functions
that map a set of controllable variables to the outcomes of an expensive
experiment. Bayesian Optimization (BO) techniques are known to be effective in
tackling global optimization problems using a relatively small number objective
function evaluations, but their performance suffers when dealing with
high-dimensional outputs. To overcome the major challenge of dimensionality,
here we propose a deep learning framework for BO and sequential decision making
based on bootstrapped ensembles of neural architectures with randomized priors.
Using appropriate architecture choices, we show that the proposed framework can
approximate functional relationships between design variables and quantities of
interest, even in cases where the latter take values in high-dimensional vector
spaces or even infinite-dimensional function spaces. In the context of BO, we
augmented the proposed probabilistic surrogates with re-parameterized Monte
Carlo approximations of multiple-point (parallel) acquisition functions, as
well as methodological extensions for accommodating black-box constraints and
multi-fidelity information sources. We test the proposed framework against
state-of-the-art methods for BO and demonstrate superior performance across
several challenging tasks with high-dimensional outputs, including a
constrained multi-fidelity optimization task involving shape optimization of
rotor blades in turbo-machinery.]]></summary>

in the presence of noisy data, was first observed in neural network models
trained with gradient descent. To better understand this empirical observation,
we consider the generalization error of two-layer neural networks trained to

initialization. We assume the data comes from well-separated class-conditional
log-concave distributions and allow for a constant fraction of the training
labels to be corrupted by an adversary. We show that in this setting, neural
networks exhibit benign overfitting: they can be driven to zero training error,
perfectly fitting any noisy training labels, and simultaneously achieve minimax
optimal test error. In contrast to previous work on benign overfitting that
require linear or kernel-based predictors, our analysis holds in a setting

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Variable importance assessment has become a crucial step in machine-learning
applications when using complex learners, such as deep neural networks, on
large-scale data. Removal-based importance assessment is currently the
reference approach, particularly when statistical guarantees are sought to
justify variable inclusion. It is often implemented with variable permutation
schemes. On the flip side, these approaches risk misidentifying unimportant
variables as important in the presence of correlations among covariates. Here
we develop a systematic approach for studying Conditional Permutation
Importance (CPI) that is model agnostic and computationally lean, as well as
reusable benchmarks of state-of-the-art variable importance estimators. We show
theoretically and empirically that $\textit{CPI}$ overcomes the limitations of
standard permutation importance by providing accurate type-I error control.
When used with a deep neural network, $\textit{CPI}$ consistently showed top
accuracy across benchmarks. An empirical benchmark on real-world data analysis
in a large-scale medical dataset showed that $\textit{CPI}$ provides a more
parsimonious selection of statistically significant variables. Our results
suggest that $\textit{CPI}$ can be readily used as drop-in replacement for
permutation-based methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The swift progression of machine learning (ML) has not gone unnoticed in the
realm of statistical mechanics. ML techniques have attracted attention by the
classical density-functional theory (DFT) community, as they enable discovery
of free-energy functionals to determine the equilibrium-density profile of a
many-particle system. Within DFT, the external potential accounts for the
interaction of the many-particle system with an external field, thus, affecting
the density distribution. In this context, we introduce a statistical-learning
framework to infer the external potential exerted on a many-particle system. We
combine a Bayesian inference approach with the classical DFT apparatus to
reconstruct the external potential, yielding a probabilistic description of the
external potential functional form with inherent uncertainty quantification.
Our framework is exemplified with a grand-canonical one-dimensional particle
ensemble with excluded volume interactions in a confined geometry. The required
training dataset is generated using a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation where the
external potential is applied to the grand-canonical ensemble. The resulting
particle coordinates from the MC simulation are fed into the learning framework
to uncover the external potential. This eventually allows us to compute the
equilibrium density profile of the system by using the tools of DFT. Our
approach benchmarks the inferred density against the exact one calculated
through the DFT formulation with the true external potential. The proposed
Bayesian procedure accurately infers the external potential and the density
profile. We also highlight the external-potential uncertainty quantification
conditioned on the amount of available simulated data. The seemingly simple
case study introduced in this work might serve as a prototype for studying a
wide variety of applications, including adsorption and capillarity.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Artificial intelligence models and methods commonly lack causal
interpretability. Despite the advancements in interpretable machine learning
(IML) methods, they frequently assign importance to features which lack causal
influence on the outcome variable. Selecting causally relevant features among
those identified as relevant by these methods, or even before model training,
would offer a solution. Feature selection methods utilizing information
theoretical quantities have been successful in identifying statistically
relevant features. However, the information theoretical quantities they are
based on do not incorporate causality, rendering them unsuitable for such
scenarios. To address this challenge, this article proposes information
theoretical quantities that incorporate the causal structure of the system,
which can be used to evaluate causal importance of features for some given
outcome variable. Specifically, we introduce causal versions of entropy and
mutual information, termed causal entropy and causal information gain, which
are designed to assess how much control a feature provides over the outcome
variable. These newly defined quantities capture changes in the entropy of a
variable resulting from interventions on other variables. Fundamental results
connecting these quantities to the existence of causal effects are derived. The
use of causal information gain in feature selection is demonstrated,
highlighting its superiority over standard mutual information in revealing
which features provide control over a chosen outcome variable. Our
investigation paves the way for the development of methods with improved
interpretability in domains involving causation.]]></summary>

take treatment, so that optimal policy rules are merely suggestions in the
presence of human non-adherence to treatment recommendations. In these same
domains, there may be heterogeneity both in who responds in taking-up
treatment, and heterogeneity in treatment efficacy. While optimal treatment
rules can maximize causal outcomes across the population, access parity
constraints or other fairness considerations can be relevant in the case of
encouragement. For example, in social services, a persistent puzzle is the gap
in take-up of beneficial services among those who may benefit from them the
most. When in addition the decision-maker has distributional preferences over
both access and average outcomes, the optimal decision rule changes. We study
causal identification, statistical variance-reduced estimation, and robust
estimation of optimal treatment rules, including under potential violations of
positivity. We consider fairness constraints such as demographic parity in
treatment take-up, and other constraints, via constrained optimization. Our
framework can be extended to handle algorithmic recommendations under an
often-reasonable covariate-conditional exclusion restriction, using our
robustness checks for lack of positivity in the recommendation. We develop a
two-stage algorithm for solving over parametrized policy classes under general
constraints to obtain variance-sensitive regret bounds. We illustrate the
methods in two case studies based on data from randomized encouragement to

 To stay on top of the latest advancements in AI, look here first.

 Personalized Route Suggestions through AI
  
The AI model comprises 360 million parameters, using real-time data from Maps users to influence factors including travel time, road conditions, tolls, and personal preferences to suggest routes.
 This technology is grounded on "inverse reinforcement learning" (IRL), specifically a new IRL algorithm - "Receding Horizon Inverse Planning (RHIP)".
  
The Power of RHIP and AI in Maps
  
Google and Deepmind jointly worked to develop RHIP, using complex stochastic models in immediate vicinity areas, but switching to simpler deterministic methods for distant areas for power conservation.
 The AI improves route suggestions for both driving and two-wheeled vehicles by learning from Maps users' movements and behaviors over time.
 Google states that this is the largest application of inverse reinforcement learning for route planning to date.
  
Implementation and User Testing
  
Google has applied the algorithm to Maps data globally, but extensive user testing is needed to confirm if the technique consistently produces better routes.
 Previous attempts at using AI systems for route planning on a large scale have often failed due to the complexity of road networks.

 Github: https://github.com/aiwaves-cn/agents 
 Abstract:
  
Recent advances on large language models (LLMs) enable researchers and developers to build autonomous language agents that can automatically solve various tasks and interact with environments, humans, and other agents using natural language interfaces. We consider language agents as a promising direction towards artificial general intelligence and release Agents, an open-source library with the goal of opening up these advances to a wider non-specialist audience. Agents is carefully engineered to support important features including planning, memory, tool usage, multi-agent communication, and fine-grained symbolic control. Agents is user-friendly as it enables non-specialists to build, customize, test, tune, and deploy state-of-the-art autonomous language agents without much coding. The library is also research-friendly as its modularized design makes it easily extensible for researchers.

 I have about 100K images on my machine and I am looking for a tool that can help me do some QA on it.
 Example features I would love:
  
Search and visualize all images with a prefix "cls1_" or "cls2_"
 Easily rename file names if they're not named correctly
 
Visualize all captions associated with each image 
  
We can assume they have the same name but with extension ".txt" or ".captions"
 Or there's a metadata.json linking between "img_file" and "caption_file"
 
 
Easily edit captions in the dashboard
 
 I can also work with some kind of metadata file instead of relying on filename logic if it really helps a certain tool.
 I prefer a locally run, open-source tool. It would be a problem for me to upload this data to any online platform.
 Many thanks in advance for any help or guidance.

One of these steps to is calculate values from algorithmic and mathematical functions. In my training and testing data the values are around 12-15 decimal places. I then split the data without shuffling. Training, validation and testing averages at 75% accuracy. 
 Now my next step I wanted to do a "real world" data test where I collect the exact same data as my testing data and predict it using my previously built model but the values inside test_dataset1 are different to test_dataset2 within the last 6-9 decimal places even though the data is going through the exact same code. For example 
 Test_dataset1 Value : 1.123456789
 Test_dataset2 Value : 1.123456987
 This messes with my prediction and its making me wonder aswell as standrising my data should I be rounding my float values to say 4-6 decimal places?

 Can developers optimize apps for Google Tensor like they can for the Neural Engine?
 If not, how do developers take advantage of machine learning acceleration chips on Google Pixel or Android in general?
 If yes, let's say a developer optimizes their app for the Google TPU, will they need to re-optimize for other chips like Samsung's NPU or Qualcomm AI too? If not, how well do they run? Are they the same fast and efficient?

As a result, there is a growing demand for lightweight, yet high-quality face generation and editing models, which are often based on generative adversarial network (GAN) techniques.

 Abstract:
  
Transformers have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing, but comprehending their internal mechanisms remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel geometric perspective that elucidates the inner mechanisms of transformer operations. Our primary contribution is illustrating how layer normalization confines the latent features to a hyper-sphere, subsequently enabling attention to mold the semantic representation of words on this surface. This geometric viewpoint seamlessly connects established properties such as iterative refinement and contextual embeddings. We validate our insights by probing a pre-trained 124M parameter GPT-2 model. Our findings reveal clear query-key attention patterns in early layers and build upon prior observations regarding the subject-specific nature of attention heads at deeper layers. Harnessing these geometric insights, we present an intuitive understanding of transformers, depicting them as processes that model the trajectory of word particles along the hyper-sphere.

 The Python library hampel implements the Hampel Filter, which is generally used to detect anomalies in data with a timeseries structure. It basically consists of a sliding window of a parameterizable size.
 The library was in plain Python before (using pandas for all the sliding operations, median computation etc), but now it has been replaced by a Cython implementation, which speeds up things quite a bit! 😀
 It also provides much more valuable information (thresholds, median absolute deviations, etc.), allowing us to create plots like this one:

 Currently, I am building a Deep Learning model with the task of automatically generating random posts and tweets. The characteristic is that it must have the personality of the writer, for example the user is the CEO of company A, then the generated post must have the writing style of the CEO or company A, similar to other users.
 Actually, I don't know where to start solving this problem. I intend to use RWKV to do this problem but I'm not sure if it is a good direction or not. Is there any related research or can anyone who has done this problem give me some suggestions?

 Abstract:
  
Transformers have become the dominant model in deep learning, but the reason for their superior performance is poorly understood. Here, we hypothesize that the strong performance of Transformers stems from an architectural bias towards mesa-optimization, a learned process running within the forward pass of a model consisting of the following two steps: (i) the construction of an internal learning objective, and (ii) its corresponding solution found through optimization. To test this hypothesis, we reverse-engineer a series of autoregressive Transformers trained on simple sequence modeling tasks, uncovering underlying gradient-based mesa-optimization algorithms driving the generation of predictions. Moreover, we show that the learned forward-pass optimization algorithm can be immediately repurposed to solve supervised few-shot tasks, suggesting that mesa-optimization might underlie the in-context learning capabilities of large language models. Finally, we propose a novel self-attention layer, the mesa-layer, that explicitly and efficiently solves optimization problems specified in context. We find that this layer can lead to improved performance in synthetic and preliminary language modeling experiments, adding weight to our hypothesis that mesa-optimization is an important operation hidden within the weights of trained Transformers.

 So the definition of the recurrent representation of the retention mechanism is below

γ is a decay factor, and K, Q, and V have their standard transformer definitions.
 What confuses me is the derivation of Sn. The formula makes it look like a scalar. But if that's the case, are we saying that for a given token, the retention mechanism is just multiplying the Query by a scalar? That's surprising! How is that able to provide enough context?
 Here is some code I wrote with GPT to show my understanding of how it works. Is this correct? I use 3 arbitrary tokens of dimension 3, and then a pick arbitrary K Q and V matrices. I also initialize gamma to 0.5

 I have already tried Python libraries and methods such as indic-nlp, Levenshtein distance, UrduHack, Word2vec Urdu etc, but they weren't able to solve this problem.

 It seems like these are difficult times. Compare today with the WWII years, explaining how much we have to be grateful for.
 Bard said:
 I agree that these are difficult times. The world is facing many challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and political instability. However, I believe that we have much to be grateful for today compared to the WWII years.
 Here are just a few things:
 We live in a time of peace. World War II was a global conflict that caused the deaths of millions of people. Today, there are no major wars raging on.
 We have access to advanced medical care. During WWII, many people died from diseases that are now easily treatable. Today, we have antibiotics, vaccines, and other medical advances that have saved countless lives.
 We have a higher standard of living. In the WWII years, many people lived in poverty. Today, most people in the developed world have access to clean water, food, and shelter.
 We have more opportunities for education and advancement. In the WWII years, many people were denied an education because of their race, gender, or social class. Today, education is more accessible than ever before, and people from all backgrounds have the opportunity to succeed.
 We have a better understanding of the world. During WWII, there was a lot of misinformation and propaganda. Today, we have access to more information than ever before, and we can make more informed decisions about our lives.
 Of course, there are still many challenges that we face today. But I believe that we have come a long way since the WWII years, and we have much to be grateful for. Let us never forget the sacrifices that were made during that time, and let us continue to work towards a better future for all.

 I have a dataset that consists of 2D trajectories and I am aiming to develop an autoencoder architecture to learn a compressed set of features that reasonable represents and can reconstruct the trajectories. 
 The trajectories may look something like this as an example. A 2D image as input would seem to require a very sparse representation with high resolution to track the trajectory path. I am hoping there is a better way to input the path without requiring high resolution. 
 An alternative might be to use a LSTM structure to input as a sequence, although not sure that solves the resolution issue.
 Do you have any suggestions? I've worked with 1d time series and 2D images just fine but this is a bit different.

 I'm running llama-2-7b-chat-hf with 4bit quantization on a g5.2xlarge instance on sagemaker.
 The method I'm using is map_reduce (option 2)from this webpage https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/summarization)
 Of everything I've tried this is the only one that's been able to do decent summaries in a reasonable amount of time. However with really long articles (10,000+ words) it takes ~6 minutes before giving an output.
 I tried running this same thing on a g5.12xlarge instance which has 4 A10G gpus but it hasn't reduced the time by any noticeable amount.
 Is there anything else I could be doing to speed this up?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I asked ChatGPT to talk with Trump's jury about the 3-hour delay. Not bad.
 ChatGPT:
 Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, today, we present a compelling case that the three-hour delay in President Trump's response to the events of January 6th is, without a doubt, overwhelming and irrefutable evidence of his planning and conducting the insurrection that unfolded before our eyes.
 First, consider the timeline. As the violence escalated, President Trump did not immediately call for an end to the chaos. This delay allowed the mob to wreak havoc, endanger lives, and damage our democracy. A leader's duty is to protect the nation and its citizens, and a three-hour wait to act is inexplicable unless there was intent behind it.
 Second, let's talk about intent. In criminal law, intent matters. It's the difference between an accident and a crime. A deliberate delay in response to an unfolding insurrection suggests a guilty mind. President Trump had the power and the responsibility to intervene immediately. Yet, he chose not to, allowing the violence to escalate.
 Furthermore, we must consider his words leading up to and during the events of January 6th. His rhetoric could be interpreted as encouragement for his supporters to take matters into their own hands. This, coupled with the delay, paints a picture of a leader who not only knew what was happening but may have orchestrated it.
 Ladies and gentlemen, we are not here to pass judgment but to seek justice. The evidence of a three-hour delay in responding to the insurrection, along with the surrounding circumstances, presents a compelling case that President Trump planned and conducted this insurrection. It is our duty to hold individuals accountable for their actions, regardless of their position.

 "The film The Social Network is a dramatization of the founding of Facebook, and as such, it takes some liberties with the truth.

Every year our company receives mandates / updates from different parties. In turn, our development teams have to parse through heavy documentation to figure out what needs to change in our code. Ingesting the data is what takes the longest. Our goal is to feed the mandates documentation through an AI and have it return what is needed to be changed in our code. For example, something might say field 200 now needs to include a 6 digit date format vs the 4 digit date format we've had in years past. We have secured a license for Azure AI but honestly no idea if that is the right AI to use. I youtubed a bunch of videos on document processing but I'm also not sure if that is what we are trying to do. Any advice on this is much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07062 
 Abstract:
  
We explore the novel application of Large Language Models to code optimization. We present a 7B-parameter transformer model trained from scratch to optimize LLVM assembly for code size. The model takes as input unoptimized assembly and outputs a list of compiler options to best optimize the program. Crucially, during training, we ask the model to predict the instruction counts before and after optimization, and the optimized code itself. These auxiliary learning tasks significantly improve the optimization performance of the model and improve the model's depth of understanding.
 We evaluate on a large suite of test programs. Our approach achieves a 3.0% improvement in reducing instruction counts over the compiler, outperforming two state-of-the-art baselines that require thousands of compilations. Furthermore, the model shows surprisingly strong code reasoning abilities, generating compilable code 91% of the time and perfectly emulating the output of the compiler 70% of the time.

 Anyway, I'm searching for alternative methods, algoritms (NLP or not) and models... There are lots of info and different implementation on RAG, but as I can see noone put much effort to augment chunking quality. 
 Also, there are other approach than this one I'm currently using? bi-encoder (instructor) - > cross-encoder (reranking) - > LLM 
 Can someone share some resources, repo, lib or existing implementation of different chunking methods? (or simply discuss here some idea, though or approach)

 Cambridge University Press
 I am solving the problem I attach and I have a doubt in section (f). I have solved all the sections (a)-(e).
 In section (e) I have obtained that I need
 $$
 k \geq \frac{\lambda_{\text{max}}\left(\frac{2}{N} A^TA + 2\mu I\right)}{\lambda_{\text{min}}\left(\frac{2}{N} A^TA + 2\mu I\right)}log((f(x^0)-f(x_\mu)/\epsilon).
 $$
 However in section (f) asks for a tight upper bound but I only can think about the following bound:
 $f(\hat{x}) \leq f_\mu(x_\mu) + ||\hat{x}||^2+ \epsilon$,
 which is very simple.
 Do you think that I can obtain the result in (e) to obtain another bond, or what would you do?

 I'm trying to figure out what is the best way to use LLMs to analyse a very old software entirely written in C.
 I've tried to to some basic prompts with ChatGPT and it seems to recognise the language.
 The situation is that I've many .c files with thousands of lines and with a lot of redundant code.
 Moreover, since there are a lot of data structure with variables names not easily understandable, I need to provide some context to allow the model to trying to understand what the code does.
 My worry is that providing all the needed info + the file itself (even considering 1 file at a time) I could consume all the model context and therefore not leave room for generating anything of value.
 Has anyone had the opportunity to face similar problems? Ideas?

 Abstract:
  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results. However, existing models are expensive to train and deploy, and it is also difficult to expand their knowledge beyond pre-training data without forgetting previous knowledge. This paper proposes a new neural network architecture, ModuleFormer, that leverages modularity to improve the efficiency and flexibility of large language models. ModuleFormer is based on the Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE). Unlike the previous SMoE-based modular language model, which requires domain-labeled data to learn domain-specific experts, ModuleFormer can i…]]></summary>

 I wasn't doing any ml in some time and forgot basics. I was thinking that you may help me. So I trained svc model on small dataset (around 1400 unical records). I have 13 classes, which are badly distributed in the training set and inbalanced. 3 classes took around 80% of all. What the business wants is keep the 3 classes and categorize the rest as "Other" class. In the future they may be able to generate more training data for the remaining labels.
 How should I do it? I know I can assign everytning to "Other" class, before training with simple if then formula, but dont know if this is the right approach. Any sugestions? I know this may be some case of 1 vs all case, but don't know which exactly.
 Thanks in advance for any help.

 I was really excited that Mojo became publicly available and thinking which project can I implement to learn Mojo concepts. Since I have already ported llama2.c to pure Python, I decided why not try to port llama2.py to Mojo now.. And here is what I got
 First round of llama2.c vs llama2.🔥 battle. Mojo demonstrated 20% better performance than C in a single threaded execution of llama2 inference and 250x times better performance than Python
 https://i.redd.it/0gcwwfc2r7ob1.gif
 For reference Mojo is using SIMD vectorization, that's why it's performing great for matmul operations. In the other hand, it turned out that gcc also aggressively optimizes all for loops it can find, so I suggest this benchmark is pretty fair.
 ​
 Mojo natively supports SIMD vectorizations out of the box
 gcc aggressively vectorizing loops
 ​
 After that I decided to compare both solutions in multi-threaded (parallelized) mode, and now `llama2.c` strike back with help of OMP demonstrating 20% better performance than Mojo
 ​
 https://i.redd.it/gwymffods7ob1.gif
 I hope this post will be useful for all Machine Learning engineers/enthusiasts/students out there, ensuring we're up-to-date with Modular/Mojo's game-changing AI tech developments.
 Stay informed and ahead of the curve!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I'm currently at a crossroads with a decision that I believe many in this community might have faced or will face at some point: Should I use cloud-based GPU instances like AWS's p3.2xlarge EC2 (with Tesla V100) or invest in building a high-performance rig at home with multiple RTX 4090s for training a large language model?
 Context: I run a startup and we're currently fine-tuning an open source LLM, and the computational demands are of course high. We want to make an informed choice between using AWS's offerings or setting up a high-performance system at home to start.
 Cloud Option: AWS p3.2xlarge EC2
  
Cost: Approximately $3.06 per hour.
 Specifications: One Tesla V100 GPU, 8 vCPUs, 61 GiB RAM.
 Pros: Scalability, reliability, specialized software optimizations.
 Cons: Recurring costs, potential limitations on customization.
  
Home Rig Option: Multiple RTX 4090s
  
Cost: Around $1,600 for each 4090, but I'd own them.
 Specifications: Even higher TFLOPs than a V100, and memory isn't a constraint (24GB per card).
 Pros: One-time investment, flexibility, potentially higher raw computational power.
 Cons: Need to handle cooling, power, and system integration myself
  
I'd love to hear your thoughts, experiences, and recommendations. Here are some specific questions:
  
Performance: How many RTX 4090s would roughly equal the computational power of an AWS p3.2xlarge instance for ML tasks?
 Cost-Effectiveness: Given that we're a startup with limited resources, does it make more financial sense to invest upfront in hardware?
 Reliability and Maintenance: For those who have run multi-GPU setups at home, how reliable are they, and what maintenance work is required?
 Other Considerations: Are there factors I haven't considered that you think are critical?
  
Thank you in advance for sharing your insights!

Abstract:
  
The current trend of scaling language models involves increasing both parameter count and training dataset size. Extrapolating this trend suggests that training dataset size may soon be limited by the amount of text data available on the internet. Motivated by this limit, we investigate scaling language models in data-constrained regimes. Specifically, we run a large set of experiments varying the extent of data repetition and compute budget, ranging up to 900 billion training tokens and 9 billion parameter models. We find that with constrained data for a fixed compute budget, training with up to 4 epochs of repeated data yields negligible changes to loss compared to having unique data. However, with more repetition, the value of adding compute eventually decays to zero. We propose and empirically validate a scaling law for compute optimality that accounts for the decreasing value of repeated tokens and excess parameters. Finally, we experiment with approaches mitigating data scarcity, including augmenting the training dataset with code data or removing commonly used filters. Models and datasets from our 400 training runs are freely available at this https URL.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In less than a year since ChatGPT was introduced, it has become the fastest consumer application to register 100 million monthly active users. But how are consumers using other GenAI products apart from ChatGPT? An a16z Consumer report examines the top 50 GenAI web products (based on SimilarWeb data) to find out.
 To stay on top of the latest advancements in AI, look here first.
 https://preview.redd.it/f0kh5qag16ob1.png?width=2058&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cab11a31d384c068912c9fca32a000393b795d5
  
Proprietary models are dominating: 80% of the top 50 GenAI products didn’t exist a year ago—suggesting many of the most compelling consumer experiences are completely novel. Interestingly, 48% of these are bootstrapped—with no outside funding.
 ChatGPT holds a massive lead: ChatGPT alone accounts for 60% of the entire list's monthly traffic, with roughly 1.6 billion visits and 200 million monthly users as of June 2023.
 LLM assistants are dominating: LLMs, including Google’s Bard and Quora’s Poe, constitute 68% of total consumer traffic to the top 50. The other categories seeing significant traffic are AI companions and content-generation tools.
 GenAI marketing is mostly organic: Marketing for most of these products has been reliant on referrals, word of mouth, and other traditional marketing as they enter the market. About 90% of these companies are already monetizing, and most do so via a subscription model.
 GenAI and mobile adaptability: Given the extensive consumer time spent on mobile, an increase in mobile-first GenAI products is expected as the technology evolves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 Recently, I tried to follow fetch_pick_and_place.env in gymnasium_robotics to build a similar environment with Franka.
 I found that the core of this implementation is to use the mocap to control the end-effector, and then mocap derives joint angles using the built-in inverse kinematics algorithm.
 For the fetch_pick_and_place.env, mocap does not cause mutations and oscillations in configuration space. However, when I use mocap to control Franka, oscillations in joint space occur frequently, although I've minimized the step size of the mocap to ensure that the movement of the end-effector in Cartesian space is minor. Fetch and Franka are both redundant arms, I don't know why there is such a big difference in mocap performance.
 Here is the video to illustrate the above phenomenon
 Franka
 I've opened issues on mujoco and gymnasium robotics repositories, but it didn't initiate any discussion.
 Any help would be appreciated! Thanks!

Prompt Engineering seems like a pretty fresh field of study. Is it up and coming as a career path?
 People that specialize in this, what field(s) did you come from and how would you recommend diving into it?
 Considering my experience, would I be able to actually find work, freelancing or employed?
 How on earth do I get started in this world? It seems so insanely big and complicated but I am just fascinated by the idea of using written dialogue to manipulate the output of an LLM!
 From my very high overview of PE and the recent advances in AI, PE as a field of study and interest is going to expand exponentially, is that accurate?

 What is the best way to get my python code for the agent to run onto the spare PC? I know I can manually load copy the code over, but I'm looking for a more efficient method that will maintain any changes made to the source code. Maybe packaging up the python code within the sweep and having the agent download and execute it?

When I take the average of all iterations I get poor results (F1 score= 0.5), but if I pool all the predictions and compute the F1 score at the end, I achieve decent performance (F1 score =0.7). So, in my project, it is in my best interest to use the second approach, and somebody that I trust tells me that it is okay to do this approach. But I cannot seem to find a paper that says that this approach is acceptable or good. What do you guys think and do you have any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was thinking of some major challenges in modeling a generic real-world environment. Some of them are: adaptive agents, uncertain intentions, and lack of common knowledge.
 However, most of the papers I see on RL make some assumption or other violating one or more of these, like considering simple agents, assuming known knowledge about others' intentions, and considering that the models of other agents are known when irl an agent hardly has a model of other agents it interacts with apriori. 
 Consider an airport scenario where agents are trying to get into respective planes within a given time, and the gates to each plane allow one person at a time. Looking at the scenario from the view of a single agent, they know what they want, but they can't really make any assumptions about the intentions, strategy, and complexity of other agents beforehand. These other agents can be neutral or adversarial (competing for getting in the same plane) from the agent's viewpoint. All they can see is a restricted view of the motions of some of the other agents.
 What would you say could model and provide a solution in such a scenario? It is to be noted that other agents can change their strategies based on actions taken by you till now, and so can you. Due to having incomplete information, I fail to see the notion of an equilibrium, and the agents needn't be fully rational as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on a project that involves analyzing large samples of Java codes. My end goal is to perform classification based on these codes. For this, I've been trying to efficiently encode the full names of the methods (in the package.class.methodname format) in the Java code.
 Currently, I am experimenting with doc2vec. I'm treating the components of each method's full name (separated by dots) as individual documents. This allows me to produce vectors for each method name, and I evaluate the results by computing the cosine similarity between pairs of similar method names. The results were not good so far.
 Before moving to doc2vec, I tried using an LLM which gave me good results. However, the inference time was far too long, especially given the scale at which I'm working. I also considered using a Bag of Words model, but quickly realized it wouldn't be effective. Many of the method names in my samples are obfuscated, making this approach unsuitable.
 The issue I'm facing is that using the direct method names as features is not generalizing well for classification. A slight change in a method's name results in losing that particular feature, making my model fragile.
 What are some optimal encoding methods for small sentences (around 5-6 words) like these method names, that can scale well? 
 Also, Are there any specialized encoding techniques tailored for software code that I could use for this task?
 Any suggestions or insights would be really helpful. Thank you!

 Github: https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm 
 Blog: https://vllm.ai/ 
 Abstract:
  
High throughput serving of large language models (LLMs) requires batching sufficiently many requests at a time. However, existing systems struggle because the key-value cache (KV cache) memory for each request is huge and grows and shrinks dynamically. When managed inefficiently, this memory can be significantly wasted by fragmentation and redundant duplication, limiting the batch size. To address this problem, we propose PagedAttention, an attention algorithm inspired by the classical virtual memory and paging techniques in operating systems. On top of it, we build vLLM, an LLM serving system that achieves (1) near-zero waste in KV cache memory and (2) flexible sharing of KV cache within and across requests to further reduce memory usage. Our evaluations show that vLLM improves the throughput of popular LLMs by 2-4× with the same level of latency compared to the state-of-the-art systems, such as FasterTransformer and Orca. The improvement is more pronounced with longer sequences, larger models, and more complex decoding algorithms.

 Currently I am seeing this as a synthetic data generation problem: two approaches I am thinking of is 1) grounding (using viral examples to guide the prompt) and 2) filtering (finetuning an LLM to predict virality and filtering for the most viral generations)

Basically after my masters, I'll probably have only these two internships to show as a work experience, Probably won't be able to get an internship in an IT company unless i opt for remote work (which is also not guaranteed atm).
 Mu question, generally is Msc + 2 research internships + 1or 2 publications good enough to secure a decent job in R&D?

 I would love to create a small group of people who work together in AI.
 The project would be to create an AI that can infer new novel knowledge from existing datasets, as opposed to be being limited by operating within the training data. Specifically to be used in the quest to learn more about the universe.
 So I am looking for a team of likeminded individuals who want to grow in the field of AI.
 I'd love to setup a discord, subreddit and github profile to showcase our work.
 My introduction question is: How do we get AI's to expand upon current knowledge instead of just serving from the knowledge itself.
 Anyone interested in joining me in this?

Each of the corporations has promised to submit their software to internal and external audits, where independent experts can attack the models to see how they can be misused.
 
The organizations agreed to safeguard their intellectual property and make sure things like the weights of their proprietary neural networks don't leak, while giving users a way to easily report vulnerabilities or bugs.
 
All eight companies agreed to focus on research to investigate societal and civil risks AI might pose if they lead to discriminatory decision-making or have weaknesses in data privacy.

 I bring 2 years of experience from a European investment fund and a solid idea for a B2B SaaS solution targeting private equity investment funds. 
 This market is notoriously challenging to penetrate without insider knowledge. The timing couldn't be better. Similar kind of software is currently sold €20k per user by a semi-monopolistic boomer company that is ready to be disrupted.
 Offer:
 - Equity shared equally.
 - Ready to quit my job and go full-time on it, if I find the right co-founder.
 Ideal Partner:
 Seeking someone proficient in SQL for handling large datasets and able to integrate OpenAI's API within such datasets (technical AI skills required). While I'm based in Berlin and prefer a European co-founder, it's not mandatory, but meeting in person is a must before we commit.
 Don't be afraid to DM me if intrigued! Together, we can make it happen. Let's revolutionize the sector!

 "Caution: TensorFlow 2.10 was the last TensorFlow release that supported GPU on native-Windows. Starting with TensorFlow 2.11, you will need to install TensorFlow in WSL2, or install tensorflow or tensorflow-cpu and, optionally, try the TensorFlow-DirectML-Plugin"
 This is really upsetting! Most of the ML developers I know actually use Windows machines since we develop locally and only switch to Linux for deployment.
 I know WSL is an option, but it (1) can only use 50% RAM (2) doesnt use the native file system.
 I feel very betrayed. After sticking with, and even advocating for Tensorflow when everyone was (and still is) switching to PyTorch, TF dropped me! This is probably the final nail in the coffin for me. I will be switching to PyTorch as soon as I can :-(

 Psychology researchers at Swansea University are carrying out an original study to see whether artificial intelligence is able to generate infant faces between the ages of 0 and 7 years. AI generated pictures will be presented alongside real faces from an existing face database, with a sliding scale underneath that you will use to roughly estimate the age of the child’s face.
 The experiment should only take between 15 and 20 minutes

 What I want from this session is to present different ways of preprocessing the data for a deep learning model. I want to show different types of implementations, how those affect the final trained model, when to use which type of data preprocessing and things similar to this. It would be great if you can suggest me some topic, notebooks or datasets for the same. All the notebooks that show good implementation and affect of data preprocessing are absolutely welcome.
 Also, as this is **Keras** Community Day, I'll have to include more about data preprocessing using Keras and less about other libraries. 
 Also, if you could help me with this: I am confused between showing preprocessing using layers or doing the preprocessing without layers. I know this sounds vague, but if you have any idea about this, let me know.

Fine-tune a LLaMA LLM
 Transcribe videos with Whisper
 Train a custom stable diffusion model

 Someone asked me today "why are LLMs still non deterministic in their output when temperature is set to 0. Assume fixed model between runs on the same machine" 
 I was like WTF are you saying - the randomness in LLM comes from temperature - chat gpt etc.. might have other randomness in the process but we don't have exact info on this. What I know is that in a standard transformers architecture, temperature is the only parameter that can enduce non deterministic behaviour at inference time. 
 He was convinced that there was more to it "i spoke about this to other LLM experts and they also are not sure" 
 I'm like wtf - I start looking up online and do find some people who claim that temperature is not the only thing that influences stochasticity during inference, but I can't find an answer as to what it is exactly. 
 Anyone has a clue of what I am missing here? 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can a single layer neural network solve the XOR problem?
 Most answers say no, but with this one weird trick the answer is yes! And we don't even need a bias! The trick is to multiply the outputs of a single (2,2) linear layer. Here is how:
 class XorSolver(nn.Module): def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs) -> None: super().__init__(*args, **kwargs) self.layer = nn.Linear(2, 2, bias=False) # we don't even need a bias! def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor: z = self.layer.forward(x) y = z[:, 0] * z[:, 1] return y 
 This is the loss and model output after 5000 epochs:
 loss: 6.516383166399464e-08 Input: [[0. 0.] [0. 1.] [1. 0.] [1. 1.]] Model output: [0. 1. 1. 0.] Expected output: [0. 1. 1. 0.] Layer weight: [[-1.248097 1.2202195 ] [-0.80121976 0.81952316]] 
 The full implementation with training and inference - around 50 lines of code - can be found on GitHub.
 Why it works?
 Basically the model simulates a more sophisticated neuron which allows more interactions between the inputs.
 By multiplying the outputs of two neurons, we introduce a form of non-linearity that allows us to separate data that are not linearly separable, like in the XOR problem:
 f(x1, x2, w1, w2, w3, w4) = (x1 * w1 + x2 * w2) * (x1 * w3 + x2 * w4)
  
w1, w2 are learnable parameters of the first neuron
 w3, w4 are learnable parameters of the second neuron
 x1, x2 are inputs to the model

 First the customer, product, then the tech that will add the value the customer needs. 
 What do you think are the top reasons generative AI applications succeed?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://github.com/lowrollr/turbozero
 I've recently been working on TurboZero, a vectorized implementation of AlphaZero where model inference, search (MCTS), and environment simulation all run in parallel on the GPU. I've also implemented a self-contained training/evaluation pipeline, along with a few environments. I've written a wiki and a starter notebook for those who want to dig deeper. 
 This project is similar to DeepMind's mctx, but supports MCTS subtree persistence (unnecessary for MuZero, which is what mctx was mainly built to support), is written with PyTorch rather than JAX, and can also stand on its own and train models end-to-end.
 I hope to continue to expand and improve upon this as time allows, and I hope someone here might find it useful or interesting! 
 This is my first major open-source project of any real substance and I still don't have tons of experience with RL, so any feedback/advice is greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI Chatbots, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, can create incredibly cost-friendly software in record time, reveals a new study.
 To stay on top of the latest advancements in AI, look here first.
 https://preview.redd.it/rxpr6db3aynb1.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&s=721ff5d8f9d25b5e48fa26e2b335c1d20620a83a
 The AI Tech Company Experiment
  
Brown University and several Chinese University researchers put ChatGPT-powered AI bots to the test by making them run a hypothetical software development company, ChatDev.
 The AI chatbots were given specific roles and allocated respective stages based on the traditional waterfall model encompassing designing, coding, testing, and documenting.
 AI 'employees' functioned with minimal human input to complete their parts of the software development process.
  
Impressive Results
  
Assigning 70 tasks to ChatDev led to the completion of the entire software development process in under seven minutes at a cost of less than one dollar on average.
 A stunning 86.66% of the generated software systems performed flawlessly.
 Despite some language model errors and biases, the study demonstrates AI's immense potential in automating tasks - a boon, especially to junior programmers around the world.
  
Broader Implications
  
Powerfully generative AI technologies like ChatGPT can perform specific job functions, saving time, and boosting productivity in several industries.
 While coders find such tools beneficial, it's also critical to note that limitations and biases do exist in AI models which could potentially affect the software creation process.

Obviously I don't want to train the full-sized models and then compare them, thats a waste of money. So I'm thinking of training smaller versions (~100M) and then comparing those instead.
 My question is there some sort of best practice for this? Some smaller multiple of your full model size where it is best to compare? Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, all,
 I'm working on a GPT-powered game where the characters speak using API calls.
 For this, I need an inexpensive vector database that does not require an API, or at least if it does, it leverages the OpenAI API. Also, this vector database must be runnable on consumer-grade gaming hardware with a small search space (let's say 10-50 entries in the DB).
 Also, I need to package it with the game somehow. My game is in the Godot engine which can use Python with a plug-in. Other approaches I was considering is having a second process communicate with the game through a socket. Ideally the vector DB solution would be easy to install - that is, I could package it with a .exe, and simply run both without the player having to download anything else.
 Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I'm currently tasked with something at my company that I'm facing some difficulty with because it's not in my domain. My company has a service where we provide video chatting to users and match users with others based on various features.
 Currently I've implemented a simple model where we have separate embedding matrices for each user feature, create a user representation by aggregating these features, and performing regression between two users. The way that regression works is that the final score output from the model would act as a "matching score" and we'll match user A with the highest other user.
 The problem is that obviously running inference on every single pair of users is very slow and I need to speed this up.
 Some methods I thought about were to either use a feature store or perform sampling on users so we're not running inference on the entire users, but I'm not sure if this is optimal.
 Just curious what other people who have tackled problems like these have done and looking for second opinions. Thanks.

Routing in Google Maps remains one of our most helpful and frequently used features. Determining the best route from A to B requires making complex trade-offs between factors including the estimated time of arrival (ETA), tolls, directness, surface conditions (e.g., paved, unpaved roads), and user preferences, which vary across transportation mode and local geography. Often, the most natural visibility we have into travelers' preferences is by analyzing real-world travel patterns.



Learning preferences from observed sequential decision making behavior is a classic application of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Given a Markov decision process (MDP) — a formalization of the road network — and a set of demonstration traject…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I've been working on an AI data marketplace platform for a few months now. Users can buy, sell, request, and subscribe to data/datasets (and soon even train their ML/AI models using other users' datasets). One of our key features is the request feature, which allows users to submit data requests for free. These requests include descriptions, required fields, geographical scope, budget etc... Once a request is posted, it's sent to numerous companies, organizations, and data vendors that have the potential to fulfill it.
 I understand how frustrating the data acquisition process can be, so I designed this platform to be your one-stop shop for all data-related transactions. You no longer have to spend weeks or months dealing with different vendors and companies through slow emails. With our platform, you can request, negotiate, and purchase data all in one place, and it's completely free to post a request, by the way.
 We've already achieved some successes, and we hope to help more people access the datasets they need. After all, the best AI models are built on diverse and differentiating data. We've had some notable achievements, and we're eager to see if we can fulfill even more interesting dataset requests!

 My opinion: It lacks a Cognitive Architecture: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02427 Also the models are far too small and are more on the gpt-2 level. The idea in itself is a good one but can be far improved with bigger models. I also would like to remember in this that all foundation models could be improved if there would be no tokenizers: https://x.com/karpathy/status/1657949234535211009?s=20 
 Abstract:
  
While recently Multimodal Large Language Models (MM-LLMs) have made exciting strides, they mostly fall prey to the limitation of only input-side multimodal understanding, without the ability to produce content in multiple modalities.

 Abstract:
  
With their recent development, large language models (LLMs) have been found to exhibit a certain level of Theory of Mind (ToM), a complex cognitive capacity that is related to our conscious mind and that allows us to infer another's beliefs and perspective. While human ToM capabilities are believed to derive from the neural activity of a broadly interconnected brain network, including that of dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) neurons, the precise processes underlying LLM's capacity for ToM or their similarities with that of humans remains largely unknown. In this study, we drew inspiration from the dmPFC neurons subserving human ToM and employed a similar methodology to examine whether LLMs exhibit comparable characteristics. Surp…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I'm trying to create an alignment between source audio in a different language than the translated transcript. Essentially want to align the translated transcript with the word-level timestamps on an Audio, programmatically. I've tried to find different tools; some open-source ML models force alignment if the source audio and transcript language are the same. 
 My goal is to have audio in a dubbed language, which I generate using a translated transcript that has been originally transcribed from my audio. Alignment seems tough since languages are spoken at different rates, so I'm figuring out the best way to optimize alignment without having to speed up/slow down the audio too much for each sentence.

 The TTS quality is similar to Elevenlabs, and there are some sample clips on the home page.
 Stuff I'm working on:
 - Emotional speech (where you can select the emotion of the TTS). Right now you can already do it by putting the emotion in brackets: e.g. "[Angrily] Please go away!" but I want to make it better.
 - Music with vocals. Currently the model only generates instrumental music. I am retraining it/tweaking the model to allow for music with lyrics.
 - Faster Inference: Since I'm doing this all myself and I'm not rich, I don't have access to the best hardware. However, I am working on some optimizations like speculative decoding that should speed things up.
 Anyways, let me know if you have any questions/comments/feature suggestions/see any bugs! Feel free to DM me. Thanks.

 Our project (Kani) is a super lightweight and hackable alternative to frameworks like LangChain or simpleAIchat meant to help developers hook in callable functions or tools to chat models easily. With Kani, devs can write functions in pure python and just add one line (the @ai_function() decorator) to turn any function into an AI-callable function!
 Kani works with any model and has built-in tools for OpenAI, HuggingFace, LLaMAv2, Vicuna, and GGML with more to come. Kani also never does any prompt engineering under the hood and doesn't require learning complex library tools---all defaults are minimal and highly customizable.
 Check out our Colab for mini-examples of things like retrieval, web-search, model routing, etc. https://colab.research.google.com/github/zhudotexe/kani/blob/main/examples/colab_examples.ipynb

The financial institution believes Dojo’s applications will go beyond Tesla's Full-Self Driving (FSD) capabilities.
 To stay on top of the latest advancements in AI, look here first.

 Morgan Stanley's Bullish Prediction on Dojo
  
Morgan Stanley has suggested that Dojo might not just enhance Tesla's FSD technology, but could find use in other devices that make real-time decisions based on a visual field.
 Apart from raising Tesla’s valuation, this could potentially open up new markets for the company.
 Following this, Morgan Stanley has increased its target price for Tesla shares from $250 to $400 each.
  
Dojo Supercomputer Overview
  
Tesla has developed Dojo in-house, diverging from conventional AI accelerators and involving its own computing, networking, IO, and instruction set.
 At the heart of Dojo is the D1 AI accelerator processor, containing 354 custom CPU cores. Twenty-five D1 chips are combined to create a Dojo training tile, which could expedite Tesla’s move towards earning revenue from vehicle software.
  
Future Plans and Implications
  
Tesla could potentially become an AI-as-a-service provider to automakers in need of FSD capabilities with Dojo.
 As the development of Dojo continues, Tesla has invested in alternative AI infrastructures, including a cluster of 10,000 of Nvidia's most potent H100 accelerators.

 The way i understand it there are 3 main methods which are compatible with different backends (the backend part is still quite confusing to me). What is the core diference between what the methods do and the backends? What are some core diferences between the backends? What is the main distinction between GPTQ and NF4? How does NF4 relate to QLoRa, is it the same or is it just a small part of QLoRa?
 Thanks in advance and i apologize for any ignorance.

 I'm currently working on a computer vision project using the Oxford Pets Dataset, which consists of 37 different pet categories. I initially used a pre-trained ViT model with ImageNet weights model=vit_b_32(ViT_B_32_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V1), and it gave me an impressive accuracy of 88%. However, I want to modify the architecture of the ViT model and train it from scratch without relying on ImageNet weights.
 I'm aware that ViT models are data-hungry and that training from scratch (model=vit_b_32( )) can be challenging, especially with limited data. I've already applied data augmentation techniques to enhance my dataset, but I'm still struggling to achieve satisfactory results. My accuracy is currently only 7%.
 I'd appreciate any advice or tips from the community on how I can improve the performance of my scratch-trained ViT model. Are there any specific training strategies, hyperparameters, or architectural modifications that I should consider? How can I make the most out of my limited dataset to boost accuracy?
 Thank you in advance for your help!

For example: A user speak English in an Indian accent should have that accent cloned in the output audio as well. By default, tortoise is not good at doing that. It can clone the pitch of the voice really well but the accent is completely lost. I was wondering if fine tuning the model could get me what I want. Please do suggest. Also do suggest any methods on fine tuning it if it does in fact help my use case. Thanks a lot!
 Note: I've also tried bark, coqui and vall-e-x. They aren't that good for voice cloning from what I saw.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Somewhere in the world there's a person who is the smartest. Why stop there? There are ten people who are the smartest. And if they are on the Internet, AI will find them.
 Perhaps not yet. It probably needs to get smarter. Maybe by Gemini. Or GPT-5. But eventually an AI will analyze all of the content on the Internet, and determine from that data who are the ten most intelligent people on the planet, (whose material is online).
 Of course if AI can determine the top ten, it can certainly determine the top 100, and the top 1,000, and even the top 100,000. I suppose when that happens there will be a lot more human brain power available to solve our problems. Although by then AI will be solving them far better than we could, haha. 
 But think about it for a minute. There are very smart people out there who don't publish in traditional mass media channels. The geniuses among us who don't fit in so well, and are therefore resigned to the margins, remaining unrecognized. 
 Wouldn't it be great if AI discovered them, and gave them the validation they deserve? Wouldn't it be great to find out who they are so that they can better work on whatever.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been working on a simple ML classifier that predicts the size of a piece of clothing based in user body specifications (such as height, weight, age, etc). As we want to move the model to production, I’m keen on understanding the best strategies to evaluate its performance in a real-world setting.
 This is a small example of how we would “tag” our recommendations:
  
If the model predicts a size M, and the user buys and keeps it, it’s a correct prediction
 If the user buys and M and returns it due to size issues, it’s incorrect
 If the user buys a different size, returns it, and then buys the size initially recommended, it’s counted as correct.
  
Additionally since we cache user input data, when they visit the same product after a while, or if they visit different product pages, they don’t need to re-input. We need to determine if they looked at this recommendation or if they even took it into account, especially if some time has passed since the original recommendation was made.
 Main questions I have: 1. What scenarios might I be missing when tagging incorrect/correct predictions 2. How would you approach the data tagging issue in this context? 3. What would be the best strategy to determine if a recommendation was considered by the user or if it’s too old to be reliable?
 I’ve gotten some insights already but would love to hear more perspectives. Any feedback, experiences, or even related research would be much appreciated!

So this was my prompt:
  
Write 5 sentences that all end with the word 'apple'.
  
It was identical in all models. I only did this exactly once for each one. Here’s the results I got of how many of the 5 sentences ended in “apple”. I let “apples” count as an ending as well even though technically that is a fail.

More generally, phi-1.5 (1.3B) exhibits many of the traits of much larger LLMs, both good – such as the ability to "think step by step" or perform some rudimentary in-context learning – and bad, including hallucinations and the potential for toxic and biased generations – encouragingly though, we are seeing improvement on that front thanks to the absence of web data. We open-source phi-1.5 to promote further research on these urgent topics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI, with its vast resource needs, is raising concerns over sustainability and environmental impact. Last year, Microsoft's data centers drained over 2,500 Olympic-sized swimming pools worth of water, reflecting a 34% increase from the previous year. Google also reported a 20% water consumption increase over the same period.
 To stay on top of the latest advancements in AI, look here first.

 A deeper look at AI's water footprint
  
The growth of AI and related technologies increases the need for vast server farms, which depend heavily on water for cooling purposes.
 The spike in water usage can be attributed primarily to AI, as per Shaolei Ren, a researcher at the UC, Riverside, who focuses on AI's environmental impact.
 For every 5 to 50 prompts submitted to ChatGPT, it consumes about 500 ml of water, according to an upcoming paper from Professor Ren's team.
  
Big Tech and Responsible Water Usage
  
Recognizing their significant water consumption, tech companies like Google have voiced concerns and are exploring ways to mitigate the negative effects.
 Google has committed to responsible water usage, which includes assessing where and how their water usage might affect surrounding areas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 "Hallucinations" seem to be one of the major blockers to the adoption of LLMs, especially in enterprise settings where seemingly plausible but false information/decisions can be disastrous.
 I am wondering whether or not current LLMs, like GPT4 or Llama 2 70b have reached the reasoning capabilities to be able not to hallucinate when fed the proper information.
 One can see a LLMs as college / high school students that have some basic reasoning and knowledge but might need to be nudged to answer business / scientific questions.
 What is your opinion on the topic? Is there for instance, a database of hallucinations, so that one could test that if the model would have answered properly if the right context was fed in the prompt?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've consulted all the AIs and all of the search engines I could think of and am still coming up short. 
 I'm pretty sure I just didn't make this up, somewhere between 2005 and 2015 there was a paper where the authors describe a method for using silicon neuron forests to predict traffic patterns. 
 They etched silicon columns onto a wafer and then submerged the wafer in an ionic solution. They sent electrical signals into the column array and recorded the output. As the signal was allowed to interact with the silicon in solution, the columns would begin to form small conductive tendrils or filaments to neighboring pillars. These filaments formed a neural network, which could be used to predict traffic patterns.
 I'm sure there were at least 2 papers that came out about this subject, but for the life of me I cannot find them. I've spent many many hours looking for at least one of the papers and am hoping for a longshot...that some kind internet stranger comes across this and can point me in the right direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Please let me know if there is a better sub for this!
 I trained a local voice model of my father, who recently passed away. He was a musician, and I found a handful of songs he had recorded in the 80's. Unfortunately but I only have a copy coming from an audio cassette, which I've digitized. There may be a copy on open reel somewhere in our basement but I haven't found it so far.
 Any, because dad was always writing and recording new songs, my training dataset consists of all original, high quality vocal stems at 96khz/24bit, spanning at least 20 years and consisting of about 30 ish minutes of audio. I also tried starting over but with a speech he gave as additional training, coming out to around 55 minutes of audio.
 I wanted to use his voice model to essentially remaster his original vocals from the cassette audio, and rerecord the rest of the instruments myself. I isolated the vocals using UVR (also tried mdx23), and tried to clean it up further as much as possible.
 The RVC vocals comes out alright, but due to the low quality of the audio, it seems to mess up certain words, for example "free" comes out as "fee". The SVC vocals came out with a closer tonality, but had many more artifacts, and pitch had a tendency to go up/down 2 octaves at the end of certain phrases.
 When using a higher quality sample (like one of my own vocal tracks), these issues aren't so prevalent, although rvc seems to create more of a hybrid sounding timbre than svc, blending the original voice + model rather than just the sound of the model.
 Happy to post samples of input/output audio, let me know!
 tl;dr
 high quality training data, low quality inference audio. Voice model is the same voice as input audio,
 1. tips for making the best of what I've got?
 2. any way to use text along with input audio and maintain original vibrato?
 3. any way to train a UVR/MDX model using a particular voice in order to better isolate that person?
 thanks :)

 Abstract: 
  
Recent efforts have incorporated large language models (LLMs) with external resources (e.g., the Internet) or internal control flows (e.g., prompt chaining) for tasks requiring grounding or reasoning. However, these efforts have largely been piecemeal, lacking a systematic framework for constructing a fully-fledged language agent. To address this challenge, we draw on the rich history of agent design in symbolic artificial intelligence to develop a blueprint for a new wave of cognitive language agents. We first show that LLMs have many of the same properties as production systems, and recent efforts to improve their grounding or reasoning mirror the development of cognitive architectures built around production systems. We then propose Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents (CoALA), a conceptual framework to systematize diverse methods for LLM-based reasoning, grounding, learning, and decision making as instantiations of language agents in the framework. Finally, we use the CoALA framework to highlight gaps and propose actionable directions toward more capable language agents in the future.

A good summary is concise and precise, and I want flexibility with bullet points and level of detail.
 Having issues with ChatGPT-based tools' token limits, and some that purport to support GPT4 (I could use that "advanced reasoning") but but have to fall back to GPT3 for various errors and reasons. So I'm open to Claude-based ones (may be too early, mo' tokens) and other proprietary engines.

 Here is my main code:
 gymnasium.env = snakeEnv() # data_manager = snakeEnv.get_data_manager() # Create an A2C model model = A2C("MlpPolicy", gymnasium.env, verbose=1, device="cuda") # Train the model (replace 'total_timesteps' with appropriate values) model.learn(total_timesteps=100_000, log_interval=1000) 
 Here is the relevant code in my agent file:
 class snakeEnv(gym.Env): def __init__(self): super(snakeEnv, self).__init__() # Define action and observation space # They must be gym.spaces objects # Example when using discrete actions: self.initNames() self.action_space = spaces.Discrete(3) self.gameCount = 0 self.record = 0 self.reward = 0 self.score = 0 self.game = SnakeGameAI(self.selectedChallenge) self.observation_space = spaces.Box(low=-1000, high=1000, shape=(11,), dtype=np.uint8) def step(self, action): self.reward, self.done, self.score = self.game.play_step(action) self.observation = self.getState(self.game) self.info = {} return self.observation, self.reward, self.done, self.info def reset(self): self.gameCount += 1 self.data_manager.logData(self.gameCount, self.score, self.record, self.reward, self.game.getDeathReason(),self.game.getHeadPos()) self.game.reset() observation = self.getState(self.game) if self.score > self.record: self.record = self.score return observation 
 It would be nice to be able to log the data in the reset function. I know how work with xslx files, the main things is just being able to get the model data.

 Explanation:
 An AI-driven compliance system ensuring adherence to evolving regulations, minimizing risks, and enabling businesses to operate confidently within legal boundaries. Pairing Large Language Models (LLMs) with blockchain technology to offer a range of benefits, particularly in the context of regulatory compliance.
 LLMs, powered by advanced natural language processing and machine learning capabilities, can enhance regulatory compliance processes in several ways. Firstly, they can automate the analysis of regulatory documents, helping businesses stay updated with evolving compliance requirements. LLMs can also assist in generating compliance reports, simplifying complex legal language into
 understandable summaries. Furthermore, by integrating LLMs into smart contracts, businesses
 can ensure that contract terms adhere to regulatory guidelines automatically.
 The integration of LLMs with blockchain can significantly improve regulatory compliance by automating document analysis, simplifying legal language, monitoring compliance in real-time, and enhancing customer interactions—all contributing to greater efficiency and accuracy in adhering to
 regulatory standards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone!
 I want to develop a DRL agent to play a turn-based 1v1 game and I'm starting to plan how to handle things in the future.
 One potential problem that I thought of is that there is a possible mid turn one-sided decision. An abstraction of the game would be like:
 There are two players: player A and player B. At the start of each turn, each player chooses an action between 3 possible actions. If player A chose a specific action (let's say action 1), the game asks player B to make a decision (let's say block or not block) and vice versa. Actions are calculated. Next turn starts.
 What would be a good approach to handle that? I thought of two possible solutions: 1. Anticipate the possibility of that mid turn decision beforehand adding a new dimension to the actions space (e.g. take action 3; if opponent takes action 1, block). That sounds that it could create credit assignment problems e.g. giving credit to the second action when it actually didn't happen. 2. Make two policies with shared value functions. That sounds complicated and I saw that previous works like DeepNash actually did that, but I don't know what problems could arise from that.
 Opinions/suggestions? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently trying to learn about how autodiff is used in gradient calculations. In the all sources I've came across, none can explicitly point to an authoritative, consistent or complete source on autodiff. I don't need examples of autodiff, I just need the full, generalized algorithm laid out.
 For example:
 I open this link: https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/spragunr/CS445/lectures/autodiff/autodiff.pdf which simply provides autodiff applied on an example, but not the description of the algorithm.
 The author of that link says if I need any more info, I should go to this other link: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/224140/step-by-step-example-of-reverse-mode-automatic-differentiation/235758#235758
 But this link doesn't even have topological sort as part of the operation. Therefore these descriptions of the autodiff is inconsistent and leaves me not knowing who to trust.
 Can someone point to some original paper on autodiff or a single source that describes this algorithm fully?
 I note here that this situation is completely different from backpropagation. The full backpropagation algorithm is impeccably laid out in peer-reviewed text books such as Learning from Data by Mustafa et al. and Optimization textbook by Chong and Zak. Furthermore, the algorithm defined in these two books are completely consistent with one another.

 Researchers at MIT and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute have developed an innovative AI-powered model called OncoNPC, designed to assist in identifying the origin of tumors in cancer patients where the primary site is unknown. For a small percentage of cancer patients, pinpointing the origin of their cancer can be incredibly challenging, making it difficult to select the most appropriate treatment, as many cancer drugs are designed for specific cancer types.
 Using machine learning, the researchers created OncoNPC, a computational model capable of analyzing the genetic sequences of approximately 400 genes. This model, based on genetic data routinely collected at Dana-Farbe…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I need to segment some short strings, they are about 100 tokens in length (BERT tokens), or 20-40 words. 1 segment per text.
 I'm currently using Spacy first, and if it fails, then use BERT. It's alright, but BERT is not really up to par to what I hope for. I'm wondering if there is some better use, as this is my first NLP project. I've trained the huggingface BertForTokenClassification to label the text as either part of segment, or not part. So binary token classification, then smooth out outliers and pick the longest segment of each text. Each string has only 1 segment.
 I've trained the BERT with 500 examples. I can easily make more train data, though training on my laptop takes time. If there are better/alternative approaches, I'd love to hear them. Regex rules etc. don't apply, which is why I'm using DL models. Especially I feel like I should segment the whole segment at a time, not by token.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to take a second to express my appreciation for the Folktables datasets!
 Folktables is a Python package that contains datasets derived from US Census data. The datasets cover topics about income, employment, health, transportation, and housing. They are quite useful for studying the effects of distribution shifts on ML models.
 For example, one could design experiments to:
 1. Study the model's performance under geographic distribution shifts:
 Each prediction problem in Folktables can be instantiated with data from every US state. So one could use Folktables to study questions around geographic distribution shifts. For example, we can train a classifier using data from California and then evaluate it on data from Michigan.
 2. Study the model's performance under temporal distribution shifts.
 Folktables contains data for several years, which in itself constitutes a form of temporal distribution shift. So, we can train a classifier using employment data from California in 2014 and evaluate how its equality of opportunity violation or accuracy varies over time.
 Finding non-synthetic (and open-access) datasets that exhibit these behaviors is so hard! Yet, it's quite easy to encounter them in production environments. 🫠
 So, big kudos to the UC Berkeley and Toyota Research Institute research teams for crafting these datasets.

 I read a book "Small unmanned aircraft: theory and practice" and watched few videos on YouTube that are reffering to this particular book. But there is a thing in correction step that I do not fully understand. To be clear, the correction looks as follows: x = x_(t-1) + K*(z - h(x))
 Both in the book and in videos, the state vector "x" is [roll, pitch]. But "z" and "h(x)" are the actual and predicted accelerometer readings [ax, ay, az]. So it looks to me, that they try to correct prediction of angles with readings in acceleration: [roll, pitch] = [roll, pitch]_(t-1) + K*[ax, ay, az].
 What am I missing?

 I wrote CNN using tensor flow to predict phenotypes (cognitive impairment (0/1) and language ability (0-3)) from .vcf files.
 I transformed the .vcf into tabular format and after determining which columns to keep, I have
 Chromosome Position Mutation (taken from ref/alt columns) Genotype
 And merged it with the phenotype data so basically every row has the cog and language scores.
 I feel like this is a bad way to go about doing this since the model is likely predicting cog/language scores for each mutation rather than each patient as a whole. Am I wrong? How can I fix this so it’s more of a composite of all mutations per subject that the model trains on?
 Thanks!

Meta plans to begin the training of this LLM early in 2024, emphasizing free access for companies.
 Despite its grand vision, Meta has encountered obstacles like researcher attrition and contentious resource allocation amidst multiple LLM projects.
 Noteworthy is the intense competition from major players such as Apple, Google, and Amazon to integrate widely generative AI in their user interface.
  
Broader implications
  
While OpenAI has not immediately revealed plans for a GPT-5, other tech giants are investing heavily. Apple's investment in its "Ajax" AI model signifies the increasing race to advanced AI.
 This move by Meta represents the ongoing trend of tech conglomerates expanding in the AI space, a fact revealed through Google and Microsoft’s use of AI in their productivity tools and Amazon's ongoing developments.

 P.S. If you like this kind of analysis, I write a free newsletter that explores the latest AI developments. Professionals from Google, Meta, and OpenAI are already reading it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work with device logs that are massive text files, filled with data that's hard to go through manually. I'm primarily interested in extracting specific events or insights, such as security incidents or device malfunctions. The conventional method would be to use regular expressions to filter out relevant information since the logs are structured, but I'm curious about leveraging Large Language Models for this task.
 I've experimented a bit with zero-shot learning for text summarization but didn't get satisfactory results. Before I invest more time into fine-tuning an LLM, I'd love to hear from anyone who has experience or advice on how to approach this problem.
 Could LLMs potentially make the process more efficient and effective? Any pointers or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Reddit,
 I'm working on a tool to pull data from highly irregular Excel files. I've gotten reasonable results which is extremely fast with standard Python coding, but it's far from perfect due to the lack of standardized templates. 
 Interestingly, when I tested ChatGPT-4 on a sample table, it did a decent job at data extraction. However, relying solely on GPT-4 has its downsides like token limits and slow processing speed (and data privacy issues). Plus, splitting the Excel sheet to fit within these limits results in loss of context and data.
 I'm considering fine-tuning a language model to post-process data that was in a Pandas DataFrame (perhaps converted to JSON). Has anyone had success with this approach or have alternative recommendations? I've tried Langchain, but it wasn't helpful.
 I have figured out to extract the relevant columns, but the post-processing part is where I am considering using an LLM which understands the domain and what needs to be extracted based on the examples I feed it.
 Looking forward to your thoughts! And would be happy to answer any additional questions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Tensorflow since 2017. I know it wasn't ideal or easy back then, but as an early adopter, I became very proficient with it and it has improved a lot since then. I have developed and deployed many custom models in low-level TF, both with and without utilizing the Keras abstractions. I am very comfortable with it in general.
 But I'm noticing now that Pytorch is gaining more popularity, all the younger practitioners, who got into deep learning within the last 3-5 years, are Pytorch adopters. I've also heard rumors that even googlers are also abandoning TF.
 I started playing around with Pytorch and as a TF expert, I couldn't help but getting annoyed at how far it is lagging behind in many abstractions and optimizations. I know things are getting better now with the Pytorch 2.0 and introducing some optimization such as the "compile" functionality, but still many of the pytorch project tools remain in beta such as Torchtext and I find many things very annoying, such as having to set the device and pass it on to layers if you want GPU acceleration, having to install Torchtext and other processing libraries separately, or having to use a Dataloader and the limited data type supports for torchdataset.
 Most people who have not mastered Tensorflow would not relate to my annoyance. Anyhow I'd really prefer to stay within my comfort zone and continue to develop and improve in TF, but if TF is dying, then I better not to, right? So should I convert? Is it indeed dying?

 Pytorch also can do these things, and the boiler plate doesn't look worse at a glance:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm an undergrad student working on a machine learning project about motor imagery classification for BCI. One requirement for the project is that I need to implement LIME an explainable AI tool on my model. I ran into a problem rather quickly as my model accuracy quickly decreases as I try and add more subjects to the training data, I'm the publicly avaliable EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset from physio.net. The features I'm currently using for training my model are SVD entropy, Spectral Entropy, Hjorth mobility , Hjorth complexity and CSP components after applying overlapping filter bank.
 One method I've been suggested is to train models seperately for each subject, I don't know how to go about this should I construct a new model for each subject or should I keep the architecture but reset the training weight, also would this defeat the purpose of implementing LIME in the first place.
 I'm wondering if there's a way to deal with inter-subject variability without having to make/ train models for each subject seperately.
 I'm sorry if the choice of features doesn't make much sense since I'm basically self-taught and I have no prior knowledge about EEG or BCI
 TLDR; how do I deal with inter-subject variability without having to make/ train models for each subject seperately.

 I have developed a library, called 100gecs, that makes hyperparameter tuning on LightGBM and CatBoost models trivially easy.
 Background
 LightGBM and CatBoost are gradient boosted tree models, like XGBoost, and in many cases the best baseline model in supervised learning tasks on tabular data. They work by iteratively fitting trees on data, with each subsequent tree "correcting" on some level the prediction of the prior tree. Here's a good intro, if you want some more background on these methods.
 Hyperparameter tuning promises an optimally or near-optimally configured model, thus enabling you to get the best baseline model you possibly can.
 Summary
 100gecs provides custom child classes of LGBMClassifier, LGBMRegressor, CatBoostRegressor and CatBoostClassifier that can be …]]></summary>

 Looking at job postings, at least in Europe, it looks like the minimum required experience is around 3 years. There seems to be a good demand for mid-senior level positions, but a void for entry level. As I understand it, most DS departments are not big enough to spare resources for newbies that must be trained, the need is for a few but seasoned engineers. How far is my guess from the truth? 
 And, most importantly, how could new candidates (let's say recent MSc in Data Science, for instance) get into the industry? Through analyst/DE roles?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm attempting to address an issue related to electricity trading in the day-ahead market. The objective is to submit 24 bids for each hour. Each bid is represented as a vector of length 10, with 5 values indicating the price and the other 5 indicating the quantity of electricity. For instance, given a sample action vector [w, x, y, z, ...], it operates as follows: if the price is greater than w, buy/sell x units of electricity, if the price is greater than y, buy/sell z units of electricity, and so forth. I possess three years' worth of data, including crucial features like weather conditions, coal prices, wind speed, net load, forecasted load, locational marginal price, and more.
 Initially, I trained a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to tackle this problem, and it's performing quite well. However, the DQN provides a scalar action for each hour, neglecting price points. It acts regardless of the price. I'm aware that I can explore solutions like Proximal Policy Gradient to generate a vector action that includes both electricity unit amounts and prices.
 I have three questions:
  
Is it possible to solve this problem using Dynamic Programming techniques? While I understand it's not an exceedingly difficult problem, can I expect some results if I attempt to apply DP?
 
How challenging might it be to output a vector instead of a scalar, with the vector being monotonically increasing? What's the recommended approach for a problem of this nature? Is it worthwhile to explore RL and specifically Proximal Policy Optimization?
 
How would you approach such a problem while keeping it simple and avoiding unnecessary complexity? 
 
 Any guidance or insights would be greatly appreciated.

 They'll put in 10s or 100s of hours reinforcing the level. It'll play over and over again, selecting for what works, and dropping what doesn't. And over time, the AI will be amazing at that level.
 But, if you take that reinforced data, and move to level 2 of that game... it'll be practically useless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone!
 I'm a truck driver with a passion for creating music. While I'm familiar with basic IT tasks from my personal experiences, I'm new to the tech industry and am eager to break in.
 I've been exploring AI tools like ChatGPT and have become comfortable navigating GitHub. These experiences make me confident about diving into the tech field. After some research, I'm contemplating three domains:
  
Cloud Technology: It seems stable and beginner-friendly. I'm leaning here primarily because I've heard cybersecurity is saturated.
 Cybersecurity: Interested but cautious due to market saturation.
 Generative AI/Data: My true passion lies here, but I've gathered that projects matter more than certifications for entry-level roles in this niche, especially for someone without a degree.
  
Given my background and no technical degree, which field would you suggest I pursue? Should I focus on certifications before taking on projects? I genuinely appreciate any insights!
 (What do you guys think about this “CloudRoad map” is it good advice?)

One idea I'm particularly excited about is anticipatory customer support. The goal is to proactively address customer needs, perhaps even before they realize them, using ML-driven insights.
 Has anyone delved into this concept or tried implementing it? I'd love to hear thoughts, potential pitfalls, or even success stories. Thanks in advance for your insights!

I know that ML folks use statistics all the time, but I am often under the impression that it's mostly the basics. I understand that inference and prediction are inherently different, but I would assume the common knowledge will be much more vast.
 What is your perspective on that? Am I just missing the point? Is there room for improvement in the future? Do you think statistics literacy (advanced, not ANOVA or so) is common among ML practitioners?

 My Context:
 I have experience setting up linux systems, building computers by myself and training DL models (CNNs/GNNs/LLMs) in a corporate setting. I am venturing to the academic world where resources are more constrained and so I am wondering if there are any guides, tips on setting up a research computer lab that does AI. I do not expect to train from scratch an LLM but maybe finetuning an small LLM. I might also need to do a lot parallelizable IO work to preprocess data. I will talk with the IT department of the university but would like to have some ideas before that conversation.
 I would appreciate any tips or thoughts, particularly on:
 * How many GPUs/CPUs to buy? Balancing cost/compute.
 * Recommended software for managing resources.
 * Running 100s-1ks of CPU jobs in parallel.
 * Local compute cluster vs buying compute online.
 * Hyperparameter optimization and logging of metrics.
 * Anything else you can think of?

 Hi everyone, just wanted to share a dataset I've been working on for use in a personal project!
 GoodWiki is a 179 million token dataset of English Wikipedia articles collected on September 4, 2023, that have been marked as Good or Featured by Wikipedia editors. The dataset provides these articles in GitHub-flavored Markdown format, preserving layout features like lists, code blocks, math, and block quotes, unlike many other public Wikipedia datasets. Articles are accompanied by a short description of the page as well as any associated categories.
 Thanks to a careful conversion process from wikicode, the markup language used by Wikipedia, articles in GoodWiki are generally faithful reproductions of the corresponding original Wikipedia pages, minus references, files, infoboxes, and tables. Curated template transclusion and HTML tag handling have minimized instances where entire words and phrases are missing mid-sentence like in other public Wikipedia datasets.
 GoodWiki is more than 1.5 times larger (when compared using the same tokenizer) than the widely used WikiText-103 dataset by Merity et al., even after excluding article descriptions. Also limited to articles marked as Good or Featured, WikiText inspired GoodWiki.

Microsoft-backed OpenAI needed a lot of water to cool its powerful supercomputer as it taught its AI systems how to mimic human writing.
 
Leading tech developers like Microsoft, OpenAI, and Google have acknowledged the high costs associated with the growing demand for AI tools, including expensive semiconductors and increased water consumption.
 
Microsoft disclosed a 34% spike in global water consumption, largely attributed to its AI research.
 
A researcher estimates that ChatGPT uses 500 milliliters of water for every series of prompts or questions.

That being said, during deployment it is currently predicting 0 for all inputs regardless of how varied the inputs may be. However, during the testing phase my model had a varied accuracy rate of 75%-85%. I'm beginning to think that it is very likely that during the testing phase the model was predicting 0 for everything and just getting these higher accuracy rates because of the dominance of non-MVPs within my dataset. This all being said, I'm a noob to ML and decided it'd be best to come on here for help. Is that the likely reason and if so how do I go about fixing it? Furthermore, what other issues could cause this and how would I go about fixing it?

 2) Multiple robots tasked with a search and rescue like mission in a particular area. 
 Both are basically applications of n agents trying to collectively cover a region.

This makes it significantly faster and more reliable than other architectures, which is important for online or interactive applications. For lack of a better term, I'm referring to this as Unified Retrieval Augmented Generation (URAG).
 The closest I can find to this in the literature is TABR which utilizes recall to improve the performance of LLMs relative to tree based models, although this particular application of Retrieval is extremely computationally expensive for a slight performance improvement, unlike RAG for LLMs that seems to provide significant new capabilities to the model.
 Is there more research going on for what I'd refer to as URAG systems? We're building open source Python & JS SDKs to make the underlying SQL API more accessible, but I'm wondering if this community, or the academic community has already done more work in this area that we should be aware of.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Based on a bit of research and a lot of gut feeling, I offer the following speculation:
  
if you self-trained an LLM with a Python interpreter or Java compiler in a feedback loop where it learned from its own mistakes then it could become dramatically better at coding. It's actually a miracle that they are "decent" at coding despite getting virtually no feedback from an interpreter or compiler.
 one could train not merely on input and output, but also on an execution trace so the LLM learned HOW the interpreter got the result
 one could also train the model on how to install and invoke open source software and thus it would learn about a variety of languages, versions and runtimes
 this might also improve its logical reasoning skills in general
  
Admittedly, running programs is a lot more expensive than doing simple next-word prediction on pre-existing texts.
 But on the other hand, a corpus of a million program executions can also be used to train future LLMs. You can keep the execution information forever and re-use it as traditional next-token prediction input.

The first character that I launched yesterday is your typical valley girl - Alix - who hangs around tech and crypto people. She browses Twitter all day and writes tweets with her opinion of the stuff she comes by. With a unique mood generated for her every day, it's always a gamble to see who lands on her good or bad side.
 I would really appreciate it if you check her out and let me know what you think! I'm interested in further developing the project and making these synthetic entities equivalent to real people in entertaiment and companionship.

 For ongoing research I'm defining a decision problem in the form of an MDP. In a simple form, this MDP can be solved via Dynamic Programming. Of course I would like to scale up my MDP by including a sensor simulation, which renders the MDP to such a complexity that my next step is to use a DQN.
 My challenge is that I'm not sure how to represent my more complex MDP in a fitting DQN. Quite frankly, the more I look into DQN's, the more I wonder if my MDP is correctly defined. It would be great to hear your views and suggestions if you like to share.
 Definition of the MDP
 The MDP aims at detecting and chasing away a mosquito. For each distance step (discrete distances although it should be continuous), for instance Si, we cycle through an episode: we detect the mosquito…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Article | Notebook | GitHub
 There are a rapidly growing number of options in the vector database space. One of the more recent developments is the creation of new vector index plugins for traditional database systems such as pgvector. This is reminiscent of the discussion back in the mid 2010s on whether one should use full text search in the database or sync with an external system such as Elasticsearch.
 Just as with full text search, it will be tough for vector indexing in the database to compete with the more dedicated solutions past the simple use cases. For example, according the ANN-Benchmarks, the dedicated vector solutions score much higher.
 The desire to reduce stack complexity and the maturity of systems like Postgres make strong arguments to try to find a way to do it all in the database.
 The referenced article above proposes a way to integrate existing databases like PostgreSQL with vector indexes such as Faiss, Hnswlib, external vector databases and even keyword indexes like Elasticsearch. This opens up the possibility of combining Postgres features such as fine-grained access control with the performance of a dedicated vector index.

This narrative overlooks the responsibility of lawmakers and their regulatory inertia.
 
The media frames AI regulation as a matter of technical knowledge rather than moral consideration.
 
The New York Times highlights the slow congressional response to new technologies and the potential influence of lawmakers' financial interests in AI companies.
 
The media fails to question why lawmakers, who have profited from AI, cannot apply their knowledge to regulate it.
 
This lack of critical information in news sources defends the inaction of lawmakers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working on clustering groups of almost identical (but time shifted) signals together. These clusters will have varying sizes, and I don´t know what the final number of clusters will be. The database consists of up to 100 thousand signals (represented by 4000 long vectors as read from individual text files) which are already quite similar to each other. 
 Ideally I would just make a huge cross-correlation matrix but that is too computationally expensive. So is DTW. What I have done is to apply the fast fourier transform to get it into the frequency domain and therefore get rid of that time shift. Then I would apply a clustering algorithm. I have tried DBSCAN and hierarchical agglomerative clustering which work relatively well but don’t scale well to datasets of this size. Affinity propagation is quick and works okish but I don’t know how to optimise it. 
 Does anyone have any recommendation on which algorithm to use and how to optimise it? Was my idea to apply the fft good? I am not a computer scientist so I am really out of my element.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To review IPPO vs. MAPPO, first, let's revisit the paper "Is Independent Learning All You Need in the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge?". ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09533 ) The paper shows that simply applying PPO to the SMAC task to construct an IPPO (independent PPO) algorithm like IQL can surpass QMIX on SMAC. IPPO demonstrates the effectiveness of applying PPO to multi-agent systems.
 The paper further extends IPPO to MAPPO. The difference is that the critic of PPO uses the global state instead of the observation as input. Surprisingly, the global information does not enhance the actual performance of IPPO.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Data is the cornerstone of deep learning. This paper reveals that the
recently developed Diffusion Model is a scalable data engine for object
detection. Existing methods for scaling up detection-oriented data often
require manual collection or generative models to obtain target images,
followed by data augmentation and labeling to produce training pairs, which are
costly, complex, or lacking diversity. To address these issues, we
presentDiffusionEngine (DE), a data scaling-up engine that provides
high-quality detection-oriented training pairs in a single stage. DE consists
of a pre-trained diffusion model and an effective Detection-Adapter,
contributing to generating scalable, diverse and generalizable detection data
in a plug-and-play manner. Detection-Adapter is learned to align the implicit
semantic and location knowledge in off-the-shelf diffusion models with
detection-aware signals to make better bounding-box predictions. Additionally,
we contribute two datasets, i.e., COCO-DE and VOC-DE, to scale up existing
detection benchmarks for facilitating follow-up research. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that data scaling-up via DE can achieve significant improvements in
diverse scenarios, such as various detection algorithms, self-supervised
pre-training, data-sparse, label-scarce, cross-domain, and semi-supervised
learning. For example, when using DE with a DINO-based adapter to scale up
data, mAP is improved by 3.1% on COCO, 7.6% on VOC, and 11.5% on Clipart.]]></summary>

combining Federated Learning (FL) and graph models with respect to the
constrain of privacy and security. In order to make better use of the power of
graph model, some researchs also combine split learning(SL). However, there are
still several issues left unattended: 1) Clients might not be able to access
the server during inference phase; 2) The graph of clients designed manually in
the server model may not reveal the proper relationship between clients. This
paper proposes a new GNN-oriented split federated learning method, named node
{\bfseries M}asking and {\bfseries M}ulti-granularity {\bfseries M}essage
passing-based Federated Graph Model (M$^3$FGM) for the above issues. For the
first issue, the server model of M$^3$FGM employs a MaskNode layer to simulate
the case of clients being offline. We also redesign the decoder of the client
model using a dual-sub-decoders structure so that each client model can use its
local data to predict independently when offline. As for the second issue, a
new GNN layer named Multi-Granularity Message Passing (MGMP) layer enables each
client node to perceive global and local information. We conducted extensive
experiments in two different scenarios on two real traffic datasets. Results
show that M$^3$FGM outperforms the baselines and variant models, achieves the
best results in both datasets and scenarios.]]></summary>

temperature prompts, then applies a curriculum learning method by increasing
the ratio of them smoothly. 2) Meta-learning-based fine-tuning framework
improves sample-efficiency of fine-tuning process and gives the soft

due to their superior capability in learning node embeddings for various graph
inference tasks, but training them can raise privacy concerns. To address this,
we propose using link local differential privacy over decentralized nodes,
enabling collaboration with an untrusted server to train GNNs without revealing
the existence of any link. Our approach spends the privacy budget separately on
links and degrees of the graph for the server to better denoise the graph
topology using Bayesian estimation, alleviating the negative impact of LDP on
the accuracy of the trained GNNs. We bound the mean absolute error of the
inferred link probabilities against the ground truth graph topology. We then
propose two variants of our LDP mechanism complementing each other in different
privacy settings, one of which estimates fewer links under lower privacy
budgets to avoid false positive link estimates when the uncertainty is high,
while the other utilizes more information and performs better given relatively
higher privacy budgets. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid variant that combines
both strategies and is able to perform better across different privacy budgets.
Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms existing methods in
terms of accuracy under varying privacy budgets.]]></summary>

to adverse weather effects to long-term social and economic impacts on
societies. Computer simulations of atmospheric dynamics are, therefore, of
great importance for the well-being of our and future generations. Here, we
propose AtmoRep, a novel, task-independent stochastic computer model of
atmospheric dynamics that can provide skillful results for a wide range of
applications. AtmoRep uses large-scale representation learning from artificial
intelligence to determine a general description of the highly complex,
stochastic dynamics of the atmosphere from the best available estimate of the
system's historical trajectory as constrained by observations. This is enabled
by a novel self-supervised learning objective and a unique ensemble that
samples from the stochastic model with a variability informed by the one in the
historical record. The task-independent nature of AtmoRep enables skillful
results for a diverse set of applications without specifically training for
them and we demonstrate this for nowcasting, temporal interpolation, model
correction, and counterfactuals. We also show that AtmoRep can be improved with
additional data, for example radar observations, and that it can be extended to
tasks such as downscaling. Our work establishes that large-scale neural
networks can provide skillful, task-independent models of atmospheric dynamics.
With this, they provide a novel means to make the large record of atmospheric
observations accessible for applications and for scientific inquiry,
complementing existing simulations based on first principles.]]></summary>

privacy-preserving machine learning methods have been proposed. In the
clustering domain, various algorithms with a federated learning framework
(i.e., federated clustering) have been actively studied and showed high
clustering performance while preserving data privacy. However, most of the base
clusterers (i.e., clustering algorithms) used in existing federated clustering
algorithms need to specify the number of clusters in advance. These algorithms,
therefore, are unable to deal with data whose distributions are unknown or
continually changing. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a
privacy-preserving continual federated clustering algorithm. In the proposed
algorithm, an adaptive resonance theory-based clustering algorithm capable of
continual learning is used as a base clusterer. Therefore, the proposed
algorithm inherits the ability of continual learning. Experimental results with
synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed algorithm has superior
clustering performance to state-of-the-art federated clustering algorithms
while realizing data privacy protection and continual learning ability. The

learning models tends to deteriorate. In practice, new input data tend to come

We suggest a novel approach that models how explanation characteristics shift

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While a key component to the success of deep learning is the availability of
massive amounts of training data, medical image datasets are often limited in
diversity and size. Transfer learning has the potential to bridge the gap
between related yet different domains. For medical applications, however, it
remains unclear whether it is more beneficial to pre-train on natural or
medical images. We aim to shed light on this problem by comparing
initialization on ImageNet and RadImageNet on seven medical classification
tasks. Our work includes a replication study, which yields results contrary to
previously published findings. In our experiments, ResNet50 models pre-trained
on ImageNet tend to outperform those trained on RadImageNet. To gain further
insights, we investigate the learned representations using Canonical
Correlation Analysis (CCA) and compare the predictions of the different models.
Our results indicate that, contrary to intuition, ImageNet and RadImageNet may
converge to distinct intermediate representations, which appear to diverge
further during fine-tuning. Despite these distinct representations, the
predictions of the models remain similar. Our findings show that the similarity
between networks before and after fine-tuning does not correlate with
performance gains, suggesting that the advantages of transfer learning might
not solely originate from the reuse of features in the early layers of a
convolutional neural network.]]></summary>

algorithm and its latest improvements FasterPAM. One of the versions guarantees
equal results to the original variant and provides a run speedup of $O(k^2)$.
In experiments on real data with 30000 samples and $k$=100, we observed a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Typical technique in knowledge distillation (KD) is regularizing the learning
of a limited capacity model (student) by pushing its responses to match a
powerful model's (teacher). Albeit useful especially in the penultimate layer
and beyond, its action on student's feature transform is rather implicit,
limiting its practice in the intermediate layers. To explicitly embed the
teacher's knowledge in feature transform, we propose a learnable KD layer for
the student which improves KD with two distinct abilities: i) learning how to
leverage the teacher's knowledge, enabling to discard nuisance information, and
ii) feeding forward the transferred knowledge deeper. Thus, the student enjoys
the teacher's knowledge during the inference besides training. Formally, we
repurpose 1x1-BN-ReLU-1x1 convolution block to assign a semantic vector to each
local region according to the template (supervised by the teacher) that the
corresponding region of the student matches. To facilitate template learning in
the intermediate layers, we propose a novel form of supervision based on the
teacher's decisions. Through rigorous experimentation, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach on 3 popular classification benchmarks. Code is

large language model (LLM)-based agents such as GPT-4. However, many commercial
conversational agent development tools are pipeline-based and have limitations
in holding a human-like conversation. This paper investigates the capabilities
of LLMs to enhance pipeline-based conversational agents during two phases: 1)
in the design and development phase and 2) during operations. In 1) LLMs can
aid in generating training data, extracting entities and synonyms,
localization, and persona design. In 2) LLMs can assist in contextualization,
intent classification to prevent conversational breakdown and handle
out-of-scope questions, auto-correcting utterances, rephrasing responses,
formulating disambiguation questions, summarization, and enabling closed
question-answering capabilities. We conducted informal experiments with GPT-4
in the private banking domain to demonstrate the scenarios above with a
practical example. Companies may be hesitant to replace their pipeline-based
agents with LLMs entirely due to privacy concerns and the need for deep
integration within their existing ecosystems. A hybrid approach in which LLMs'
are integrated into the pipeline-based agents allows them to save time and
costs of building and running agents by capitalizing on the capabilities of
LLMs while retaining the integration and privacy safeguards of their existing

making long-term fairness a crucial consideration. It has been shown that when
ignoring the long-term effect, naively imposing fairness criterion in static
settings can actually exacerbate bias over time. To explicitly address biases
in sequential decision-making, recent works formulate long-term fairness
notions in Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework. They define the long-term
bias to be the sum of static bias over each time step. However, we demonstrate
that naively summing up the step-wise bias can cause a false sense of fairness
since it fails to consider the importance difference of different time steps
during transition. In this work, we introduce a long-term fairness notion
called Equal Long-term Benefit Rate (ELBERT), which explicitly considers
varying temporal importance and adapts static fairness principles to the
sequential setting. Moreover, we show that the policy gradient of Long-term
Benefit Rate can be analytically reduced to standard policy gradient. This
makes standard policy optimization methods applicable for reducing the bias,
leading to our proposed bias mitigation method ELBERT-PO. Experiments on three
sequential decision making environments show that ELBERT-PO significantly
reduces bias and maintains high utility. Code is available at

the principle that good models should exclude parameters beyond those minimally
required to describe the systems they represent. This is because redundancy can
lead to incorrect estimates of model parameters from data, and thus inaccurate
or ambiguous conclusions. Here, we show how deep learning can be powerfully
leveraged to address Occam's razor. FixFit, our new method, uses a feedforward
deep neural network with a bottleneck layer to characterize and predict the
behavior of a given model from its input parameters. FixFit has three major
benefits. First, it provides a metric to quantify the original model's degree
of complexity. Second, it allows for the unique fitting of data. Third, it
provides an unbiased way to discriminate between experimental hypotheses that
add value versus those that do not. In two use cases, we demonstrate the broad
applicability of this method across scientific domains. To validate the method
using a known system, we apply FixFit to recover known composite parameters for
the Kepler orbit model. To illustrate how the method can be applied to less
well-established fields, we use it to identify parameters for a multi-scale

DNNs.

In order to achieve safety of AD systems with DNN-based perception components
in a systematic and comprehensive approach, so-called safety concerns have been
introduced as a suitable structuring element. On the one hand, the concept of
safety concerns is -- by design -- well aligned to existing standards relevant
for safety of AD systems such as ISO 21448 (SOTIF). On the other hand, it has
already inspired several academic publications and upcoming standards on AI
safety such as ISO PAS 8800.

While the concept of safety concerns has been previously introduced, this

safety experts in the field. In particular, this paper introduces an additional
categorization for a better understanding as well as enabling cross-functional

series, are gaining traction for their expansive influence. While there is keen
interest in their applicability within medical domains such as psychology,
tangible explorations on real-world data remain scant. Concurrently, users on
social media platforms are increasingly vocalizing personal sentiments; under
specific thematic umbrellas, these sentiments often manifest as negative
emotions, sometimes escalating to suicidal inclinations. Timely discernment of
such cognitive distortions and suicidal risks is crucial to effectively
intervene and potentially avert dire circumstances. Our study ventured into
this realm by experimenting on two pivotal tasks: suicidal risk and cognitive
distortion identification on Chinese social media platforms. Using supervised
learning as a baseline, we examined and contrasted the efficacy of large
language models via three distinct strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, and
fine-tuning. Our findings revealed a discernible performance gap between the
large language models and traditional supervised learning approaches, primarily
attributed to the models' inability to fully grasp subtle categories. Notably,
while GPT-4 outperforms its counterparts in multiple scenarios, GPT-3.5 shows
significant enhancement in suicide risk classification after fine-tuning. To
our knowledge, this investigation stands as the maiden attempt at gauging large
language models on Chinese social media tasks. This study underscores the
forward-looking and transformative implications of using large language models
in the field of psychology. It lays the groundwork for future applications in

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Accurate segmentation of punctate white matter lesions (PWMLs) are
fundamental for the timely diagnosis and treatment of related developmental
disorders. Automated PWMLs segmentation from infant brain MR images is
challenging, considering that the lesions are typically small and low-contrast,
and the number of lesions may dramatically change across subjects. Existing
learning-based methods directly apply general network architectures to this
challenging task, which may fail to capture detailed positional information of
PWMLs, potentially leading to severe under-segmentations. In this paper, we
propose to leverage the idea of counterfactual reasoning coupled with the
auxiliary task of brain tissue segmentation to learn fine-grained positional
and morphological representations of PWMLs for accurate localization and
segmentation. A simple and easy-to-implement deep-learning framework (i.e.,
DeepPWML) is accordingly designed. It combines the lesion counterfactual map
with the tissue probability map to train a lightweight PWML segmentation
network, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a real-clinical dataset
of infant T1w MR images. The code is available at

diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. An important metric of cardiac function is
the left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), where lower EF is associated with
cardiomyopathy. Echocardiography is a popular diagnostic tool in cardiology,
with ultrasound being a low-cost, real-time, and non-ionizing technology.
However, human assessment of echocardiograms for calculating EF is
time-consuming and expertise-demanding, raising the need for an automated
approach. In this work, we propose using the M(otion)-mode of echocardiograms
for estimating the EF and classifying cardiomyopathy. We generate multiple
artificial M-mode images from a single echocardiogram and combine them using
off-the-shelf model architectures. Additionally, we extend contrastive learning
(CL) to cardiac imaging to learn meaningful representations from exploiting
structures in unlabeled data allowing the model to achieve high accuracy, even
with limited annotations. Our experiments show that the supervised setting
converges with only ten modes and is comparable to the baseline method while
bypassing its cumbersome training process and being computationally much more
efficient. Furthermore, CL using M-mode images is helpful for limited data
scenarios, such as having labels for only 200 patients, which is common in
medical applications.]]></summary>

significant challenge for both model-based control systems and imitation
learning algorithms. The complexity arises from the need for multi-fingered
robotic hands to dynamically establish and break contacts, balance
non-prehensile forces, and control large degrees of freedom. Reinforcement
learning (RL) offers a promising approach due to its general applicability and
capacity to autonomously acquire optimal manipulation strategies. However, its
real-world application is often hindered by the necessity to generate a large
number of samples, reset the environment, and obtain reward signals. In this
work, we introduce an efficient system for learning dexterous manipulation
skills with RL to alleviate these challenges. The main idea of our approach is
the integration of recent advances in sample-efficient RL and replay buffer
bootstrapping. This combination allows us to utilize data from different tasks
or objects as a starting point for training new tasks, significantly improving
learning efficiency. Additionally, our system completes the real-world training
cycle by incorporating learned resets via an imitation-based pickup policy as
well as learned reward functions, eliminating the need for manual resets and
reward engineering. We demonstrate the benefits of reusing past data as replay
buffer initialization for new tasks, for instance, the fast acquisition of
intricate manipulation skills in the real world on a four-fingered robotic
hand. (Videos: https://sites.google.com/view/reboot-dexterous)]]></summary>

for improving the interpretability and trustworthiness of machine learning
models. While saliency maps have stolen the show for the last few years in the
XAI field, their ability to reflect models' internal processes has been
questioned. Although less in the spotlight, example-based XAI methods have
continued to improve. It encompasses methods that use examples as explanations
for a machine learning model's predictions. This aligns with the psychological
mechanisms of human reasoning and makes example-based explanations natural and
intuitive for users to understand. Indeed, humans learn and reason by forming
mental representations of concepts based on examples.

This paper provides an overview of the state-of-the-art in natural
example-based XAI, describing the pros and cons of each approach. A "natural"
example simply means that it is directly drawn from the training data without
involving any generative process. The exclusion of methods that require
generating examples is justified by the need for plausibility which is in some
regards required to gain a user's trust. Consequently, this paper will explore
the following family of methods: similar examples, counterfactual and
semi-factual, influential instances, prototypes, and concepts. In particular,
it will compare their semantic definition, their cognitive impact, and added
values. We hope it will encourage and facilitate future work on natural
example-based XAI.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adversarial examples, inputs designed to induce worst-case behavior in
machine learning models, have been extensively studied over the past decade.
Yet, our understanding of this phenomenon stems from a rather fragmented pool
of knowledge; at present, there are a handful of attacks, each with disparate
assumptions in threat models and incomparable definitions of optimality. In
this paper, we propose a systematic approach to characterize worst-case (i.e.,
optimal) adversaries. We first introduce an extensible decomposition of attacks
in adversarial machine learning by atomizing attack components into surfaces
and travelers. With our decomposition, we enumerate over components to create
576 attacks (568 of which were previously unexplored). Next, we propose the
Pareto Ensemble Attack (PEA): a theoretical attack that upper-bounds attack
performance. With our new attacks, we measure performance relative to the PEA
on: both robust and non-robust models, seven datasets, and three extended
lp-based threat models incorporating compute costs, formalizing the Space of
Adversarial Strategies. From our evaluation we find that attack performance to
be highly contextual: the domain, model robustness, and threat model can have a
profound influence on attack efficacy. Our investigation suggests that future
studies measuring the security of machine learning should: (1) be
contextualized to the domain & threat models, and (2) go beyond the handful of
known attacks used today.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Accurate acquisition of crowd flow at Points of Interest (POIs) is pivotal
for effective traffic management, public service, and urban planning. Despite
this importance, due to the limitations of urban sensing techniques, the data
quality from most sources is inadequate for monitoring crowd flow at each POI.
This renders the inference of accurate crowd flow from low-quality data a
critical and challenging task. The complexity is heightened by three key
factors: 1) \emph{The scarcity and rarity of labeled data}, 2) \emph{The
intricate spatio-temporal dependencies among POIs}, and 3) \emph{The myriad
correlations between precise crowd flow and GPS reports}.

To address these challenges, we recast the crowd flow inference problem as a
self-supervised attributed graph representation learning task and introduce a
novel \underline{C}ontrastive \underline{S}elf-learning framework for
\underline{S}patio-\underline{T}emporal data (\model). Our approach initiates
with the construction of a spatial adjacency graph founded on the POIs and
their respective distances. We then employ a contrastive learning technique to
exploit large volumes of unlabeled spatio-temporal data. We adopt a swapped
prediction approach to anticipate the representation of the target subgraph
from similar instances. Following the pre-training phase, the model is
fine-tuned with accurate crowd flow data. Our experiments, conducted on two
real-world datasets, demonstrate that the \model pre-trained on extensive noisy
data consistently outperforms models trained from scratch.]]></summary>

modern approximation. These approaches are able to produce accurate
approximations to nonsmooth and non-Lipschitz functions, including multivariate
domain functions. In this paper we compare the efficiency of function
approximation using rational approximation, neural network and their
combinations. It was found that rational approximation is superior to neural
network based approaches with the same number of decision variables. Our
numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of rational approximation,
even when the number of approximation parameters (that is, the dimension of the
corresponding optimisation problems) is small. Another important contribution
of this paper lies in the improvement of rational approximation algorithms.
Namely, the optimisation based algorithms for rational approximation can be
adjusted to in such a way that the conditioning number of the constraint
matrices are controlled. This simple adjustment enables us to work with high
dimension optimisation problems and improve the design of the neural network.
The main strength of neural networks is in their ability to handle models with
a large number of variables: complex models are decomposed in several simple
optimisation problems. Therefore the the large number of decision variables is
in the nature of neural networks.]]></summary>

essential for traffic prediction. While recent works have shown improved
prediction performance by using neural networks to extract spatiotemporal
correlations, their effectiveness depends on the quality of the graph
structures used to represent the spatial topology of the traffic network. In
this work, we propose a novel approach for traffic prediction that embeds
time-varying dynamic Bayesian network to capture the fine spatiotemporal
topology of traffic data. We then use graph convolutional networks to generate
traffic forecasts. To enable our method to efficiently model nonlinear traffic
propagation patterns, we develop a deep learning-based module as a
hyper-network to generate stepwise dynamic causal graphs. Our experimental
results on a real traffic dataset demonstrate the superior prediction
performance of the proposed method. The code is available at

acoustic space to the articulatory space. Signal-processing features like the
MFCCs, have been widely used for the AAI task. For subjects with dysarthric
speech, AAI is challenging because of an imprecise and indistinct
pronunciation. In this work, we perform AAI for dysarthric speech using
representations from pre-trained self-supervised learning (SSL) models. We
demonstrate the impact of different pre-trained features on this challenging
AAI task, at low-resource conditions. In addition, we also condition x-vectors
to the extracted SSL features to train a BLSTM network. In the seen case, we
experiment with three AAI training schemes (subject-specific, pooled, and
fine-tuned). The results, consistent across training schemes, reveal that
DeCoAR, in the fine-tuned scheme, achieves a relative improvement of the
Pearson Correlation Coefficient (CC) by ${\sim}$1.81\% and ${\sim}$4.56\% for
healthy controls and patients, respectively, over MFCCs. In the unseen case, we
observe similar average trends for different SSL features. Overall, SSL
networks like wav2vec, APC, and DeCoAR, which are trained with feature
reconstruction or future timestep prediction tasks, perform well in predicting
dysarthric articulatory trajectories.]]></summary>

arising in applications where data is recorded over time and over multiple
channels. For example, a smartwatch can record the acceleration and orientation
of a person's motion, and these signals are recorded as multivariate time
series. We can classify this data to understand and predict human movement and
various properties such as fitness levels. In many applications classification
alone is not enough, we often need to classify but also understand what the
model learns (e.g., why was a prediction given, based on what information in
the data). The main focus of this paper is on analysing and evaluating
explanation methods tailored to Multivariate Time Series Classification (MTSC).
We focus on saliency-based explanation methods that can point out the most
relevant channels and time series points for the classification decision. We
analyse two popular and accurate multivariate time series classifiers, ROCKET
and dResNet, as well as two popular explanation methods, SHAP and dCAM. We
study these methods on 3 synthetic datasets and 2 real-world datasets and
provide a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the explanations provided.
We find that flattening the multivariate datasets by concatenating the channels
works as well as using multivariate classifiers directly and adaptations of
SHAP for MTSC work quite well. Additionally, we also find that the popular
synthetic datasets we used are not suitable for time series analysis.]]></summary>

cheaper approach that adds noise not until the data become pure random noise,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While recommender systems have significantly benefited from implicit
feedback, they have often missed the nuances of multi-behavior interactions
between users and items. Historically, these systems either amalgamated all
behaviors, such as \textit{impression} (formerly \textit{view}),
\textit{add-to-cart}, and \textit{buy}, under a singular 'interaction' label,
or prioritized only the target behavior, often the \textit{buy} action,
discarding valuable auxiliary signals. Although recent advancements tried
addressing this simplification, they primarily gravitated towards optimizing
the target behavior alone, battling with data scarcity. Additionally, they
tended to bypass the nuanced hierarchy intrinsic to behaviors. To bridge these
gaps, we introduce the \textbf{H}ierarchical \textbf{M}ulti-behavior
\textbf{G}raph Attention \textbf{N}etwork (HMGN). This pioneering framework
leverages attention mechanisms to discern information from both inter and
intra-behaviors while employing a multi-task Hierarchical Bayesian Personalized
Ranking (HBPR) for optimization. Recognizing the need for scalability, our
approach integrates a specialized multi-behavior sub-graph sampling technique.
Moreover, the adaptability of HMGN allows for the seamless inclusion of
knowledge metadata and time-series data. Empirical results attest to our
model's prowess, registering a notable performance boost of up to 64\% in
NDCG@100 metrics over conventional graph neural network methods.]]></summary>

However, learning the value function via bootstrapping often leads to unstable
training due to fast-changing target values. Target Networks are employed to
stabilize training by using an additional set of lagging parameters to estimate
the target values. Despite the popularity of Target Networks, their effect on
the optimization is still misunderstood. In this work, we show that they act as
an implicit regularizer which can be beneficial in some cases, but also have
disadvantages such as being inflexible and can result in instabilities, even
when vanilla TD(0) converges. To overcome these issues, we propose an explicit
Functional Regularization alternative that is flexible and a convex regularizer
in function space and we theoretically study its convergence. We conduct an
experimental study across a range of environments, discount factors, and
off-policiness data collections to investigate the effectiveness of the
regularization induced by Target Networks and Functional Regularization in
terms of performance, accuracy, and stability. Our findings emphasize that
Functional Regularization can be used as a drop-in replacement for Target
Networks and result in performance improvement. Furthermore, adjusting both the
regularization weight and the network update period in Functional
Regularization can result in further performance improvements compared to
solely adjusting the network update period as typically done with Target
Networks. Our approach also enhances the ability to networks to recover

value. Those risk values can be robustly estimated via using the remarkable

events over time. We ask a relatively basic question: how might we compare
these forecasters, either online or post-hoc, while avoiding unverifiable
assumptions on how the forecasts and outcomes were generated? In this paper, we
present a rigorous answer to this question by designing novel sequential
inference procedures for estimating the time-varying difference in forecast
scores. To do this, we employ confidence sequences (CS), which are sequences of
confidence intervals that can be continuously monitored and are valid at
arbitrary data-dependent stopping times ("anytime-valid"). The widths of our
CSs are adaptive to the underlying variance of the score differences.
Underlying their construction is a game-theoretic statistical framework, in
which we further identify e-processes and p-processes for sequentially testing
a weak null hypothesis -- whether one forecaster outperforms another on average
(rather than always). Our methods do not make distributional assumptions on the
forecasts or outcomes; our main theorems apply to any bounded scores, and we
later provide alternative methods for unbounded scores. We empirically validate
our approaches by comparing real-world baseball and weather forecasters.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Explicit antisymmetrization of a neural network is a potential candidate for
a universal function approximator for generic antisymmetric functions, which
are ubiquitous in quantum physics. However, this procedure is a priori
factorially costly to implement, making it impractical for large numbers of
particles. The strategy also suffers from a sign problem. Namely, due to
near-exact cancellation of positive and negative contributions, the magnitude
of the antisymmetrized function may be significantly smaller than before
anti-symmetrization. We show that the anti-symmetric projection of a two-layer
neural network can be evaluated efficiently, opening the door to using a
generic antisymmetric layer as a building block in anti-symmetric neural
network Ansatzes. This approximation is effective when the sign problem is
controlled, and we show that this property depends crucially the choice of
activation function under standard Xavier/He initialization methods. As a
consequence, using a smooth activation function requires re-scaling of the
neural network weights compared to standard initializations.]]></summary>

security, especially in recent rampant research in security breach such as
adversarial/membership attacks. To this end, \textit{unlearnable examples}
(UEs) have been recently proposed as a compelling protection, by adding
imperceptible perturbation to data so that models trained on them cannot
classify them accurately on original clean distribution. Unfortunately, we find
UEs provide a false sense of security, because they cannot stop unauthorized
users from utilizing other unprotected data to remove the protection, by
turning unlearnable data into learnable again. Motivated by this observation,
we formally define a new threat by introducing \textit{learnable unauthorized
examples} (LEs) which are UEs with their protection removed. The core of this
approach is a novel purification process that projects UEs onto the manifold of
LEs. This is realized by a new joint-conditional diffusion model which denoises
UEs conditioned on the pixel and perceptual similarity between UEs and LEs.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LE delivers state-of-the-art countering
performance against both supervised UEs and unsupervised UEs in various
scenarios, which is the first generalizable countermeasure to UEs across
supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Our code is available at

deep learning model architectures have underscored the need for more efficient
data representation and analysis techniques. This paper is motivated by the
work of Helal (2023) and aims to present a comprehensive overview of
tensorization. This transformative approach bridges the gap between the
inherently multidimensional nature of data and the simplified 2-dimensional
matrices commonly used in linear algebra-based machine learning algorithms.
This paper explores the steps involved in tensorization, multidimensional data
sources, various multiway analysis methods employed, and the benefits of these
approaches. A small example of Blind Source Separation (BSS) is presented
comparing 2-dimensional algorithms and a multiway algorithm in Python. Results
indicate that multiway analysis is more expressive. Contrary to the intuition
of the dimensionality curse, utilising multidimensional datasets in their
native form and applying multiway analysis methods grounded in multilinear
algebra reveal a profound capacity to capture intricate interrelationships
among various dimensions while, surprisingly, reducing the number of model
parameters and accelerating processing. A survey of the multi-away analysis
methods and integration with various Deep Neural Networks models is presented
using case studies in different domains.]]></summary>

learning and physics simulations to train a policy that controls the global and

present a learning curriculum with increasing difficulty. It starts with

training including both hands and non-stationary objects. To evaluate our
method, we introduce Dynamic Object Grasping and Articulation, a task that
involves bringing an object into a target articulated pose. This task requires

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Performance metrics for medical image segmentation models are used to measure
the agreement between the reference annotation and the predicted segmentation.
Usually, overlap metrics, such as the Dice, are used as a metric to evaluate
the performance of these models in order for results to be comparable. However,
there is a mismatch between the distributions of cases and difficulty level of
segmentation tasks in public data sets compared to clinical practice. Common
metrics fail to measure the impact of this mismatch, especially for clinical
data sets that include low signal pathologies, a difficult segmentation task,
and uncertain, small, or empty reference annotations. This limitation may
result in ineffective research of machine learning practitioners in designing
and optimizing models. Dimensions of evaluating clinical value include
consideration of the uncertainty of reference annotations, independence from
reference annotation volume size, and evaluation of classification of empty
reference annotations. We study how uncertain, small, and empty reference
annotations influence the value of metrics for medical image segmentation on an
in-house data set regardless of the model. We examine metrics behavior on the
predictions of a standard deep learning framework in order to identify metrics
with clinical value. We compare to a public benchmark data set (BraTS 2019)
with a high-signal pathology and certain, larger, and no empty reference
annotations. We may show machine learning practitioners, how uncertain, small,
or empty reference annotations require a rethinking of the evaluation and
optimizing procedures. The evaluation code was released to encourage further
analysis of this topic.

imitating expert demonstrations, allowing users to communicate their
instructions in an intuitive manner. Recent progress in LfD often relies on
kinesthetic teaching or teleoperation as the medium for users to specify the
demonstrations. Kinesthetic teaching requires physical handling of the robot,
while teleoperation demands proficiency with additional hardware. This paper
introduces an alternative paradigm for LfD called Diagrammatic Teaching.
Diagrammatic Teaching aims to teach robots novel skills by prompting the user
to sketch out demonstration trajectories on 2D images of the scene, these are
then synthesised as a generative model of motion trajectories in 3D task space.
Additionally, we present the Ray-tracing Probabilistic Trajectory Learning
(RPTL) framework for Diagrammatic Teaching. RPTL extracts time-varying
probability densities from the 2D sketches, applies ray-tracing to find
corresponding regions in 3D Cartesian space, and fits a probabilistic model of
motion trajectories to these regions. New motion trajectories, which mimic
those sketched by the user, can then be generated from the probabilistic model.
We empirically validate our framework both in simulation and on real robots,
which include a fixed-base manipulator and a quadruped-mounted manipulator.]]></summary>

(ITS), the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) plays a vital role in alleviating traffic
issues. Object detection is one of the key technologies in the IoV, which has
been widely used to provide traffic management services by analyzing timely and
sensitive vehicle-related information. However, the current object detection
methods are mostly based on centralized deep training, that is, the sensitive
data obtained by edge devices need to be uploaded to the server, which raises
privacy concerns. To mitigate such privacy leakage, we first propose a
federated learning-based framework, where well-trained local models are shared
in the central server. However, since edge devices usually have limited
computing power, plus a strict requirement of low latency in IoVs, we further
propose a sparse training process on edge devices, which can effectively
lighten the model, and ensure its training efficiency on edge devices, thereby
reducing communication overheads. In addition, due to the diverse computing
capabilities and dynamic environment, different sparsity rates are applied to
edge devices. To further guarantee the performance, we propose, FedWeg, an
improved aggregation scheme based on FedAvg, which is designed by the inverse
ratio of sparsity rates. Experiments on the real-life dataset using YOLO show
that the proposed scheme can achieve the required object detection rate while

remarkable ability to generate fitting responses to natural language

an LLM is dominantly written by persons with a specific political bias, we
might expect generated answers to share this bias. Current research work seeks
to de-bias such models, or suppress potentially biased answers. With this
demonstration, we take a different view on biases in instruction-tuning: Rather
than aiming to suppress them, we aim to make them explicit and transparent. To
this end, we present OpinionGPT, a web demo in which users can ask questions
and select all biases they wish to investigate. The demo will answer this
question using a model fine-tuned on text representing each of the selected
biases, allowing side-by-side comparison. To train the underlying model, we
identified 11 different biases (political, geographic, gender, age) and derived
an instruction-tuning corpus in which each answer was written by members of one
of these demographics. This paper presents OpinionGPT, illustrates how we

respond to multi-modality conditions, including audio, 3D point clouds, video,
and their embedding-space arithmetic by only image-text alignment training.
During training, we adopt a learnable bind network to align the embedding space
between LLaMA and ImageBind's image encoder. Then, the image features
transformed by the bind network are added to word tokens of all layers in
LLaMA, which progressively injects visual instructions via an attention-free
and zero-initialized gating mechanism. Aided by the joint embedding of
ImageBind, the simple image-text training enables our model to exhibit superior
multi-modality instruction-following capabilities. During inference, the
multi-modality inputs are fed into the corresponding ImageBind encoders, and
processed by a proposed visual cache model for further cross-modal embedding
enhancement. The training-free cache model retrieves from three million image
features extracted by ImageBind, which effectively mitigates the
training-inference modality discrepancy. Notably, with our approach,
ImageBind-LLM can respond to instructions of diverse modalities and demonstrate

constrained closed-loop control systems, where both the objective and the
constraints are unknown black-box functions affected by exogenous time-varying
contextual disturbances. A primal-dual contextual Bayesian optimization
algorithm is proposed that achieves sublinear cumulative regret with respect to
the dynamic optimal solution under certain regularity conditions. Furthermore,
the algorithm achieves zero time-average constraint violation, ensuring that
the average value of the constraint function satisfies the desired constraint.
The method is applied to both sampled instances from Gaussian processes and a
continuous stirred tank reactor parameter tuning problem; simulation results
show that the method simultaneously provides close-to-optimal performance and
maintains constraint feasibility on average. This contrasts current
state-of-the-art methods, which either suffer from large cumulative regret or
severe constraint violations for the case studies presented.]]></summary>

action spaces in Markov decision processes (MDPs) (also called controlled
Markov chains) and various efforts have been made in the literature towards the
applicability of such algorithms for continuous state and action spaces. In
this paper, we show that under very mild regularity conditions (in particular,
involving only weak continuity of the transition kernel of an MDP), Q-learning
for standard Borel MDPs via quantization of states and actions (called
Quantized Q-Learning) converges to a limit, and furthermore this limit
satisfies an optimality equation which leads to near optimality with either
explicit performance bounds or which are guaranteed to be asymptotically
optimal. Our approach builds on (i) viewing quantization as a measurement
kernel and thus a quantized MDP as a partially observed Markov decision process
(POMDP), (ii) utilizing near optimality and convergence results of Q-learning
for POMDPs, and (iii) finally, near-optimality of finite state model
approximations for MDPs with weakly continuous kernels which we show to
correspond to the fixed point of the constructed POMDP. Thus, our paper
presents a very general convergence and approximation result for the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is important to leverage the full potential
of machine learning (ML). In practice, users are often interested in
multi-objective (MO) problems, i.e., optimizing potentially conflicting
objectives, like accuracy and energy consumption. To tackle this, the vast
majority of MO-ML algorithms return a Pareto front of non-dominated machine
learning models to the user. Optimizing the hyperparameters of such algorithms
is non-trivial as evaluating a hyperparameter configuration entails evaluating
the quality of the resulting Pareto front. In literature, there are known
indicators that assess the quality of a Pareto front (e.g., hypervolume, R2) by
quantifying different properties (e.g., volume, proximity to a reference
point). However, choosing the indicator that leads to the desired Pareto front
might be a hard task for a user. In this paper, we propose a human-centered
interactive HPO approach tailored towards multi-objective ML leveraging
preference learning to extract desiderata from users that guide the
optimization. Instead of relying on the user guessing the most suitable
indicator for their needs, our approach automatically learns an appropriate
indicator. Concretely, we leverage pairwise comparisons of distinct Pareto
fronts to learn such an appropriate quality indicator. Then, we optimize the
hyperparameters of the underlying MO-ML algorithm towards this learned
indicator using a state-of-the-art HPO approach. In an experimental study
targeting the environmental impact of ML, we demonstrate that our approach
leads to substantially better Pareto fronts compared to optimizing based on a
wrong indicator pre-selected by the user, and performs comparable in the case
of an advanced user knowing which indicator to pick.]]></summary>

maximum changes in the output concerning the input, taking into account
associated irrelevant biased factors. It is an efficient and provable method
for examining the output stability of machine learning models without incurring
additional computation costs. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which
operate on non-Euclidean data, have gained significant attention. However, no
previous research has investigated the GNN Lipschitz bounds to shed light on
stabilizing model outputs, especially when working on non-Euclidean data with
inherent biases. Given the inherent biases in common graph data used for GNN
training, it poses a serious challenge to constraining the GNN output
perturbations induced by input biases, thereby safeguarding fairness during
training. Recently, despite the Lipschitz constant's use in controlling the
stability of Euclideanneural networks, the calculation of the precise Lipschitz
constant remains elusive for non-Euclidean neural networks like GNNs,
especially within fairness contexts. To narrow this gap, we begin with the
general GNNs operating on an attributed graph, and formulate a Lipschitz bound
to limit the changes in the output regarding biases associated with the input.
Additionally, we theoretically analyze how the Lipschitz constant of a GNN
model could constrain the output perturbations induced by biases learned from
data for fairness training. We experimentally validate the Lipschitz bound's
effectiveness in limiting biases of the model output. Finally, from a training
dynamics perspective, we demonstrate why the theoretical Lipschitz bound can
effectively guide the GNN training to better trade-off between accuracy and
fairness.]]></summary>

classification problems where there is an abundance of unlabeled data along
with a small number of positive data instances, which can be used to address

resulted in the development of various risk estimators, yet they neglect the
differences among distinct populations. To address this issue, we present a
novel Positive-Unlabeled Learning Tree (PUtree) algorithm. PUtree is designed
to take into account communities such as different age or income brackets, in
tasks of chronic disease prediction. We propose a novel approach for binary
decision-making, which hierarchically builds community-based PU models and then
aggregates their deliverables. Our method can explicate each PU model on the
tree for the optimized non-leaf PU node splitting. Furthermore, a mask-recovery
data augmentation strategy enables sufficient training of the model in
individual communities. Additionally, the proposed approach includes an
adversarial PU risk estimator to capture hierarchical PU-relationships, and a
model fusion network that integrates data from each tree path, resulting in
robust binary classification results. We demonstrate the superior performance
of PUtree as well as its variants on two benchmarks and a new

crucial in planning its supply and consumption and optimizing the cost of
obtaining it, mainly by industrial entities. However, in times of threats to
its supply, it is also a critical element that guarantees the supply of this
raw material to meet individual consumers' needs, ensuring society's energy
security. This article introduces a novel multistep ahead forecasting of
natural gas consumption with change point detection integration for model
collection selection with continual learning capabilities using data stream
processing. The performance of the forecasting models based on the proposed
approach is evaluated in a complex real-world use case of natural gas
consumption forecasting. We employed Hoeffding tree predictors as forecasting
models and the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) algorithm for the change point
detection procedure. The change point detection integration enables selecting a
different model collection for successive time frames. Thus, three model
collection selection procedures (with and without an error feedback loop) are
defined and evaluated for forecasting scenarios with various densities of
detected change points. These models were compared with change point agnostic
baseline approaches. Our experiments show that fewer change points result in a
lower forecasting error regardless of the model collection selection procedure
employed. Also, simpler model collection selection procedures omitting
forecasting error feedback leads to more robust forecasting models suitable for

the two test neuroradiologists the model-expert agreement was non-inferior to

underwater acoustic data by leveraging a model trained on a broad spectrum of
non-underwater (aerial) sounds. Recognizing the challenge in labeling vast
amounts of underwater data, we propose a two-fold methodology to accelerate
this labor-intensive procedure.

The first part of our approach involves PCA and UMAP visualization of the
underwater data using the feature vectors of an aerial sound recognition model.
This enables us to cluster the data in a two dimensional space and listen to
points within these clusters to understand their defining characteristics. This
innovative method simplifies the process of selecting candidate labels for
further training.

In the second part, we train a neural network model using both the selected
underwater data and the non-underwater dataset. We conducted a quantitative
analysis to measure the precision, recall, and F1 score of our model for
recognizing airgun sounds, a common type of underwater sound. The F1 score
achieved by our model exceeded 84.3%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach in analyzing underwater acoustic data.

The methodology presented in this paper holds significant potential to reduce
the amount of labor required in underwater data analysis and opens up new
possibilities for further research in the field of cross-domain data analysis.]]></summary>

High-Energy Physics experiments. Tracking is exceptionally computationally
challenging and fielded solutions, relying on traditional algorithms, do not

representing it, will facilitate the solution exploration workflow. We provide
the REDuced VIrtual Detector (REDVID) as a complexity-reduced detector model

simulation-in-the-loop, to both generate synthetic data efficiently and to
simplify the challenge of ML model design. The fully parametric nature of our
tool, with regards to system-level configuration, while in contrast to
physics-accurate simulations, allows for the generation of simplified data for
research and education, at different levels. Resulting from the reduced
complexity, we showcase the computational efficiency of REDVID by providing the
computational cost figures for a multitude of simulation benchmarks. As a

highly flexible, reusable and open-source. Reference data sets generated with

the ranking matches the observations? This problem, known as rank aggregation,
has found many applications in sports, recommendation systems, and other web
applications. As it is generally NP-hard to find a global ranking that
minimizes the mismatch (known as the Kemeny optimization), we focus on the
Erd\"os-R\'enyi outliers (ERO) model for this ranking problem. Here, each
pairwise comparison is a corrupted copy of the true score difference. We
investigate spectral ranking algorithms that are based on unnormalized and
normalized data matrices. The key is to understand their performance in
recovering the underlying scores of each item from the observed data. This
reduces to deriving an entry-wise perturbation error bound between the top
eigenvectors of the unnormalized/normalized data matrix and its population
counterpart. By using the leave-one-out technique, we provide a sharper
$\ell_{\infty}$-norm perturbation bound of the eigenvectors and also derive an
error bound on the maximum displacement for each item, with only $\Omega(n\log
n)$ samples. Our theoretical analysis improves upon the state-of-the-art
results in terms of sample complexity, and our numerical experiments confirm

properties of data or context, in which the model operates, change over time
leading to a decrease in its performance. Therefore, maintaining a constant
monitoring process for machine learning model performance is crucial in order
to proactively prevent any potential performance regression. However,
supervised drift detection methods require human annotation and consequently
lead to a longer time to detect and mitigate the drift. In our proposed
unsupervised drift detection method, we follow a two step process. Our first
step involves encoding a sample of production data as the target distribution,
and the model training data as the reference distribution. In the second step,
we employ a kernel-based statistical test that utilizes the maximum mean
discrepancy (MMD) distance metric to compare the reference and target
distributions and estimate any potential drift. Our method also identifies the
subset of production data that is the root cause of the drift. The models
retrained using these identified high drift samples show improved performance
on online customer experience quality metrics.]]></summary>

are a type of IQ test that requires deriving an abstract "concept" from a set
of positive and negative "support" images, and then classifying whether or not
a new query image depicts the key concept. On Bongard-HOI, a benchmark for
natural-image Bongard problems, existing methods have only reached 66% accuracy
(where chance is 50%). Low accuracy is often attributed to neural nets' lack of
ability to find human-like symbolic rules. In this work, we point out that many
existing methods are forfeiting accuracy due to a much simpler problem: they do
not incorporate information contained in the support set as a whole, and rely
instead on information extracted from individual supports. This is a critical
issue, because unlike in few-shot learning tasks concerning object
classification, the "key concept" in a typical Bongard problem can only be
distinguished using multiple positives and multiple negatives. We explore a
variety of simple methods to take this cross-image context into account, and
demonstrate substantial gains over prior methods, leading to new
state-of-the-art performance on Bongard-LOGO (75.3%) and Bongard-HOI (72.45%)

a well-functioning personalized pricing policy in place is essential to
effective business making. Typically, such a policy must be derived from
observational data, which introduces several challenges. While the problem of
``endogeneity'' is prominently studied in the established pricing literature,
the problem of selection bias (or, more precisely, bid selection bias) is not.
We take a step towards understanding the effects of selection bias by posing
pricing as a problem of causal inference. Specifically, we consider the
reaction of a customer to price a treatment effect. In our experiments, we
simulate varying levels of selection bias on a semi-synthetic dataset on
mortgage loan applications in Belgium. We investigate the potential of
parametric and nonparametric methods for the identification of individual
bid-response functions. Our results illustrate how conventional methods such as
logistic regression and neural networks suffer adversely from selection bias.
In contrast, we implement state-of-the-art methods from causal machine learning

Adversarial Neural Operator (GANO) that combines recent advancements in machine
learning and open access strong motion data sets to generate three-component
acceleration time histories conditioned on moment magnitude ($M$), rupture
distance ($R_{rup}$), time-average shear-wave velocity at the top $30m$
($V_{S30}$), and tectonic environment or style of faulting. We use Neural
Operators, a resolution invariant architecture that guarantees that the model
training is independent of the data sampling frequency. We first present the
conditional ground-motion synthesis algorithm (referred to heretofore as
cGM-GANO) and discuss its advantages compared to previous work. Next, we verify
the cGM-GANO framework using simulated ground motions generated with the
Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) Broadband Platform (BBP). We
lastly train cGM-GANO on a KiK-net dataset from Japan, showing that the
framework can recover the magnitude, distance, and $V_{S30}$ scaling of Fourier
amplitude and pseudo-spectral accelerations. We evaluate cGM-GANO through
residual analysis with the empirical dataset as well as by comparison with
conventional Ground Motion Models (GMMs) for selected ground motion scenarios.
Results show that cGM-GANO produces consistent median scaling with the GMMs for
the corresponding tectonic environments. The largest misfit is observed at
short distances due to the scarcity of training data. With the exception of
short distances, the aleatory variability of the response spectral ordinates is
also well captured, especially for subduction events due to the adequacy of
training data. Applications of the presented framework include generation of
risk-targeted ground motions for site-specific engineering applications.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This study presents insights from interviews with nineteen Knowledge Graph
(KG) practitioners who work in both enterprise and academic settings on a wide
variety of use cases. Through this study, we identify critical challenges
experienced by KG practitioners when creating, exploring, and analyzing KGs
that could be alleviated through visualization design. Our findings reveal
three major personas among KG practitioners - KG Builders, Analysts, and
Consumers - each of whom have their own distinct expertise and needs. We
discover that KG Builders would benefit from schema enforcers, while KG
Analysts need customizable query builders that provide interim query results.
For KG Consumers, we identify a lack of efficacy for node-link diagrams, and
the need for tailored domain-specific visualizations to promote KG adoption and
comprehension. Lastly, we find that implementing KGs effectively in practice
requires both technical and social solutions that are not addressed with
current tools, technologies, and collaborative workflows. From the analysis of
our interviews, we distill several visualization research directions to improve
KG usability, including knowledge cards that balance digestibility and
discoverability, timeline views to track temporal changes, interfaces that
support organic discovery, and semantic explanations for AI and machine
learning predictions.]]></summary>

block-based computational neural network tailored for medical image
segmentation on IoT and edge platforms. Conventional U-Net-based models face
challenges in meeting the speed and efficiency demands of real-time clinical
applications, such as disease monitoring, radiation therapy, and image-guided
surgery. LDMRes-Net overcomes these limitations with its remarkably low number
of learnable parameters (0.072M), making it highly suitable for
resource-constrained devices. The model's key innovation lies in its dual
multi-residual block architecture, which enables the extraction of refined
features on multiple scales, enhancing overall segmentation performance. To
further optimize efficiency, the number of filters is carefully selected to
prevent overlap, reduce training time, and improve computational efficiency.
The study includes comprehensive evaluations, focusing on segmentation of the
retinal image of vessels and hard exudates crucial for the diagnosis and
treatment of ophthalmology. The results demonstrate the robustness,
generalizability, and high segmentation accuracy of LDMRes-Net, positioning it
as an efficient tool for accurate and rapid medical image segmentation in
diverse clinical applications, particularly on IoT and edge platforms. Such
advances hold significant promise for improving healthcare outcomes and
enabling real-time medical image analysis in resource-limited settings.]]></summary>

robots in the context of the RoboCup Standard Platform League, with a primary
focus on detecting the ball. The challenge lies in detecting a dynamic object
in varying lighting conditions and blurred images caused by fast movements. To
address this challenge, the paper presents a convolutional neural network
architecture designed specifically for computationally constrained robotic
platforms. The proposed CNN is trained to achieve high precision classification
of single objects in image patches and to determine their precise spatial
positions. The paper further integrates Early Exits into the existing
high-precision CNN architecture to reduce the computational cost of easily
rejectable cases in the background class. The training process involves a
composite loss function based on confidence and positional losses with dynamic
weighting and data augmentation. The proposed approach achieves a precision of
100% on the validation dataset and a recall of almost 87%, while maintaining an
execution time of around 170 $\mu$s per hypotheses. By combining the proposed
approach with an Early Exit, a runtime optimization of more than 28%, on
average, can be achieved compared to the original CNN. Overall, this paper
provides an efficient solution for an enhanced detection of objects, especially
the ball, in computationally constrained robotic platforms.]]></summary>

an unknown digital video with its source device, within a closed set of
possible devices. The existing techniques in source detection of digital videos
try to find a fingerprint of the actual source in the video in form of PRNU
(Photo Response Non--Uniformity), and match it against the SPN (Sensor Pattern
Noise) of each possible device. The highest correlation indicates the correct
source. We investigate the problem of identifying a video source through a
feature based approach using machine learning. In this paper, we present a
blind forensic technique of video source authentication and identification,
based on feature extraction, feature selection and subsequent source
classification. The main aim is to determine whether a claimed source for a
video is actually its original source. If not, we identify its original source.
Our experimental results prove the efficiency of the proposed method compared
to traditional fingerprint based technique.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Federated learning (FL) is designed to preserve data privacy during model
training, where the data remains on the client side (i.e., IoT devices), and
only model updates of clients are shared iteratively for collaborative
learning. However, this process is vulnerable to privacy attacks and Byzantine
attacks: the local model updates shared throughout the FL network will leak
private information about the local training data, and they can also be
maliciously crafted by Byzantine attackers to disturb the learning. In this
paper, we propose a new FL scheme that guarantees rigorous privacy and
simultaneously enhances system robustness against Byzantine attacks. Our
approach introduces sparsification- and momentum-driven variance reduction into
the client-level differential privacy (DP) mechanism, to defend against
Byzantine attackers. The security design does not violate the privacy guarantee
of the client-level DP mechanism; hence, our approach achieves the same
client-level DP guarantee as the state-of-the-art. We conduct extensive
experiments on both IID and non-IID datasets and different tasks and evaluate
the performance of our approach against different Byzantine attacks by
comparing it with state-of-the-art defense methods. The results of our
experiments show the efficacy of our framework and demonstrate its ability to
improve system robustness against Byzantine attacks while achieving a strong
privacy guarantee.]]></summary>

making that prediction, providing insights in the performance of the
algorithms, and suggestions to further improve them. Finally, we assess the

security in the modern world. Their ubiquity aids in monitoring suspicious
activities effectively. However, in densely populated environments, continuous
active monitoring becomes impractical, necessitating the development of
intelligent surveillance systems. AI integration in the surveillance domain was

attributed the composition of data augmentations as a crucial factor for their
strong representation learning capabilities. While regional dropout strategies
have proven to guide models to focus on lesser indicative parts of the objects
in supervised methods, it hasn't been adopted by self-supervised methods for
generating positive pairs. This is because the regional dropout methods are not
suitable for the input sampling process of the self-supervised methodology.
Whereas dropping informative pixels from the positive pairs can result in
inefficient training, replacing patches of a specific object with a different
one can steer the model from maximizing the agreement between different
positive pairs. Moreover, joint embedding representation learning methods have
not made robustness their primary training outcome. To this end, we propose the
ViewMix augmentation policy, specially designed for self-supervised learning,
upon generating different views of the same image, patches are cut and pasted
from one view to another. By leveraging the different views created by this
augmentation strategy, multiple joint embedding-based self-supervised
methodologies obtained better localization capability and consistently
outperformed their corresponding baseline methods. It is also demonstrated that
incorporating ViewMix augmentation policy promotes robustness of the
representations in the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our
experimentation and analysis of compute times suggest that ViewMix augmentation
doesn't introduce any additional overhead compared to other counterparts.]]></summary>

slow inference speed in semantic segmentation. In our research we identify 25
proposed distillation loss terms from 14 publications in the last 4 years.
Unfortunately, a comparison of terms based on published results is often
impossible, because of differences in training configurations. A good
illustration of this problem is the comparison of two publications from 2022.
Using the same models and dataset, Structural and Statistical Texture
Distillation (SSTKD) reports an increase of student mIoU of 4.54 and a final
performance of 29.19, while Adaptive Perspective Distillation (APD) only
improves student performance by 2.06 percentage points, but achieves a final
performance of 39.25. The reason for such extreme differences is often a
suboptimal choice of hyperparameters and a resulting underperformance of the
student model used as reference point. In our work, we reveal problems of
insufficient hyperparameter tuning by showing that distillation improvements of
two widely accepted frameworks, SKD and IFVD, vanish when hyperparameters are
optimized sufficiently. To improve comparability of future research in the
field, we establish a solid baseline for three datasets and two student models
and provide extensive information on hyperparameter tuning. We find that only
two out of eight techniques can compete with our simple baseline on the ADE20K
dataset.]]></summary>

multimodal approaches often assume unchanged modalities from training stage to
inference stage. In practice, however, many scenarios fail to satisfy such
assumptions with missing modalities during inference, leading to limitations on
where multimodal models can be applied. While existing methods mitigate the
problem through reconstructing the missing modalities, it increases unnecessary
computational cost, which could be just as critical, especially for large,
deployed systems. To solve the problem from both sides, we propose a novel
guidance network that promotes knowledge sharing during training, taking
advantage of the multimodal representations to train better single-modality
models for inference. Real-life experiment in violence detection shows that our
proposed framework trains single-modality models that significantly outperform
its traditionally trained counterparts while maintaining the same inference

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The analysis of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is an important step
in remote sensing applications, and it is a challenging problem due to its
inherent speckle noise. One typical solution is to model the data using the
$G_I^0$ distribution and extract its roughness information, which in turn can
be used in posterior imaging tasks, such as segmentation, classification and
interpretation. This leads to the need of quick and reliable estimation of the
roughness parameter from SAR data, especially with high resolution images.
Unfortunately, traditional parameter estimation procedures are slow and prone
to estimation failures. In this work, we proposed a neural network-based
estimation framework that first learns how to predict underlying parameters of
$G_I^0$ samples and then can be used to estimate the roughness of unseen data.
We show that this approach leads to an estimator that is quicker, yields less
estimation error and is less prone to failures than the traditional estimation
procedures for this problem, even when we use a simple network. More
importantly, we show that this same methodology can be generalized to handle
image inputs and, even if trained on purely synthetic data for a few seconds,
is able to perform real time pixel-wise roughness estimation for high
resolution real SAR imagery.]]></summary>

including data augmentation, anomaly detection, and privacy preservation.
Although significant strides have been made in this field, existing methods
exhibit three key limitations: (1) They often benchmark against similar model
types, constraining a holistic view of performance capabilities. (2) The use of
specialized synthetic and private datasets introduces biases and hampers
generalizability. (3) Ambiguous evaluation measures, often tied to custom
networks or downstream tasks, hinder consistent and fair comparison.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce \textsf{TSGBench}, the inaugural
TSG Benchmark, designed for a unified and comprehensive assessment of TSG
methods. It comprises three modules: (1) a curated collection of publicly
available, real-world datasets tailored for TSG, together with a standardized
preprocessing pipeline; (2) a comprehensive evaluation measures suite including
vanilla measures, new distance-based assessments, and visualization tools; (3)
a pioneering generalization test rooted in Domain Adaptation (DA), compatible
with all methods. We have conducted extensive experiments across ten real-world
datasets from diverse domains, utilizing ten advanced TSG methods and twelve
evaluation measures, all gauged through \textsf{TSGBench}. The results
highlight its remarkable efficacy and consistency. More importantly,
\textsf{TSGBench} delivers a statistical breakdown of method rankings,

several image analysis tasks in the computer-aided diagnosis scheme for
mammography. The training of an efficacious deep learning model requires large
data with diverse styles and qualities. The diversity of data often comes from
the use of various scanners of vendors. But, in practice, it is impractical to
collect a sufficient amount of diverse data for training. To this end, a novel
contrastive learning is developed to equip the deep learning models with better
style generalization capability. Specifically, the multi-style and multi-view
unsupervised self-learning scheme is carried out to seek robust feature
embedding against style diversity as a pretrained model. Afterward, the
pretrained network is further fine-tuned to the downstream tasks, e.g., mass
detection, matching, BI-RADS rating, and breast density classification. The
proposed method has been evaluated extensively and rigorously with mammograms
from various vendor style domains and several public datasets. The experimental
results suggest that the proposed domain generalization method can effectively
improve performance of four mammographic image tasks on the data from both seen
and unseen domains, and outperform many state-of-the-art (SOTA) generalization

adversarial robustness of deep learning models. These methods are based on a
new class of optimal-transport-regularized divergences, constructed via an
infimal convolution between an information divergence and an optimal-transport
(OT) cost. We use these as tools to enhance adversarial robustness by
maximizing the expected loss over a neighborhood of distributions, a technique
known as distributionally robust optimization. Viewed as a tool for
constructing adversarial samples, our method allows samples to be both
transported, according to the OT cost, and re-weighted, according to the
information divergence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on
malware detection and image recognition applications and find that, to our
knowledge, it outperforms existing methods at enhancing the robustness against
adversarial attacks. $ARMOR_D$ yields the robustified accuracy of $98.29\%$
against $FGSM$ and $98.18\%$ against $PGD^{40}$ on the MNIST dataset, reducing
the error rate by more than $19.7\%$ and $37.2\%$ respectively compared to
prior methods. Similarly, in malware detection, a discrete (binary) data

outcome, the "dose response", is relevant in a variety of domains, from
healthcare to business, economics, and beyond. Such effects, also known as
continuous-valued treatment effects, are typically estimated from observational
data, which may be subject to dose selection bias. This means that the
allocation of doses depends on pre-treatment covariates. Previous studies have
shown that conventional machine learning approaches fail to learn accurate
individual estimates of dose responses under the presence of dose selection
bias. In this work, we propose CBRNet, a causal machine learning approach to
estimate an individual dose response from observational data. CBRNet adopts the
Neyman-Rubin potential outcome framework and extends the concept of balanced
representation learning for overcoming selection bias to continuous-valued
treatments. Our work is the first to apply representation balancing in a
continuous-valued treatment setting. We evaluate our method on a newly proposed
benchmark. Our experiments demonstrate CBRNet's ability to accurately learn
treatment effects under selection bias and competitive performance with respect
to other state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

our model is theoretically motivated by the concept of implicit fairing in
geometry processing, and comprises a graph convolution module for aggregating

combining layer-wise neighborhood representations. This propagation rule is
derived from the iterative solution of the implicit fairing equation via the
Jacobi method. In addition to capturing information from distant graph nodes
through skip connections between the network's layers, our approach exploits
both the graph structure and node features for learning discriminative node
representations. These skip connections are integrated by design in our

through extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, achieving better or

only to restart the process over again once new data becomes available. A much
cheaper and more efficient solution would be to enable the continual
pre-training of these models, i.e. updating pre-trained models with new data
instead of re-training them from scratch. However, the distribution shift
induced by novel data typically results in degraded performance on past data.
Taking a step towards efficient continual pre-training, in this work, we
examine the effect of different warm-up strategies. Our hypothesis is that the
learning rate must be re-increased to improve compute efficiency when training
on a new dataset. We study the warmup phase of models pre-trained on the Pile
(upstream data, 300B tokens) as we continue to pre-train on SlimPajama
(downstream data, 297B tokens), following a linear warmup and cosine decay
schedule. We conduct all experiments on the Pythia 410M language model
architecture and evaluate performance through validation perplexity. We
experiment with different pre-training checkpoints, various maximum learning
rates, and various warmup lengths. Our results show that while rewarming models
first increases the loss on upstream and downstream data, in the longer run it
improves the downstream performance, outperforming models trained from

outperforms its peers in MCAR settings, especially when data is only missing
out-of-sample, while lacking behind in IM settings. A hybrid model, the
TrinaryMIA tree, which combines the Trinary tree and the Missing In Attributes

enabling access to high-dimensional Hilbert space. Our method employs a
multi-objective genetic algorithm that simultaneously maximizes classification
accuracy while minimizing both the local and non-local gate costs of the
quantum feature map's circuit. To achieve this, we define distinct fitness
functions for local gates and entanglement gates. Comparisons with classical
classifiers are given in order to understand the advantages of using quantum
machine learning. Surprisingly, our experiments reveal that the optimal
configuration of quantum circuits for the quantum kernel method incorporates a
proportional number of non-local gates for entanglement, contrary to previous
literature where non-local gates were largely suppressed.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that the separability indexes of data can be
effectively leveraged to determine the number of non-local gates required for
the quantum support vector machine's feature maps. This insight can
significantly aid in selecting appropriate parameters, such as the entanglement

applications, where graphs can represent various multimedia data types such as
images, videos, and social networks. Previous efforts have applied graph neural
networks (GNNs) in balanced situations where the class distribution is
balanced. However, real-world data typically exhibit long-tailed class
distributions, resulting in a bias towards the head classes when using GNNs and
limited generalization ability over the tail classes. Recent approaches mainly
focus on re-balancing different classes during model training, which fails to
explicitly introduce new knowledge and sacrifices the performance of the head
classes. To address these drawbacks, we propose a novel framework called
Retrieval Augmented Hybrid Network (RAHNet) to jointly learn a robust feature
extractor and an unbiased classifier in a decoupled manner. In the feature
extractor training stage, we develop a graph retrieval module to search for
relevant graphs that directly enrich the intra-class diversity for the tail
classes. Moreover, we innovatively optimize a category-centered supervised
contrastive loss to obtain discriminative representations, which is more
suitable for long-tailed scenarios. In the classifier fine-tuning stage, we
balance the classifier weights with two weight regularization techniques, i.e.,
Max-norm and weight decay. Experiments on various popular benchmarks verify the
superiority of the proposed method against state-of-the-art approaches.]]></summary>

each step, they adequately tune the interaction of biomechanical muscle
dynamics and neuronal signals to be robust against uncertainties in ground
conditions. However, it is still not fully understood how the nervous system
resolves the musculoskeletal redundancy to solve the multi-objective control
problem considering stability, robustness, and energy efficiency. In computer
simulations, energy minimization has been shown to be a successful optimization
target, reproducing natural walking with trajectory optimization or
reflex-based control methods. However, these methods focus on particular
motions at a time and the resulting controllers are limited when compensating
for perturbations. In robotics, reinforcement learning~(RL) methods recently
achieved highly stable (and efficient) locomotion on quadruped systems, but the
generation of human-like walking with bipedal biomechanical models has required
extensive use of expert data sets. This strong reliance on demonstrations often
results in brittle policies and limits the application to new behaviors,
especially considering the potential variety of movements for high-dimensional
musculoskeletal models in 3D. Achieving natural locomotion with RL without
sacrificing its incredible robustness might pave the way for a novel approach

compute-hungry, short, high-resolution simulations to ML emulators. However,
this hybrid ML-physics simulation approach requires domain-specific treatment

researchers. It consists of 5.7 billion pairs of multivariate input and output

high-fidelity physics on a host climate simulator's macro-scale physical state.

The dataset is global in coverage, spans multiple years at high sampling
frequency, and is designed such that resulting emulators are compatible with
downstream coupling into operational climate simulators. We implement a range

which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the
theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly
understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we
explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\boldsymbol{X})=\langle
\boldsymbol{Xv}, \texttt{softmax}(\boldsymbol{XWp})\rangle$, where
$\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and
$(\boldsymbol{v},\boldsymbol{W},\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We
prove that running gradient descent on $\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently
$\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that
separates $\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly
formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our
results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize
$\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings
$\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader
regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of
attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\boldsymbol{v}$
and $\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions
under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective
hard-margin SVM solutions where $\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features
based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\boldsymbol{p}$
is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we
verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.]]></summary>

learning of single index models, i.e. functions that depend on a 1-dimensional
projection of the input data, is governed by their information exponent.
However, these results are only concerned with isotropic data, while in
practice the input often contains additional structure which can implicitly
guide the algorithm. In this work, we investigate the effect of a spiked
covariance structure and reveal several interesting phenomena. First, we show
that in the anisotropic setting, the commonly used spherical gradient dynamics
may fail to recover the true direction, even when the spike is perfectly
aligned with the target direction. Next, we show that appropriate weight
normalization that is reminiscent of batch normalization can alleviate this
issue. Further, by exploiting the alignment between the (spiked) input
covariance and the target, we obtain improved sample complexity compared to the
isotropic case. In particular, under the spiked model with a suitably large
spike, the sample complexity of gradient-based training can be made independent
of the information exponent while also outperforming lower bounds for
rotationally invariant kernel methods.]]></summary>

scientific and engineering disciplines. However, traditional numerical solvers
are limited by the choice of step sizes when estimating integration, resulting
in a trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency. To address this

(NeurVec), which can compensate for integration errors and enable larger time
step sizes in simulations. Our extensive experiments on a variety of complex
dynamical system benchmarks demonstrate that NeurVec exhibits remarkable
generalization capability on a continuous phase space, even when trained using
limited and discrete data. NeurVec significantly accelerates traditional
solvers, achieving speeds tens to hundreds of times faster while maintaining
high levels of accuracy and stability. Moreover, NeurVec's simple-yet-effective

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the last decades, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has been intensively
studied by the Machine Learning community. Despite its versatility and
excellent performance, the optimization of large models via SGD still is a
time-consuming task. To reduce training time, it is common to distribute the
training process across multiple devices. Recently, it has been shown that the
convergence of asynchronous SGD (ASGD) will always be faster than mini-batch
SGD. However, despite these improvements in the theoretical bounds, most ASGD
convergence-rate proofs still rely on a centralized parameter server, which is
prone to become a bottleneck when scaling out the gradient computations across
many distributed processes.

In this paper, we present a novel convergence-rate analysis for decentralized
and asynchronous SGD (DASGD) which does not require partial synchronization
among nodes nor restrictive network topologies. Specifically, we provide a
bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sigma\epsilon^{-2}) +
\mathcal{O}(QS_{avg}\epsilon^{-3/2}) + \mathcal{O}(S_{avg}\epsilon^{-1})$ for
the convergence rate of DASGD, where $S_{avg}$ is the average staleness between
models, $Q$ is a constant that bounds the norm of the gradients, and $\epsilon$
is a (small) error that is allowed within the bound. Furthermore, when
gradients are not bounded, we prove the convergence rate of DASGD to be
$\mathcal{O}(\sigma\epsilon^{-2}) +
\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\hat{S}_{avg}\hat{S}_{max}}\epsilon^{-1})$, with
$\hat{S}_{max}$ and $\hat{S}_{avg}$ representing a loose version of the average
and maximum staleness, respectively. Our convergence proof holds for a fixed
stepsize and any non-convex, homogeneous, and L-smooth objective function. We
anticipate that our results will be of high relevance for the adoption of DASGD
by a broad community of researchers and developers.]]></summary>

approximated to arbitrary precision by a $\varrho$-activated network of width

to hallucinations, i.e., generating content that deviates from facts seen
during pretraining. We propose a simple decoding strategy for reducing
hallucinations with pretrained LLMs that does not require conditioning on

the next-token distribution by contrasting the differences in logits obtained
from projecting the later layers versus earlier layers to the vocabulary space,
exploiting the fact that factual knowledge in an LLMs has generally been shown
to be localized to particular transformer layers. We find that this Decoding by
Contrasting Layers (DoLa) approach is able to better surface factual knowledge
and reduce the generation of incorrect facts. DoLa consistently improves the
truthfulness across multiple choices tasks and open-ended generation tasks, for
example improving the performance of LLaMA family models on TruthfulQA by
12-17% absolute points, demonstrating its potential in making LLMs reliably

Importantly, we explore the limitations of a common approach to characterizing

based on which we provide two recipes for producing classes of
one-hidden-neuron NNs that provably cannot be fully characterized by a type of

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Interpolators are unstable. For example, the mininum $\ell_2$ norm least
square interpolator exhibits unbounded test errors when dealing with noisy
data. In this paper, we study how ensemble stabilizes and thus improves the
generalization performance, measured by the out-of-sample prediction risk, of
an individual interpolator. We focus on bagged linear interpolators, as bagging
is a popular randomization-based ensemble method that can be implemented in
parallel. We introduce the multiplier-bootstrap-based bagged least square
estimator, which can then be formulated as an average of the sketched least
square estimators. The proposed multiplier bootstrap encompasses the classical
bootstrap with replacement as a special case, along with a more intriguing
variant which we call the Bernoulli bootstrap.

Focusing on the proportional regime where the sample size scales
proportionally with the feature dimensionality, we investigate the
out-of-sample prediction risks of the sketched and bagged least square
estimators in both underparametrized and overparameterized regimes. Our results
reveal the statistical roles of sketching and bagging. In particular, sketching
modifies the aspect ratio and shifts the interpolation threshold of the minimum
$\ell_2$ norm estimator. However, the risk of the sketched estimator continues
to be unbounded around the interpolation threshold due to excessive variance.
In stark contrast, bagging effectively mitigates this variance, leading to a
bounded limiting out-of-sample prediction risk. To further understand this
stability improvement property, we establish that bagging acts as a form of
implicit regularization, substantiated by the equivalence of the bagged
estimator with its explicitly regularized counterpart. We also discuss several

financial surveillance, and health risk, various deep anomaly detection models
have been proposed and achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, besides
being effective, in practice, the practitioners would further like to know what
causes the abnormal outcome and how to further fix it. In this work, we propose
RootCLAM, which aims to achieve Root Cause Localization and Anomaly Mitigation
from a causal perspective. Especially, we formulate anomalies caused by
external interventions on the normal causal mechanism and aim to locate the
abnormal features with external interventions as root causes. After that, we
further propose an anomaly mitigation approach that aims to recommend
mitigation actions on abnormal features to revert the abnormal outcomes such
that the counterfactuals guided by the causal mechanism are normal. Experiments
on three datasets show that our approach can locate the root causes and further
flip the abnormal labels.]]></summary>

diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as of 5 pathological controls
have been collected and analysed by Raman spectroscopy (RS). We investigated
whether the raw and preprocessed Raman spectra could be used to distinguish AD
from controls. First, we applied standard Machine Learning (ML) methods
obtaining unsatisfactory results. Then, we applied ML to a set of topological
descriptors extracted from raw spectra, achieving a very good classification
accuracy (>87%). Although our results are preliminary, they indicate that RS

enlarging the dataset of CSF samples to validate the proposed method better

pairwise intra-/inter- class proximity violations in the embedding space. We
relate DML to feasibility problem of finite chance constraints. We show that
minimizer of proxy-based DML satisfies certain chance constraints, and that the
worst case generalization performance of the proxy-based methods can be
characterized by the radius of the smallest ball around a class proxy to cover
the entire domain of the corresponding class samples, suggesting multiple
proxies per class helps performance. To provide a scalable algorithm as well as
exploiting more proxies, we consider the chance constraints implied by the
minimizers of proxy-based DML instances and reformulate DML as finding a
feasible point in intersection of such constraints, resulting in a problem to
be approximately solved by iterative projections. Simply put, we repeatedly
train a regularized proxy-based loss and re-initialize the proxies with the
embeddings of the deliberately selected new samples. We applied our method with
4 well-accepted DML losses and show the effectiveness with extensive

from exploding and vanishing gradient problems. Numerous solutions have been
proposed such as normalisation techniques or limiting activation functions to
linear rectifying units. In this work we follow a different approach which is
particularly applicable to closed-loop learning of forward models where
back-propagation makes exclusive use of the sign of the error signal to prime
the learning, whilst a global relevance signal modulates the rate of learning.
This is inspired by the interaction between local plasticity and a global
neuromodulation. For example, whilst driving on an empty road, one can allow
for slow step-wise optimisation of actions, whereas, at a busy junction, an
error must be corrected at once. Hence, the error is the priming signal and the
intensity of the experience is a modulating factor in the weight change. The
advantages of this Prime and Modulate paradigm is twofold: it is free from
normalisation and it makes use of relevant cues from the environment to enrich
the learning. We present a mathematical derivation of the learning rule in
z-space and demonstrate the real-time performance with a robotic platform. The
results show a significant improvement in the speed of convergence compared to
that of the conventional back-propagation.]]></summary>

intelligence whose bottlenecks include huge computational expenses, power, and

efficient resolutions for generic (stochastic) gradient descent algorithms,
scaling as $\mathcal{O}(T^2 \times \text{polylog}(n))$, where $n$ is the size

the models are both sufficiently dissipative and sparse, with small learning
rates. Based on earlier efficient quantum algorithms for dissipative
differential equations, we find and prove that similar algorithms work for
(stochastic) gradient descent, the primary algorithm for machine learning. In
practice, we benchmark instances of large machine learning models from 7
million to 103 million parameters. We find that, in the context of sparse
training, a quantum enhancement is possible at the early stage of learning
after model pruning, motivating a sparse parameter download and re-upload

been recently extended to exploit prior knowledge on the cardinality of each
cluster. Such knowledge is used to increase performance as well as solution
quality. In this paper, we propose a global optimization approach based on the
branch-and-cut technique to solve the cardinality-constrained MSSC. For the
lower bound routine, we use the semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation
recently proposed by Rujeerapaiboon et al. [SIAM J. Optim. 29(2), 1211-1239,
(2019)]. However, this relaxation can be used in a branch-and-cut method only
for small-size instances. Therefore, we derive a new SDP relaxation that scales
better with the instance size and the number of clusters. In both cases, we
strengthen the bound by adding polyhedral cuts. Benefiting from a tailored
branching strategy which enforces pairwise constraints, we reduce the
complexity of the problems arising in the children nodes. For the upper bound,
instead, we present a local search procedure that exploits the solution of the
SDP relaxation solved at each node. Computational results show that the
proposed algorithm globally solves, for the first time, real-world instances of
size 10 times larger than those solved by state-of-the-art exact methods.]]></summary>

attributed to the areas of Statistics and Machine Learning in order to obtain
the benefits of both approaches. In this article, the statistical technique
lasso for variable selection is represented through a neural network. It is
observed that, although both the statistical approach and its neural version
have the same objective function, they differ due to their optimization. In
particular, the neural version is usually optimized in one-step using a single
validation set, while the statistical counterpart uses a two-step optimization
based on cross-validation. The more elaborated optimization of the statistical
method results in more accurate parameter estimation, especially when the
training set is small. For this reason, a modification of the standard approach
for training neural networks, that mimics the statistical framework, is
proposed. During the development of the above modification, a new optimization
algorithm for identifying the significant variables emerged. Experimental

obtain natural looking and view-consistent results, we leverage existing and
new geometric priors and 3D augmentations for improving the visual fidelity of
the final result. We test our framework both qualitatively and quantitatively

pre-training has shown a remarkable potential to boost the performance of
fundamental models in 2D vision. However, in 3D vision, the over-reliance on
Transformer-based backbones and the unordered nature of point clouds have
restricted the further development of generative pre-training. In this paper,
we propose a novel 3D-to-2D generative pre-training method that is adaptable to
any point cloud model. We propose to generate view images from different
instructed poses via the cross-attention mechanism as the pre-training scheme.
Generating view images has more precise supervision than its point cloud
counterpart, thus assisting 3D backbones to have a finer comprehension of the
geometrical structure and stereoscopic relations of the point cloud.
Experimental results have proved the superiority of our proposed 3D-to-2D
generative pre-training over previous pre-training methods. Our method is also
effective in boosting the performance of architecture-oriented approaches,
achieving state-of-the-art performance when fine-tuning on ScanObjectNN

like robotic teleoperation given noisy, high-dimensional command signals (e.g.,
from a brain-computer interface). Recent advances in human-in-the-loop machine
learning enable such systems to improve by interacting with users, but tend to
be limited by the amount of data that they can collect from individual users in
practice. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm to
address this by training an interface to map raw command signals to actions
using a combination of offline pre-training and online fine-tuning. To address
the challenges posed by noisy command signals and sparse rewards, we develop a
novel method for representing and inferring the user's long-term intent for a
given trajectory. We primarily evaluate our method's ability to assist users
who can only communicate through noisy, high-dimensional input channels through
a user study in which 12 participants performed a simulated navigation task by
using their eye gaze to modulate a 128-dimensional command signal from their
webcam. The results show that our method enables successful goal navigation
more often than a baseline directional interface, by learning to denoise user
commands signals and provide shared autonomy assistance. We further evaluate on
a simulated Sawyer pushing task with eye gaze control, and the Lunar Lander
game with simulated user commands, and find that our method improves over
baseline interfaces in these domains as well. Extensive ablation experiments
with simulated user commands empirically motivate each component of our method.]]></summary>

anthropocentric measurements, which is capable of generating a wide range of
human body shapes and poses. The proposed model enables direct modeling of
specific human identities through a deep generative architecture, which can
produce humans in any arbitrary pose. It is the first of its kind to have been
trained end-to-end using only synthetically generated data, which not only
provides highly accurate human mesh representations but also allows for precise
anthropometry of the body. Moreover, using a highly diverse animation library,
we articulated our synthetic humans' body and hands to maximize the diversity
of the learnable priors for model training. Our model was trained on a dataset
of $100k$ procedurally-generated posed human meshes and their corresponding
anthropometric measurements. Our synthetic data generator can be used to
generate millions of unique human identities and poses for non-commercial

supervision is a promising approach to deal with the need for Segmentation
networks, especially for generating a large number of pixel-wise masks in a
given dataset. However, most state-of-the-art image-level WSSS techniques lack
an understanding of the geometric features embedded in the images since the
network cannot derive any object boundary information from just image-level
labels. We define a boundary here as the line separating an object and its
background, or two different objects. To address this drawback, we are
proposing our novel ReFit framework, which deploys state-of-the-art class
activation maps combined with various post-processing techniques in order to
achieve fine-grained higher-accuracy segmentation masks. To achieve this, we
investigate a state-of-the-art unsupervised segmentation network that can be
used to construct a boundary map, which enables ReFit to predict object
locations with sharper boundaries. By applying our method to WSSS predictions,
we achieved up to 10% improvement over the current state-of-the-art WSSS
methods for medical imaging. The framework is open-source, to ensure that our
results are reproducible, and accessible online at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can produce high-quality samples, but
do not provide an estimate of the probability density around the samples.
However, it has been noted that maximizing the log-likelihood within an
energy-based setting can lead to an adversarial framework where the
discriminator provides unnormalized density (often called energy). We further
develop this perspective, incorporate importance sampling, and show that 1)
Wasserstein GAN performs a biased estimate of the partition function, and we
propose instead to use an unbiased estimator; and 2) when optimizing for
likelihood, one must maximize generator entropy. This is hypothesized to
provide a better mode coverage. Different from previous works, we explicitly
compute the density of the generated samples. This is the key enabler to
designing an unbiased estimator of the partition function and computation of
the generator entropy term. The generator density is obtained via a new type of
flow network, called one-way flow network, that is less constrained in terms of
architecture, as it does not require a tractable inverse function. Our
experimental results show that our method converges faster, produces comparable
sample quality to GANs with similar architecture, successfully avoids
over-fitting to commonly used datasets and produces smooth low-dimensional
latent representations of the training data.]]></summary>

large language model (LLM)-based agents such as GPT-4. However, many commercial
conversational agent development tools are pipeline-based and have limitations
in holding a human-like conversation. This paper investigates the capabilities
of LLMs to enhance pipeline-based conversational agents during two phases: 1)
in the design and development phase and 2) during operations. In 1) LLMs can
aid in generating training data, extracting entities and synonyms,
localization, and persona design. In 2) LLMs can assist in contextualization,
intent classification to prevent conversational breakdown and handle
out-of-scope questions, auto-correcting utterances, rephrasing responses,
formulating disambiguation questions, summarization, and enabling closed
question-answering capabilities. We conducted informal experiments with GPT-4
in the private banking domain to demonstrate the scenarios above with a
practical example. Companies may be hesitant to replace their pipeline-based
agents with LLMs entirely due to privacy concerns and the need for deep
integration within their existing ecosystems. A hybrid approach in which LLMs'
are integrated into the pipeline-based agents allows them to save time and
costs of building and running agents by capitalizing on the capabilities of
LLMs while retaining the integration and privacy safeguards of their existing

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Distribution shifts are all too common in real-world applications of machine
learning. Domain adaptation (DA) aims to address this by providing various
frameworks for adapting models to the deployment data without using labels.
However, the domain shift scenario raises a second more subtle challenge: the
difficulty of performing hyperparameter optimisation (HPO) for these adaptation
algorithms without access to a labelled validation set. The unclear validation
protocol for DA has led to bad practices in the literature, such as performing
HPO using the target test labels when, in real-world scenarios, they are not
available. This has resulted in over-optimism about DA research progress
compared to reality. In this paper, we analyse the state of DA when using good
evaluation practice, by benchmarking a suite of candidate validation criteria
and using them to assess popular adaptation algorithms. We show that there are
challenges across all three branches of domain adaptation methodology including
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA), Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA), and
Test Time Adaptation (TTA). While the results show that realistically
achievable performance is often worse than expected, they also show that using
proper validation splits is beneficial, as well as showing that some previously
unexplored validation metrics provide the best options to date. Altogether, our
improved practices covering data, training, validation and hyperparameter
optimisation form a new rigorous pipeline to improve benchmarking, and hence
research progress, within this important field going forward.]]></summary>

cheaper approach that adds noise not until the data become pure random noise,

rely on Gaussian process inference. Unfortunately, Gaussian process inference
scales cubically with the number of data points, limiting applicability to
high-dimensional and embedded systems. In this paper, we propose a safe
learning algorithm that provides probabilistic safety guarantees but leverages
the Nadaraya-Watson estimator instead of Gaussian processes. For the

in the presence of computational-statistical gaps. We begin by considering
offline sparse parity learning, a supervised classification problem which
admits a statistical query lower bound for gradient-based training of a
multilayer perceptron. This lower bound can be interpreted as a multi-resource
tradeoff frontier: successful learning can only occur if one is sufficiently
rich (large model), knowledgeable (large dataset), patient (many training
iterations), or lucky (many random guesses). We show, theoretically and
experimentally, that sparse initialization and increasing network width yield
significant improvements in sample efficiency in this setting. Here, width
plays the role of parallel search: it amplifies the probability of finding
"lottery ticket" neurons, which learn sparse features more sample-efficiently.
Finally, we show that the synthetic sparse parity task can be useful as a proxy
for real problems requiring axis-aligned feature learning. We demonstrate
improved sample efficiency on tabular classification benchmarks by using wide,

perform periodic dedicated tasks with soft deadlines. This work focuses on
developing methods to derive efficient power-management methods for periodic
tasks on small devices. We first study the limitations of the existing Linux
built-in methods used in small devices. We illustrate three typical
workload/system patterns that are challenging to manage with Linux's built-in
solutions. We develop a reinforcement-learning-based technique with temporal
encoding to derive an effective DVFS governor even with the presence of the
three system patterns. The derived governor uses only one performance counter,
the same as the built-in Linux mechanism, and does not require an explicit task
model for the workload. We implemented a prototype system on the Nvidia Jetson
Nano Board and experimented with it with six applications, including two
self-designed and four benchmark applications. Under different deadline
constraints, our approach can quickly derive a DVFS governor that can adapt to
performance requirements and outperform the built-in Linux approach in energy
saving. On Mibench workloads, with performance slack ranging from 0.04 s to 0.4
s, the proposed method can save 3% - 11% more energy compared to Ondemand.
AudioReg and FaceReg applications tested have 5%- 14% energy-saving
improvement. We have open-sourced the implementation of our in-kernel quantized
neural network engine. The codebase can be found at:

applications due to their high energy and power density. Their market was
estimated to be up to 48 billion U.S. dollars in 2022. However, the widespread
adoption of Li-ion batteries has resulted in counterfeit cell production, which
can pose safety hazards to users. Counterfeit cells can cause explosions or
fires, and their prevalence in the market makes it difficult for users to
detect fake cells. Indeed, current battery authentication methods can be
susceptible to advanced counterfeiting techniques and are often not adaptable
to various cells and systems. In this paper, we improve the state of the art on
battery authentication by proposing two novel methodologies, DCAuth and
EISthentication, which leverage the internal characteristics of each cell
through Machine Learning models. Our methods automatically authenticate
lithium-ion battery models and architectures using data from their regular
usage without the need for any external device. They are also resilient to the
most common and critical counterfeit practices and can scale to several
batteries and devices. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed
methodologies, we analyze time-series data from a total of 20 datasets that we
have processed to extract meaningful features for our analysis. Our methods
achieve high accuracy in battery authentication for both architectures (up to
0.99) and models (up to 0.96). Moreover, our methods offer comparable
identification performances. By using our proposed methodologies, manufacturers
can ensure that devices only use legitimate batteries, guaranteeing the
operational state of any system and safety measures for the users.]]></summary>

events over time. We ask a relatively basic question: how might we compare
these forecasters, either online or post-hoc, while avoiding unverifiable
assumptions on how the forecasts and outcomes were generated? In this paper, we
present a rigorous answer to this question by designing novel sequential
inference procedures for estimating the time-varying difference in forecast
scores. To do this, we employ confidence sequences (CS), which are sequences of
confidence intervals that can be continuously monitored and are valid at
arbitrary data-dependent stopping times ("anytime-valid"). The widths of our
CSs are adaptive to the underlying variance of the score differences.
Underlying their construction is a game-theoretic statistical framework, in
which we further identify e-processes and p-processes for sequentially testing
a weak null hypothesis -- whether one forecaster outperforms another on average
(rather than always). Our methods do not make distributional assumptions on the
forecasts or outcomes; our main theorems apply to any bounded scores, and we
later provide alternative methods for unbounded scores. We empirically validate
our approaches by comparing real-world baseball and weather forecasters.]]></summary>

the ranking matches the observations? This problem, known as rank aggregation,
has found many applications in sports, recommendation systems, and other web
applications. As it is generally NP-hard to find a global ranking that
minimizes the mismatch (known as the Kemeny optimization), we focus on the
Erd\"os-R\'enyi outliers (ERO) model for this ranking problem. Here, each
pairwise comparison is a corrupted copy of the true score difference. We
investigate spectral ranking algorithms that are based on unnormalized and
normalized data matrices. The key is to understand their performance in
recovering the underlying scores of each item from the observed data. This
reduces to deriving an entry-wise perturbation error bound between the top
eigenvectors of the unnormalized/normalized data matrix and its population
counterpart. By using the leave-one-out technique, we provide a sharper
$\ell_{\infty}$-norm perturbation bound of the eigenvectors and also derive an
error bound on the maximum displacement for each item, with only $\Omega(n\log
n)$ samples. Our theoretical analysis improves upon the state-of-the-art
results in terms of sample complexity, and our numerical experiments confirm

square interpolator exhibits unbounded test errors when dealing with noisy
data. In this paper, we study how ensemble stabilizes and thus improves the
generalization performance, measured by the out-of-sample prediction risk, of
an individual interpolator. We focus on bagged linear interpolators, as bagging
is a popular randomization-based ensemble method that can be implemented in
parallel. We introduce the multiplier-bootstrap-based bagged least square
estimator, which can then be formulated as an average of the sketched least
square estimators. The proposed multiplier bootstrap encompasses the classical
bootstrap with replacement as a special case, along with a more intriguing
variant which we call the Bernoulli bootstrap.

Focusing on the proportional regime where the sample size scales
proportionally with the feature dimensionality, we investigate the
out-of-sample prediction risks of the sketched and bagged least square
estimators in both underparametrized and overparameterized regimes. Our results
reveal the statistical roles of sketching and bagging. In particular, sketching
modifies the aspect ratio and shifts the interpolation threshold of the minimum
$\ell_2$ norm estimator. However, the risk of the sketched estimator continues
to be unbounded around the interpolation threshold due to excessive variance.
In stark contrast, bagging effectively mitigates this variance, leading to a
bounded limiting out-of-sample prediction risk. To further understand this
stability improvement property, we establish that bagging acts as a form of
implicit regularization, substantiated by the equivalence of the bagged
estimator with its explicitly regularized counterpart. We also discuss several
extensions.]]></summary>

(KG) that incorporates the dimension of time. Reasoning on TKGs is a crucial
task that aims to predict future facts based on historical occurrences. The key
challenge lies in uncovering structural dependencies within historical
subgraphs and temporal patterns. Most existing approaches model TKGs relying on
entity modeling, as nodes in the graph play a crucial role in knowledge
representation. However, the real-world scenario often involves an extensive
number of entities, with new entities emerging over time. This makes it
challenging for entity-dependent methods to cope with extensive volumes of
entities, and effectively handling newly emerging entities also becomes a
significant challenge. Therefore, we propose Temporal Inductive Path Neural
Network (TiPNN), which models historical information in an entity-independent
perspective. Specifically, TiPNN adopts a unified graph, namely history
temporal graph, to comprehensively capture and encapsulate information from
history. Subsequently, we utilize the defined query-aware temporal paths to
model historical path information related to queries on history temporal graph
for the reasoning. Extensive experiments illustrate that the proposed model not
only attains significant performance enhancements but also handles inductive
settings, while additionally facilitating the provision of reasoning evidence
through history temporal graphs.]]></summary>

However, learning the value function via bootstrapping often leads to unstable
training due to fast-changing target values. Target Networks are employed to
stabilize training by using an additional set of lagging parameters to estimate
the target values. Despite the popularity of Target Networks, their effect on
the optimization is still misunderstood. In this work, we show that they act as
an implicit regularizer which can be beneficial in some cases, but also have
disadvantages such as being inflexible and can result in instabilities, even
when vanilla TD(0) converges. To overcome these issues, we propose an explicit
Functional Regularization alternative that is flexible and a convex regularizer
in function space and we theoretically study its convergence. We conduct an
experimental study across a range of environments, discount factors, and
off-policiness data collections to investigate the effectiveness of the
regularization induced by Target Networks and Functional Regularization in
terms of performance, accuracy, and stability. Our findings emphasize that
Functional Regularization can be used as a drop-in replacement for Target
Networks and result in performance improvement. Furthermore, adjusting both the
regularization weight and the network update period in Functional
Regularization can result in further performance improvements compared to
solely adjusting the network update period as typically done with Target

been recently extended to exploit prior knowledge on the cardinality of each
cluster. Such knowledge is used to increase performance as well as solution
quality. In this paper, we propose a global optimization approach based on the
branch-and-cut technique to solve the cardinality-constrained MSSC. For the
lower bound routine, we use the semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation
recently proposed by Rujeerapaiboon et al. [SIAM J. Optim. 29(2), 1211-1239,
(2019)]. However, this relaxation can be used in a branch-and-cut method only
for small-size instances. Therefore, we derive a new SDP relaxation that scales
better with the instance size and the number of clusters. In both cases, we
strengthen the bound by adding polyhedral cuts. Benefiting from a tailored
branching strategy which enforces pairwise constraints, we reduce the
complexity of the problems arising in the children nodes. For the upper bound,
instead, we present a local search procedure that exploits the solution of the
SDP relaxation solved at each node. Computational results show that the
proposed algorithm globally solves, for the first time, real-world instances of
size 10 times larger than those solved by state-of-the-art exact methods.]]></summary>

heavy-tailed settings, where data does not have finite variance, but only has
$p$-th moment with $p \in (1,2)$. Instead of using estimation procedure based
on truncated observed data, we choose the optimizer by minimizing the risk
value. Those risk values can be robustly estimated via using the remarkable
Catoni's method (Catoni, 2012). Thanks to the structure of Catoni-type
influence functions, we are able to establish excess risk upper bounds via
using generalized generic chaining methods. Moreover, we take computational
issues into consideration. We especially theoretically investigate two types of
optimization methods, robust gradient descent algorithm and empirical
risk-based methods. With an extensive numerical study, we find that the
optimizer based on empirical risks via Catoni-style estimation indeed shows
better performance than other baselines. It indicates that estimation directly
based on truncated data may lead to unsatisfactory results.]]></summary>

high-dimensional observation data are essential in many real world
applications, such as gene mutation, brain diseases, natural disasters,
financial crises, and engineering reliability. To effectively extract early
warning signals, we develop a novel approach: the directed anisotropic
diffusion map that captures the latent evolutionary dynamics in low-dimensional
manifold. Applying the methodology to authentic electroencephalogram (EEG)
data, we successfully find the appropriate effective coordinates, and derive
early warning signals capable of detecting the tipping point during the state
transition. Our method bridges the latent dynamics with the original dataset.
The framework is validated to be accurate and effective through numerical
experiments, in terms of density and transition probability. It is shown that
the second coordinate holds meaningful information for critical transition in

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Advances in Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) have almost entirely closed the
gap between SSL and Supervised Learning at a fraction of the number of labels.
However, recent performance improvements have often come \textit{at the cost of
significantly increased training computation}. To address this, we propose
Curriculum Batch Size (CBS), \textit{an unlabeled batch size curriculum which
exploits the natural training dynamics of deep neural networks.} A small
unlabeled batch size is used in the beginning of training and is gradually
increased to the end of training. A fixed curriculum is used regardless of
dataset, model or number of epochs, and reduced training computations is
demonstrated on all settings. We apply CBS, strong labeled augmentation,
Curriculum Pseudo Labeling (CPL) \citep{FlexMatch} to FixMatch \citep{FixMatch}
and term the new SSL algorithm Fast FixMatch. We perform an ablation study to
show that strong labeled augmentation and/or CPL do not significantly reduce
training computations, but, in synergy with CBS, they achieve optimal
performance. Fast FixMatch also achieves substantially higher data utilization
compared to previous state-of-the-art. Fast FixMatch achieves between
$2.1\times$ - $3.4\times$ reduced training computations on CIFAR-10 with all
but 40, 250 and 4000 labels removed, compared to vanilla FixMatch, while
attaining the same cited state-of-the-art error rate \citep{FixMatch}. Similar
results are achieved for CIFAR-100, SVHN and STL-10. Finally, Fast MixMatch
achieves between $2.6\times$ - $3.3\times$ reduced training computations in
federated SSL tasks and online/streaming learning SSL tasks, which further
demonstrate the generializbility of Fast MixMatch to different scenarios and
tasks.]]></summary>

aspect of many applications including classification and clustering. Existing
measures may fail to capture similarities due to local trends (shapes) and may
even produce misleading results. Our goal is to develop a measure that looks
for similar trends occurring around similar times and is easily interpretable
for researchers in applied domains. This is particularly useful for
applications where time-series have a sequence of meaningful local trends that
are ordered, such as in epidemics (a surge to an increase to a peak to a
decrease). We propose a novel measure, DTW+S, which creates an interpretable
"closeness-preserving" matrix representation of the time-series, where each
column represents local trends, and then it applies Dynamic Time Warping to
compute distances between these matrices. We present a theoretical analysis
that supports the choice of this representation. We demonstrate the utility of
DTW+S in ensemble building and clustering of epidemic curves. We also
demonstrate that our approach results in better classification compared to
Dynamic Time Warping for a class of datasets, particularly when local trends

for fast and accurate estimation of post-physical synthesis circuit delay and
area metrics from pre-physical synthesis circuit netlists. Once trained,
GraPhSyM provides accurate visibility of final design metrics to early EDA
stages, such as logic synthesis, without running the slow physical synthesis
flow, enabling global co-optimization across stages. Additionally, the swift
and precise feedback provided by GraPhSyM is instrumental for
machine-learning-based EDA optimization frameworks. Given a gate-level netlist
of a circuit represented as a graph, GraPhSyM utilizes graph structure,
connectivity, and electrical property features to predict the impact of
physical synthesis transformations such as buffer insertion and gate sizing.
When trained on a dataset of 6000 prefix adder designs synthesized at an
aggressive delay target, GraPhSyM can accurately predict the post-synthesis
delay (98.3%) and area (96.1%) metrics of unseen adders with a fast 0.22s
inference time. Furthermore, we illustrate the compositionality of GraPhSyM by
employing the model trained on a fixed delay target to accurately anticipate
post-synthesis metrics at a variety of unseen delay targets. Lastly, we report
promising generalization capabilities of the GraPhSyM model when it is
evaluated on circuits different from the adders it was exclusively trained on.
The results show the potential for GraPhSyM to serve as a powerful tool for
advanced optimization techniques and as an oracle for EDA machine learning
frameworks.]]></summary>

agent rapidly adapt to various stationary reward functions randomly sampled
from a fixed distribution. In such situations, the successor representation
(SR) is a popular framework which supports rapid policy evaluation by
decoupling a policy's expected discounted, cumulative state occupancies from a
specific reward function. However, in the natural world, sequential tasks are
rarely independent, and instead reflect shifting priorities based on the
availability and subjective perception of rewarding stimuli. Reflecting this
disjunction, in this paper we study the phenomenon of diminishing marginal
utility and introduce a novel state representation, the $\lambda$
representation ($\lambda$R) which, surprisingly, is required for policy
evaluation in this setting and which generalizes the SR as well as several
other state representations from the literature. We establish the $\lambda$R's
formal properties and examine its normative advantages in the context of
machine learning, as well as its usefulness for studying natural behaviors,

toward the development of therapeutics for complex diseases such as Alzheimer's
disease (AD). However, most machine learning approaches developed for
prediction of disease progression are either single-task or single-modality
models, which can not be directly adopted to our setting involving multi-task
learning with high dimensional images. Moreover, most of those approaches are
trained on a single dataset (i.e. cohort), which can not be generalized to
other cohorts. We propose a novel multimodal multi-task deep learning model to
predict AD progression by analyzing longitudinal clinical and neuroimaging data
from multiple cohorts. Our proposed model integrates high dimensional MRI
features from a 3D convolutional neural network with other data modalities,
including clinical and demographic information, to predict the future
trajectory of patients. Our model employs an adversarial loss to alleviate the
study-specific imaging bias, in particular the inter-study domain shifts. In
addition, a Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) optimization technique is
applied to further improve model generalization. The proposed model is trained
and tested on various datasets in order to evaluate and validate the results.
Our results showed that 1) our model yields significant improvement over the

feasibility of this approach for small infrastructures but do not scale to
realistic scenarios due to the exponential growth in computational complexity

that recursively decomposes the game into subgames which can be solved in
parallel. Applying optimal stopping theory we show that the best response
strategies in these subgames exhibit threshold structures, which allows us to
compute them efficiently. To solve the decomposed game we introduce an
algorithm called Decompositional Fictitious Self-Play (DFSP), which learns Nash

both the perception and production of emotions. The subjectivity of emotions
poses significant challenges in developing accurate and robust computational
models. This thesis examines critical facets of emotion recognition, beginning
with the collection of diverse datasets that account for psychological factors
in emotion production.

To handle the challenge of non-representative training data, this work
collects the Multimodal Stressed Emotion dataset, which introduces controlled
stressors during data collection to better represent real-world influences on
emotion production. To address issues with label subjectivity, this research
comprehensively analyzes how data augmentation techniques and annotation
schemes impact emotion perception and annotator labels. It further handles
natural confounding variables and variations by employing adversarial networks
to isolate key factors like stress from learned emotion representations during
model training. For tackling concerns about leakage of sensitive demographic
variables, this work leverages adversarial learning to strip sensitive
demographic information from multimodal encodings. Additionally, it proposes
optimized sociological evaluation metrics aligned with cost-effective,
real-world needs for model testing.

This research advances robust, practical emotion recognition through
multifaceted studies of challenges in datasets, labels, modeling, demographic
and membership variable encoding in representations, and evaluation. The
groundwork has been laid for cost-effective, generalizable emotion recognition
models that are less likely to encode sensitive demographic information.]]></summary>

diverse range of activation functions. An activation function set $\mathscr{A}$
is defined to encompass the majority of commonly used activation functions,
such as $\mathtt{ReLU}$, $\mathtt{LeakyReLU}$, $\mathtt{ReLU}^2$,
$\mathtt{ELU}$, $\mathtt{SELU}$, $\mathtt{Softplus}$, $\mathtt{GELU}$,
$\mathtt{SiLU}$, $\mathtt{Swish}$, $\mathtt{Mish}$, $\mathtt{Sigmoid}$,
$\mathtt{Tanh}$, $\mathtt{Arctan}$, $\mathtt{Softsign}$, $\mathtt{dSiLU}$, and
$\mathtt{SRS}$. We demonstrate that for any activation function $\varrho\in
\mathscr{A}$, a $\mathtt{ReLU}$ network of width $N$ and depth $L$ can be
approximated to arbitrary precision by a $\varrho$-activated network of width
$4N$ and depth $2L$ on any bounded set. This finding enables the extension of
most approximation results achieved with $\mathtt{ReLU}$ networks to a wide
variety of other activation functions, at the cost of slightly larger

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Survival analysis is a valuable tool for estimating the time until specific
events, such as death or cancer recurrence, based on baseline observations.
This is particularly useful in healthcare to prognostically predict clinically
important events based on patient data. However, existing approaches often have
limitations; some focus only on ranking patients by survivability, neglecting
to estimate the actual event time, while others treat the problem as a
classification task, ignoring the inherent time-ordered structure of the
events. Furthermore, the effective utilization of censored samples - training
data points where the exact event time is unknown - is essential for improving
the predictive accuracy of the model. In this paper, we introduce CenTime, a
novel approach to survival analysis that directly estimates the time to event.
Our method features an innovative event-conditional censoring mechanism that
performs robustly even when uncensored data is scarce. We demonstrate that our
approach forms a consistent estimator for the event model parameters, even in
the absence of uncensored data. Furthermore, CenTime is easily integrated with
deep learning models with no restrictions on batch size or the number of
uncensored samples. We compare our approach with standard survival analysis
methods, including the Cox proportional-hazard model and DeepHit. Our results
indicate that CenTime offers state-of-the-art performance in predicting
time-to-death while maintaining comparable ranking performance. Our
implementation is publicly available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Causal inference plays a vital role in diverse domains like epidemiology,
healthcare, and economics. De-confounding and counterfactual prediction in
observational data has emerged as a prominent concern in causal inference
research. While existing models tackle observed confounders, the presence of
unobserved confounders remains a significant challenge, distorting causal
inference and impacting counterfactual outcome accuracy. To address this, we
propose a novel variational learning model of unobserved confounders for
counterfactual inference (VLUCI), which generates the posterior distribution of
unobserved confounders. VLUCI relaxes the unconfoundedness assumption often
overlooked by most causal inference methods. By disentangling observed and
unobserved confounders, VLUCI constructs a doubly variational inference model
to approximate the distribution of unobserved confounders, which are used for
inferring more accurate counterfactual outcomes. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate VLUCI's superior performance
in inferring unobserved confounders. It is compatible with state-of-the-art
counterfactual inference models, significantly improving inference accuracy at
both group and individual levels. Additionally, VLUCI provides confidence
intervals for counterfactual outcomes, aiding decision-making in risk-sensitive
domains. We further clarify the considerations when applying VLUCI to cases
where unobserved confounders don't strictly conform to our model assumptions
using the public IHDP dataset as an example, highlighting the practical
advantages of VLUCI.]]></summary>

Handling non-diffuse effects, such as global illumination or cast shadows, has
long been a challenge in face relighting. Prior work often assumes Lambertian
surfaces, simplified lighting models or involves estimating 3D shape, albedo,
or a shadow map. This estimation, however, is error-prone and requires many
training examples with lighting ground truth to generalize well. Our work
bypasses the need for accurate estimation of intrinsic components and can be
trained solely on 2D images without any light stage data, multi-view images, or
lighting ground truth. Our key idea is to leverage a conditional diffusion
implicit model (DDIM) for decoding a disentangled light encoding along with
other encodings related to 3D shape and facial identity inferred from
off-the-shelf estimators. We also propose a novel conditioning technique that
eases the modeling of the complex interaction between light and geometry by
using a rendered shading reference to spatially modulate the DDIM. We achieve
state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmark Multi-PIE and can
photorealistically relight in-the-wild images. Please visit our page:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most common things that a genealogist is tasked with is the
gathering of a person's initial family history, normally via in-person
interviews or with the use of a platform such as ancestry.com, as this can
provide a strong foundation upon which a genealogist may build. However, the
ability to conduct these interviews can often be hindered by both geographical
constraints and the technical proficiency of the interviewee, as the
interviewee in these types of interviews is most often an elderly person with a
lower than average level of technical proficiency. With this in mind, this
study presents what we believe, based on prior research, to be the first
chatbot geared entirely towards the gathering of family histories, and explores
the viability of utilising such a chatbot by comparing the performance and
usability of such a method with the aforementioned alternatives. With a
chatbot-based approach, we show that, though the average time taken to conduct
an interview may be longer than if the user had used ancestry.com or
participated in an in-person interview, the number of mistakes made and the
level of confusion from the user regarding the UI and process required is lower
than the other two methods. Note that the final metric regarding the user's
confusion is not applicable for the in-person interview sessions due to its
lack of a UI. With refinement, we believe this use of a chatbot could be a
valuable tool for genealogists, especially when dealing with interviewees who
are based in other countries where it is not possible to conduct an in-person
interview.]]></summary>

attributed to the areas of Statistics and Machine Learning in order to obtain
the benefits of both approaches. In this article, the statistical technique
lasso for variable selection is represented through a neural network. It is
observed that, although both the statistical approach and its neural version
have the same objective function, they differ due to their optimization. In
particular, the neural version is usually optimized in one-step using a single
validation set, while the statistical counterpart uses a two-step optimization
based on cross-validation. The more elaborated optimization of the statistical
method results in more accurate parameter estimation, especially when the
training set is small. For this reason, a modification of the standard approach
for training neural networks, that mimics the statistical framework, is
proposed. During the development of the above modification, a new optimization
algorithm for identifying the significant variables emerged. Experimental
results, using synthetic and real data sets, show that this new optimization

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The utility of reinforcement learning is limited by the alignment of reward
functions with the interests of human stakeholders. One promising method for
alignment is to learn the reward function from human-generated preferences
between pairs of trajectory segments, a type of reinforcement learning from
human feedback (RLHF). These human preferences are typically assumed to be
informed solely by partial return, the sum of rewards along each segment. We
find this assumption to be flawed and propose modeling human preferences
instead as informed by each segment's regret, a measure of a segment's
deviation from optimal decision-making. Given infinitely many preferences
generated according to regret, we prove that we can identify a reward function
equivalent to the reward function that generated those preferences, and we
prove that the previous partial return model lacks this identifiability
property in multiple contexts. We empirically show that our proposed regret
preference model outperforms the partial return preference model with finite
training data in otherwise the same setting. Additionally, we find that our
proposed regret preference model better predicts real human preferences and
also learns reward functions from these preferences that lead to policies that
are better human-aligned. Overall, this work establishes that the choice of
preference model is impactful, and our proposed regret preference model
provides an improvement upon a core assumption of recent research. We have open
sourced our experimental code, the human preferences dataset we gathered, and
our training and preference elicitation interfaces for gathering a such a
dataset.]]></summary>

mixture of $k$ Gaussians up to total variation distance $\alpha$ while
satisfying $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP. This is the first finite sample
complexity upper bound for the problem that does not make any structural
assumptions on the GMMs.

To solve the problem, we devise a new framework which may be useful for other
tasks. On a high level, we show that if a class of distributions (such as
Gaussians) is (1) list decodable and (2) admits a "locally small'' cover
[BKSW19] with respect to total variation distance, then the class of its
mixtures is privately learnable. The proof circumvents a known barrier

reinforcement learning over the S&P 500 index. The on-policy techniques of
Value Iteration (VI) and State-action-reward-state-action (SARSA) are
implemented along with the off-policy technique of Q-Learning. The models are
trained and tested on a dataset comprising multiple years of stock market data
from 2000-2023. The analysis presents the results and findings from training
and testing the models using two different time periods: one including the
COVID-19 pandemic years and one excluding them. The results indicate that
including market data from the COVID-19 period in the training dataset leads to
superior performance compared to the baseline strategies. During testing, the
on-policy approaches (VI and SARSA) outperform Q-learning, highlighting the
influence of bias-variance tradeoff and the generalization capabilities of
simpler policies. However, it is noted that the performance of Q-learning may
vary depending on the stability of future market conditions. Future work is
suggested, including experiments with updated Q-learning policies during
testing and trading diverse individual stocks. Additionally, the exploration of

learning of single index models, i.e. functions that depend on a 1-dimensional
projection of the input data, is governed by their information exponent.
However, these results are only concerned with isotropic data, while in
practice the input often contains additional structure which can implicitly
guide the algorithm. In this work, we investigate the effect of a spiked
covariance structure and reveal several interesting phenomena. First, we show
that in the anisotropic setting, the commonly used spherical gradient dynamics
may fail to recover the true direction, even when the spike is perfectly
aligned with the target direction. Next, we show that appropriate weight
normalization that is reminiscent of batch normalization can alleviate this
issue. Further, by exploiting the alignment between the (spiked) input
covariance and the target, we obtain improved sample complexity compared to the
isotropic case. In particular, under the spiked model with a suitably large
spike, the sample complexity of gradient-based training can be made independent
of the information exponent while also outperforming lower bounds for
rotationally invariant kernel methods.]]></summary>

of a limited capacity model (student) by pushing its responses to match a
powerful model's (teacher). Albeit useful especially in the penultimate layer
and beyond, its action on student's feature transform is rather implicit,
limiting its practice in the intermediate layers. To explicitly embed the
teacher's knowledge in feature transform, we propose a learnable KD layer for
the student which improves KD with two distinct abilities: i) learning how to
leverage the teacher's knowledge, enabling to discard nuisance information, and
ii) feeding forward the transferred knowledge deeper. Thus, the student enjoys
the teacher's knowledge during the inference besides training. Formally, we
repurpose 1x1-BN-ReLU-1x1 convolution block to assign a semantic vector to each
local region according to the template (supervised by the teacher) that the
corresponding region of the student matches. To facilitate template learning in
the intermediate layers, we propose a novel form of supervision based on the
teacher's decisions. Through rigorous experimentation, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach on 3 popular classification benchmarks. Code is

improve the handling of missing data in decision tree regressors and
classifiers. Unlike other approaches, the Trinary decision tree does not assume
that missing values contain any information about the response. Both
theoretical calculations on estimator bias and numerical illustrations using
real data sets are presented to compare its performance with established
algorithms in different missing data scenarios (Missing Completely at Random

outperforms its peers in MCAR settings, especially when data is only missing
out-of-sample, while lacking behind in IM settings. A hybrid model, the
TrinaryMIA tree, which combines the Trinary tree and the Missing In Attributes
(MIA) approach, shows robust performance in all types of missingness. Despite
the potential drawback of slower training speed, the Trinary tree offers a
promising and more accurate method of handling missing data in decision tree

in the presence of computational-statistical gaps. We begin by considering
offline sparse parity learning, a supervised classification problem which

tradeoff frontier: successful learning can only occur if one is sufficiently
rich (large model), knowledgeable (large dataset), patient (many training
iterations), or lucky (many random guesses). We show, theoretically and
experimentally, that sparse initialization and increasing network width yield
significant improvements in sample efficiency in this setting. Here, width
plays the role of parallel search: it amplifies the probability of finding
"lottery ticket" neurons, which learn sparse features more sample-efficiently.
Finally, we show that the synthetic sparse parity task can be useful as a proxy
for real problems requiring axis-aligned feature learning. We demonstrate
improved sample efficiency on tabular classification benchmarks by using wide,

maximizing the expected loss over a neighborhood of distributions, a technique

learning system using a seemingly inconsequential modification to a piece of
input data. Paradoxically, empirical evidence indicates that even systems which
are robust to large random perturbations of the input data remain susceptible
to small, easily constructed, adversarial perturbations of their inputs. Here,
we show that this may be seen as a fundamental feature of classifiers working
with high dimensional input data. We introduce a simple generic and
generalisable framework for which key behaviours observed in practical systems
arise with high probability -- notably the simultaneous susceptibility of the
(otherwise accurate) model to easily constructed adversarial attacks, and
robustness to random perturbations of the input data. We confirm that the same
phenomena are directly observed in practical neural networks trained on
standard image classification problems, where even large additive random noise
fails to trigger the adversarial instability of the network. A surprising
takeaway is that even small margins separating a classifier's decision surface
from training and testing data can hide adversarial susceptibility from being
detected using randomly sampled perturbations. Counterintuitively, using
additive noise during training or testing is therefore inefficient for
eradicating or detecting adversarial examples, and more demanding adversarial
training is required.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Time series classification is an important data mining task that has received
a lot of interest in the past two decades. Due to the label scarcity in
practice, semi-supervised time series classification with only a few labeled
samples has become popular. Recently, Similarity-aware Time Series
Classification (SimTSC) is proposed to address this problem by using a graph
neural network classification model on the graph generated from pairwise
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance of batch data. It shows excellent accuracy
and outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models in several few-label
settings. However, since SimTSC relies on pairwise DTW distances, the quadratic
complexity of DTW limits its usability to only reasonably sized datasets. To
address this challenge, we propose a new efficient semi-supervised time series
classification technique, LB-SimTSC, with a new graph construction module.
Instead of using DTW, we propose to utilize a lower bound of DTW, LB_Keogh, to
approximate the dissimilarity between instances in linear time, while retaining
the relative proximity relationships one would have obtained via computing DTW.
We construct the pairwise distance matrix using LB_Keogh and build a graph for
the graph neural network. We apply this approach to the ten largest datasets
from the well-known UCR time series classification archive. The results
demonstrate that this approach can be up to 104x faster than SimTSC when
constructing the graph on large datasets without significantly decreasing
classification accuracy.]]></summary>

the s-BKG, as potential drug candidates. We constructed a patent-informed
biomedical knowledge graph (p-BKG) by adding pharmaceutical patent information.
Finally, we developed a graph embedding protocol to ascertain the structure of
the p-BKG, thereby calculating the relevance scores of those candidates with
target disease-related patents to evaluate their technological potential. Our
case study on Alzheimer's disease demonstrates its efficacy and feasibility,
while the quantitative outcomes and systematic methods are expected to bridge
the gap between computational discoveries and successful market applications in
drug repositioning research.]]></summary>

the transformers pay particular attention to, and to show that these relevant

of differential privacy (DP). Our main result is that $\tilde{O}(k^2 d^4

mixture of $k$ Gaussians up to total variation distance $\alpha$ while
satisfying $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP. This is the first finite sample
complexity upper bound for the problem that does not make any structural
assumptions on the GMMs.

To solve the problem, we devise a new framework which may be useful for other
tasks. On a high level, we show that if a class of distributions (such as
Gaussians) is (1) list decodable and (2) admits a "locally small'' cover
[BKSW19] with respect to total variation distance, then the class of its
mixtures is privately learnable. The proof circumvents a known barrier

encode human-interpretable concepts is a fundamental problem. One prominent
approach for the identification of concepts in neural representations is
searching for a linear subspace whose erasure prevents the prediction of the
concept from the representations. However, while many linear erasure algorithms
are tractable and interpretable, neural networks do not necessarily represent
concepts in a linear manner. To identify non-linearly encoded concepts, we
propose a kernelization of a linear minimax game for concept erasure. We
demonstrate that it is possible to prevent specific non-linear adversaries from

Behavior analysis reveals both general and detailed patterns in the interaction

by recognizing specific behaviors through statistical visualization. However,
current approaches are limited to the analysis of small customer behavior sets,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Personalized federated learning has received an upsurge of attention due to
the mediocre performance of conventional federated learning (FL) over
heterogeneous data. Unlike conventional FL which trains a single global
consensus model, personalized FL allows different models for different clients.
However, existing personalized FL algorithms only implicitly transfer the
collaborative knowledge across the federation by embedding the knowledge into
the aggregated model or regularization. We observed that this implicit
knowledge transfer fails to maximize the potential of each client's empirical
risk toward other clients. Based on our observation, in this work, we propose
Personalized Global Federated Learning (PGFed), a novel personalized FL
framework that enables each client to personalize its own global objective by
explicitly and adaptively aggregating the empirical risks of itself and other
clients. To avoid massive (O(N^2)) communication overhead and potential privacy
leakage while achieving this, each client's risk is estimated through a
first-order approximation for other clients' adaptive risk aggregation. On top
of PGFed, we develop a momentum upgrade, dubbed PGFedMo, to more efficiently
utilize clients' empirical risks. Our extensive experiments on four datasets
under different federated settings show consistent improvements of PGFed over
previous state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at

for many downstream tasks: such descriptions can surface failures, guide
interventions, and perhaps even explain important model behaviors. To date,
most mechanistic descriptions of trained networks have involved small models,
narrowly delimited phenomena, and large amounts of human labor. Labeling all
human-interpretable sub-computations in models of increasing size and
complexity will almost certainly require tools that can generate and validate
descriptions automatically. Recently, techniques that use learned models
in-the-loop for labeling have begun to gain traction, but methods for
evaluating their efficacy are limited and ad-hoc. How should we validate and
compare open-ended labeling tools? This paper introduces FIND (Function
INterpretation and Description), a benchmark suite for evaluating the building
blocks of automated interpretability methods. FIND contains functions that
resemble components of trained neural networks, and accompanying descriptions
of the kind we seek to generate. The functions are procedurally constructed
across textual and numeric domains, and involve a range of real-world
complexities, including noise, composition, approximation, and bias. We
evaluate new and existing methods that use language models (LMs) to produce
code-based and language descriptions of function behavior. We find that an
off-the-shelf LM augmented with only black-box access to functions can
sometimes infer their structure, acting as a scientist by forming hypotheses,
proposing experiments, and updating descriptions in light of new data. However,
LM-based descriptions tend to capture global function behavior and miss local
corruptions. These results show that FIND will be useful for characterizing the
performance of more sophisticated interpretability methods before they are
applied to real-world models.]]></summary>

modern media and entertainment sectors, gaming and Augmented/Virtual Reality
industries. Many methods have been proposed to recreate the HDR counterparts of
input Low Dynamic Range (LDR) images/videos given a single exposure or
multi-exposure LDRs. The state-of-the-art methods focus primarily on the
preservation of the reconstruction's structural similarity and the pixel-wise
accuracy. However, these conventional approaches do not emphasize preserving
the artistic intent of the images in terms of human visual perception, which is
an essential element in media, entertainment and gaming. In this paper, we
attempt to study and fill this gap. We propose an architecture called
ArtHDR-Net based on a Convolutional Neural Network that uses multi-exposed LDR
features as input. Experimental results show that ArtHDR-Net can achieve
state-of-the-art performance in terms of the HDR-VDP-2 score (i.e., mean
opinion score index) while reaching competitive performance in terms of PSNR
and SSIM.]]></summary>

permit adjusting the (subgraph) vanishing moments of the framelets and extra
properties, such as directionality, for efficiently representing graph signals

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi-task learning (MTL) is a powerful approach in deep learning that
leverages the information from multiple tasks during training to improve model
performance. In medical imaging, MTL has shown great potential to solve various
tasks. However, existing MTL architectures in medical imaging are limited in
sharing information across tasks, reducing the potential performance
improvements of MTL. In this study, we introduce a novel attention-based MTL
framework to better leverage inter-task interactions for various tasks from
pixel-level to image-level predictions. Specifically, we propose a Cross-Task
Attention Network (CTAN) which utilizes cross-task attention mechanisms to
incorporate information by interacting across tasks. We validated CTAN on four
medical imaging datasets that span different domains and tasks including:
radiation treatment planning prediction using planning CT images of two
different target cancers (Prostate, OpenKBP); pigmented skin lesion
segmentation and diagnosis using dermatoscopic images (HAM10000); and COVID-19
diagnosis and severity prediction using chest CT scans (STOIC). Our study
demonstrates the effectiveness of CTAN in improving the accuracy of medical
imaging tasks. Compared to standard single-task learning (STL), CTAN
demonstrated a 4.67% improvement in performance and outperformed both widely
used MTL baselines: hard parameter sharing (HPS) with an average performance
improvement of 3.22%; and multi-task attention network (MTAN) with a relative
decrease of 5.38%. These findings highlight the significance of our proposed
MTL framework in solving medical imaging tasks and its potential to improve
their accuracy across domains.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Knowledge graph (KG) embedding has been used to benefit the diagnosis of
animal diseases by analyzing electronic medical records (EMRs), such as notes
and veterinary records. However, learning representations to capture entities
and relations with literal information in KGs is challenging as the KGs show
heterogeneous properties and various types of literal information. Meanwhile,
the existing methods mostly aim to preserve graph structures surrounding target
nodes without considering different types of literals, which could also carry
significant information. In this paper, we propose a knowledge graph embedding
model for the efficient diagnosis of animal diseases, which could learn various
types of literal information and graph structure and fuse them into unified
representations, namely LiteralKG. Specifically, we construct a knowledge graph
that is built from EMRs along with literal information collected from various
animal hospitals. We then fuse different types of entities and node feature
information into unified vector representations through gate networks. Finally,
we propose a self-supervised learning task to learn graph structure in pretext
tasks and then towards various downstream tasks. Experimental results on link
prediction tasks demonstrate that our model outperforms the baselines that
consist of state-of-the-art models. The source code is available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN) collects information on cancer patients
by receiving cancer messages from different medical entities (e.g., medical
labs, and hospitals) in Norway. Such messages are validated by an automated
cancer registry system: GURI. Its correct operation is crucial since it lays
the foundation for cancer research and provides critical cancer-related
statistics to its stakeholders. Constructing a cyber-cyber digital twin (CCDT)
for GURI can facilitate various experiments and advanced analyses of the
operational state of GURI without requiring intensive interactions with the
real system. However, GURI constantly evolves due to novel medical diagnostics
and treatment, technological advances, etc. Accordingly, CCDT should evolve as
well to synchronize with GURI. A key challenge of achieving such
synchronization is that evolving CCDT needs abundant data labelled by the new
GURI. To tackle this challenge, we propose EvoCLINICAL, which considers the
CCDT developed for the previous version of GURI as the pretrained model and
fine-tunes it with the dataset labelled by querying a new GURI version.
EvoCLINICAL employs a genetic algorithm to select an optimal subset of cancer
messages from a candidate dataset and query GURI with it. We evaluate
EvoCLINICAL on three evolution processes. The precision, recall, and F1 score
are all greater than 91%, demonstrating the effectiveness of EvoCLINICAL.
Furthermore, we replace the active learning part of EvoCLINICAL with random
selection to study the contribution of transfer learning to the overall
performance of EvoCLINICAL. Results show that employing active learning in
EvoCLINICAL increases its performances consistently.]]></summary>

Differential privacy (DP) is a rigorous mathematical definition of privacy. DP algorithms are randomized to protect user data by ensuring that the probability of any particular output is nearly unchanged when a data point is added or removed. Therefore, the output of a DP algorithm does not disclose the presence of any one data point. There has been significant progress in both foundational research and adoption of differential privacy with contributions such as the Privacy Sandbox and Google Open Source Library.

So, here's a poll. Answer away if you feel like it. 
 I'm sharing this on a few other subs too (for the sake of greater information gathering) so please don't vote more than once.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Everyone, 
 I'm currently exploring the idea of a solution tailored for ML engineers and technologists. While I have a background in recruiting, I've often found myself dissatisfied with the typical recruitment process. It seems that many recruiters don't always appreciate the importance of working with candidates or understand the impact on people's livelihoods and careers. 
 What I'm proposing is the creation of a career representation firm specifically designed for purpose-driven technologists specializing in data, product, and hardware careers. This firm would advocate for the career interests of the most passionate ML engineers. 
 Our representation would encompass: 
 - Strategic Career Development: Crafting a strategic approach to help engineers secure opportunities aligned with their desired projects and professional development. 
 - Impact Matching: Identifying and connecting engineers with projects and teams where their technical skills, career goals, and personal interests can have the greatest positive impact, ensuring that your work aligns with your values and aspirations. 
 - Industry Leadership: Positioning you as an industry leader by marketing your expertise and securing speaking engagements at conferences and other events, enhancing your professional visibility and reputation. 
 In return for this representation, engineers would commit to a 3% fee deducted from their salary, which would support the services provided by the firm. 
 Would you be interested in participating in such a service? If not, would you consider recommending it to someone you know? If you are in favor of this idea, what makes you believe it would be advantageous for others even if it might not be your preference? Do you think you could personally benefit from this type of career representation? 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tech startups are running sexually explicit ads for apps promoting not-safe-for-work experiences on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.
 
These ads feature digitally created potential 'girlfriends' with large breasts and tight clothing, and some even use popular children's TV characters to promote 'NSFW pics' apps.
 
NBC News found 35 app developers running sexually explicit ads on Meta-owned apps, and 14 app developers running similar ads on TikTok.
 
The marketing push is part of an AI gold rush, capitalizing on the surge of interest in AI and benefiting from a double standard that hurts real human sex workers.
 
Researchers believe that the gender-based slant in these ads reflects social media platforms allowing sex-related ads only if the intended audience is men.
 
Meta and TikTok have stepped up their removal of sexually explicit AI ads after NBC News contacted them, but questions remain about how the ads got through their filters in the first place.
 
Similar ads also appear in the Apple and Google app stores, although the extent of advertising there is unknown.

 so I've been researching a little about transformers and meanwhile I had to understand sinusoidal positional embedding. I have found two implementations for this, after testing both approaches I found they compute different embeddings for the same position/timestep with the same embedding dimensions... shouldn't it be equal if the position and embedding dimensions are the same?
 This is getting me confused, because now I don't know which implementation should I consider... Do you have any suggestions to where I can look?
 Thank you :)

Especially with more complex stories, like Game of Thrones. At the moment I'm reading Wheel of Time, a rather long fantasy series. I had the idea to build the following WebApp:
 There is online each chapter of the series summarized separately. So in the WebApp I could ask questions about the content. In addition, I can indicate which chapter I am reading, so that it is ensured not to spoil the user.
 I want to avoid to train a model. I would prefer to use one of the existing open-source models, like llama. A first, primitive idea: give the LLM all the summaries and the user's question. But this would mean to give all summaries as input every time. Not only that this approach would not be elegant, the restriction in the input size (number of words) would make this possibly even impossible.
 Feel free to share your ideas how i could solve this :)

 I was suddenly inspired to make a WH Gladius bot.
 Background: I recently got into the game, it seems very interesting to me personally, but alas, there are not enough guides on it for you to learn how to play at a high level. I don’t intend to spend hundreds of hours to master the base, so I decided to try something like RARL so that this thing would learn, and I could analyze its moves, change the conditions and thus start playing at an intermediate level faster.
 However, a superficial analysis revealed that the game does not have an API at all. Let's say I could grab some stats using Cheat Engine and OllyDbg, but I have no idea how to fit it into the gym. Or does gym as env need to pass a link to the client from the machine so that it only restarts it?
 In general, if anyone has done something similar, I ask for a link to a guide or a similar example.
 All the best

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the upcoming versions of macOS and iOS, Apple is including a predictive text model which offers suggestions while you type, which they’ve said to be a "transformer model". I managed to find some details about this model, including details about its topology and tokenizer, and I was even able to peek in and see several of its top predictions while typing!

 Hopefully this can give some insight into some of the trade-offs that Apple went through to put a model on every iPhone and MacBook — it’s small, it has a pretty narrow scope, and it’s not very capable on its own. Let me know what you think!

 i have recently started working on a project, where I need to animate an image of a face in real time to speak sentences. Essentially I am trying to build a face for my own large language model. I know of Nvidia's Audio2Face and Metahuman, but these are all in 3D and take a lot of time rendering the lip and eye animations. I need something, which works only with a bit of latency.

 Does anyone know a service or a repo I could use to animate a 2D picture to speak text?

 I am trying to work on a project in which I use drone imagery to detect objects that are in close formations with each other. I do this for the purpose of counting particular objects, as well as to check if an object has moved (by making a prediction on drone imagery that is taken later).
 Create masks?
 I'm now trying to understand what methodology/models make sense. First of all, should I be looking at creating masks, or do bounding boxes suffice? My idea was that masks are better, since bounding boxes overlap with each other and can miss that an object has moved slightly, Or am I wrong and are masks just an extra hassle? Or shouldn't I be looking at bounding boxes or masks at all?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think there's a lot of confusion around AI agents today and it's mainly because of lack of definition and using the wrong terminology.
 We've been talking to many companies who are claiming they're working on agents but when you look under the hood, they are really just chains.
 I just listened to the Latent Space pod with Harrison Chase (Founder of Langchain) and I really liked how he thinks about chains vs agents.
 Chains: sequence of tasks in a more rigid order, where you have more control, more predictability.
 Agents: handling the edge-cases, the long-tail of things that can happen.
 And the most important thing is that it's not an OR question but an AND one: you can use them in the same application by starting with chains -> figuring our the edge-cases -> using agents to deal with them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys! I need some help here.. many days trying to get good results but without success. So I already have the voice I want to use (edited with uvr5 and it sounds really great, without any echo or noise on the background), I trained it on aivc so that I can generate this voice verbalizing the text content I need. I used high quality - it took like 40min to generate each phrase - and it is ok, but still a little robotic. So I installed RVC and trained a model with the original voice (edited with the uvr5) just like I did the training on aivc. So I loaded the trained model on the inference tab and I selected the audio to be processed - the generated audio files from aivc. Even selecting the harvest mode, the output was worse than the generated files from aivc. I even tried to record my own voice speaking the text but it does not sound good. My trained model on rvc has 500 epochs, and it may be a very good model to use, yet idk what I’m doing wrong. Maybe I’m misusing rvc, so what I need is to improve the realism of my aivc(or tortoise) generated voices, simple as that, is rvc the best option to do this? If yes, how? Any help please would be much appreciated thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi ML community, I have been working on benchmarking publicly available LLMs these past couple of weeks. More precisely, I am interested on the finetuning piece since a lot of businesses are starting to entertain the idea of self-hosting LLMs trained on their proprietary data rather than relying on third party APIs. To this point, I am tracking the following 4 pillars of evaluation that businesses are typically look into: - Performance - Time to train an LLM - Cost to train an LLM - Inference (throughput / latency / cost per token)
 For each LLM, my aim is to benchmark them for popular tasks, i.e., classification and summarization. Moreover, I would like to compare them against each other.
 So far, I have benchmarked Flan-T5-Large, Falcon-7B and RedPajama and have found them to be very efficient in low-data situations, i.e., when there are very few annotated samples. Llama2-7B/13B and Writer’s Palmyra are in the pipeline.
 But there’s so many LLMs out there! In case this work interests you, would be great to join forces.
 GitHub repo attached — feedback is always welcome :)

 Happy hacking!

Turbulence is ubiquitous in environmental and engineering fluid flows, and is encountered routinely in everyday life.

However, despite its importance, our current understanding and our ability to reliably predict such flows remains limited. This is mainly attributed to the highly chaotic nature a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let me give you a quick intro. My engineering experience primarily revolved around data processing, analytics, and distributed systems. Nonetheless, I had a desire to learn about ML, and imho the best way to learn is to work on a practical project. So, that's precisely what I did. A few months ago, I embarked on an exciting journey with a friend, and together, we've created http://github.com/huggingbench/huggingbench.
 Now, after three months, I find myself seeking validation for some of my assumptions from the broader community. If you'd like to learn more about our motivations and the path we've taken check out the blog post https://medium.com/@niksa.jakovljevic/introducing-huggingbench-a-path-to-optimized-model-serving-a17cecc8d3ec.
 What I'd like to gather from individuals with machine learning models in production is their level of investment in optimizing inference. Is this a commonplace practice? I acknowledge that it can vary on a case-by-case basis, but I'm still hopeful of identifying prevailing trends. After conversing with a few companies, I've come to the impression that only the truly large players (those spending six figures or more on inference per month) place significant emphasis on inference optimization, which is entirely understandable. Nevertheless, I sense that there are numerous low hanging fruits that could result in substantial cost savings, even for typical startups.
 Could it be that the entire machine learning field is still in its infancy, and many engineers may not be fully considering or prioritizing such optimizations? Perhaps businesses are not giving as much attention to cost considerations? Alternatively, there might be technical challenges I'm not yet aware of. In any case, I would greatly appreciate hearing your insights on the subject of inference optimization.

 EntitySeg dataset
 Dense image segmentation tasks (e.g., semantic, panoptic) are useful for image editing, but existing methods can hardly generalize well in an in-the-wild setting where there are unrestricted image domains, classes, and image resolution and quality variations. Motivated by these observations, we construct a new entity segmentation dataset, with a strong focus on high-quality dense segmentation in the wild. The dataset contains images spanning diverse image domains and entities, along with plentiful high-resolution images and high-quality mask annotations for training and testing.
 We have now released the dataset at https://github.com/adobe-research/EntitySeg-Dataset

 So, I've been messing around with ML and I must say, the hardware requirements can be a real buzzkill... I mean, not everyone's got a huge GPU lying around or the money to rent a dedicated cloud instance.
 What are your hacks for pulling off decent model training without selling a kidney?
 Here's what I'm curious about:
  
CPU: Is anyone else training models on their CPU? How's that working out for you? What are some workarounds you've tried to make it less painful?
 Cloud: Who's been dabbling in cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure? Are they worth the pennies or complicated to set up?
 Big Dataset: How do you handle a massive dataset with a standard storage space?
  
Let's help each other get those models trained without going broke! :D

 Basically, I want a neural network to learn the simple polynomial pattern of a set of arrays of the form [x,y], with y = x², where the first coordinates are uniformly distributed random numbers in the interval [0,1].
 I started with a model with 2 hidden layers of size two and 'tanh' activation functions, and an output layer with 'linear' activation function. 
 I've then experimented with both additional hidden layers and with increasing the sizes of these layers. Finally, I've tested both the 'adam' and 'sgd' optimizers and the loss functions 'meanSquaredError' and 'meanAbsolutePercentageError'.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the LOw-Memory Optimization paper one of the main ideas towards reducing memory usage in training LLMs is to replace a fancy optimizer like Adam with simple SGD. The reason is that Adam maintains "the optimizer state", which accounts for about 75% of the memory used. In contrast, SGD does not store any intermediate state, as they say on page one. So far, so good.
 https://preview.redd.it/b0dj2nzscumb1.png?width=1055&format=png&auto=webp&s=1712f8500b5cbfb3773cee00ea980175491dddbf
 On page six they have pie charts and a table showing memory usage for Adam, SGD, and LOMO. Here's where I got confused. The pie chart for SGD shows that the optimizer state accounts for nearly 50% of the memory used (weight, gradients and activations are shown separately). It's a major WTF moment: WHAT OPTIMIZER STATE? Can anybody understand and explain this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Medicine's field transformation is being driven by artificial intelligence (AI). However, an important debatable question arises: Will AI ever have a place in this field, or will it remain exclusive to doctors and medical pros?
 Opponents of automated AI diagnosis and treatment contend that machines cannot be relied upon to preserve patient health and lives. Bugs in AI algorithms might cause incorrect diagnoses and treatment prescriptions, leaving them cautious. Individual differences, the doubt is whether AI can truly empathize with patients.
 By contrast, advocates of AI in medicine contend that the technology can considerably improve diagnosis and treatment accuracy. Faster and more accurate than humans, machines can analyze large amounts of data. Not only does it identify rare and complex diseases, but it also saves time and resources. By incorporating AI, clinicians receive additional tips and signals to make more judicious choices.
 Where medical specialists are in short supply, AI can prove especially valuable. This approach can help with shortages in health systems.
 And what do you think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am planning on publishing a journal based on the thesis i completed in the mid of 2022. I did my thesis on Parkinson disease binary classification on 3D structural brain mri, and the dataset has significantly small amount of data(around 80 samples); but due to high resolution and complex data structure I was able achieve around 70% accuracy.
 But now at 2023 using deep neural network only isnot enough to publish in a good journal. Currently I am learning about GAN and attention mechanism, but completely noob on this area. For my journal to get published, I have planned on applying some key operations. But I am not sure if they would work or not. So needed some advice on this regard.
  
Applying tranfer learning: as my dataset has very small amount of data. I was thinking if its possible to pre train a CNN Architecture with some other structural mri data of a different disease and then apply to my dataset? ( for example: brain tumor dataset has the same type of three dimensional data structure, but has comparatively good amount of data)
 
Applying attention mechanism: how should I approach on learning about attention mechanism? 
 
 Any other advices will be appreciated, thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forrester predicts that generative AI will replace 2.4 million US jobs by 2030, mostly white-collar roles, such as technical writers, proofreaders, copywriters, and administrative positions. But ironically, other forms of automation will displace more jobs.
 To stay on top of the latest advancements in AI, look here first.
 (Chart showing how much different types of jobs can expect to be influenced by technology)
 Concerns about Generative AI
  
While the Generative AI impact is significant, other forms of automation are set to cause more widespread job displacement.
 The most impacted group will be middle-class, college-educated, white-collar workers, specifically those earning above $60,000 annually.
  
Creative professionals stand to benefit
  
Interestingly, workers in creative industries will likely utilize generative AI tools in their jobs rather than being replaced. This includes editors, writers, authors, poets, and lyricists.
 However, the use of such tools as ChatGPT may result in inconsistent outputs and even "coherent nonsense", leading to potential performance issues.

 I have ~10,000 documents that are "scams" because of some specific reason (all are verified); now I want to check if a new document is similar to any of the documents in the corpus of 10k scam documents. 
 Right now I've implemented a winnowing solution which normalizes text, breaks it up into windows, and then calculates the intersection between a document and each document in the corpus. HOWEVER, this method is pretty computationally expensive (for this many documents a single comparison cycle can take upwards of 3-4 minutes especially when windows are NOT precomputed). 
 How might I approach this problem? Because my data is pretty well structured, supervised learning might be a good approach but so might be setting up recursive chunking for the 10k document corpus and then using LLMs to access if this current legal document has any similarity, but I would love to hear your thoughts!

 ​
 In my opinion the real dystopia will be when politicians sit own with big tech lobbyists and big rights holders and decide that training as it is currently done, for free and open source models and others is illegal. Then the big players would actually win, since they have enough resources to license datasets and will certainly do so willingly and gladly, if it is clear that the jurisdiction keeps all the small players and open source out.

 Github: https://github.com/modelscope/modelscope-agent
 Abstract:
  
Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities to comprehend human intentions, engage in reasoning, and design planning-like behavior. To further unleash the power of LLMs to accomplish complex tasks, there is a growing trend to build agent framework that equips LLMs, such as ChatGPT, with tool-use abilities to connect with massive external APIs. In this work, we introduce ModelScope-Agent, a general and customizable agent framework for real-world applications, based on open-source LLMs as controllers. It provides a user-friendly system library, with customizable engine design to support model training on multiple open-source LLMs, while also enabling seamless integration with both model APIs and common APIs in a unified way. To equip the LLMs with tool-use abilities, a comprehensive framework has been proposed spanning over tool-use data collection, tool retrieval, tool registration, memory control, customized model training, and evaluation for practical real-world applications. Finally, we showcase ModelScopeGPT, a real-world intelligent assistant of ModelScope Community based on the ModelScope-Agent framework, which is able to connect open-source LLMs with more than 1000 public AI models and localized community knowledge in ModelScope.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been hearing lately that NNs are better than GBDTs when scaled up alot:
  
Uber https://www.uber.com/en-CA/blog/deepeta-how-uber-predicts-arrival-times/
 Stripe https://stripe.com/blog/how-we-built-it-stripe-radar
 Most CTR papers coming from google are also NN based (like https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05310)
 Meta mentions NNs in their recommender system (also kind of a large scale tabular problem there) https://engineering.fb.com/2023/08/09/ml-applications/scaling-instagram-explore-recommendations-system
 Lyft forecasting https://medium.com/this-week-in-machine-learning-ai/causal-models-in-practice-at-lyft-with-sean-taylor-1e62efd62385
  
What's your intuition on DL vs GBDT on (very)large-scale tabular datasets? Have you heard of other such examples (or the reverse)? 
 Are there any particularly interesting open large tabular datasets on which I could test this? I guess datasets should also be wide/hard/with large intrinsic dimention (whatever that means) so there is something to learn with scale (the above examples sure feel good in this way).

Time series forecasting is critical to various real-world applications, from demand forecasting to pandemic spread prediction. In multivariate time series forecasting (forecasting multiple variants at the same time), one can split existing methods into two categories: univariate models and multivariate models. Univariate models focus on inter-series interactions or temporal patterns that encompass trends and seasonal patterns on a time series with a single variable. Examples of such trends and seasonal patterns might be the way mortgage rates increase due to inflation, and how traffic peaks during rush hour. In addition to inter-series patterns, multivariate models process intr…]]></summary>

 To stay on top of the latest advancements in AI, look here first.

 Musk's AI Integration Plan
  
Musk is contemplating merging Neuralink and Tesla, alongside his xAI startup, to create a comprehensive artificial intelligence model.
 Leveraging the text data from Twitter and real-world images from Tesla's Full Self-Driving network, he intends to develop AI chatbots and physical robots capable of real-world navigation.
  
Reasoning Behind the Merge
  
A concern that AI could potentially render humans obsolete led Musk to found xAI for AI safety.
 Musk is targeting to create an AI that can generate computer software and a politically unbiased chatbot rival to ChatGPT.
  
Twitter and Tesla as AI Datasets
  
Despite criticism, Musk's acquisition of Twitter offers access to vast user data for AI training.
 In addition, the Autopilot and Full-Self Driving systems of Tesla, with billions of collected camera images, serve as valuable resources to build physical robot AI.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After our first blog post gained some attention from folks interested in applied fine-tuning, we now have a follow-up post that discusses all sorts of things we learned while working with LoRA.
 We hope that this helps engineers and other folks in the community to improve their fine-tuning.
 Here's what you can expect from the post:
 We compare full-parameter fine-tuning with LoRA and answer questions around the strengths and weaknesses of the two techniques. We train the Llama 2 models on three real-world use cases and demonstrate that using LoRA involves a trade-off between serving efficiency and model quality, which varies according to the specific task at hand. Additionally, we offer insights into how to stabilize training with LoRA through intelligent prompting techniques. We further show that adopting a lower learning rate can enhance the reliability of the resulting model checkpoints.

 Assume I have data for forex / stocks day trading, where my data/columns are:
 1) price of last 50 ticks (a tick is the price at that moment in time, the smallest movement possibly that you can get for that currency)
 2) If we should be in a trade (and direction of trade. where 1 = trade going up. 2 = trade going down. 0 = we should not be in a trade).
 I have tried classification (I generalized the tick price by changing it to pct_change() ) but accuracy is low.
 would it be possible to reverse engineer through reinforcement learning given these data? I am actually more interested in the trade exiting only (so if trade is currently has value of 1 then it became 0 or 2, it means we should exit existing trade). 
 any guide on how to go about this? Yes I know it will be hard. but if humans can teach a robot to walk, maybe hopefully an agent can be taught to learn to exit a trade based on historucal data?
 I have done preliminary readings, and is PPO the best way to go? or DQN? assuming I will use stable baseline3. I am also open to using other Python libraries.
 Thank you.

 I'm working on a card game similar to Hearthstone or Magic: The Gathering, i.e. a game where two players battle with decks of cards coming from a large collection (for instance, there are around 4000 cards in Hearthstone).
 Actions are limited to three things:
  
Play a card (potentially on a target)
 Use a card on a target
 End the turn
  
I'm looking at building AI for it, and am investigating using machine learning for it. I know very little on the subject (I am a game engineer with a reasonable experience of cloud / AWS stuff), but it seems to me that it might be a good fit: features would be the state of the board (i.e. all the cards in play or in hand or in deck), the turn, and whether the current player has won that game or not (eventually), and label would be the action taken (that turn).
 I was looking at SageMaker, hoping that it would streamline and allow me to try something relatively easily, but I immediately found it complicated and quite unclear.
 I would be very grateful if anyone could point me at resources describing at a high level what a full ML pipeline could look like (i.e. what software can injest this kind of data, what software can provide inference, etc.). For instance, would it be saner to "just" get started with Spark on EMR for this kind of problem domain?
 I hope I'm not too wide off the mark with those questions, and thanks in advance!

However, why not directly use human feedback to finetune with a simple ranking loss(e.g pairwise loss)? What might be the best advantage for RLHF?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've just finished pre-processing the danbooru dataset, which if you don't know, is a 5 million anime image dataset. Each image is tagged by humans such as ['1girl', 'thigh_highs', 'blue eyes'], however, many images are missing tags due to there being so many. I've filtered the tags (classes) down to the 15k most common. Although the top classes have 100k or more examples, many rare classes only have a few hundred tags (long tail problem?). 
 This is my first time training on such a large dataset, and I'm planning on using Convnext due to close to SOTA accuracy and fast training speed. Perhaps vit or a transformer architecture may benefit from such a large dataset? However, vit trains way slower even on my 4090. 
 What are some tips and tricks for training on such a large noisy dastaset? Existing models such as deepdanbooru work well on common classes, but struggles on rare classes in my testing. 
 I assume class unbalance will be a huge problem, as the 100k classes will dominate the loss compared to the rarer classes. Perhaps focal loss or higher sampling ratio for rare classes?
 For missing labels, I'm planning on using psuedolabeling (self distillation) to fix the missing labels. What is the best practice when generating psuedolabels? 
 ​
 Any tips or experiences with training on large unbalanced noisy datasets you could contribute would be greatly appreciated!

 I have a project I would need help with. We need to build a MVP (minimum viable product) of a combination of two models.
 A model that recommend the best channel to use performing a task. And then after that a model to recommend the best time today to perform that task in given channel.
 We have a set of features already defined. Some are in the data and some are generated from the data.
 Looking for someone who could work on this as a freelancer.
 Our preferred environment would be AWS SageMaker, but honestly not a necessity at this point as this is a MVP.
 Due to the reason I want to keep this "secret" for a while, I will not disclose all the details in this post.
 End product that I am waiting for includes (but not restricted to): - Model Training script that evaluates if the new model is more accurate as the previous model (some level of version control) - Model prediction API that will accept the data and prepare it for the models, run the prediction, return the result with accuracy.

Because each time a new action can be given to the robot and it has to minic that action (it's sort of like a supervised data that the robot has to memorize) Is there a way to do it? is it some branch of machine learning that I'm not aware?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Martian Lawyers Club (MLC) has raised $2.2 million in a pre-seed round to develop AI-based game personalization technology.
 
Unlike other companies that focus on generating game assets, MLC is focused on the systems that form the core of a game.
 
The company aims to create games that feel like a conversation, where players provide input and the game responds in a way that wasn't pre-defined by the developer.
 
MLC plans to provide an SDK that allows developers to design the game experience without having to create every interaction from scratch.
 
Developers will have access to a sandbox experience where they can design the game, and the SDK will also have guardrails to ensure the generative AI system stays within boundaries.
 
MLC is currently working on its first game, a collectible card game, to test out its SDK.
 
The company is the first spin-off from INSAIT, an AI-centric tech institute, and has received funding from Fly Ventures, System.One, and Amar Shah.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all !
 Reading through articles online and reading through sub reddit I have seen some people use LLMs (mainly through openAI) for nlp specific tasks (NER, Text classification, etc.). I was a bit surprised as smaller (~100 million) size models already like RoBERTa exist for such cases.
 Not much content online about this beside this recent paper : https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.10092.pdf
 Highly recommend reading it, here are a few take aways:
  
Most LLM benchmarks today focus on capabilities like understanding, reasoning and Q&A. They often overlook performance on specific nlp tasks like text classification, NER, etc.
 Llama 2 (70b) required fine-tuning to beat GPT 3.5 in some tasks. Both were still overall outperformed by RoBERTa.
 In certain cases GPT4 did better. However smaller open models provide more advantages in terms of speed, cost and transparency.
 The difference of speed/latency (often more important than accuracy in production) and the cost differences between LLMs and "Smaller" models is mind blowing in my view (see screenshots)
  
​
 Cost, speed and throughput comparaison
 How good the models do on various tasks/datasets
 Note: Not saying benchmarks are a source of truth, just found the analysis interesting, always take benchmarks with a grain of salt. 
 If you're using LLMs for anything else beside text generation, I'm curious to know more about your experience so far :) cheers!

A short while ago I was laid off for reasons unrelated to AI. The way I see it, this is an excellent opportunity to make a career pivot. I have an intermediate understanding of JavaScript, React, Node and Linux. I have a good understanding of other technologies and languages too but specialize in web-dev. not saying web-dev will be done by AI but my very specialized niche will be gone way before I am ready to retire.
  
 Can anyone recommend any good online courses? If you could even recommend a good article or two? I really don't know where to start. There are so many different buzz words floating around right now and it feels like it would be easy to waste a bunch of time learning AI related stuff that is outdated or leading to a deadend.

I would like to optimize the parameters by comparing the output with the real measurements using ML methods such as stochastic gradient descent.
 ​
 Question: Is there any possible way to use white box optimizers to optimize the parameters of my C-model without adapting the model itself? Is there a framework that I could use?
 ​
 What I tried: I tried using frameworks such as tensorflow or pytorch and tried to include the compiled C-model in Python. However, gradient tracking does not work when using C functions. I tried doing the optimization in C++ by using libtorch. I realized that for gradient tracking it is essential to only use torch methods. I cannot adapt the C functions to torch functions. I don't want to use black box optimizers since they require good knowledge of the parameters that I will not have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey fellow Redditors,
 I've been wondering about a question lately about the inner workings of large language models like GPT-3.5 and I'm hoping some of you knowledgeable folks can shed some light on this. My curiosity centers around how these models manage to perform translation tasks as an emergent property of next token prediction.
 So, here's my question: Does the training data for models like GPT-3.5 contain text explicitly linking between languages, such as a dictionary, or do they learn translation by assigning similarity between words in different languages based on mathematical metrics like cosine distance?So in that sense, being indepedently trained on several textbooks of different languages (not on the same topic), they would be able to link languages simply by their arithmetic properties? I hope that's making sense.
 For instance, if you look at words like "queen" in English and "rainha" in Portuguese, they share a certain similarity that could be quantified using mathematical similarity metrics. I'm wondering if through this similar vector assignment, the models learn what means what.
 I'm more leaning towards the latter, but I'm too lazy to pursue this empirically.As a follow up question, does this mean that if we are able to predict whale conversation, we would be able to translate it to English as well?
 Thanks in advance for any input you can provide! 🤓

 I have data with time stamp and rewards from several models for each agent. My question is how do we establish baseline behaviour of agents?
 Does each row in weights and bias considered as a separate agent?
 Are the initial few 100’s of rewards according to timestamp be considered as baseline behaviour? Thankful in advance.

However, I've encountered some issues. After adding the discriminator network, the discriminator's loss function stabilizes at around 0.3, and I'm unsure if this value is too high. Additionally, it is strange that the value loss of my value network can reach values between 80 and 90. I want to know if anyone else has experienced a similar situation and what might be the reasons behind these issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent survey by GitLab reveals a growing trend among organizations implementing AI in their software development processes, deeming it essential to stay competitive.
 To stay on top of the latest advancements in AI, look here first.
 GitLab Survey
 AI becomes crucial for software development
  
GitLab's report reveals that most respondents (83%) consider AI essential for their software development, regardless of their position, job level, or years of experience.
 Most organizations have deemed AI adoption successful, with 90% stating confidence in using AI tools daily.
  
Areas of AI application and concerns about its integration
  
AI's application in software development extends beyond simply generating codes, focusing more on natural language chatbots, automated test generation, and tracking machine learning model experiments.
 However, despite the growing adoption, concerns about AI-generated codes lacking copyright protection (48%) and potentially introducing vulnerabilities (39%) are rising.
 The rising fear of AI replacing existing roles is evident, with 57% predicting that their jobs might be threatened within five years.
  
The need for training and the real-world implications of AI integration
  
As AI permeates workplaces, nearly 81% believe they require more training.
 Interestingly, those with more AI experience were less likely to link it with productivity gains and faster cycle times, highlighting the importance of human verification in AI-generated codes for ensuring error-free, secure, and copyright-compliant production.

 I’m an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer. I want to be a practitioner. Building, deploying, and evaluating models to solve problems.
 Ideally I want to land a job in Tech as an MLE. I struggle at times to stay committed to building side projects, studying ML algos, etc.
 I have a background in hardware specific C++ SWE stuff for 3.5 yrs, but not much in the way of ML and web backend. I do have a decent amount of python coding from other experiences and it’s my preferred language.
 Would anyone be interested in forming a discord to talk about what we are doing to prepare, practice interview each other, stay accountable to each other, etc?
 Had a few people show interest in r/ArtificialInteligence already
 If so comment below! Let’s do this!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Insilico Medicine, an AI-driven biotech company, has announced its AI-designed COVID-19 drug is entering Phase I clinical trials. Promising to deliver lasting results against all variants, this could become the first viable alternative to Paxlovid.
 To stay on top of such cutting-edge advancements in AI, look here first.
 Insilico's breakthrough medicine, ISM3312
  
Generated using Artificial Intelligence, ISM3312 may offer the superior solution to the constraints of current oral medication, Paxlovid.
 Insilico’s new drug could address the limitations of Paxlovid, including unpleasant side effects and drug resistance due to constant COVID mutation.
 Preclinical studies reveal the drug’s potential in reducing the viral load in lung tissue and mitigating lung inflammation.
  
Development powered by AI
  
Identified via AI-driven platform PandaOmics, the drug effectively targets crucial proteins in the coronavirus.
 Using Chemistry42, a generative chemistry platform, Insilico generated new molecules built to suppress this protein, creating ISM3312.
 Given the success, the company patented ISM3312, which is currently undergoing Phase I Clinical trials, with results expected by end 2023.
  
The Implications
  
Dr. Harvey Castro, an emergency medicine physician, encourages doctors to remain cautious but also recognizes the promise of AI-generated drugs like ISM3312.
 With the trials in progress, the medical community is closely monitoring it as it could redefine the treatment course for COVID and other similar viruses.
 Insilico's venture exhibits AI's potential in accelerating effective drug discovery, prompting the need for consistent tracking of AI's transformation of healthcare and other fields.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! Last year we launched a tool to make it easier to deploy ML models into production behind REST APIs.
 Our first prototype was focused on small models built with Scikit-Learn and XGBoost, but pretty quickly we got a lot of requests to support bigger, more complex models built on Tensorflow, Pytorch and Transformers.
 From detecting model dependencies to building out auto-scaling compute, it's been a lot of fun working through the challenges to make this product scale.
 We've built a few tutorials to showcase deploying some interesting and complex models to REST Endpoints. The latest one we released is a tutorial showing how to deploy a Grounding DINO model to a Rest API Endpoint for open-set object detection with prompts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I know that embeddings work by finding words that are used in similar contexts or found around some input word. This allows us to find similar words based on proximity to other words and in a way, map a relationship between an input word and other words.
 But I assume children learn what words mean and the intuition behind them, by hearing the word and associating it with visuals or a specific scenario in front of them which helps them to add context to that word and how it is used.
 If we were to emulate how children learn words, could we or is there an architecture that allows us to take an input word, find images with the input word in there (Object detection) and then extract the context from the images (other objects and their position and relation to the input word) then convert that context to phrases and query those phrases the next time that a word is inputted to see other phrases or words that are similar to the input word based on whether or not they appear in the images of the input word.
 Not sure if it makes sense or if it is even useful compared to embeddings but I was thinking about how we could emulate how children learn words to see if we could draw influence from that. Just wondering if there’s a similar approach to this where we use context from images to find similar words and phrases to some input.

Usually my first thought when I try to augment my ML models is input data preprocessing. In case of NER stop word removal and removal of punctuation, numbers and one-character words came to mind - they are hardly ever named entities so I woulndt loose many training examples. However, NER does in fact require context to work, so removing stuff could prove harmfull in the end? I am kind of torn. Should I do it? Are there better data augmentation approaches? I would be really thankfull for any kind of hint

With multi-modal pre-training, we can directly query the image content based on a set of questions of interest and the model will be able to answer these questions. This enables users to chat with the image to confirm if it contains any inappropriate content that violates the organization’s policies. We use the powerful generating capability of LLMs to generate the final decision including safe/unsafe labels and category type. In addition, by designing a prompt, we can make an LLM generate the defined output format, such as JSON format. The designed prompt template allows the LLM to determine if the image violates the moderation policy, identify the category of violation, explain why, and provide the output in a structured JSON format.]]></summary>

 This is the first time that I post here and I desperately need your help. I need to perform anomaly detection on a huge network traffic dataset with isolation forest (unsupervised learning). I have the .pcap files of a whole month and and for each day there are multiple devices that communicated each other. So the file of each day is from 700 MB to 2 or 3 GB.
 My initial idea was to only maintain the header of the packets and to discard the data payload. But even in this case the dataset remains huge and the number of entries is crazy.
 What I should do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 I am training an agent via PPO. The environment is a node removal ('n' number of actions which are nodes on the graph) with evaluation after each node removed. the state is represented by a trained graph attention network in the environment with the average of the node embeddings on the graph representing the state of dimension size 'n'. The embedding of the a node that has been removed is subtracted from overall graph embedding representation to represent the 'removal' of that node. 
 However, I want to absolutely be certain, that given a state representation, in a new unseen graph, the agent will not select a node that is absent from that graph. In the event that the state representation may not be granular enough and might cause the agent to think that a node on the graph is present when it is not, are there ways to mitigate this? Two ideas I have are:
  
mask actions for nodes that are not present (this is already done after node removal to prevent the agent from selecting the same node again), but is this valid to do in an unseen graph if I a priori mask nodes that are not present in the action space
 Inject a second input to the policy network such as a one-hot encoding of nodes that have already been selected as an input in addition to the state representation of the graph, so that it models finer dependencies between the state and action taken. However is this valid? 
  
Any thoughts are appreciated! thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been running hyperparameter optimization for an LGBM multi-classifier model with randomized search with 10fold stratified cv as well as oversampling on each fold using SMOTE as follows:
 # Create a pipeline with SMOTE oversampling smote_pipeline = make_pipeline(SMOTE(random_state=42), lgbm_clf) # Initialize 10-fold stratified cross-validation cv = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=10, shuffle=True, random_state=42) # Initialize RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning using the pipeline random_search = RandomizedSearchCV( estimator=smote_pipeline, param_distributions=param_dist_with_prefix, n_iter=n_iter, scoring=f1_macro_scorer, n_jobs=n_cores, pre_dispatch=n_cores, cv=cv, random_state=42 
 I wanted do incorporate early stopping based on the validation set from the nth iteration of cv. However this does not seem possible using the current API if I am correct.
 If I wanted to use a predefined validation set the code would be sth like this but I want to perform validation using 10 fold-cv validation set only:.
 mode l= lgb.LGBMClassifier() clf = RandomizedSearchCV( model, parameters, fit_params={ 'early_stopping_rounds':20, 'eval_set':[(X,y)] }, cv=cv ) 
 My questions are:
 1- Does it make sense to use early stopping during randomized search?
 2- Do you know a way I could do it?
 3- If not, is it a good idea to use randomized search without early stopping and train a new model with early stopping using the best parameters resulting from randomized search?
 Bonus Question: Does it make sense to run randomized search with f1_macro scoring from sklearn instead of multilogloss in case of imbalanced classes?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am currently working on predicting 2D deformations of objects. These objects are available as 2D contours in my code. I am splitting these contours into 1000 points with an equal distance in the direction of the x axis. I have about 70 data entries. 
 The following picture shows one of these objects:
 Comparison before and after
 The red data series contains the points before and the blue series contains the points after the deformation.
 My model should take in a series of coordinates before the deformation. Using this information the model should predict the coordinates after the deformation. 
 I have tried using the LSTM Model from keras. Unfortunately I wasn't able to produce useful results. The way I structured my data is the following:
 [
 [
 [x1, y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], ... 1000 coordinate pairs
 ], [
 [x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...
 ],
 .... 70 entries
 ] 
 The structure for the input and the output series is the same. 
 When trying to train the model I have a very low loss and low validation loss as well:
 Overview during training of model
 The test loss is also quite similar:
 Overview test loss
 However when looking into the predictions I get results like these:
 Visualized prediction after training
 The prediction is not close to what it should be like. Also the prediction seems to not change even when changing the input. 
 ​
 Do you have an idea about why my ML model does not work? Are there examples on this topic available? Should I change my approach in any way?
 Thank you in advance! Any help is appreciated!
 ​
 If you need my jupyter-notebook, it would be great if somebody could tell me, how to link files on Reddit :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks! I wanted to advertise Equinox -- my now-surprisingly-popular ( :D ) JAX library for numerical models. These days that often means "neural networks", but I like to emphasise that this also includes ODEs/SDEs/linear solves, etc.
 Here's the GitHub link: https://github.com/patrick-kidger/equinox
 For those already using JAX, then Equinox is interesting because (a) it ships with a NN library, and (b) this is built around the idea that "everything is a pytree", which makes things easy to reason about and easy to compose. Furthermore (c) Equinox offers advanced tools like true runtime errors, out-of-place pytree surgery, and checkpointed while loops, and AFAIK in the JAX ecosystem these are unique to Equinox.
 For those most familiar with PyTorch: for many use cases (sciML in particular), JAX has a much stronger compiler, more advanced autodiff, etc. And whilst JAX itself is akin to the torch.* namespace, libraries like Equinox are then akin to the torch.nn.* namespace.
 Because of its speed and features, right now JAX+Equinox is my favourite approach to numerical computing. So I'd love for some more people to try it. What do you think?

 i want to share a little side project of mine: hydralette. I mainly built this for my own work but thought why not get some feedback and potentially make someone else's work a little easier as well.
 I think we all agree that having a flexible configuration is crucial to successful ML experimentation. There are a million python config libraries out there, some dedicated to configs like hydra and others that support configs as a convenience feature like transformers.HfArgumentParser. So why did I decide to write yet another library?
 First off, I can say that I never really liked the way huggingface handles configs. All options are on a single level with tons of dependencies between them, some only taking effect if a combination of others is given. General approach to configs asid…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learning a skill, for me, was never about securing knowledge that privileged me over everyone else who did not put the work in. While often, it did feel like drinking Kool-Aid, buying in to these groups like yoga and climbing, I knew I was not there to rub elbows, but to discover the how behind it. Some leaders of some groups did create a barrier of entry, a necessary proving point, but I have always seen these loops to jump through as a challenge - once completed - a spy. Every skill you have learned has prepared you not to be better at that skill, but to learn a new skill with more ease. It is uncomfortable to learn something new, like drinking from a fire hydrant, but the more sips you take from that blasting surge of water, the more you realize it is all part of the process. We get blasted, we sip, we get overwhelmed, we come back. Just because there is a tool that regulates the blasting, that holds our hand through the overwhelm, does not mean all our hard work has been for nothing. In fact, it means we are more prepared, more primed, to receive all of the beauty and knowledge coming our way. Now, friends, we become CURATORS. :) xo

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am learning about natural language processing now. Technically, is this a way for a computer to input language of a person and then convert it into machine code (0s and 1s)? Or, is this a way to turn human language into some computer language like Python, and then turn into machine code as a second step?
 I am assuming that NLP has only just recently become widely used (like in Chat GPT). Was it a huge jump to go from a machine understanding a computer programming language like Python to a machine understanding ordinary human language? Why was it so much more difficult to train computers to understand the later?
 Thanks!

 Code: https://zenodo.org/record/8037309
 Abstract:
  
Neuromodulators in the brain act globally at many forms of synaptic plasticity, represented as metaplasticity, which is rarely considered by existing spiking (SNNs) and nonspiking artificial neural networks (ANNs). Here, we report an efficient brain-inspired computing algorithm for SNNs and ANNs, referred to here as neuromodulation-assisted credit assignment (NACA), which uses expectation signals to induce defined levels of neuromodulators to selective synapses, whereby the long-term synaptic potentiation and depression are modified in a nonlinear manner depending on the neuromodulator level. The NACA algorithm achieved high recognition accuracy with substantially reduced computational cost in learning spatial and temporal classification tasks. Notably, NACA was also verified as efficient for learning five different class continuous learning tasks with varying degrees of complexity, exhibiting a markedly mitigated catastrophic forgetting at low computational cost. Mapping synaptic weight changes showed that these benefits could be explained by the sparse and targeted synaptic modifications attributed to expectation-based global neuromodulation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many natural language processing tasks benefit from long inputs, but processing long documents with Transformers is expensive -- not only due to quadratic attention complexity but also from applying feedforward and projection layers to every token. However, not all tokens are equally important, especially for longer documents. 
 CoLT5, a long-input Transformer model that builds on this intuition by employing conditional computation, devoting more resources to important tokens in both feedforward and attention layers. CoLT5 can effectively and tractably make use of extremely long inputs, showing strong gains up to 64k input length.
 In this video, we walk through the ColT5 paper and explain what is T5, longT5, UL2 and PEGASUS, then discuss how ColT5 has advantage over previous methods for few-shot and 1-shot tasks.

 Abstract:
  
Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) have been shown to effectively encode positional information in transformer-based language models. However, these models fail to generalize past the sequence length they were trained on. We present YaRN (Yet another RoPE extensioN method), a compute-efficient method to extend the context window of such models, requiring 10x less tokens and 2.5x less training steps than previous methods. Using YaRN, we show that LLaMA models can effectively utilize and extrapolate to context lengths much longer than their original pre-training would allow, while also surpassing previous the state-of-the-art at context window extension. In addition, we demonstrate that YaRN exhibits the capability to extrapolate beyond the limited context of a fine-tuning dataset. We publish the checkpoints of Llama 2 7B/13B fine-tuned using YaRN with 64k and 128k context windows at https://github.com/jquesnelle/yarn .

 What is your experience regarding image sequences from videos in the training datasets? 
 My intuition is, that the added information to the dataset from one video isn't proportional to the number of frames. The network probably can't learn much more from 30 frames with little variation in comparison to a single image (at least if you use augmentations). What do you think about this? Or do you even know any research in the direction of this question?

 I'm a screenwriter that's curious about ML/AI tech and its applications to my industry. I'm wondering what the current best product is for writers and editors. Specifically, I'm curious if there's a product that can "edit" longform text - say, to trim a screenplay down from 140 pages to 120, while retaining style, plot, and narrative intent. Are there any products like that? Forgive me if this is too basic; I've only dabbled in ChatGPT and MidJourney to see what the fuss is about. Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My question is more focused on the pre-processing side, rather than the training side of things.
 I have a local RAG Q&A pipeline set up for personal documents (local regulations, technical manuals, stuff like that), and I'm looking for ways to improve it. 
 All the documents I'm working with are consistently structured, with nested bullets of varying depth making up most of the structure. So far I've been manually writing/tweaking a python script I wrote to recursively extract the nested bullets and duplicate their hierarchy parents' content for each of the inner-most bullets, that way each bullet has all the contextual content it needs to be valuable in a vacuum. 
 So something like: (a) 1. A. B.
 Would turn into: (a) + 1. + A. (a) + 1. + B.
 This works well in the sense that my LLM does a wonderful job answering my questions and citing the right sources, but the lion's share of my work goes into the tweaking of my parser scripts, or creating new ones entirely. I've played around with semantic segmentation via embedding models, but it doesn't really work here since I'm trying to retain the nested structure of the document for citation accuracy.
 Does anyone have any ideas for ots solutions that address this kind of thing? I can't be the only person who has run into this type of problem, but I've been having a really hard time finding relevant libraries/software that can even get me 80% of the way there.
 Also, I'm totally happy to hear what you guys have done and how's it's worked out/what walls you've hit!
 Edit: I suppose I should have included my current attempt as well, so it's doesn't look like I'm treating this subreddit like Google lol

 I have questions about data contracts!
 Schema evolution, where the schema of the destination evolves based on incoming data is nice for ingesting transactional data.
 However, there are scenarios where we might not want this automatic evolution. For example, when other parts of our infrastructure require a fixed schema or when we want to store only data that conforms to the current schema. This is where a data contract comes into play.
 Our plan is to implement a straightforward version of this concept initially. We're considering introducing settings on the pipeline to control schema evolution, and here are some modes we're thinking about:

 Struggling to strip unhelpful prefixes (such as "Sure! " or "I am just a language model!")?
 Having to wait on retries in cases of unexpected outputs?
 Getting random responses on the same query?
 Need a "quick and dirty" text classifier? Don't have enough training data?

 The short of the paper is they show that an AI algorithm that can only learn via sampling from human action is unable to tractably simulate human behavior.

 ​
 1 - It only seems to apply for AIs trained to mimic humans via sampling human behavior: 
 The paper assumes the AI is trained via an arbitrary machine learning algo M that samples from possible human behaviors in given situations. This matches pretty well to how a lot of LLMs are pretrained (guess the next token), but doesn't seem to apply to any sort of reinforcement learning, since in those situations you are not training the …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This was a small project I was working upon which adds a recurrent prior to attention-based models. 
 This allows integrating an adaptive-computation mechanism, leading to much better length-extrapolation capabilities (compared to vanilla transformers). On some tasks, I'm able to OOD extrapolate to quite an appreciable extent!
 Its also (relatively) quite parallelizable with slightly different training regimes - thus, hopefully being scalable as well. Being lightweight, it might be useful for inferencing as it saves on memory (trading off compute instead).
 It's interesting to think that MHSA might contain an implicit inductive bias that prevents extrapolation. Replacing that with other variants helps a lot - I go in detail in the writeup!

 More specifically, if I want to replicate the paper in 3 months full time (as a student with some experience in ML), what would be the best approach to the UI part of the paper. What if deployment is a concern? I was intially thinking of simple python frameworks like PySimpleGui, or maybe something more comprehensive like PyQt.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How MoEs (sparsely gated ones) are trained appear to be rather opaque from looking at literature (e.g. GLAM and similar papers). 
 From my intuition it would make sense that it works either by:
 Each expert being trained on a subset of data (the data they are supposed to have expertise in) to predict a token given a previous token, or to predict a token given a contextual embedding. This would mean the expert MLPs are frozen, and the only thing concerning the experts that we train with the transformer is the gating mechanism. 
 or
 The experts are trained in the same training loop as the transformer (e.g. backprop over the whole network), but that each of the experts are only trained on a subset of the data corresponding to their expertise (e.g. as we perform the training loop and we run upon data from our math dataset, then we backprop through the math expert mlp)

 Could anyone help me resolve my confusion and point me in the right direction for how these are trained? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scammers are now using AI to create realistic voice deepfakes, aiming to trick people into transferring money. By mimicking real customer voices, this new type of voice fraud attempts to exploit bank security systems and deceive call center agents.
 To make sure you're updated about the latest AI trends, look here first.
 Increasing prevalence and sophistication of voice frauds
  
A rise in AI-generated voice frauds has been noted this year, with one major case featuring an investor in Florida whose voice was synthetically duplicated to deceive his bank.
 Voice authentication vendor Nuance detected its first successful deepfake attack on a financial services client late last year.
 These scams are facilitated by the wide availability of voice samples online, coupled with the growth of AI capabilities and hackers' access to stolen bank account details.
  
Defending against evolving AI threats
  
Currently, only a small percentage of fraud calls to large financial companies are AI-generated. Most attacks have targeted credit card service call centers.
 Fraudsters are advancing their techniques, now able to convert speech to a specific target's voice in real-time using advanced AI systems like Microsoft's VALL-E.
 With most of these security measures focusing on call centers and automated systems, individual calls to high-ranking officials remain a vulnerability.

 In my university, there are not a lot of companies visiting for campus placement this year so I decided to go on the offcampus job hunt. I'm a final year student (in masters but bachelors was unrelated to CS) and no work experience. 
 I have further personal goals for which I'd need a steady and good income. I decided if I could get a remote job it would be really beneficial for me as my living costs would be saved and I'll be paid much more than what India offers freshers(since I'll be paid in dollars or euros). 
 However, I need advice in various domains: 1. Should I focus on one of ML/DL/ Data science or multiple ? 2. Any resources that could help me learn ? 3. Projects that help me stand out from the crowd? 4. Where can I start looking for remote work(websites, etc)? 5. Any other personal advice is appreciated!

 abstract.
 This paper investigates the rational thinking capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-round argumentative debates by exploring the impact of fallacious arguments on their logical reasoning performance. More specifically, we present Logic Competence Measurement Benchmark (LOGICOM), a diagnostic benchmark to assess the robustness of LLMs against logical fallacies. LOGICOM involves two agents: a persuader and a debater engaging in a multi-round debate on a controversial topic, where the persuader tries to convince the debater of the correctness of its claim. First, LOGICOM assesses the potential of LLMs to change their opinions through reasoning. Then, it evaluates the debater’s performance in logical reasoning by contrasting the scenario where the persuader employs logical fallacies against one where logical reasoning is used. We use this benchmark to evaluate the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 using a dataset containing controversial topics, claims, and reasons supporting them. Our findings indicate that both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can adjust their opinion through reasoning. However, when presented with logical fallacies, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are erroneously convinced 41% and 69% more often, respectively, compared to when logical reasoning is used. Finally, we introduce a new dataset containing over 5k pairs of logical vs. fallacious arguments. The source code and dataset of this work are made publicly available.
 GPT3.5 vulnerable to false information generated by itself!

 "At this step you're saying you encode responders as 1 and non-responders as 0 but you actually did it the other way around."
 "That groupby statement isn't doing what you think it's doing."
 "When you created your target variable by labeling people with this ratio >= 30%, you accidentally failed to capture a ton of actual responders, because the floating-point arithmetic used to derive this column is calculating people with actual values of 0.30 as 0.2999999999999998."

 DINOv2 for advanced visual tasks
  
Meta has made the powerful DINOv2 model available under the Apache 2.0 license, employing self-supervised learning to enhance image segmentation and depth estimation.
 This broader use model encourages further innovation and practical application in the computer vision community, driving progress in the AI industry.
  
FACET for enhanced AI fairness
  
Given the inherent difficulty and risks in ensuring fairness in computer vision, Meta introduced FACET.
 FACET has been developed to benchmark fairness across computer vision models performing tasks such as detection or classification, considering a wide array of demographic attributes.
 This revolutionary tool enables a better understanding of potential biases in AI models, helping to address fairness and robustness concerns.
  
Wider implications
  
Preliminary studies indicate performance disparities across some demographic groups within computer vision models. FACET allows researchers to track these divergences and monitor the implementation of corrective measures.
 Meta actively encourages researchers to use FACET for fairness benchmarking in other visual/multimodal tasks. For instance, the DINOv2 model's performance was analyzed with FACET — facilitating insights into potential biases.

 I will provide you with link to github code so you can see both input dataset, how my onehot encoding and decoding works and implementation of VAE, with current reconstruction_loss and kl_loss fuctions that make my loss function.
 dataset - amp.csv
 onehotencoding -- tools.py
 main code -- VAE-onehot-testing.ipynb
 https://github.com/aronta/Master-thesis-Generating-de-novo-peptides-using-variational-autoencoder-model/blob/main/VAE-onehot-testing.ipynb
 Firstly, just to explain dataset. I have sequences of peptides represented with onehot encoded sequences which I am using as input for my model. Current VAE model, both encoder and deocder are based on LSTM layer as a main way for this VAE to learn connections between inputed sequences and to make sense of it all.
 Main Issue
 Issue is that the latent space im getting doesn't look good no matter what i do. (pictures of plots are on link). So i have tried scalling kl loss (and also warming it up -- because many papers say its a good way) but it doesn't change the end result. Maybe there is problem in the implementation of the VAE, i am realy not sure.
 The main goal would be (like in all VAE implementations) generating new sequences from latent spaces that make sense, opposed to the current outputs that im getting.
 My guess
 There is a problem with optimizing loss function, but i could be completely wrong (maybe the model is wrong for the input I have, or onehotencoding isn't even a good way to represent data entering LSTM layer).

 Now I'm confused what to continue with, should I do both or do it one by One. I'm a recent graduate so need a job ASAP but I can give maximum time of the day to study. Please can someone give some advice so I can make my decision, as I'm unable to leave either

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, I'm trying to compute the percentage of each language appearing in a document. My current use cases including two known languages and a set of documents which have the two languages mixed in (code switching, due to translation error). I'm training an ML model to make the output monolingual (leaned towards a designated language), so I need a reliable measure to estimate whether the ML model is making progress or not. Currently, I use lingua with the `compute_language_confidence_values()` function but the prediction is quite poor.
 For example, given a piece of text in Japanese and English:
 from lingua import Language, LanguageDetectorBuilder languages = [Language.ENGLISH, Language.JAPANESE] detector = LanguageDetectorBuilder.from_languages(*languages).build() detector.compute_language_confidence_values("わかりません hey do you understand me hey oh really") >>> [ConfidenceValue(language=Language.ENGLISH, value=1.0), ConfidenceValue(language=Language.JAPANESE, value=0.0)] 
 So it's not quite correct (should be 0.8-0.2 or something similar), does anyone have any advice ? Or are there better softwares out there ?

 Comgra (computation graph analysis) is a library you can use with pytorch to extract all the tensor data you care about and visualize it graphically in a browser.
 This allows for a much more detailed analysis of what is happening than the usual approach of using tensorboard. You can go investigate tensors as training proceeds, drill down into individual neurons, inspect single data sets that are of special interest to you, track gradients, compare statistics between different training runs, and more.
 This tool has saved me a ton of time in my research by letting me check my hypotheses much more quickly than normal and by helping me understand how the different parts of my network really interact.
 I hope this tool can save other people just as much time as it did me. I'm also open for suggestions on how to improve it further: Since I'm already gathering and visualizing a lot of network information, adding more automated analysis would not be much extra work.

 ReST uses a bootsrap-like method to produce its own extended dataset and trains on ever higher-quality subsets of it to improve its own reward. The method allows for re-using the same generated data multiple times and thus has an efficiency advantage with respect to Online RL techniques like PPO.
 ​
 Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08998
 ​
 Abstract:
 Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) can improve the quality of large language model's (LLM) outputs by aligning them with human preferences. We propose a simple algorithm for aligning LLMs with human preferences inspired by growing batch reinforcement learning (RL), which we call Reinforced Self-Training (ReST). Given an initial LLM policy, ReST produces a dataset by generating samples from the policy, which are then used to improve the LLM policy using offline RL algorithms. ReST is more efficient than typical online RLHF methods because the training dataset is produced offline, which allows data reuse. While ReST is a general approach applicable to all generative learning settings, we focus on its application to machine translation. Our results show that ReST can substantially improve translation quality, as measured by automated metrics and human evaluation on machine translation benchmarks in a compute and sample-efficient manner.

I am trying to understand how this would play out with GAN's, I know that in general training is generally unstable and there are a lot of issues such as memorization and mode collapse under this regime, but I am looking for a theoretical result, for instance we know that GAN's converge under ideal conditions and we also know that MAML converges, can we make any comments on the convergence properties of GAN's when trained using MAML, ideally a neat trick to know if they will converge based on what we already know? The proof for MAML convergence is fairly complicated and I expect that a proof that has additional second order gradient terms and feedback loops will probably involve a lot of work and I am wondering if anyone could provide some sort of insight or intuition as to what such a result would look like?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Problem: Given time series data of the last few years, one data point per day (eg price of a product or sales made this day). My job is to predict the next 7 days, ie. 7 scalars. 
 Approach: Train one model for each time lag. The first model predicts tomorrow, the second model the day after tomorrow and so on (7 models in total). The features are the last prices of the last 7 days and some saisonal features (calendar week, price on this day last year and so on). 
 Question: is there anything wrong with this approach? It doesn’t feel like the most elegant method to train 7 separate models. The problem with using a single model is, that this model must be able to predict 7 values of different points in time (and i don’t want to give the model input data of 7 days and let it predict all 7 scalars at once. The model should only use the features of a single day to predict this day). The 2 other to options I have considered are to train an autoregressive model (model just learns to predict the next day. To predict the day after tomorrow you give it its own prediction as input). Or to build a „time-lag“ feature, which tells the model how far in the future this datapoint lies. But this doesn’t make sense, because there is nothing like a weekly trend or so. 
 What do you think? The autoregressive approach is elegant, but its implementation and maintenance is complex.

 **Correct me if I misunderstand in any.
 From my understanding, Model-Free RL (MFRL) is generally used for control tasks where environment is not accessible. It takes a sample of an experience from the environment and uses it to adjust its policy, either policy-based, value-based, and actor-critic. Model-Based RL (MBRL) uses a transition model to optimize the optimal policy like in model predictive control (MPC).
 I am interested in using RL for control multiple and continuous actions in continuous stochastic environment. For now, I am moving around DDPG. Do you have any suggested algorithm that match to my task?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In videos like this, it talks about how you need to find the right fit for your data which is shown on a scatter plot. I understand how this works when you have a dataset for something but how does it work when you are trying to train a DQN to play snake (eating apples and getting longer game). I have been struggling to tune my hyperparameters as well as figure out how many hidden neurons and hidden layers I need. I have found that right now 256 hidden neurons and 2 hidden layers works best. Please tell me if this topic has flown completely over my head and I am missing something. Thank you!

 I've stumbled across FinRL recently and would like to hire some help to develop some FinRL code. 
 What's the market like for RL? I know all the rage is LLM's but how different is RL and does the labour market care about the difference?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey All,
 I have to read in multiple JSON files with each one containing objects in an array.
 For each file I want to create a data frame (A matrix might also work) where the rows and columns are just integers pointing to a string. Like this
 ​
  
 - 0 1 2 
  
 0 dsad asd ad 
  1 asd asd grth 
  2 ter xc wer 
 
 ​
 Using the same JSON file I also want to process the objects inside the arrays using the dataframe (matrix) above. So the process (pipeline) would be something like:
  |==> Create Matrix =======>| JSON file =>| | ===> Use matrix to process object. |==> Individual objects ==>| 
 ​
 I have been looking through the docs but still unsure how to do this.
  
Should I use a dataframe or a spark matrix?
 How do I split the objects into parts and also generate the matrix?
 How do I combine dataframes which isn't joining?
  
Just a point in the right direction would be great. Thanks in advance for this relatively simple question.

 Can someone here please help me with this algorithm? 
 What is the “Boosting” part of the algorithm?
 To my (limited) understanding XGBoost is an ensemble learning algorithm that uses many decision trees (efficiently), where each tree tries to correct the loss of the previous one. 
 But I’m not sure how this is connected to “Boosting” and then it’s cousin “Bagging”
 Any intuition that may help me here?

 For expert insights into AI developments, look here first.
 https://preview.redd.it/mj64uof9rvlb1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=a856ce3e4b6063ebf7a585df3338142defba6323
 X's approach to AI training
  
Under the most recent privacy policy, X will harness the personal data it collects and publicly accessible information for its machine learning algorithms.
 Musk assures only publicly accessible data will be used, safeguarding private user information like DMs.
 However, with X having disbanded its press operation, more specific details about the data collected and its intended use still need to be provided.
  
Unfolding plans of Musk
  
Despite X's quiet stance on AI, Musk recently launched xAI, aspiring "to understand the true nature of the universe."
 xAI's homepage discloses plans to sync with X closely, possibly using collected user data to progress the mission.
 A competitive stance against LinkedIn suggests a possible additional motive for data collection, speculating an enhanced job and education section on X.
 Despite concerns about selling user data for revenue, concrete evidence is needed to support this argument, reflecting Twitter's previous strategy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am struggling to understand one part of the FAQ of the transformer reinforcement learning library from HuggingFace:
  
What Is the Concern with Negative KL Divergence?
 If you generate text by purely sampling from the model distribution things work fine in general. But when you use the generate method there are a few caveats because it does not always purely sample depending on the settings which can cause KL-divergence to go negative. Essentially when the active model achieves log_p_token_active < log_p_token_ref we get negative KL-div. This can happen in a several cases:
 top-k sampling: the model can smooth out the probability distribution causing the top-k tokens having a smaller probability than those of the reference model but they still are selected
 min_length: this ignores the EOS token until min_length is reached. thus the model can assign a very high log prob to the EOS token and very low prob to all others until min_length is reached
 batched generation: finished sequences in a batch are padded until all generations are finished. The model can learn to assign very low probabilities to the padding tokens unless they are properly masked or removed.These are just a few examples. Why is negative KL an issue? The total reward R is computed R = r - beta * KL so if the model can learn how to drive KL-divergence negative it effectively gets a positive reward. In many cases it can be much easier to exploit such a bug in the generation than actually learning the reward function. In addition the KL can become arbitrarily small thus the actual reward can be very small compared to it.
  
I understand why the KL-divergence that is computed here is an approximation that can be negative as opposed to the real one. However, I cannot wrap my head around the details of why these specific sampling parameters would lead to negative KL-divergence. Could someone elaborate on these points?

The edited review comment now discusses entirely different point.
 We would like to raise this concern to AC but the thing is that we didn’t save the original review comment, and the “revision history” for some reason doesn’t show the previous content, other than the entry that there was previous version. But this revision history overall isn’t inconsistent (showing the last two history after the discussion period, but the ones before the period is not shown) 
 Can reviewers delete their own revision history in OpenReview tool? I don’t know if this is a bug or they deleted them with an intention.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! I've noticed that most beginner-level tutorials on recommender systems primarily focus on model training, with limited information about deploying them in a production environment. Additionally, the different usage of models in the recall (retrieval) and ranking modules can indeed be confusing for beginners.
 Recently, I've been working on a recommender system project that encompasses both offline development and online deployment, covering both recall and ranking modules. The entire project is developed using Python and executed on a single laptop. All components are contained within Docker, ensuring no impact on the local environment. 
 The GitHub repo: https://github.com/akiragy/recsys_pipeline
 You can follow the commands provided in the README to run it. 
 This project primarily utilizes PyTorch, Redis, Elasticsearch, Feast Feature Store, Triton Inference Server, and Flask. 
 PyTorch is used for training the FM model for recall and the DeepFM model for ranking. 
 Redis serves as the store for user terms and vectors, while Elasticsearch is used to create an item term index and a vector index. Redis and Elasticsearch form the recall module. 
 Feast is utilized to store user and item features, while Triton serves as a real-time prediction engine. Feast and Triton form the ranking module. 
 Flask is deployed as the web server, receiving recommendation requests and returning responses. 
 Thanks for checking it out!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We released another preprint on a neuro-symbolic approach called "metacognitive error correction and detection rules" (EDCR). The idea is that if you have a trained neural model, you can symbolically fine tune the results with rules. In this initial study, we apply it to the classification of GPS movement traces.
 Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_OV4lap_rk
 Preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14250
 Code: https://github.com/lab-v2/Error-Detection-and-Correction
 Further information: https://neurosymbolic.asu.edu/metacognition/ 
 In the example below, we show the results for a single class. The rules detect errors by identifying classifications that may be incorrect and then re-assign to a new class. While recall can drop for a given class, we can bound the drop in recall with a hyperparameter - but this is guaranteed to improve precision. This is illustrated in the below figure. We show this approach leads to an overall improvement in accuracy over the base model, including the state-of-the-art. We also examine the effects when encountering classes not seen in the model's training data.
 We provide theoretical as well as empirical results and believe this approach can be used in other use-cases in the future.

But the probabilities are decreasing with each and every move performed and they are overfitting to one move which is an invalid move (same case for both dqn and a2c) so in the bellman equation i removed the next reward prediction and put constant value of 1 to check whether it is at least trying to increase the probability for valid moves but that doesnt seems to be the case because it is still giving probability of 1 for an invalid move. and there is also this case where the probabilities are getting so small they are becoming nan values. can someone provide some insights for me to look into

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 I'm the founder of a generative AI consultancy and we build gen AI powered products for other companies. We've been doing this for 18 months now and I thought I share our learnings - it might help others.
 ​
  
It's a never ending battle to keep up with the latest tools and developments. 
 
By the time you ship your product it's already using an outdated tech-stack. 
 
There are no best-practices yet. You need to make a bet on tools/processes and hope that things won't change much by the time you ship (they will, see point 2). 
 
If your generative AI product doesn't have a VC-backed competitor, there will be one soon. 
 
In order to win you need one of the two things: either (1) the best distribution or (2) the generative AI component is hidden in your product so others don't/can't copy you. 
 
AI researchers / data scientists are suboptimal choice for AI engineering. They're expensive, won't be able to solve most of your problems and likely want to focus on more fundamental problems rather than building products. 
 
Software engineers make the best AI engineers. They are able to solve 80% of your problems right away and they are motivated because they can "work in AI". 
 
Product designers need to get more technical, AI engineers need to get more product-oriented. The gap currently is too big and this leads to all sorts of problems during product development. 
 
Demo bias is real and it makes it 10x harder to deliver something that's in alignment with your client's expectation. Communicating this effectively is a real and underrated skill. 
 
There's no such thing as off-the-shelf AI generated content yet. Current tools are not reliable enough, they hallucinate, make up stuff and produce inconsistent results (applies to text, voice, image and video).

One of the main problems in road segmentation by using depth was that if a region is flat, such as walls, it may be detected as road. This was already a known phenomenon and to overcome this, surface normal estimation was used. But, SNE requires dense depth images. Instead, we used a multi-task architecture, and used surface normals as an auxiliary loss, which reduced computation time significantly and also we don't need a dense depth image. Only LiDAR (which is sparse in nature) is sufficient.

I have tried putting a separate decoder just for this one class but the results are worse, and I don’t really have other ideas to better my results. Do you have any ideas/techniques to help me improve my results? Thanks !

 If you want to stay on top of the latest trends and insights in AI, look here first.

 AI’s evolving role in tackling the opioid crisis
  
With a legacy of over 1 million overdose deaths since 1999, the opioid crisis has stubbornly resisted traditional preventive and regulatory measures. The latest AI-fueled developments offer newfound hope.
 Groundbreaking AI innovations are focusing on identifying individuals at potential risk, monitoring treatment progress, and predicting relapse probabilities. Decoding social media behavior offers an effective outlet for early intervention.
 More radically, AI-enabled wearable devices are being developed to detect overdose symptoms and automatically deliver lifesaving treatment.
  
AI: A double-edged sword?
  
Despite its promising potential, AI application in this sphere also raises concerns around privacy rights and misinformation. Facial recognition technology could lead to discrimination, while the risk of false data being fed into chatbots causing harm cannot be undermined.
 Trust in AI and its appropriate deployment will be crucial to ensuring its positive contribution rather than being a dystopian threat.

biomedical data. Several knowledge graph embedding algorithms have been
proposed to learn from and complete knowledge graphs. However, a recent study
demonstrates the limited efficacy of these embedding algorithms when applied to

embeddings have limitations in biomedical settings. This study aims to apply
state-of-the-art knowledge graph embedding models in the context of a recent
biomedical knowledge graph, BioKG, and evaluate their performance and potential
downstream uses. We achieve a three-fold improvement in terms of performance
based on the HITS@10 score over previous work on the same biomedical knowledge
graph. Additionally, we provide interpretable predictions through a rule-based
method. We demonstrate that knowledge graph embedding models are applicable in
practice by evaluating the best-performing model on four tasks that represent
real-life polypharmacy situations. Results suggest that knowledge learnt from
large biomedical knowledge graphs can be transferred to such downstream use
cases. Our code is available at https://github.com/aryopg/biokge.]]></summary>

broken and spotted, for the development of AI-aided automatic quality
inspection technology. For semantic segmentation, images with varying
complexity, from single sprout images to images with multiple sprouts, along
with human-labelled mask images, are included. The label has 4 different
classes: background, head, body, tail. The dataset also provides images and
masks for the image decomposition task, including two separate sprout images
and their combined form. Lastly, 5 physical features of sprouts (head length,
body length, body thickness, tail length, weight) are provided for image-based
measurement tasks. This dataset is expected to be a valuable resource for a
wide range of research and applications in the advanced analysis of images of
soybean sprouts. Also, we hope that this dataset can assist researchers

distributed learning refers to the process of training learning models on
distributed data sources. In our setting a set of agents need to cooperatively
train a learning model from streaming data. Differently from federated
learning, the proposed approach does not rely on a central server but only on
peer-to-peer communications among the agents. This approach is often used in
scenarios where data cannot be moved to a centralized location due to privacy,
security, or cost reasons. In order to overcome the absence of a central
server, we propose a distributed algorithm that relies on a quantized,
finite-time coordination protocol to aggregate the locally trained models.
Furthermore, our algorithm allows for the use of stochastic gradients during
local training. Stochastic gradients are computed using a randomly sampled
subset of the local training data, which makes the proposed algorithm more
efficient and scalable than traditional gradient descent. In our paper, we
analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of the mean distance
from the online solution. Finally, we present numerical results for a logistic
regression task.]]></summary>

applications require decomposing such structures for further processing in
computer graphics. In the last decade, several methods were proposed to tackle
this problem, at the cost of intensive computational times. Recently, machine
learning has proven to be effective for the segmentation task on 3D structures.
Nevertheless, these state-of-the-art methods are often hardly generalizable and
require dividing the learned model into several specific classes of objects to
avoid overfitting. We present a data-driven approach leveraging deep learning
to encode a mapping function prior to mesh segmentation for multiple
applications. Our network reproduces a neighborhood map using our knowledge of
the \textsl{Shape Diameter Function} (SDF) method using similarities among
vertex neighborhoods. Our approach is resolution-agnostic as we downsample the
input meshes and query the full-resolution structure solely for neighborhood
contributions. Using our predicted SDF values, we can inject the resulting
structure into a graph-cut algorithm to generate an efficient and robust mesh
segmentation while considerably reducing the required computation times.]]></summary>

learn better policies than the behavior policy used for data collection. In
contrast to behavior cloning, which assumes the data is collected from expert
demonstrations, offline RL can work with non-expert data and multimodal
behavior policies. However, offline RL algorithms face challenges in handling
distribution shifts and effectively representing policies due to the lack of
online interaction during training. Prior work on offline RL uses conditional
diffusion models to represent multimodal behavior in the dataset. Nevertheless,
these methods are not tailored toward alleviating the out-of-distribution state
generalization. We introduce a novel method, named State Reconstruction for
Diffusion Policies (SRDP), incorporating state reconstruction feature learning
in the recent class of diffusion policies to address the out-of-distribution
generalization problem. State reconstruction loss promotes more descriptive
representation learning of states to alleviate the distribution shift incurred
by the out-of-distribution (OOD) states. We design a novel 2D Multimodal
Contextual Bandit environment to illustrate the OOD generalization of SRDP
compared to prior algorithms. In addition, we assess the performance of our
model on D4RL continuous control benchmarks, namely the navigation of an 8-DoF
ant and forward locomotion of half-cheetah, hopper, and walker2d, achieving

leaves with unbalanced accuracy can provide misleading explanations.
Low-accuracy leaves give less valid explanations, which could be interpreted as
unfairness among explanations. Here, we train a shallow tree with the objective
of minimizing the maximum misclassification error across each leaf node. Then,
we extend each leaf with a separate tree-based model. The shallow tree provides
a global explanation, while the overall statistical performance of the shallow

annotation process. Hence, training a deep-learning model with only raw data
can easily lead to overfitting. One solution to this problem is to augment the
raw data with various transformations, improving the model's ability to
generalize to new data. However, manually configuring a generic augmentation
combination and parameters for different datasets is non-trivial due to
inconsistent acquisition approaches and data distributions. Therefore,
automatic data augmentation is proposed to learn favorable augmentation
strategies for different datasets while incurring large GPU overhead. To this
end, we present a novel method, called Dynamic Data Augmentation (DDAug), which
is efficient and has negligible computation cost. Our DDAug develops a
hierarchical tree structure to represent various augmentations and utilizes an
efficient Monte-Carlo tree searching algorithm to update, prune, and sample the
tree. As a result, the augmentation pipeline can be optimized for each dataset
automatically. Experiments on multiple Prostate MRI datasets show that our

mainly focused on the SSVD(sparse SVD) method and tried a new sparse penalty

sparsity. Then in the simulation study, we tried different types of generated

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising research direction for
building power-efficient information processing systems, especially for
temporal tasks such as speech recognition. In SNNs, delays refer to the time
needed for one spike to travel from one neuron to another. These delays matter
because they influence the spike arrival times, and it is well-known that
spiking neurons respond more strongly to coincident input spikes. More
formally, it has been shown theoretically that plastic delays greatly increase
the expressivity in SNNs. Yet, efficient algorithms to learn these delays have
been lacking. Here, we propose a new discrete-time algorithm that addresses
this issue in deep feedforward SNNs using backpropagation, in an offline
manner. To simulate delays between consecutive layers, we use 1D convolutions
across time. The kernels contain only a few non-zero weights - one per synapse
- whose positions correspond to the delays. These positions are learned
together with the weights using the recently proposed Dilated Convolution with
Learnable Spacings (DCLS). We evaluated our method on three datasets: the
Spiking Heidelberg Dataset (SHD), the Spiking Speech Commands (SSC) and its
non-spiking version Google Speech Commands v0.02 (GSC) benchmarks, which
require detecting temporal patterns. We used feedforward SNNs with two or three
hidden fully connected layers, and vanilla leaky integrate-and fire neurons. We
showed that fixed random delays help and that learning them helps even more.
Furthermore, our method outperformed the state-of-the-art in the three datasets
without using recurrent connections and with substantially fewer parameters.
Our work demonstrates the potential of delay learning in developing accurate
and precise models for temporal data processing. Our code is based on PyTorch /
SpikingJelly and available at: https://github.com/Thvnvtos/SNN-delays]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Medical applications of machine learning (ML) have experienced a surge in
popularity in recent years. The intensive care unit (ICU) is a natural habitat
for ML given the abundance of available data from electronic health records.
Models have been proposed to address numerous ICU prediction tasks like the
early detection of complications. While authors frequently report
state-of-the-art performance, it is challenging to verify claims of
superiority. Datasets and code are not always published, and cohort
definitions, preprocessing pipelines, and training setups are difficult to
reproduce. This work introduces Yet Another ICU Benchmark (YAIB), a modular
framework that allows researchers to define reproducible and comparable
clinical ML experiments; we offer an end-to-end solution from cohort definition
to model evaluation. The framework natively supports most open-access ICU
datasets (MIMIC III/IV, eICU, HiRID, AUMCdb) and is easily adaptable to future
ICU datasets. Combined with a transparent preprocessing pipeline and extensible
training code for multiple ML and deep learning models, YAIB enables unified
model development. Our benchmark comes with five predefined established
prediction tasks (mortality, acute kidney injury, sepsis, kidney function, and
length of stay) developed in collaboration with clinicians. Adding further
tasks is straightforward by design. Using YAIB, we demonstrate that the choice
of dataset, cohort definition, and preprocessing have a major impact on the
prediction performance - often more so than model class - indicating an urgent
need for YAIB as a holistic benchmarking tool. We provide our work to the
clinical ML community to accelerate method development and enable real-world
clinical implementations. Software Repository:

organs, vessels) and 3D surgical instrument models. Prior to the deep learning
era, the broad application of statistical shape models (SSMs) in medical image
analysis is evidence that shapes have been commonly used to describe medical
data. Nowadays, however, state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning algorithms in
medical imaging are predominantly voxel-based. In computer vision, on the
contrary, shapes (including, voxel occupancy grids, meshes, point clouds and
implicit surface models) are preferred data representations in 3D, as seen from
the numerous shape-related publications in premier vision conferences, such as
the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), as
well as the increasing popularity of ShapeNet (about 51,300 models) and
Princeton ModelNet (127,915 models) in computer vision research. MedShapeNet is
created as an alternative to these commonly used shape benchmarks to facilitate
the translation of data-driven vision algorithms to medical applications, and
it extends the opportunities to adapt SOTA vision algorithms to solve critical
medical problems. Besides, the majority of the medical shapes in MedShapeNet
are modeled directly on the imaging data of real patients, and therefore it
complements well existing shape benchmarks comprising of computer-aided design
(CAD) models. MedShapeNet currently includes more than 100,000 medical shapes,
and provides annotations in the form of paired data. It is therefore also a
freely available repository of 3D models for extended reality (virtual reality
- VR, augmented reality - AR, mixed reality - MR) and medical 3D printing. This
white paper describes in detail the motivations behind MedShapeNet, the shape
acquisition procedures, the use cases, as well as the usage of the online shape

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adversarial examples (AEs) for DNNs have been shown to be transferable: AEs
that successfully fool white-box surrogate models can also deceive other
black-box models with different architectures. Although a bunch of empirical
studies have provided guidance on generating highly transferable AEs, many of
these findings lack explanations and even lead to inconsistent advice. In this
paper, we take a further step towards understanding adversarial
transferability, with a particular focus on surrogate aspects. Starting from
the intriguing little robustness phenomenon, where models adversarially trained
with mildly perturbed adversarial samples can serve as better surrogates, we
attribute it to a trade-off between two predominant factors: model smoothness
and gradient similarity. Our investigations focus on their joint effects,
rather than their separate correlations with transferability. Through a series
of theoretical and empirical analyses, we conjecture that the data distribution
shift in adversarial training explains the degradation of gradient similarity.
Building on these insights, we explore the impacts of data augmentation and
gradient regularization on transferability and identify that the trade-off
generally exists in the various training mechanisms, thus building a
comprehensive blueprint for the regulation mechanism behind transferability.
Finally, we provide a general route for constructing better surrogates to boost
transferability which optimizes both model smoothness and gradient similarity
simultaneously, e.g., the combination of input gradient regularization and
sharpness-aware minimization (SAM), validated by extensive experiments. In
summary, we call for attention to the united impacts of these two factors for
launching effective transfer attacks, rather than optimizing one while ignoring
the other, and emphasize the crucial role of manipulating surrogate models.]]></summary>

transformer (CNN-Transformer) for medical image segmentation. The proposed
Hybrid Decoder, based on MaxViT-block, is designed to harness the power of both
the convolution and self-attention mechanisms at each decoding stage with a
nominal memory and computational burden. The inclusion of multi-axis
self-attention, within each decoder stage, significantly enhances the
discriminating capacity between the object and background regions, thereby
helping in improving the segmentation efficiency. In the Hybrid Decoder block,
the fusion process commences by integrating the upsampled lower-level decoder
features, obtained through transpose convolution, with the skip-connection
features derived from the hybrid encoder. Subsequently, the fused features
undergo refinement through the utilization of a multi-axis attention mechanism.
The proposed decoder block is repeated multiple times to progressively segment
the nuclei regions. Experimental results on MoNuSeg18 and MoNuSAC20 dataset
demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed technique. Our MaxViT-UNet
outperformed the previous CNN-based (UNet) and Transformer-based (Swin-UNet)

models, synthesizing a sequence of animated frames that are both photorealistic
and temporally coherent is still in its infancy. While off-the-shelf
billion-scale datasets for image generation are available, collecting similar
video data of the same scale is still challenging. Also, training a video
diffusion model is computationally much more expensive than its image
counterpart. In this work, we explore finetuning a pretrained image diffusion
model with video data as a practical solution for the video synthesis task. We
find that naively extending the image noise prior to video noise prior in video
diffusion leads to sub-optimal performance. Our carefully designed video noise
prior leads to substantially better performance. Extensive experimental
validation shows that our model, Preserve Your Own Correlation (PYoCo), attains
SOTA zero-shot text-to-video results on the UCF-101 and MSR-VTT benchmarks. It
also achieves SOTA video generation quality on the small-scale UCF-101

person's future observations based on their past labeled observations and is
typically used for sequential tasks, e.g., to predict daily mood ratings. When
making personalized predictions, a model can combine two types of trends: (a)
trends shared across people, i.e., person-generic trends, such as being happier
on weekends, and (b) unique trends for each person, i.e., person-specific
trends, such as a stressful weekly meeting. Mixed effect models are popular
statistical models to study both trends by combining person-generic and
person-specific parameters. Though linear mixed effect models are gaining
popularity in machine learning by integrating them with neural networks, these
integrations are currently limited to linear person-specific parameters: ruling
out nonlinear person-specific trends. In this paper, we propose Neural Mixed
Effect (NME) models to optimize nonlinear person-specific parameters anywhere
in a neural network in a scalable manner. NME combines the efficiency of neural
network optimization with nonlinear mixed effects modeling. Empirically, we
observe that NME improves performance across six unimodal and multimodal
datasets, including a smartphone dataset to predict daily mood and a
mother-adolescent dataset to predict affective state sequences where half the
mothers experience at least moderate symptoms of depression. Furthermore, we
evaluate NME for two model architectures, including for neural conditional
random fields (CRF) to predict affective state sequences where the CRF learns
nonlinear person-specific temporal transitions between affective states.
Analysis of these person-specific transitions on the mother-adolescent dataset
shows interpretable trends related to the mother's depression symptoms.]]></summary>

fields to group mixed numeric and categorical data. In many algorithms, a
predefined distance measurement is used to cluster data points based on their
dissimilarity. While there exist numerous distance-based measures for data with
pure numerical attributes and several ordered and unordered categorical
metrics, an efficient and accurate distance for mixed-type data that utilizes
the continuous and discrete properties simulatenously is an open problem. Many
metrics convert numerical attributes to categorical ones or vice versa. They
handle the data points as a single attribute type or calculate a distance
between each attribute separately and add them up. We propose a metric called
KDSUM that uses mixed kernels to measure dissimilarity, with cross-validated
optimal bandwidth selection. We demonstrate that KDSUM is a shrinkage method
from existing mixed-type metrics to a uniform dissimilarity metric, and
improves clustering accuracy when utilized in existing distance-based
clustering algorithms on simulated and real-world datasets containing

nonparametric modeling, they exhibit limitations in effectively capturing
abrupt changes in function smoothness and accommodating relationships with
heteroscedastic errors. Addressing these shortcomings, the heteroscedastic
Gaussian process (HeGP) regression seeks to introduce flexibility by
acknowledging the variability of residual variances across covariates in the
regression model. In this work, we extend the HeGP concept, expanding its scope
beyond regression tasks to encompass classification and state-space models. To
achieve this, we propose a novel framework where the Gaussian process is
coupled with a covariate-induced precision matrix process, adopting a mixture
formulation. This approach enables the modeling of heteroscedastic covariance
functions across covariates. To mitigate the computational challenges posed by
sampling, we employ variational inference to approximate the posterior and
facilitate posterior predictive modeling. Additionally, our training process
leverages an EM algorithm featuring closed-form M-step updates to efficiently
evaluate the heteroscedastic covariance function. A notable feature of our
model is its consistent performance on multivariate responses, accommodating
various types (continuous or categorical) seamlessly. Through a combination of
simulations and real-world applications in climatology, we illustrate the
model's prowess and advantages. By overcoming the limitations of traditional
Gaussian process models, our proposed framework offers a robust and versatile
tool for a wide array of applications.]]></summary>

surrogate maps for partial differential equation (PDE) solution operators. For
many real-world applications, which often require high-resolution data points,
training time and memory usage are significant bottlenecks. While there are
mixed-precision training techniques for standard neural networks, those work
for real-valued datatypes on finite dimensions and therefore cannot be directly
applied to FNO, which crucially operates in the (complex-valued) Fourier domain
and in function spaces. On the other hand, since the Fourier transform is
already an approximation (due to discretization error), we do not need to
perform the operation at full precision. In this work, we (i) profile memory
and runtime for FNO with full and mixed-precision training, (ii) conduct a
study on the numerical stability of mixed-precision training of FNO, and (iii)
devise a training routine which substantially decreases training time and
memory usage (up to 34%), with little or no reduction in accuracy, on the
Navier-Stokes and Darcy flow equations. Combined with the recently proposed
tensorized FNO (Kossaifi et al., 2023), the resulting model has far better
performance while also being significantly faster than the original FNO.]]></summary>

ensemble methods cannot be directly applied to improve the robustness and

without requiring further information about each model. Besides, we provide a

almost surely. Experiments on benchmarks show the superiority of pTSE overall

processing modalities separately. We compare the performance of our model to
baselines that only process individual comments and conduct extensive ablation
studies. To evaluate our work, we present a new dataset, HatefulDiscussions,

properties which allow their efficient computation. We prove that the MMD of
Riesz kernels coincides with the MMD of their sliced version. As a consequence,
the computation of gradients of MMDs can be performed in the one-dimensional
setting. Here, for $r=1$, a simple sorting algorithm can be applied to reduce
the complexity from $O(MN+N^2)$ to $O((M+N)\log(M+N))$ for two measures with
$M$ and $N$ support points. As another interesting follow-up result, the MMD of
compactly supported measures can be estimated from above and below by the
Wasserstein-1 distance. For the implementations we approximate the gradient of
the sliced MMD by using only a finite number $P$ of slices. We show that the
resulting error has complexity $O(\sqrt{d/P})$, where $d$ is the data

method establishes a new pareto frontier in model accuracy and memory footprint
demonstrating a range of quantized models, delivering best-in-class accuracy
below 4.3 MB of weights (wgts.) and activations (acts.). Our main contributions

of air traffic management (ATM) systems. Models of aircraft operated under
instrument flight rules (IFR) require capturing the variability inherent in how
aircraft follow standard flight procedures. The variability in aircraft
behavior varies among flight stages. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic
model that can learn the variability from the procedural data and flight tracks
collected from radar surveillance data. For each segment, a Gaussian mixture
model is used to learn the deviations of aircraft trajectories from their
procedures. Given new procedures, we can generate synthetic trajectories by
sampling a series of deviations from the trained Gaussian distributions and
reconstructing the aircraft trajectory using the deviations and the procedures.
We extend this method to capture pairwise correlations between aircraft and
show how a pairwise model can be used to generate traffic involving an
arbitrary number of aircraft. We demonstrate the proposed models on the arrival
tracks and procedures of the John F. Kennedy International Airport. The
distributional similarity between the original and the synthetic trajectory
dataset was evaluated using the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the empirical
distributions of different variables. We also provide qualitative analyses of
the synthetic trajectories generated from the models.]]></summary>

unfairness issues on graphs involve both attributes and topological structures.
Existing work on fair graph learning simply assumes that attributes of all
nodes are available for model training and then makes fair predictions. In
practice, however, the attributes of some nodes might not be accessible due to
missing data or privacy concerns, which makes fair graph learning even more
challenging. In this paper, we propose FairAC, a fair attribute completion
method, to complement missing information and learn fair node embeddings for
graphs with missing attributes. FairAC adopts an attention mechanism to deal
with the attribute missing problem and meanwhile, it mitigates two types of
unfairness, i.e., feature unfairness from attributes and topological unfairness
due to attribute completion. FairAC can work on various types of homogeneous
graphs and generate fair embeddings for them and thus can be applied to most
downstream tasks to improve their fairness performance. To our best knowledge,
FairAC is the first method that jointly addresses the graph attribution
completion and graph unfairness problems. Experimental results on benchmark
datasets show that our method achieves better fairness performance with less
sacrifice in accuracy, compared with the state-of-the-art methods of fair graph
learning. Code is available at: https://github.com/donglgcn/FairAC.]]></summary>

convert them into dense, grid-like input representations before using an
off-the-shelf network. However, selecting the appropriate representation for
the task traditionally requires training a neural network for each
representation and selecting the best one based on the validation score, which
is very time-consuming. This work eliminates this bottleneck by selecting
representations based on the Gromov-Wasserstein Discrepancy (GWD) between raw
events and their representation. It is about 200 times faster to compute than
training a neural network and preserves the task performance ranking of event
representations across multiple representations, network backbones, datasets,
and tasks. Thus finding representations with high task scores is equivalent to
finding representations with a low GWD. We use this insight to, for the first
time, perform a hyperparameter search on a large family of event
representations, revealing new and powerful representations that exceed the
state-of-the-art. Our optimized representations outperform existing
representations by 1.7 mAP on the 1 Mpx dataset and 0.3 mAP on the Gen1
dataset, two established object detection benchmarks, and reach a 3.8% higher
classification score on the mini N-ImageNet benchmark. Moreover, we outperform
state-of-the-art by 2.1 mAP on Gen1 and state-of-the-art feed-forward methods
by 6.0 mAP on the 1 Mpx datasets. This work opens a new unexplored field of
explicit representation optimization for event-based learning.]]></summary>

executing diverse manipulation tasks from visual observations in unstructured
real-world environments. To achieve this goal, the robot needs to have a
comprehensive understanding of the 3D structure and semantics of the scene. In
this work, we present $\textbf{GNFactor}$, a visual behavior cloning agent for
multi-task robotic manipulation with $\textbf{G}$eneralizable $\textbf{N}$eural

field (GNF) as a reconstruction module and a Perceiver Transformer as a
decision-making module, leveraging a shared deep 3D voxel representation. To
incorporate semantics in 3D, the reconstruction module utilizes a
vision-language foundation model ($\textit{e.g.}$, Stable Diffusion) to distill
rich semantic information into the deep 3D voxel. We evaluate GNFactor on 3
real robot tasks and perform detailed ablations on 10 RLBench tasks with a

GNFactor over current state-of-the-art methods in seen and unseen tasks,

involving more than two entities. In scenarios where explicit hypergraphs are
not readily available, it is desirable to infer a meaningful hypergraph
structure from the node features to capture the intrinsic relations within the
data. However, existing methods either adopt simple pre-defined rules that fail
to precisely capture the distribution of the potential hypergraph structure, or
learn a mapping between hypergraph structures and node features but require a
large amount of labelled data, i.e., pre-existing hypergraph structures, for
training. Both restrict their applications in practical scenarios. To fill this
gap, we propose a novel smoothness prior that enables us to design a method to
infer the probability for each potential hyperedge without labelled data as
supervision. The proposed prior indicates features of nodes in a hyperedge are
highly correlated by the features of the hyperedge containing them. We use this
prior to derive the relation between the hypergraph structure and the node
features via probabilistic modelling. This allows us to develop an unsupervised
inference method to estimate the probability for each potential hyperedge via
solving an optimisation problem that has an analytical solution. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our method can learn
meaningful hypergraph structures from data more efficiently than existing
hypergraph structure inference methods.]]></summary>

by obscuring their faces. These methods, however, can degrade the quality of
photos, and they usually do not preserve the utility of faces, i.e., their age,
gender, pose, and facial expression. Recently, GANs, such as StyleGAN, have
been proposed, which generate realistic, high-quality imaginary faces. In this
paper, we investigate the use of StyleGAN in generating de-identified faces
through style mixing. We examined this de-identification method for preserving
utility and privacy by implementing several face detection, verification, and
identification attacks and conducting a user study. The results from our
extensive experiments, human evaluation, and comparison with two
state-of-the-art methods, i.e., CIAGAN and DeepPrivacy, show that StyleGAN
performs on par or better than these methods, preserving users' privacy and
images' utility. In particular, the results of the machine learning-based
experiments show that StyleGAN0-4 preserves utility better than CIAGAN and
DeepPrivacy while preserving privacy at the same level. StyleGAN0-3 preserves
utility at the same level while providing more privacy. In this paper, for the
first time, we also performed a carefully designed user study to examine both
privacy and utility-preserving properties of StyleGAN0-3, 0-4, and 0-5, as well
as CIAGAN and DeepPrivacy from the human observers' perspectives. Our
statistical tests showed that participants tend to verify and identify
StyleGAN0-5 images more easily than DeepPrivacy images. All the methods but
StyleGAN0-5 had significantly lower identification rates than CIAGAN. Regarding
utility, as expected, StyleGAN0-5 performed significantly better in preserving
some attributes. Among all methods, on average, participants believe gender has

from researchers due to its wide range of applications.As conversation has a
natural graph structure,numerous approaches used to model ERC based on graph
convolutional networks (GCNs) have yielded significant results.However,the
aggregation approach of traditional GCNs suffers from the node information
redundancy problem,leading to node discriminant information
loss.Additionally,single-layer GCNs lack the capacity to capture long-range
contextual information from the graph. Furthermore,the majority of approaches
are based on textual modality or stitching together different modalities,
resulting in a weak ability to capture interactions between modalities. To
address these problems, we present the relational bilevel aggregation graph
convolutional network (RBA-GCN), which consists of three modules: the graph
generation module (GGM), similarity-based cluster building module (SCBM) and
bilevel aggregation module (BiAM). First, GGM constructs a novel graph to
reduce the redundancy of target node information.Then,SCBM calculates the node
similarity in the target node and its structural neighborhood, where noisy
information with low similarity is filtered out to preserve the discriminant
information of the node. Meanwhile, BiAM is a novel aggregation method that can
preserve the information of nodes during the aggregation process. This module
can construct the interaction between different modalities and capture
long-range contextual information based on similarity clusters. On both the
IEMOCAP and MELD datasets, the weighted average F1 score of RBA-GCN has a
2.17$\sim$5.21\% improvement over that of the most advanced method.Our code is

as surrogate models, superseding quantum-chemistry calculations in ab initio
molecular dynamics. The prevalent benchmark for NFFs has been the MD17 dataset
and its subsequent extension. These datasets predominantly comprise geometries
from the equilibrium region of the ground electronic state potential energy
surface, sampling from direct adiabatic dynamics. However, many chemical
reactions entail significant molecular deformations, notably bond breaking. We
demonstrate the constrained distribution of internal coordinates and energies
in the MD17 datasets, underscoring their inadequacy for representing systems
undergoing chemical reactions. Addressing this sampling limitation, we
introduce the xxMD (Extended Excited-state Molecular Dynamics) dataset, derived
from non-adiabatic dynamics. This dataset encompasses energies and forces
ascertained from both multireference wave function theory and density
functional theory. Furthermore, its nuclear configuration spaces authentically
depict chemical reactions, making xxMD a more chemically relevant dataset. Our
re-assessment of equivariant models on the xxMD datasets reveals notably higher
mean absolute errors than those reported for MD17 and its variants. This
observation underscores the challenges faced in crafting a generalizable NFF
model with extrapolation capability. Our proposed xxMD-CASSCF and xxMD-DFT
datasets are available at https://github.com/zpengmei/xxMD.]]></summary>

However, its limited customization options hinder users from accurately
describing desired outputs. For example, plain text makes it hard to specify
continuous quantities, such as the precise RGB color value or importance of
each word. Furthermore, creating detailed text prompts for complex scenes is
tedious for humans to write and challenging for text encoders to interpret. To
address these challenges, we propose using a rich-text editor supporting
formats such as font style, size, color, and footnote. We extract each word's
attributes from rich text to enable local style control, explicit token
reweighting, precise color rendering, and detailed region synthesis. We achieve
these capabilities through a region-based diffusion process. We first obtain
each word's region based on attention maps of a diffusion process using plain
text. For each region, we enforce its text attributes by creating
region-specific detailed prompts and applying region-specific guidance, and
maintain its fidelity against plain-text generation through region-based
injections. We present various examples of image generation from rich text and
demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines with quantitative

differential equations (PDEs), neural networks have the potential to break the
curse of dimensionality, providing approximate solutions to problems where
using classical solvers is difficult or impossible. While global minimization
of the PDE residual over the network parameters works well for boundary value
problems, catastrophic forgetting impairs the applicability of this approach to
initial value problems (IVPs). In an alternative local-in-time approach, the
optimization problem can be converted into an ordinary differential equation
(ODE) on the network parameters and the solution propagated forward in time;
however, we demonstrate that current methods based on this approach suffer from
two key issues. First, following the ODE produces an uncontrolled growth in the
conditioning of the problem, ultimately leading to unacceptably large numerical
errors. Second, as the ODE methods scale cubically with the number of model
parameters, they are restricted to small neural networks, significantly
limiting their ability to represent intricate PDE initial conditions and
solutions. Building on these insights, we develop Neural IVP, an ODE based IVP
solver which prevents the network from getting ill-conditioned and runs in time
linear in the number of parameters, enabling us to evolve the dynamics of
challenging PDEs with neural networks.]]></summary>

reasoning, a crucial aspect of many security tasks. However, existing LLM
architectures for code are often borrowed from other domains like natural
language processing, raising concerns about their generalization and robustness
to unseen code. A key generalization challenge is to incorporate the knowledge
of code semantics, including control and data flow, into the LLM architectures.

Drawing inspiration from examples of convolution layers exploiting
translation symmetry, we explore how code symmetries can enhance LLM
architectures for program analysis and modeling. We present a rigorous
group-theoretic framework that formally defines code symmetries as
semantics-preserving transformations and provides techniques for precisely
reasoning about symmetry preservation within LLM architectures. Using this
framework, we introduce a novel variant of self-attention that preserves
program symmetries, demonstrating its effectiveness in generalization and
robustness through detailed experimental evaluations across different binary

rigorous and powerful reasoning techniques that can guide the future
development of specialized LLMs for code and advance LLM-guided program

source code to express the software semantics, but the compiler converts it to
a binary format that the CPU can directly execute. Therefore, binary code
analysis is critical to applications in reverse engineering and computer
security tasks where source code is not available. However, unlike source code
and natural language that contain rich semantic information, binary code is
typically difficult for human engineers to understand and analyze. While
existing work uses AI models to assist source code analysis, few studies have
considered binary code. In this paper, we propose a COntrastive learning Model
for Binary cOde Analysis, or COMBO, that incorporates source code and comment
information into binary code during representation learning. Specifically, we
present three components in COMBO: (1) a primary contrastive learning method
for cold-start pre-training, (2) a simplex interpolation method to incorporate
source code, comments, and binary code, and (3) an intermediate representation
learning algorithm to provide binary code embeddings. Finally, we evaluate the
effectiveness of the pre-trained representations produced by COMBO using three
indicative downstream tasks relating to binary code: algorithmic functionality
classification, binary code similarity, and vulnerability detection. Our
experimental results show that COMBO facilitates representation learning of
binary code visualized by distribution analysis, and improves the performance
on all three downstream tasks by 5.45% on average compared to state-of-the-art
large-scale language representation models. To the best of our knowledge, COMBO
is the first language representation model that incorporates source code,
binary code, and comments into contrastive code representation learning and
unifies multiple tasks for binary code analysis.]]></summary>

alternative for full fine-tuning so as to adapt pre-trained vision models to
downstream tasks, which only tunes a small number of parameters while freezing
the vast majority ones to ease storage burden and optimization difficulty.
However, existing PEFT methods introduce trainable parameters to the same
positions across different tasks depending solely on human heuristics and
neglect the domain gaps. To this end, we study where to introduce and how to
allocate trainable parameters by proposing a novel Sensitivity-aware visual
Parameter-efficient fine-Tuning (SPT) scheme, which adaptively allocates
trainable parameters to task-specific important positions given a desired
tunable parameter budget. Specifically, our SPT first quickly identifies the
sensitive parameters that require tuning for a given task in a data-dependent
way. Next, our SPT further boosts the representational capability for the
weight matrices whose number of sensitive parameters exceeds a pre-defined
threshold by utilizing existing structured tuning methods, e.g., LoRA [23] or
Adapter [22], to replace directly tuning the selected sensitive parameters
(unstructured tuning) under the budget. Extensive experiments on a wide range
of downstream recognition tasks show that our SPT is complementary to the
existing PEFT methods and largely boosts their performance, e.g., SPT improves
Adapter with supervised pre-trained ViT-B/16 backbone by 4.2% and 1.4% mean
Top-1 accuracy, reaching SOTA performance on FGVC and VTAB-1k benchmarks,

performance of all nested sub-models of a model, without re-evaluating any of
these sub-models. Until now, Bayesian model reduction has been applied mainly
in the computational neuroscience community on simple models. In this paper, we
formulate and apply Bayesian model reduction to perform principled pruning of
Bayesian neural networks, based on variational free energy minimization. Direct
application of Bayesian model reduction, however, gives rise to approximation
errors. Therefore, a novel iterative pruning algorithm is presented to
alleviate the problems arising with naive Bayesian model reduction, as
supported experimentally on the publicly available UCI datasets for different
inference algorithms. This novel parameter pruning scheme solves the
shortcomings of current state-of-the-art pruning methods that are used by the
signal processing community. The proposed approach has a clear stopping
criterion and minimizes the same objective that is used during training. Next
to these benefits, our experiments indicate better model performance in
comparison to state-of-the-art pruning schemes.]]></summary>

object detection. The most basic methods include insertion of copied objects
and rotation and scaling of the entire training frame. Numerous variants have
been developed as well. The existing methods, however, are considerably limited
when compared to the variety of the real world possibilities. In this work, we
develop a diversified and realistic augmentation method that can flexibly
construct a whole-body object, freely locate and rotate the object, and apply
self-occlusion and external-occlusion accordingly. To improve the diversity of
the whole-body object construction, we develop an iterative method that
stochastically combines multiple objects observed from the real world into a
single object. Unlike the existing augmentation methods, the constructed
objects can be randomly located and rotated in the training frame because
proper occlusions can be reflected to the whole-body objects in the final step.
Finally, proper self-occlusion at each local object level and
external-occlusion at the global frame level are applied using the Hidden Point
Removal (HPR) algorithm that is computationally efficient. HPR is also used for
adaptively controlling the point density of each object according to the
object's distance from the LiDAR. Experiment results show that the proposed
DR.CPO algorithm is data-efficient and model-agnostic without incurring any
computational overhead. Also, DR.CPO can improve mAP performance by 2.08% when
compared to the best 3D detection result known for KITTI dataset. The code is

functions for deep neural networks (DNNs). As it counts 1 for positive
variables and 0 for others, its intrinsic characteristics (e.g., discontinuity
and no viable information of subgradients) impede its development for several
decades. Even if there is an impressive body of work on designing DNNs with
continuous activation functions that can be deemed as surrogates of the step
function, it is still in the possession of some advantageous properties, such
as complete robustness to outliers and being capable of attaining the best
learning-theoretic guarantee of predictive accuracy. Hence, in this paper, we
aim to train DNNs with the step function used as an activation function (dubbed
as 0/1 DNNs). We first reformulate 0/1 DNNs as an unconstrained optimization
problem and then solve it by a block coordinate descend (BCD) method. Moreover,
we acquire closed-form solutions for sub-problems of BCD as well as its
convergence properties. Furthermore, we also integrate
$\ell_{2,0}$-regularization into 0/1 DNN to accelerate the training process and
compress the network scale. As a result, the proposed algorithm has a high
performance on classifying MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. As a result, the
proposed algorithm has a desirable performance on classifying MNIST,

small amounts of data. One of the most popular and elegant Few-Shot learning
approaches is Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). The main idea behind this
method is to learn the shared universal weights of a meta-model, which are then
adapted for specific tasks. However, the method suffers from over-fitting and
poorly quantifies uncertainty due to limited data size. Bayesian approaches
could, in principle, alleviate these shortcomings by learning weight
distributions in place of point-wise weights. Unfortunately, previous
modifications of MAML are limited due to the simplicity of Gaussian posteriors,
MAML-like gradient-based weight updates, or by the same structure enforced for
universal and adapted weights.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework for Bayesian MAML called
BayesianHMAML, which employs Hypernetworks for weight updates. It learns the
universal weights point-wise, but a probabilistic structure is added when
adapted for specific tasks. In such a framework, we can use simple Gaussian
distributions or more complicated posteriors induced by Continuous Normalizing
Flows.]]></summary>

global model without disclosing their data. Previous researches often require
training the complete model parameters. However, the emergence of powerful
pre-trained models makes it possible to achieve higher performance with fewer
learnable parameters in FL. In this paper, we propose a federated adaptive
prompt tuning algorithm, FedAPT, for multi-domain collaborative image
classification with powerful foundation models, like CLIP. Compared with direct
federated prompt tuning, our core idea is to adaptively unlock specific domain
knowledge for each test sample in order to provide them with personalized
prompts. To implement this idea, we design an adaptive prompt tuning module,
which consists of a meta prompt, an adaptive network, and some keys. The server
randomly generates a set of keys and assigns a unique key to each client. Then
all clients cooperatively train the global adaptive network and meta prompt
with the local datasets and the frozen keys. Ultimately, the global aggregation
model can assign a personalized prompt to CLIP based on the domain features of
each test sample. We perform extensive experiments on two multi-domain image
classification datasets across two different settings - supervised and
unsupervised. The results show that FedAPT can achieve better performance with
less than 10\% of the number of parameters of the fully trained model, and the
global model can perform well in diverse client domains simultaneously.]]></summary>

quality prediction for millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications. Previous
studies have proposed machine learning-based methods to predict received signal
strength for future time periods using time series of depth images to mitigate
the line-of-sight (LOS) path blockage by pedestrians in mmWave communication.
However, these image-based methods have limited applicability due to privacy
concerns as camera images may contain sensitive information. This study
proposes a point cloud-based method for mmWave link quality prediction and
demonstrates its feasibility through experiments. Point clouds represent
three-dimensional (3D) spaces as a set of points and are sparser and less
likely to contain sensitive information than camera images. Additionally, point
clouds provide 3D position and motion information, which is necessary for
understanding the radio propagation environment involving pedestrians. This
study designs the mmWave link quality prediction method and conducts realistic
indoor experiments, where the link quality fluctuates significantly due to
human blockage, using commercially available IEEE 802.11ad-based 60 GHz
wireless LAN devices and Kinect v2 RGB-D camera and Velodyne VLP-16 light
detection and ranging (LiDAR) for point cloud acquisition. The experimental
results showed that our proposed method can predict future large attenuation of
mmWave received signal strength and throughput induced by the LOS path blockage
by pedestrians with comparable or superior accuracy to image-based prediction
methods. Hence, our point cloud-based method can serve as a viable alternative
to image-based methods.]]></summary>

approaches are generally not scalable, and do not come with sound theoretical

optimal FL iteration from which FL has to be reinitialized, with unlearning
guarantees obtained through a randomized perturbation mechanism. The theory of

assurance (QA) by humans before the predictions of an ML model can be deployed.
QA for ML (QA4ML) interfaces require users to view a large amount of data and
perform many interactions to correct errors made by the ML model. An optimized
user interface (UI) can significantly reduce interaction costs. While UI
optimization can be informed by user studies evaluating design options, this
approach is not scalable because there are typically numerous small variations
that can affect the efficiency of a QA4ML interface. Hence, we propose using
simulation to evaluate and aid the optimization of QA4ML interfaces. In
particular, we focus on simulating the combined effects of human intelligence
in initiating appropriate interaction commands and machine intelligence in
providing algorithmic assistance for accelerating QA4ML processes. As QA4ML is
usually labor-intensive, we use the simulated task completion time as the
metric for UI optimization under different interface and algorithm setups. We
demonstrate the usage of this UI design method in several QA4ML applications.]]></summary>

can be calculated, including off-diagonal expectations between different states

it works particularly well in conjunction with recent work on using neural
networks as variational Ansatze for many-electron systems, and we show that by
combining this method with the FermiNet and Psiformer Ansatze we can accurately
recover vertical excitation energies and oscillator strengths on molecules as

this technique will be of great interest for applications of variational

from sparse point segmentation to dense voxel segmentation, where the objective
is to predict the semantic occupancy of each voxel in the concerned 3D space.
The dense nature of the prediction space has rendered existing efficient
2D-projection-based methods (e.g., bird's eye view, range view, etc.)
ineffective, as they can only describe a subspace of the 3D scene. To address
this, we propose a cylindrical tri-perspective view to represent point clouds
effectively and comprehensively and a PointOcc model to process them
efficiently. Considering the distance distribution of LiDAR point clouds, we
construct the tri-perspective view in the cylindrical coordinate system for
more fine-grained modeling of nearer areas. We employ spatial group pooling to
maintain structural details during projection and adopt 2D backbones to
efficiently process each TPV plane. Finally, we obtain the features of each
point by aggregating its projected features on each of the processed TPV planes
without the need for any post-processing. Extensive experiments on both 3D
occupancy prediction and LiDAR segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that the
proposed PointOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance with much faster speed.
Specifically, despite only using LiDAR, PointOcc significantly outperforms all
other methods, including multi-modal methods, with a large margin on the
OpenOccupancy benchmark. Code: https://github.com/wzzheng/PointOcc.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Federated Learning (FL) requires frequent exchange of model parameters, which
leads to long communication delay, especially when the network environments of
clients vary greatly. Moreover, the parameter server needs to wait for the
slowest client (i.e., straggler, which may have the largest model size, lowest
computing capability or worst network condition) to upload parameters, which
may significantly degrade the communication efficiency. Commonly-used client
selection methods such as partial client selection would lead to the waste of
computing resources and weaken the generalization of the global model. To
tackle this problem, along a different line, in this paper, we advocate the
approach of model parameter dropout instead of client selection, and
accordingly propose a novel framework of Federated learning scheme with
Differential parameter Dropout (FedDD). FedDD consists of two key modules:
dropout rate allocation and uploaded parameter selection, which will optimize
the model parameter uploading ratios tailored to different clients'
heterogeneous conditions and also select the proper set of important model
parameters for uploading subject to clients' dropout rate constraints.
Specifically, the dropout rate allocation is formulated as a convex
optimization problem, taking system heterogeneity, data heterogeneity, and
model heterogeneity among clients into consideration. The uploaded parameter
selection strategy prioritizes on eliciting important parameters for uploading
to speedup convergence. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the convergence
of the proposed FedDD scheme. Extensive performance evaluations demonstrate
that the proposed FedDD scheme can achieve outstanding performances in both
communication efficiency and model convergence, and also possesses a strong
generalization capability to data of rare classes.]]></summary>

controllers for systems operating in stochastic and potentially adversarial
environments. Automatic synthesis tools, however, require a model of the
environment to construct controllers. In this work, we introduce a model-free
reinforcement learning (RL) approach to derive controllers from given LTL
specifications even when the environment is completely unknown. We model the
problem as a stochastic game (SG) between the controller and the adversarial
environment; we then learn optimal control strategies that maximize the
probability of satisfying the LTL specifications against the worst-case
environment behavior. We first construct a product game using the deterministic
parity automaton (DPA) translated from the given LTL specification. By deriving
distinct rewards and discount factors from the acceptance condition of the DPA,
we reduce the maximization of the worst-case probability of satisfying the LTL
specification into the maximization of a discounted reward objective in the
product game; this enables the use of model-free RL algorithms to learn an
optimal controller strategy. To deal with the common scalability problems when
the number of sets defining the acceptance condition of the DPA (usually
referred as colors), is large, we propose a lazy color generation method where
distinct rewards and discount factors are utilized only when needed, and an
approximate method where the controller eventually focuses on only one color.
In several case studies, we show that our approach is scalable to a wide range

controllers from LTL specifications in SGs.]]></summary>

neural network is then inferred from the properties of the ODE vector field.
Besides injecting more structure into the network architectures, this modelling
procedure allows a better theoretical understanding of their behaviour. We
present two universal approximation results and demonstrate how to impose some
particular properties on the neural networks. A particular focus is on
1-Lipschitz architectures including layers that are not 1-Lipschitz. These

multiple tasks by exploiting the correlations between different outputs.
Generally, MOGPs models assume a flat correlation structure between the
outputs. However, such a formulation does not account for more elaborate
relationships, for instance, if several replicates were observed for each
output (which is a typical setting in biological experiments). This paper
proposes an extension of MOGPs for hierarchical datasets (i.e. datasets for
which the relationships between observations can be represented within a tree
structure). Our model defines a tailored kernel function accounting for
hierarchical structures in the data to capture different levels of correlations
while leveraging the introduction of latent variables to express the underlying
dependencies between outputs through a dedicated kernel. This latter feature is
expected to significantly improve scalability as the number of tasks increases.
An extensive experimental study involving both synthetic and real-world data
from genomics and motion capture is proposed to support our claims.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The online Data Quality Monitoring system (DQM) of the CMS electromagnetic
calorimeter (ECAL) is a crucial operational tool that allows ECAL experts to
quickly identify, localize, and diagnose a broad range of detector issues that
would otherwise hinder physics-quality data taking. Although the existing ECAL
DQM system has been continuously updated to respond to new problems, it remains
one step behind newer and unforeseen issues. Using unsupervised deep learning,
a real-time autoencoder-based anomaly detection system is developed that is
able to detect ECAL anomalies unseen in past data. After accounting for spatial
variations in the response of the ECAL and the temporal evolution of anomalies,
the new system is able to efficiently detect anomalies while maintaining an
estimated false discovery rate between $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-4}$, beating existing
benchmarks by about two orders of magnitude. The real-world performance of the
system is validated using anomalies found in 2018 and 2022 LHC collision data.
Additionally, first results from deploying the autoencoder-based system in the
CMS online DQM workflow for the ECAL barrel during Run 3 of the LHC are
presented, showing its promising performance in detecting obscure issues that
could have been missed in the existing DQM system.]]></summary>

block polymer morphology evolution for large domains over long timescales. The
strategy exploits the separation of characteristic times between coarse-grained
particle evolution on the monomer scale and slow morphological evolution over
mesoscopic scales. In contrast to empirical continuum models, the proposed
approach learns stochastically driven defect annihilation processes directly
from particle-based simulations. A UNet architecture that respects different
boundary conditions is adopted, thereby allowing periodic and fixed substrate
boundary conditions of arbitrary shape. Physical concepts are also introduced
via the loss function and symmetries are incorporated via data augmentation.
The model is validated using three different use cases. Explainable artificial
intelligence methods are applied to visualize the morphology evolution over
time. This approach enables the generation of large system sizes and long
trajectories to investigate defect densities and their evolution under
different types of confinement. As an application, we demonstrate the
importance of accessing late-stage morphologies for understanding particle
diffusion inside a single block. This work has implications for directed
self-assembly and materials design in micro-electronics, battery materials, and
membranes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A vast number of systems across the world use algorithmic decision making
(ADM) to (partially) automate decisions that have previously been made by
humans. When designed well, these systems promise more objective decisions
while saving large amounts of resources and freeing up human time. However,
when ADM systems are not designed well, they can lead to unfair decisions which
discriminate against societal groups. The downstream effects of ADMs critically
depend on the decisions made during the systems' design and implementation, as
biases in data can be mitigated or reinforced along the modeling pipeline. Many
of these design decisions are made implicitly, without knowing exactly how they
will influence the final system. It is therefore important to make explicit the
decisions made during the design of ADM systems and understand how these
decisions affect the fairness of the resulting system.

To study this issue, we draw on insights from the field of psychology and
introduce the method of multiverse analysis for algorithmic fairness. In our
proposed method, we turn implicit design decisions into explicit ones and
demonstrate their fairness implications. By combining decisions, we create a
grid of all possible "universes" of decision combinations. For each of these
universes, we compute metrics of fairness and performance. Using the resulting
dataset, one can see how and which decisions impact fairness. We demonstrate
how multiverse analyses can be used to better understand variability and
robustness of algorithmic fairness using an exemplary case study of predicting
public health coverage of vulnerable populations for potential interventions.
Our results illustrate how decisions during the design of a machine learning
system can have surprising effects on its fairness and how to detect these
effects using multiverse analysis.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since its inception in "Attention Is All You Need", transformer architecture
has led to revolutionary advancements in NLP. The attention layer within the
transformer admits a sequence of input tokens $X$ and makes them interact
through pairwise similarities computed as softmax$(XQK^\top X^\top)$, where
$(K,Q)$ are the trainable key-query parameters. In this work, we establish a
formal equivalence between the optimization geometry of self-attention and a
hard-margin SVM problem that separates optimal input tokens from non-optimal
tokens using linear constraints on the outer-products of token pairs. This
formalism allows us to characterize the implicit bias of 1-layer transformers
optimized with gradient descent: (1) Optimizing the attention layer with
vanishing regularization, parameterized by $(K,Q)$, converges in direction to
an SVM solution minimizing the nuclear norm of the combined parameter
$W=KQ^\top$. Instead, directly parameterizing by $W$ minimizes a Frobenius norm
objective. We characterize this convergence, highlighting that it can occur
toward locally-optimal directions rather than global ones. (2) Complementing
this, we prove the local/global directional convergence of gradient descent
under suitable geometric conditions. Importantly, we show that
over-parameterization catalyzes global convergence by ensuring the feasibility
of the SVM problem and by guaranteeing a benign optimization landscape devoid
of stationary points. (3) While our theory applies primarily to linear
prediction heads, we propose a more general SVM equivalence that predicts the
implicit bias with nonlinear heads. Our findings are applicable to arbitrary
datasets and their validity is verified via experiments. We also introduce
several open problems and research directions. We believe these findings
inspire the interpretation of transformers as a hierarchy of SVMs that
separates and selects optimal tokens.]]></summary>

shared model without transferring their local data. FL reduces the
communication overhead, making it a promising learning method in UAV-enhanced
wireless networks with scarce energy resources. Despite the potential,
implementing FL in UAV-enhanced networks is challenging, as conventional UAV
placement methods that maximize coverage increase the FL delay significantly.
Moreover, the uncertainty and lack of a priori information about crucial
variables, such as channel quality, exacerbate the problem. In this paper, we
first analyze the statistical characteristics of a UAV-enhanced wireless sensor
network (WSN) with energy harvesting. We then develop a model and solution
based on the multi-objective multi-armed bandit theory to maximize the network
coverage while minimizing the FL delay. Besides, we propose another solution
that is particularly useful with large action sets and strict energy
constraints at the UAVs. Our proposal uses a scalarized best-arm identification
algorithm to find the optimal arms that maximize the ratio of the expected
reward to the expected energy cost by sequentially eliminating one or more arms
in each round. Then, we derive the upper bound on the error probability of our
multi-objective and cost-aware algorithm. Numerical results show the

derived from graph convolutional networks have shown significant success. These
indicators, achieved by representing feed-forward structures as component

architecture performance across varying search spaces. In contrast, handcrafted
performance indicators (zero-shot NAS), which use the same architecture with
random initialization, can generalize across multiple search spaces. Addressing
this limitation, we propose a novel approach for zero-shot NAS using deep
learning. Our method employs Fourier sum of sines encoding for convolutional
kernels, enabling the construction of a computational feed-forward graph with a
structure similar to the architecture under evaluation. These encodings are
learnable and offer a comprehensive view of the architecture's topological

architectures based on their encodings. Experimental results show that our
approach surpasses previous methods using graph convolutional networks in terms
of correlation on the NAS-Bench-201 dataset and exhibits a higher convergence

recommendation, as a sub-domain, aims to amalgamate longitudinal patient
history with medical knowledge, assisting physicians in prescribing safer and
more accurate medication combinations. Existing methods overlook the inherent
long-tail distribution in medical data, lacking balanced representation between
head and tail data, which leads to sub-optimal model performance. To address
this challenge, we introduce StratMed, a model that incorporates an innovative
relevance stratification mechanism. It harmonizes discrepancies in data
long-tail distribution and strikes a balance between the safety and accuracy of
medication combinations. Specifically, we first construct a pre-training method
using deep learning networks to obtain entity representation. After that, we
design a pyramid-like data stratification method to obtain more generalized
entity relationships by reinforcing the features of unpopular entities. Based
on this relationship, we designed two graph structures to express medication
precision and safety at the same level to obtain visit representations.
Finally, the patient's historical clinical information is fitted to generate
medication combinations for the current health condition. Experiments on the
MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate that our method has outperformed current
state-of-the-art methods in four evaluation metrics (including safety and

convergence to a constant state and a potential over-separation of node states,
as the amplification of subspaces only depends on the spectrum of the
aggregation function. In linear scenarios, this leads to node representations
being dominated by a low-dimensional subspace with an asymptotic convergence
rate independent of the feature transformations. This causes a rank collapse of
the node representations, resulting in over-smoothing when smooth vectors span
this subspace, and over-correlation even when over-smoothing is avoided. Guided
by our theory, we propose a sum of Kronecker products as a beneficial property
that can provably prevent over-smoothing, over-correlation, and rank collapse.
We empirically extend our insights to the non-linear case, demonstrating the

Collision Functions (LACO) a novel approach that learns a collision function
using only a single-view image, language prompt, and robot configuration. LACO
predicts collisions between the robot and the environment, enabling flexible,
conditional path planning without the need for manual object annotations, point
cloud data, or ground-truth object meshes. In both simulation and the real
world, we demonstrate that LACO can facilitate complex, nuanced path plans that
allow for interaction with objects that are safe to collide, rather than
prohibiting any collision.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) is structured to derive policies from
static trajectory data without requiring real-time environment interactions.
Recent studies have shown the feasibility of framing offline RL as a sequence
modeling task, where the sole aim is to predict actions based on prior context
using the transformer architecture. However, the limitation of this single task
learning approach is its potential to undermine the transformer model's
attention mechanism, which should ideally allocate varying attention weights
across different tokens in the input context for optimal prediction. To address
this, we reformulate offline RL as a multi-objective optimization problem,
where the prediction is extended to states and returns. We also highlight a
potential flaw in the trajectory representation used for sequence modeling,
which could generate inaccuracies when modeling the state and return
distributions. This is due to the non-smoothness of the action distribution
within the trajectory dictated by the behavioral policy. To mitigate this
issue, we introduce action space regions to the trajectory representation. Our
experiments on D4RL benchmark locomotion tasks reveal that our propositions
allow for more effective utilization of the attention mechanism in the
transformer model, resulting in performance that either matches or outperforms
current state-of-the art methods.]]></summary>

interaction/dependencies of a Linear Dynamical System (LDS) over a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG) is studied. The sample complexity of learning a DAG's
structure is well-studied for static systems, where the samples of nodal states
are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). However, such a study is
less explored for DAGs with dynamical systems, where the nodal states are
temporally correlated. We call such a DAG underlying an LDS as \emph{dynamical}
DAG (DDAG). In particular, we consider a DDAG where the nodal dynamics are
driven by unobserved exogenous noise sources that are wide-sense stationary
(WSS) in time but are mutually uncorrelated, and have the same {power spectral
density (PSD)}. Inspired by the static settings, a metric and an algorithm
based on the PSD matrix of the observed time series are proposed to reconstruct
the DDAG. The equal noise PSD assumption can be relaxed such that
identifiability conditions for DDAG reconstruction are not violated. For the
LDS with WSS (sub) Gaussian exogenous noise sources, it is shown that the
optimal sample complexity (or length of state trajectory) needed to learn the
DDAG is $n=\Theta(q\log(p/q))$, where $p$ is the number of nodes and $q$ is the
maximum number of parents per node. To prove the sample complexity upper bound,
a concentration bound for the PSD estimation is derived, under two different
sampling strategies. A matching min-max lower bound using generalized Fano's
inequality also is provided, thus showing the order optimality of the proposed
algorithm.]]></summary>

resulting in enhanced computational efficiency and improved estimation

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The rapid development of blockchain has led to more and more funding pouring
into the cryptocurrency market, which also attracted cybercriminals' interest
in recent years. The Ponzi scheme, an old-fashioned fraud, is now popular on
the blockchain, causing considerable financial losses to many crypto-investors.
A few Ponzi detection methods have been proposed in the literature, most of
which detect a Ponzi scheme based on its smart contract source code or opcode.
The contract-code-based approach, while achieving very high accuracy, is not
robust: first, the source codes of a majority of contracts on Ethereum are not
available, and second, a Ponzi developer can fool a contract-code-based
detection model by obfuscating the opcode or inventing a new profit
distribution logic that cannot be detected (since these models were trained on
existing Ponzi logics only). A transaction-based approach could improve the
robustness of detection because transactions, unlike smart contracts, are
harder to be manipulated. However, the current transaction-based detection
models achieve fairly low accuracy. We address this gap in the literature by
developing new detection models that rely only on the transactions, hence
guaranteeing the robustness, and moreover, achieve considerably higher
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score than existing transaction-based
models. This is made possible thanks to the introduction of novel
time-dependent features that capture Ponzi behaviours characteristics derived
from our comprehensive data analyses on Ponzi and non-Ponzi data from the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The vulnerabilities to backdoor attacks have recently threatened the
trustworthiness of machine learning models in practical applications.
Conventional wisdom suggests that not everyone can be an attacker since the
process of designing the trigger generation algorithm often involves
significant effort and extensive experimentation to ensure the attack's
stealthiness and effectiveness. Alternatively, this paper shows that there
exists a more severe backdoor threat: anyone can exploit an easily-accessible
algorithm for silent backdoor attacks. Specifically, this attacker can employ
the widely-used lossy image compression from a plethora of compression tools to
effortlessly inject a trigger pattern into an image without leaving any
noticeable trace; i.e., the generated triggers are natural artifacts. One does
not require extensive knowledge to click on the "convert" or "save as" button
while using tools for lossy image compression. Via this attack, the adversary
does not need to design a trigger generator as seen in prior works and only
requires poisoning the data. Empirically, the proposed attack consistently
achieves 100% attack success rate in several benchmark datasets such as MNIST,
CIFAR-10, GTSRB and CelebA. More significantly, the proposed attack can still
achieve almost 100% attack success rate with very small (approximately 10%)
poisoning rates in the clean label setting. The generated trigger of the
proposed attack using one lossy compression algorithm is also transferable
across other related compression algorithms, exacerbating the severity of this
backdoor threat. This work takes another crucial step toward understanding the
extensive risks of backdoor attacks in practice, urging practitioners to
investigate similar attacks and relevant backdoor mitigation methods.]]></summary>

practicality across various applications. Compared to the centralized version,
training a shared model among a large number of nodes in DFL is more
challenging, as there is no central server to coordinate the training process.
Especially when distributed nodes suffer from limitations in communication or
computational resources, DFL will experience extremely inefficient and unstable
training. Motivated by these challenges, in this paper, we develop a novel
algorithm based on the framework of the inexact alternating direction method
(iADM). On one hand, our goal is to train a shared model with a sparsity
constraint. This constraint enables us to leverage one-bit compressive sensing
(1BCS), allowing transmission of one-bit information among neighbour nodes. On
the other hand, communication between neighbour nodes occurs only at certain
steps, reducing the number of communication rounds. Therefore, the algorithm
exhibits notable communication efficiency. Additionally, as each node selects
only a subset of neighbours to participate in the training, the algorithm is
robust against stragglers. Additionally, complex items are computed only once
for several consecutive steps and subproblems are solved inexactly using
closed-form solutions, resulting in high computational efficiency. Finally,
numerical experiments showcase the algorithm's effectiveness in both
communication and computation.]]></summary>

create AI systems that can explain their rationale to human users. Local
explanations in XAI can provide information about the causes of individual
predictions in terms of feature importance. However, a critical drawback of
existing local explanation methods is their inability to quantify the
uncertainty associated with a feature's importance. This paper introduces an
extension of a feature importance explanation method, Calibrated Explanations
(CE), previously only supporting classification, with support for standard
regression and probabilistic regression, i.e., the probability that the target
is above an arbitrary threshold. The extension for regression keeps all the
benefits of CE, such as calibration of the prediction from the underlying model
with confidence intervals, uncertainty quantification of feature importance,
and allows both factual and counterfactual explanations. CE for standard
regression provides fast, reliable, stable, and robust explanations. CE for
probabilistic regression provides an entirely new way of creating probabilistic
explanations from any ordinary regression model and with a dynamic selection of
thresholds. The performance of CE for probabilistic regression regarding
stability and speed is comparable to LIME. The method is model agnostic with
easily understood conditional rules. An implementation in Python is freely
available on GitHub and for installation using pip making the results in this
paper easily replicable.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Detection of tumors in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) plays an essential
role in the early diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer. Deep learning models
backboned by fully convolutional neural networks (FCNNs) have become the
dominant model for segmenting 3D computerized tomography (CT) scans. However,
since their convolution layers suffer from limited kernel size, they are not
able to capture long-range dependencies and global context. To tackle this
restriction, vision transformers have been introduced to solve FCNN's locality
of receptive fields. Although transformers can capture long-range features,
their segmentation performance decreases with various tumor sizes due to the
model sensitivity to the input patch size. While finding an optimal patch size
improves the performance of vision transformer-based models on segmentation
tasks, it is a time-consuming and challenging procedure. This paper proposes a
technique to select the vision transformer's optimal input multi-resolution
image patch size based on the average volume size of metastasis lesions. We
further validated our suggested framework using a transfer-learning technique,
demonstrating that the highest Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) performance
was obtained by pre-training on training data with a larger tumour volume using
the suggested ideal patch size and then training with a smaller one. We
experimentally evaluate this idea through pre-training our model on a
multi-resolution public dataset. Our model showed consistent and improved
results when applied to our private multi-resolution mCRC dataset with a
smaller average tumor volume. This study lays the groundwork for optimizing
semantic segmentation of small objects using vision transformers. The

location labels, which imposes a high deployment cost. This paper develops a
region-based radio map from received signal strength (RSS) measurements without
location labels. The construction is based on a set of blindly collected RSS
measurement data from a device that visits each region in an indoor area
exactly once, where the footprints and timestamps are not recorded. The main
challenge is to cluster the RSS data and match clusters with the physical
regions. Classical clustering algorithms fail to work as the RSS data naturally
appears as non-clustered due to multipaths and noise. In this paper, a signal
subspace model with a sequential prior is constructed for the RSS data, and an
integrated segmentation and clustering algorithm is developed, which is shown
to find the globally optimal solution in a special case. Furthermore, the
clustered data is matched with the physical regions using a graph-based
approach. Based on real measurements from an office space, the proposed scheme
reduces the region localization error by roughly 50% compared to a weighted
centroid localization (WCL) baseline, and it even outperforms some supervised
localization schemes, including k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The success of existing multi-view clustering (MVC) relies on the assumption
that all views are complete. However, samples are usually partially available
due to data corruption or sensor malfunction, which raises the research of
incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC). Although several anchor-based IMVC
methods have been proposed to process the large-scale incomplete data, they
still suffer from the following drawbacks: i) Most existing approaches neglect
the inter-view discrepancy and enforce cross-view representation to be
consistent, which would corrupt the representation capability of the model; ii)
Due to the samples disparity between different views, the learned anchor might
be misaligned, which we referred as the Anchor-Unaligned Problem for Incomplete
data (AUP-ID). Such the AUP-ID would cause inaccurate graph fusion and degrades
clustering performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel incomplete
anchor graph learning framework termed Scalable Incomplete Multi-View
Clustering with Structure Alignment (SIMVC-SA). Specially, we construct the
view-specific anchor graph to capture the complementary information from
different views. In order to solve the AUP-ID, we propose a novel structure
alignment module to refine the cross-view anchor correspondence. Meanwhile, the
anchor graph construction and alignment are jointly optimized in our unified
framework to enhance clustering quality. Through anchor graph construction
instead of full graphs, the time and space complexity of the proposed SIMVC-SA
is proven to be linearly correlated with the number of samples. Extensive
experiments on seven incomplete benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/wy1019/SIMVC-SA.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Masked image modeling has been demonstrated as a powerful pretext task for
generating robust representations that can be effectively generalized across
multiple downstream tasks. Typically, this approach involves randomly masking
patches (tokens) in input images, with the masking strategy remaining unchanged
during training. In this paper, we propose a curriculum learning approach that
updates the masking strategy to continually increase the complexity of the
self-supervised reconstruction task. We conjecture that, by gradually
increasing the task complexity, the model can learn more sophisticated and
transferable representations. To facilitate this, we introduce a novel
learnable masking module that possesses the capability to generate masks of
different complexities, and integrate the proposed module into masked
autoencoders (MAE). Our module is jointly trained with the MAE, while adjusting
its behavior during training, transitioning from a partner to the MAE
(optimizing the same reconstruction loss) to an adversary (optimizing the
opposite loss), while passing through a neutral state. The transition between
these behaviors is smooth, being regulated by a factor that is multiplied with
the reconstruction loss of the masking module. The resulting training procedure
generates an easy-to-hard curriculum. We train our Curriculum-Learned Masked
Autoencoder (CL-MAE) on ImageNet and show that it exhibits superior
representation learning capabilities compared to MAE. The empirical results on
five downstream tasks confirm our conjecture, demonstrating that curriculum
learning can be successfully used to self-supervise masked autoencoders.]]></summary>

that: 1) working with quantum data can be perceived as embedding physical
system parameters through a hidden feature map; 2) their high performance for
quantum phase recognition can be attributed to generation of a very suitable
basis set during the ground state embedding, where quantum criticality of spin
models leads to basis functions with rapidly changing features; 3) pooling
layers of QCNNs are responsible for picking those basis functions that can
contribute to forming a high-performing decision boundary, and the learning
process corresponds to adapting the measurement such that few-qubit operators
are mapped to full-register observables; 4) generalization of QCNN models
strongly depends on the embedding type, and that rotation-based feature maps
with the Fourier basis require careful feature engineering; 5) accuracy and
generalization of QCNNs with readout based on a limited number of shots favor
the ground state embeddings and associated physics-informed models. We
demonstrate these points in simulation, where our results shed light on
classification for physical processes, relevant for applications in sensing.
Finally, we show that QCNNs with properly chosen ground state embeddings can be
used for fluid dynamics problems, expressing shock wave solutions with good

effectiveness of slicing input images pre-inference, the implications of
varying the resolution of the transformer backbone, and the potential of

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graph classification, aiming at learning the graph-level representations for
effective class assignments, has received outstanding achievements, which
heavily relies on high-quality datasets that have balanced class distribution.
In fact, most real-world graph data naturally presents a long-tailed form,
where the head classes occupy much more samples than the tail classes, it thus
is essential to study the graph-level classification over long-tailed data
while still remaining largely unexplored. However, most existing long-tailed
learning methods in visions fail to jointly optimize the representation
learning and classifier training, as well as neglect the mining of the
hard-to-classify classes. Directly applying existing methods to graphs may lead
to sub-optimal performance, since the model trained on graphs would be more
sensitive to the long-tailed distribution due to the complex topological
characteristics. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel long-tailed
graph-level classification framework via Collaborative Multi-expert Learning
(CoMe) to tackle the problem. To equilibrate the contributions of head and tail
classes, we first develop balanced contrastive learning from the view of
representation learning, and then design an individual-expert classifier
training based on hard class mining. In addition, we execute gated fusion and
disentangled knowledge distillation among the multiple experts to promote the
collaboration in a multi-expert framework. Comprehensive experiments are
performed on seven widely-used benchmark datasets to demonstrate the
superiority of our method CoMe over state-of-the-art baselines.]]></summary>

improving quantitative metrics regardless of other factors. In human-centered
applications, like skin lesion classification in dermatology, DL-driven
clinical decision support systems are still in their infancy due to the limited
transparency of their decision-making process. Moreover, the lack of procedures
that can explain the behavior of trained DL algorithms leads to almost no trust
from clinical physicians. To diagnose skin lesions, dermatologists rely on
visual assessment of the disease and the data gathered from the patient's
anamnesis. Data-driven algorithms dealing with multi-modal data are limited by
the separation of feature-level and decision-level fusion procedures required
by convolutional architectures. To address this issue, we enable single-stage
multi-modal data fusion via the attention mechanism of transformer-based
architectures to aid in diagnosing skin diseases. Our method beats other
state-of-the-art single- and multi-modal DL architectures in image-rich and
patient-data-rich environments. Additionally, the choice of the architecture
enables native interpretability support for the classification task both in the

label-deficient target network by transferring the knowledge from a source
network with abundant labels, draws increasing attention recently. To address
CNNC, we propose a domain-adaptive message passing graph neural network
(DM-GNN), which integrates graph neural network (GNN) with conditional
adversarial domain adaptation. DM-GNN is capable of learning informative
representations for node classification that are also transferrable across
networks. Firstly, a GNN encoder is constructed by dual feature extractors to
separate ego-embedding learning from neighbor-embedding learning so as to
jointly capture commonality and discrimination between connected nodes.
Secondly, a label propagation node classifier is proposed to refine each node's
label prediction by combining its own prediction and its neighbors' prediction.
In addition, a label-aware propagation scheme is devised for the labeled source
network to promote intra-class propagation while avoiding inter-class
propagation, thus yielding label-discriminative source embeddings. Thirdly,
conditional adversarial domain adaptation is performed to take the
neighborhood-refined class-label information into account during adversarial
domain adaptation, so that the class-conditional distributions across networks
can be better matched. Comparisons with eleven state-of-the-art methods
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DM-GNN.]]></summary>

registration (PCR) that improves the generalization and the performance of

progress, generalization to unknown testing environments remains a major
challenge due to the variations in 3D scans. Existing methods typically train a
generic model and the same trained model is applied on each instance during
testing. This could be sub-optimal since it is difficult for the same model to
handle all the variations during testing. In this paper, we propose a test-time
adaptation approach for PCR. Our model can adapt to unseen distributions at
test-time without requiring any prior knowledge of the test data. Concretely,
we design three self-supervised auxiliary tasks that are optimized jointly with
the primary PCR task. Given a test instance, we adapt our model using these
auxiliary tasks and the updated model is used to perform the inference. During
training, our model is trained using a meta-auxiliary learning approach, such
that the adapted model via auxiliary tasks improves the accuracy of the primary

this issue, this paper proposes a test-time adaption approach to enhance model
generality of point cloud upsampling. The proposed approach leverages
meta-learning to explicitly learn network parameters for test-time adaption.
Our method does not require any prior information about the test data. During
meta-training, the model parameters are learned from a collection of
instance-level tasks, each of which consists of a sparse-dense pair of point
clouds from the training data. During meta-testing, the trained model is
fine-tuned with a few gradient updates to produce a unique set of network
parameters for each test instance. The updated model is then used for the final
prediction. Our framework is generic and can be applied in a plug-and-play
manner with existing backbone networks in point cloud upsampling. Extensive

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Science is facing a reproducibility crisis. Previous work has proposed
incorporating data analysis replications into classrooms as a potential
solution. However, despite the potential benefits, it is unclear whether this
approach is feasible, and if so, what the involved stakeholders-students,
educators, and scientists-should expect from it. Can students perform a data
analysis replication over the course of a class? What are the costs and
benefits for educators? And how can this solution help benchmark and improve
the state of science?

In the present study, we incorporated data analysis replications in the
project component of the Applied Data Analysis course (CS-401) taught at EPFL
(N=354 students). Here we report pre-registered findings based on surveys
administered throughout the course. First, we demonstrate that students can
replicate previously published scientific papers, most of them qualitatively
and some exactly. We find discrepancies between what students expect of data
analysis replications and what they experience by doing them along with changes
in expectations about reproducibility, which together serve as evidence of
attitude shifts to foster students' critical thinking. Second, we provide
information for educators about how much overhead is needed to incorporate
replications into the classroom and identify concerns that replications bring
as compared to more traditional assignments. Third, we identify tangible
benefits of the in-class data analysis replications for scientific communities,
such as a collection of replication reports and insights about replication
barriers in scientific work that should be avoided going forward.

Overall, we demonstrate that incorporating replication tasks into a large
data science class can increase the reproducibility of scientific work as a
by-product of data science instruction, thus benefiting both science and
students.]]></summary>

calculation of gradients by using a generically written ``backslash'' or
Gaussian elimination on triangular systems of equations. Generally, the matrix
elements are operators. This paper has three contributions: (i) it is of
intellectual value to replace traditional treatments of automatic
differentiation with a (left acting) operator theoretic, graph-based approach;
(ii) operators can be readily placed in matrices in software in programming
languages such as Julia as an implementation option; (iii) we introduce a novel
notation, ``transpose dot'' operator ``$\{\}^{T_\bullet}$'' that allows for the
reversal of operators.

We further demonstrate the elegance of the operators approach in a suitable
programming language consisting of generic linear algebra operators such as
Julia \cite{bezanson2017julia}, and that it is possible to realize this
abstraction in code. Our implementation shows how generic linear algebra can
allow operators as elements of matrices. In contrast to ``operator
overloading,'' where backslash would normally have to be rewritten to take
advantage of operators, with ``generic programming'' there is no such need.]]></summary>

natural science, social networks, or the semantic web. However, while being
rich in information, graphs are often noisy and incomplete. As a result, graph
completion tasks, such as node classification or link prediction, have gained
attention. On one hand, neural methods, such as graph neural networks, have
proven to be robust tools for learning rich representations of noisy graphs. On
the other hand, symbolic methods enable exact reasoning on graphs.We propose
Knowledge Enhanced Graph Neural Networks (KeGNN), a neuro-symbolic framework
for graph completion that combines both paradigms as it allows for the
integration of prior knowledge into a graph neural network model.Essentially,
KeGNN consists of a graph neural network as a base upon which knowledge
enhancement layers are stacked with the goal of refining predictions with
respect to prior knowledge.We instantiate KeGNN in conjunction with two
state-of-the-art graph neural networks, Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph
Attention Networks, and evaluate KeGNN on multiple benchmark datasets for node

architecture over another? We evaluate the most commonly used comparison
techniques, such as a linear encoding model and centered kernel alignment, to
correctly identify a model by replacing brain recordings with known ground

to capture global structures, while others attempt to preserve local
neighborhoods. Few methods attempt to do both, and it is not always possible to
capture well both local and global information in two dimensions, which is
where most graph drawing live. The choice of using a local or a global
embedding for visualization depends not only on the task but also on the
structure of the underlying data, which may not be known in advance. For a
given graph, LGS aims to find a good balance between the local and global
structure to preserve. We evaluate the performance of LGS with synthetic and
real-world datasets and our results indicate that it is competitive with the
state-of-the-art methods, using established quality metrics such as stress and
neighborhood preservation. We introduce a novel quality metric, cluster
distance preservation, to assess intermediate structure capture. All

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mobile Internet has profoundly reshaped modern lifestyles in various aspects.
Encrypted Traffic Classification (ETC) naturally plays a crucial role in
managing mobile Internet, especially with the explosive growth of mobile apps
using encrypted communication. Despite some existing learning-based ETC methods
showing promising results, three-fold limitations still remain in real-world
network environments, 1) label bias caused by traffic class imbalance, 2)
traffic homogeneity caused by component sharing, and 3) training with reliance
on sufficient labeled traffic. None of the existing ETC methods can address all
these limitations. In this paper, we propose a novel Pre-trAining
Semi-Supervised ETC framework, dubbed PASS. Our key insight is to resample the
original train dataset and perform contrastive pre-training without using
individual app labels directly to avoid label bias issues caused by class
imbalance, while obtaining a robust feature representation to differentiate
overlapping homogeneous traffic by pulling positive traffic pairs closer and
pushing negative pairs away. Meanwhile, PASS designs a semi-supervised
optimization strategy based on pseudo-label iteration and dynamic loss
weighting algorithms in order to effectively utilize massive unlabeled traffic
data and alleviate manual train dataset annotation workload. PASS outperforms
state-of-the-art ETC methods and generic sampling approaches on four public
datasets with significant class imbalance and traffic homogeneity, remarkably
pushing the F1 of Cross-Platform215 with 1.31%, ISCX-17 with 9.12%.
Furthermore, we validate the generality of the contrastive pre-training and
pseudo-label iteration components of PASS, which can adaptively benefit ETC
methods with diverse feature extractors.]]></summary>

been illustrated across a variety of research domains such as natural language
processing, computer vision, and molecular modeling. We extend this paradigm by
utilizing LLMs for material property prediction by introducing our model
Materials Informatics Transformer (MatInFormer). Specifically, we introduce a
novel approach that involves learning the grammar of crystallography through
the tokenization of pertinent space group information. We further illustrate
the adaptability of MatInFormer by incorporating task-specific data pertaining
to Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs). Through attention visualization, we uncover
the key features that the model prioritizes during property prediction. The

establish some uniform recursive relations for the Moreau envelopes for weakly

schemes to establish rate of convergence for Prox-SubGrad without assuming

Furthermore, we propose some new stochastic subgradient upper bounding

stochastic subgradient method (Sto-SubGrad) to solve non-Lipschitz and
nonsmooth stochastic optimization problems. In particular, for both
deterministic and stochastic subgradient methods on weakly convex optimization
problems without Lipschitz continuity, under any of the subgradient upper
bounding conditions to be introduced in the paper, we show that $O(1/\sqrt{T})$

and robustness against adversarial examples in deep neural networks (DNNs).
Although adversarial training (AT) improves robustness, it degrades the
standard accuracy, thus yielding the tradeoff. To mitigate this tradeoff, we
propose a novel AT method called ARREST, which comprises three components: (i)
adversarial finetuning (AFT), (ii) representation-guided knowledge distillation
(RGKD), and (iii) noisy replay (NR). AFT trains a DNN on adversarial examples
by initializing its parameters with a DNN that is standardly pretrained on
clean examples. RGKD and NR respectively entail a regularization term and an
algorithm to preserve latent representations of clean examples during AFT. RGKD
penalizes the distance between the representations of the standardly pretrained
and AFT DNNs. NR switches input adversarial examples to nonadversarial ones
when the representation changes significantly during AFT. By combining these
components, ARREST achieves both high standard accuracy and robustness.
Experimental results demonstrate that ARREST mitigates the tradeoff more
effectively than previous AT-based methods do.]]></summary>

rapidly emerged as powerful tools for generating realistic and diverse data
across various domains, including computer vision and other applied areas.
Consisting of a discriminative network and a generative network engaged in a
Minimax game, GANs have revolutionized the field of generative modeling. In
February 2018, GAN secured the leading spot on the ``Top Ten Global
Breakthrough Technologies List'' issued by the Massachusetts Science and
Technology Review. Over the years, numerous advancements have been proposed,
leading to a rich array of GAN variants, such as conditional GAN, Wasserstein
GAN, CycleGAN, and StyleGAN, among many others. This survey aims to provide a
general overview of GANs, summarizing the latent architecture, validation
metrics, and application areas of the most widely recognized variants. We also
delve into recent theoretical developments, exploring the profound connection
between the adversarial principle underlying GAN and Jensen-Shannon divergence,
while discussing the optimality characteristics of the GAN framework. The
efficiency of GAN variants and their model architectures will be evaluated
along with training obstacles as well as training solutions. In addition, a
detailed discussion will be provided, examining the integration of GANs with
newly developed deep learning frameworks such as Transformers, Physics-Informed
Neural Networks, Large Language models, and Diffusion models. Finally, we

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is a crucial issue in recommendation
systems. There has been an emergence of various public CTR datasets. However,
existing datasets primarily suffer from the following limitations. Firstly,
users generally click different types of items from multiple scenarios, and
modeling from multiple scenarios can provide a more comprehensive understanding
of users. Existing datasets only include data for the same type of items from a
single scenario. Secondly, multi-modal features are essential in multi-scenario
prediction as they address the issue of inconsistent ID encoding between
different scenarios. The existing datasets are based on ID features and lack
multi-modal features. Third, a large-scale dataset can provide a more reliable
evaluation of models, fully reflecting the performance differences between
models. The scale of existing datasets is around 100 million, which is
relatively small compared to the real-world CTR prediction. To address these
limitations, we propose AntM$^{2}$C, a Multi-Scenario Multi-Modal CTR dataset
based on industrial data from Alipay. Specifically, AntM$^{2}$C provides the
following advantages: 1) It covers CTR data of 5 different types of items,
providing insights into the preferences of users for different items, including
advertisements, vouchers, mini-programs, contents, and videos. 2) Apart from
ID-based features, AntM$^{2}$C also provides 2 multi-modal features, raw text
and image features, which can effectively establish connections between items
with different IDs. 3) AntM$^{2}$C provides 1 billion CTR data with 200
features, including 200 million users and 6 million items. It is currently the
largest-scale CTR dataset available. Based on AntM$^{2}$C, we construct several
typical CTR tasks and provide comparisons with baseline methods. The dataset

wide range of downstream applications such as segmentation and detection.
Previous works have shown that segmentation properties emerge in vision
transformers (ViTs) trained using self-supervised methods such as DINO, but not
in those trained on supervised classification tasks. In this study, we probe
whether segmentation emerges in transformer-based models solely as a result of
intricate self-supervised learning mechanisms, or if the same emergence can be
achieved under much broader conditions through proper design of the model
architecture. Through extensive experimental results, we demonstrate that when
employing a white-box transformer-like architecture known as CRATE, whose
design explicitly models and pursues low-dimensional structures in the data
distribution, segmentation properties, at both the whole and parts levels,
already emerge with a minimalistic supervised training recipe. Layer-wise
finer-grained analysis reveals that the emergent properties strongly
corroborate the designed mathematical functions of the white-box network. Our
results suggest a path to design white-box foundation models that are
simultaneously highly performant and mathematically fully interpretable. Code

scenarios: classification of the discrete labels and regression of the
continuously tagged labels. Although many algorithms were proposed for
classification tasks, there are only a few methods for regression tasks. For
emotion regression, the label is continuous in time. A natural method is to
learn the temporal dynamic patterns. In previous studies, long short-term
memory (LSTM) and temporal convolutional neural networks (TCN) were utilized to
learn the temporal contextual information from feature vectors of EEG. However,
the spatial patterns of EEG were not effectively extracted. To enable the
spatial learning ability of TCN towards better regression and classification
performances, we propose a novel unified model, named MASA-TCN, for EEG emotion
regression and classification tasks. The space-aware temporal layer enables TCN
to additionally learn from spatial relations among EEG electrodes. Besides, a
novel multi-anchor block with attentive fusion is proposed to learn dynamic
temporal dependencies. Experiments on two publicly available datasets show
MASA-TCN achieves higher results than the state-of-the-art methods for both EEG
emotion regression and classification tasks. The code is available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Performance of classifiers is often measured in terms of average accuracy on
test data. Despite being a standard measure, average accuracy fails in
characterizing the fit of the model to the underlying conditional law of labels
given the features vector ($Y|X$), e.g. due to model misspecification, over
fitting, and high-dimensionality. In this paper, we consider the fundamental
problem of assessing the goodness-of-fit for a general binary classifier. Our
framework does not make any parametric assumption on the conditional law $Y|X$,
and treats that as a black box oracle model which can be accessed only through
queries. We formulate the goodness-of-fit assessment problem as a tolerance
hypothesis testing of the form \[ H_0: \mathbb{E}\Big[D_f\Big({\sf
Bern}(\eta(X))\|{\sf Bern}(\hat{\eta}(X))\Big)\Big]\leq \tau\,, \] where $D_f$
represents an $f$-divergence function, and $\eta(x)$, $\hat{\eta}(x)$
respectively denote the true and an estimate likelihood for a feature vector
$x$ admitting a positive label. We propose a novel test, called \grasp for
testing $H_0$, which works in finite sample settings, no matter the features
(distribution-free). We also propose model-X \grasp designed for model-X
settings where the joint distribution of the features vector is known. Model-X
\grasp uses this distributional information to achieve better power. We
evaluate the performance of our tests through extensive numerical experiments.]]></summary>

function designed for data with simultaneous time and space dependencies. In
such a context, we study the Trend Filtering, a nonparametric estimator

univariate settings, the signals we consider are assumed to have a kth weak
derivative with bounded total variation, allowing for a general degree of
smoothness. In the multivariate scenario, we study a $K$-Nearest Neighbor fused
lasso estimator as in \cite{padilla2018adaptive}, employing an ADMM algorithm,
suitable for signals with bounded variation that adhere to a piecewise
Lipschitz continuity criterion. By aligning with lower bounds, the minimax
optimality of our estimators is validated. A unique phase transition
phenomenon, previously uncharted in Trend Filtering studies, emerges through
our analysis. Both Simulation studies and real data applications underscore the

dissemination is crucial for supporting critical operations across domains like
disaster response, autonomous vehicles, and sensor networks. This paper
introduces a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach as a

collaborative solutions. We propose a Decentralized-POMDP formulation for
information dissemination, empowering each agent to independently decide on
message forwarding. This constitutes a significant paradigm shift from
traditional heuristics based on Multi-Point Relay (MPR) selection. Our approach
harnesses Graph Convolutional Reinforcement Learning, employing Graph Attention
Networks (GAT) with dynamic attention to capture essential network features. We
propose two approaches, L-DGN and HL-DGN, which differ in the information that
is exchanged among agents. We evaluate the performance of our decentralized
approaches, by comparing them with a widely-used MPR heuristic, and we show
that our trained policies are able to efficiently cover the network while
bypassing the MPR set selection process. Our approach promises a first step
toward bolstering the resilience of real-world broadcast communication

designing reaction pathways from commercially available starting materials to a
target molecule. Each step in multi-step retrosynthesis planning requires
accurate prediction of possible precursor molecules given the target molecule
and confidence estimates to guide heuristic search algorithms. We model
single-step retrosynthesis planning as a distribution learning problem in a
discrete state space. First, we introduce the Markov Bridge Model, a generative
framework aimed to approximate the dependency between two intractable discrete
distributions accessible via a finite sample of coupled data points. Our
framework is based on the concept of a Markov bridge, a Markov process pinned
at its endpoints. Unlike diffusion-based methods, our Markov Bridge Model does
not need a tractable noise distribution as a sampling proxy and directly
operates on the input product molecules as samples from the intractable prior
distribution. We then address the retrosynthesis planning problem with our
novel framework and introduce RetroBridge, a template-free retrosynthesis
modeling approach that achieves state-of-the-art results on standard evaluation
benchmarks.]]></summary>

nonparametric modeling, they exhibit limitations in effectively capturing
abrupt changes in function smoothness and accommodating relationships with
heteroscedastic errors. Addressing these shortcomings, the heteroscedastic
Gaussian process (HeGP) regression seeks to introduce flexibility by
acknowledging the variability of residual variances across covariates in the
regression model. In this work, we extend the HeGP concept, expanding its scope
beyond regression tasks to encompass classification and state-space models. To
achieve this, we propose a novel framework where the Gaussian process is
coupled with a covariate-induced precision matrix process, adopting a mixture
formulation. This approach enables the modeling of heteroscedastic covariance
functions across covariates. To mitigate the computational challenges posed by
sampling, we employ variational inference to approximate the posterior and
facilitate posterior predictive modeling. Additionally, our training process
leverages an EM algorithm featuring closed-form M-step updates to efficiently
evaluate the heteroscedastic covariance function. A notable feature of our
model is its consistent performance on multivariate responses, accommodating
various types (continuous or categorical) seamlessly. Through a combination of
simulations and real-world applications in climatology, we illustrate the
model's prowess and advantages. By overcoming the limitations of traditional
Gaussian process models, our proposed framework offers a robust and versatile
tool for a wide array of applications.]]></summary>

Transmitting videos in the face of dynamic network bandwidth conditions

effective iterative solvers. Often, these systems are noisy due to operational
errors or faulty data-collection processes. In the past decade, the randomized
Kaczmarz (RK) algorithm has been studied extensively as an efficient iterative
solver for such systems. However, the convergence study of RK in the noisy
regime is limited and considers measurement noise in the right-hand side
vector, $b$. Unfortunately, in practice, that is not always the case; the
coefficient matrix $A$ can also be noisy. In this paper, we analyze the
convergence of RK for noisy linear systems when the coefficient matrix, $A$, is
corrupted with both additive and multiplicative noise, along with the noisy
vector, $b$. In our analyses, the quantity $\tilde R=\| \tilde A^{\dagger}
\|_2^2 \|\tilde A \|_F^2$ influences the convergence of RK, where $\tilde A$
represents a noisy version of $A$. We claim that our analysis is robust and
realistically applicable, as we do not require information about the noiseless
coefficient matrix, $A$, and considering different conditions on noise, we can
control the convergence of RK. We substantiate our theoretical findings by
performing comprehensive numerical experiments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a prominent research topic in
the field of machine learning. Existing GNN models are commonly categorized
into two types: spectral GNNs, which are designed based on polynomial graph
filters, and spatial GNNs, which utilize a message-passing scheme as the
foundation of the model. For the expressive power and universality of spectral
GNNs, a natural approach is to improve the design of basis functions for better
approximation ability. As for spatial GNNs, models like Graph Isomorphism
Networks (GIN) analyze their expressive power based on Graph Isomorphism Tests.
Recently, there have been attempts to establish connections between spatial
GNNs and geometric concepts like curvature and cellular sheaves, as well as
physical phenomena like oscillators. However, despite the recent progress,
there is still a lack of comprehensive analysis regarding the universality of
spatial GNNs from the perspectives of geometry and physics. In this paper, we
propose MetricGNN (MGNN), a spatial GNN model inspired by the
congruent-insensitivity property of classifiers in the classification phase of
GNNs. We demonstrate that a GNN model is universal in the spatial domain if it
can generate embedding matrices that are congruent to any given embedding
matrix. This property is closely related to the Distance Geometry Problem
(DGP). Since DGP is an NP-Hard combinatorial optimization problem, we propose
optimizing an energy function derived from spring networks and the
Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) problem. This approach also allows our model to
handle both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Finally, we propose employing
the iteration method to optimize our energy function. We extensively evaluate
the effectiveness of our model through experiments conducted on both synthetic
and real-world datasets. Our code is available at:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this work, we study the problem of semantic communication and inference,
in which a student agent (i.e. mobile device) queries a teacher agent (i.e.
cloud sever) to generate higher-order data semantics living in a simplicial
complex. Specifically, the teacher first maps its data into a k-order
simplicial complex and learns its high-order correlations. For effective
communication and inference, the teacher seeks minimally sufficient and
invariant semantic structures prior to conveying information. These minimal
simplicial structures are found via judiciously removing simplices selected by
the Hodge Laplacians without compromising the inference query accuracy.
Subsequently, the student locally runs its own set of queries based on a masked
simplicial convolutional autoencoder (SCAE) leveraging both local and remote
teacher's knowledge. Numerical results corroborate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach in terms of improving inference query accuracy under
different channel conditions and simplicial structures. Experiments on a
coauthorship dataset show that removing simplices by ranking the Laplacian
values yields a 85% reduction in payload size without sacrificing accuracy.
Joint semantic communication and inference by masked SCAE improves query
accuracy by 25% compared to local student based query and 15% compared to
remote teacher based query. Finally, incorporating channel semantics is shown
to effectively improve inference accuracy, notably at low SNR values.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Accurate traffic forecasting at intersections governed by intelligent traffic
signals is critical for the advancement of an effective intelligent traffic
signal control system. However, due to the irregular traffic time series
produced by intelligent intersections, the traffic forecasting task becomes
much more intractable and imposes three major new challenges: 1) asynchronous
spatial dependency, 2) irregular temporal dependency among traffic data, and 3)
variable-length sequence to be predicted, which severely impede the performance
of current traffic forecasting methods. To this end, we propose an Asynchronous
Spatio-tEmporal graph convolutional nEtwoRk (ASeer) to predict the traffic
states of the lanes entering intelligent intersections in a future time window.
Specifically, by linking lanes via a traffic diffusion graph, we first propose
an Asynchronous Graph Diffusion Network to model the asynchronous spatial
dependency between the time-misaligned traffic state measurements of lanes.
After that, to capture the temporal dependency within irregular traffic state
sequence, a learnable personalized time encoding is devised to embed the
continuous time for each lane. Then we propose a Transformable Time-aware
Convolution Network that learns meta-filters to derive time-aware convolution
filters with transformable filter sizes for efficient temporal convolution on
the irregular sequence. Furthermore, a Semi-Autoregressive Prediction Network
consisting of a state evolution unit and a semiautoregressive predictor is
designed to effectively and efficiently predict variable-length traffic state
sequences. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of ASeer in six metrics.]]></summary>

both conditional and unconditional generation. Still conditional generation is
based on either a specific training of a conditional model or classifier
guidance, which requires training a noise-dependent classifier, even when the
classifier for uncorrupted data is given. We propose an approach to sample from
unconditional score-based generative models enforcing arbitrary logical
constraints, without any additional training. Firstly, we show how to
manipulate the learned score in order to sample from an un-normalized
distribution conditional on a user-defined constraint. Then, we define a
flexible and numerically stable neuro-symbolic framework for encoding soft
logical constraints. Combining these two ingredients we obtain a general, but
approximate, conditional sampling algorithm. We further developed effective
heuristics aimed at improving the approximation. Finally, we show the
effectiveness of our approach for various types of constraints and data:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Partial Label Learning (PLL) is a type of weakly supervised learning where
each training instance is assigned a set of candidate labels, but only one
label is the ground-truth. However, this idealistic assumption may not always
hold due to potential annotation inaccuracies, meaning the ground-truth may not
be present in the candidate label set. This is known as Unreliable Partial
Label Learning (UPLL) that introduces an additional complexity due to the
inherent unreliability and ambiguity of partial labels, often resulting in a
sub-optimal performance with existing methods. To address this challenge, we
propose the Unreliability-Robust Representation Learning framework (URRL) that
leverages unreliability-robust contrastive learning to help the model fortify
against unreliable partial labels effectively. Concurrently, we propose a dual
strategy that combines KNN-based candidate label set correction and
consistency-regularization-based label disambiguation to refine label quality
and enhance the ability of representation learning within the URRL framework.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art PLL methods on various datasets with diverse degrees of
unreliability and ambiguity. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of
our approach from the perspective of the expectation maximization (EM)
algorithm. Upon acceptance, we pledge to make the code publicly accessible.]]></summary>

capabilities of graph neural networks (GNNs). While over-smoothing eliminates
the differences between nodes making them indistinguishable, over-squashing
refers to the inability of GNNs to propagate information over long distances,
as exponentially many node states are squashed into fixed-size representations.
Both phenomena share similar causes, as both are largely induced by the graph
topology. To mitigate these problems in graph classification tasks, we propose
CurvPool, a novel pooling method. CurvPool exploits the notion of curvature of
a graph to adaptively identify structures responsible for both over-smoothing
and over-squashing. By clustering nodes based on the Balanced Forman curvature,
CurvPool constructs a graph with a more suitable structure, allowing deeper
models and the combination of distant information. We compare it to other
state-of-the-art pooling approaches and establish its competitiveness in terms
of classification accuracy, computational complexity, and flexibility. CurvPool
outperforms several comparable methods across all considered tasks. The most
consistent results are achieved by pooling densely connected clusters using the
sum aggregation, as this allows additional information about the size of each
pool.]]></summary>

adequate infrastructure, deployment of low-carbon transport modes and shifts in
travel behavior. To adequately implement alterations in infrastructure, it's
essential to grasp the location-specific cause-and-effect mechanisms that the
constructed environment has on travel. Yet, current research falls short in
representing causal relationships between the 6D urban form variables and
travel, generalizing across different regions, and modeling urban form effects
at high spatial resolution. Here, we address all three gaps by utilizing a
causal discovery and an explainable machine learning framework to detect urban
form effects on intra-city travel based on high-resolution mobility data of six
cities across three continents. We show that both distance to city center,
demographics and density indirectly affect other urban form features. By
considering the causal relationships, we find that location-specific influences
align across cities, yet vary in magnitude. In addition, the spread of the city
and the coverage of jobs across the city are the strongest determinants of
travel-related emissions, highlighting the benefits of compact development and
associated benefits. Differences in urban form effects across the cities call
for a more holistic definition of 6D measures. Our work is a starting point for
location-specific analysis of urban form effects on mobility behavior using
causal discovery approaches, which is highly relevant for city planners and

node lesions. However, the diagnoses of these images largely hinge on the
expertise of medical practitioners, rendering the process susceptible to
misdiagnoses. Although rapidly developing deep learning has substantially
improved the diagnoses of diverse ultrasound images, there remains a
conspicuous research gap concerning cervical lymph nodes. The objective of our
work is to accurately diagnose cervical lymph node lesions by leveraging a deep
learning model. To this end, we first collected 3392 images containing normal
lymph nodes, benign lymph node lesions, malignant primary lymph node lesions,
and malignant metastatic lymph node lesions. Given that ultrasound images are
generated by the reflection and scattering of sound waves across varied bodily
tissues, we proposed the Conv-FFT Block. It integrates convolutional operations
with the fast Fourier transform to more astutely model the images. Building
upon this foundation, we designed a novel architecture, named US-SFNet. This
architecture not only discerns variances in ultrasound images from the spatial
domain but also adeptly captures microstructural alterations across various
lesions in the frequency domain. To ascertain the potential of US-SFNet, we
benchmarked it against 12 popular architectures through five-fold

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The electronic design automation of analog circuits has been a longstanding
challenge in the integrated circuit field due to the huge design space and
complex design trade-offs among circuit specifications. In the past decades,
intensive research efforts have mostly been paid to automate the transistor
sizing with a given circuit topology. By recognizing the graph nature of
circuits, this paper presents a Circuit Graph Neural Network (CktGNN) that
simultaneously automates the circuit topology generation and device sizing
based on the encoder-dependent optimization subroutines. Particularly, CktGNN
encodes circuit graphs using a two-level GNN framework (of nested GNN) where
circuits are represented as combinations of subgraphs in a known subgraph
basis. In this way, it significantly improves design efficiency by reducing the
number of subgraphs to perform message passing. Nonetheless, another critical
roadblock to advancing learning-assisted circuit design automation is a lack of
public benchmarks to perform canonical assessment and reproducible research. To
tackle the challenge, we introduce Open Circuit Benchmark (OCB), an
open-sourced dataset that contains $10$K distinct operational amplifiers with
carefully-extracted circuit specifications. OCB is also equipped with
communicative circuit generation and evaluation capabilities such that it can
help to generalize CktGNN to design various analog circuits by producing
corresponding datasets. Experiments on OCB show the extraordinary advantages of
CktGNN through representation-based optimization frameworks over other recent
powerful GNN baselines and human experts' manual designs. Our work paves the
way toward a learning-based open-sourced design automation for analog circuits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The detection of Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs) is intricate due to
their complex waveforms, extended duration, and low signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR), making them more challenging to be identified compared to compact binary
coalescences. While matched filtering-based techniques are known for their
computational demands, existing deep learning-based methods primarily handle
time-domain data and are often constrained by data duration and SNR. In
addition, most existing work ignores time-delay interferometry (TDI) and
applies the long-wavelength approximation in detector response calculations,
thus limiting their ability to handle laser frequency noise. In this study, we
introduce DECODE, an end-to-end model focusing on EMRI signal detection by
sequence modeling in the frequency domain. Centered around a dilated causal
convolutional neural network, trained on synthetic data considering TDI-1.5
detector response, DECODE can efficiently process a year's worth of
multichannel TDI data with an SNR of around 50. We evaluate our model on 1-year
data with accumulated SNR ranging from 50 to 120 and achieve a true positive
rate of 96.3% at a false positive rate of 1%, keeping an inference time of less
than 0.01 seconds. With the visualization of three showcased EMRI signals for
interpretability and generalization, DECODE exhibits strong potential for
future space-based gravitational wave data analyses.]]></summary>

models brittle and sensitive to distribution shifts. In this work, we first
examine vision transformers (ViTs) and find that they tend to extract robust
and spurious features with distinct attention heads. As a result of this
modularity, their performance under distribution shifts can be significantly
improved at test time by pruning heads corresponding to spurious features,
which we demonstrate using an "oracle selection" on validation data. Second, we
propose a method to further enhance the diversity and complementarity of the

benchmarks (MNIST-CIFAR, Waterbirds) as a consequence of the enhanced diversity

difficult to imagine that completely different skills are needed for heading a

reinforcement learning algorithm for adapting a policy to implicit changes in
goals or environments in a single motion category with different reward

a growing interest in automated anomaly detection systems. However, the
classification of anomalies detected on network Key Performance Indicators
(KPI) has received less attention, resulting in a lack of information about

paper proposes a modular anomaly classification framework. The framework
assumes separate entities for the anomaly classifier and the detector, allowing
for a distinct treatment of anomaly detection and classification tasks on time
series. The objectives of this study are (1) to develop a time series simulator
that generates synthetic time series resembling real-world network KPI
behavior, (2) to build a detection model to identify anomalies in the time
series, (3) to build classification models that accurately categorize detected
anomalies into predefined classes (4) to evaluate the classification framework
performance on simulated and real-world network KPI time series. This study has
demonstrated the good performance of the anomaly classification models trained
on simulated anomalies when applied to real-world network time series data.]]></summary>

high contrast imaging. However, these structures face challenges in data
reduction, leading to over-subtraction from speckles and self-subtraction with
most existing methods. Iterative post-processing methods offer promising
results, but their integration into existing pipelines is hindered by selective
algorithms, high computational cost, and algorithmic regularization. To address
this for reference differential imaging (RDI), here we propose the data
imputation concept to Karhunen-Lo\`eve transform (DIKL) by modifying two steps
in the standard Karhunen-Lo\`eve image projection (KLIP) method. Specifically,
we partition an image to two matrices: an anchor matrix which focuses only on
the speckles to obtain the DIKL coefficients, and a boat matrix which focuses
on the regions of astrophysical interest for speckle removal using DIKL
components. As an analytical approach, DIKL achieves high-quality results with
significantly reduced computational cost (~3 orders of magnitude less than
iterative methods). Being a derivative method of KLIP, DIKL is seamlessly
integrable into high contrast imaging pipelines for RDI observations.]]></summary>

the main methodological innovation is to apply this model to emulate the
progression that an exact Metropolis-Hastings (MH) sampler would take if it was
applicable. Informative log-likelihood evaluation locations are selected using
a sequential experimental design strategy until the MH accept/reject decision
is done accurately enough according to the GP model. The resulting approximate
sampler is conceptually simple and sample-efficient. It is also more robust to
violations of GP modelling assumptions compared with earlier, related "Bayesian
optimisation-like" methods tailored for Bayesian inference. We discuss some
theoretical aspects and various interpretations of the resulting approximate MH

generalised Bayesian likelihood-free inference for simulator-based statistical

times of agents are highly heterogeneous, and its communication complexity
depends on the empirical pull times of agents. ODC is a generic protocol that

differential equations (PDEs), neural networks have the potential to break the
curse of dimensionality, providing approximate solutions to problems where
using classical solvers is difficult or impossible. While global minimization
of the PDE residual over the network parameters works well for boundary value
problems, catastrophic forgetting impairs the applicability of this approach to
initial value problems (IVPs). In an alternative local-in-time approach, the
optimization problem can be converted into an ordinary differential equation
(ODE) on the network parameters and the solution propagated forward in time;
however, we demonstrate that current methods based on this approach suffer from
two key issues. First, following the ODE produces an uncontrolled growth in the
conditioning of the problem, ultimately leading to unacceptably large numerical
errors. Second, as the ODE methods scale cubically with the number of model
parameters, they are restricted to small neural networks, significantly
limiting their ability to represent intricate PDE initial conditions and
solutions. Building on these insights, we develop Neural IVP, an ODE based IVP
solver which prevents the network from getting ill-conditioned and runs in time
linear in the number of parameters, enabling us to evolve the dynamics of

support systems (DSSs). The best-performing predictive models used in AI-based
DSSs lack transparency. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to
create AI systems that can explain their rationale to human users. Local
explanations in XAI can provide information about the causes of individual
predictions in terms of feature importance. However, a critical drawback of
existing local explanation methods is their inability to quantify the
uncertainty associated with a feature's importance. This paper introduces an
extension of a feature importance explanation method, Calibrated Explanations
(CE), previously only supporting classification, with support for standard
regression and probabilistic regression, i.e., the probability that the target
is above an arbitrary threshold. The extension for regression keeps all the
benefits of CE, such as calibration of the prediction from the underlying model
with confidence intervals, uncertainty quantification of feature importance,
and allows both factual and counterfactual explanations. CE for standard
regression provides fast, reliable, stable, and robust explanations. CE for
probabilistic regression provides an entirely new way of creating probabilistic
explanations from any ordinary regression model and with a dynamic selection of
thresholds. The performance of CE for probabilistic regression regarding
stability and speed is comparable to LIME. The method is model agnostic with
easily understood conditional rules. An implementation in Python is freely
available on GitHub and for installation using pip making the results in this
paper easily replicable.]]></summary>

differentiable Neural Logic (dNL) networks, are able to learn Boolean functions

for use in RRL by incorporating non-linear continuous predicates, allowing RRL

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This work presents a general geometric framework for simulating and learning
the dynamics of Hamiltonian systems that are invariant under a Lie group of
transformations. This means that a group of symmetries is known to act on the
system respecting its dynamics and, as a consequence, Noether's Theorem,
conserved quantities are observed. We propose to simulate and learn the
mappings of interest through the construction of $G$-invariant Lagrangian
submanifolds, which are pivotal objects in symplectic geometry. A notable
property of our constructions is that the simulated/learned dynamics also
preserves the same conserved quantities as the original system, resulting in a
more faithful surrogate of the original dynamics than non-symmetry aware
methods, and in a more accurate predictor of non-observed trajectories.
Furthermore, our setting is able to simulate/learn not only Hamiltonian flows,
but any Lie group-equivariant symplectic transformation. Our designs leverage
pivotal techniques and concepts in symplectic geometry and geometric mechanics:
reduction theory, Noether's Theorem, Lagrangian submanifolds, momentum
mappings, and coisotropic reduction among others. We also present methods to
learn Poisson transformations while preserving the underlying geometry and how
to endow non-geometric integrators with geometric properties. Thus, this work
presents a novel attempt to harness the power of symplectic and Poisson
geometry towards simulating and learning problems.]]></summary>

powerful, efficient, and scientifically informative than separate analyses. To
address variation architectures correctly and comprehensively for
high-dimensional data across multiple sample sets (i.e., cohorts), we propose
multiple augmented reduced rank regression (maRRR), a flexible matrix
regression and factorization method to concurrently learn both covariate-driven
and auxiliary structured variation. We consider a structured nuclear norm
objective that is motivated by random matrix theory, in which the regression or
factorization terms may be shared or specific to any number of cohorts. Our
framework subsumes several existing methods, such as reduced rank regression
and unsupervised multi-matrix factorization approaches, and includes a
promising novel approach to regression and factorization of a single dataset
(aRRR) as a special case. Simulations demonstrate substantial gains in power
from combining multiple datasets, and from parsimoniously accounting for all
structured variation. We apply maRRR to gene expression data from multiple
cancer types (i.e., pan-cancer) from TCGA, with somatic mutations as
covariates. The method performs well with respect to prediction and imputation
of held-out data, and provides new insights into mutation-driven and auxiliary
variation that is shared or specific to certain cancer types.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Large Language Model (LLM) inference consists of two distinct phases -
prefill phase which processes the input prompt and decode phase which generates
output tokens autoregressively. While the prefill phase effectively saturates
GPU compute at small batch sizes, the decode phase results in low compute
utilization as it generates one token at a time per request. The varying
prefill and decode times also lead to imbalance across micro-batches when using
pipeline parallelism, resulting in further inefficiency due to bubbles.

We present SARATHI to address these challenges. SARATHI employs
chunked-prefills, which splits a prefill request into equal sized chunks, and
decode-maximal batching, which constructs a batch using a single prefill chunk
and populates the remaining slots with decodes. During inference, the prefill
chunk saturates GPU compute, while the decode requests 'piggyback' and cost up
to an order of magnitude less compared to a decode-only batch. Chunked-prefills
allows constructing multiple decode-maximal batches from a single prefill
request, maximizing coverage of decodes that can piggyback. Furthermore, the
uniform compute design of these batches ameliorates the imbalance between
micro-batches, significantly reducing pipeline bubbles.

Our techniques yield significant improvements in inference performance across
models and hardware. For the LLaMA-13B model on A6000 GPU, SARATHI improves
decode throughput by up to 10x, and accelerates end-to-end throughput by up to
1.33x. For LLaMa-33B on A100 GPU, we achieve 1.25x higher end-to-end-throughput
and up to 4.25x higher decode throughput. When used with pipeline parallelism
on GPT-3, SARATHI reduces bubbles by 6.29x, resulting in an end-to-end
throughput improvement of 1.91x.]]></summary>

and it has been repeatedly associated with increased mortality. Forecasting
future service demand has the potential patient outcomes. Despite active

performance metrics have been rarely reported. In this study, we document the
performance of a set of advanced ML models in forecasting ED occupancy 24 hours

extensive set of explanatory variables, including the availability of beds in
catchment area hospitals, traffic data from local observation stations, weather
variables, etc. We show that N-BEATS and LightGBM outpeform benchmarks with 11
% and 9 % respective improvements and that DeepAR predicts next day crowding
with an AUC of 0.76 (95 % CI 0.69-0.84). To the best of our knowledge, this is

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hypergraphs are important for processing data with higher-order relationships
involving more than two entities. In scenarios where explicit hypergraphs are
not readily available, it is desirable to infer a meaningful hypergraph
structure from the node features to capture the intrinsic relations within the
data. However, existing methods either adopt simple pre-defined rules that fail
to precisely capture the distribution of the potential hypergraph structure, or
learn a mapping between hypergraph structures and node features but require a
large amount of labelled data, i.e., pre-existing hypergraph structures, for
training. Both restrict their applications in practical scenarios. To fill this
gap, we propose a novel smoothness prior that enables us to design a method to
infer the probability for each potential hyperedge without labelled data as
supervision. The proposed prior indicates features of nodes in a hyperedge are
highly correlated by the features of the hyperedge containing them. We use this
prior to derive the relation between the hypergraph structure and the node
features via probabilistic modelling. This allows us to develop an unsupervised
inference method to estimate the probability for each potential hyperedge via
solving an optimisation problem that has an analytical solution. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our method can learn
meaningful hypergraph structures from data more efficiently than existing
hypergraph structure inference methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Community detection is an important content in complex network analysis. The
existing community detection methods in attributed networks mostly focus on
only using network structure, while the methods of integrating node attributes
is mainly for the traditional community structures, and cannot detect
multipartite structures and mixture structures in network. In addition, the
model-based community detection methods currently proposed for attributed
networks do not fully consider unique topology information of nodes, such as
betweenness centrality and clustering coefficient. Therefore, a stochastic
block model that integrates betweenness centrality and clustering coefficient
of nodes for community detection in attributed networks, named BCSBM, is
proposed in this paper. Different from other generative models for attributed
networks, the generation process of links and attributes in BCSBM model follows
the Poisson distribution, and the probability between community is considered
based on the stochastic block model. Moreover, the betweenness centrality and
clustering coefficient of nodes are introduced into the process of links and
attributes generation. Finally, the expectation maximization algorithm is
employed to estimate the parameters of the BCSBM model, and the node-community
memberships is obtained through the hard division process, so the community
detection is completed. By experimenting on six real-work networks containing
different network structures, and comparing with the community detection
results of five algorithms, the experimental results show that the BCSBM model
not only inherits the advantages of the stochastic block model and can detect
various network structures, but also has good data fitting ability due to
introducing the betweenness centrality and clustering coefficient of nodes.
Overall, the performance of this model is superior to other five compared
algorithms.]]></summary>

test data. Despite being a standard measure, average accuracy fails in
characterizing the fit of the model to the underlying conditional law of labels
given the features vector ($Y|X$), e.g. due to model misspecification, over
fitting, and high-dimensionality. In this paper, we consider the fundamental
problem of assessing the goodness-of-fit for a general binary classifier. Our
framework does not make any parametric assumption on the conditional law $Y|X$,
and treats that as a black box oracle model which can be accessed only through
queries. We formulate the goodness-of-fit assessment problem as a tolerance
hypothesis testing of the form \[ H_0: \mathbb{E}\Big[D_f\Big({\sf
Bern}(\eta(X))\|{\sf Bern}(\hat{\eta}(X))\Big)\Big]\leq \tau\,, \] where $D_f$
represents an $f$-divergence function, and $\eta(x)$, $\hat{\eta}(x)$
respectively denote the true and an estimate likelihood for a feature vector
$x$ admitting a positive label. We propose a novel test, called \grasp for
testing $H_0$, which works in finite sample settings, no matter the features
(distribution-free). We also propose model-X \grasp designed for model-X
settings where the joint distribution of the features vector is known. Model-X
\grasp uses this distributional information to achieve better power. We
evaluate the performance of our tests through extensive numerical experiments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A vast number of systems across the world use algorithmic decision making
(ADM) to (partially) automate decisions that have previously been made by
humans. When designed well, these systems promise more objective decisions
while saving large amounts of resources and freeing up human time. However,
when ADM systems are not designed well, they can lead to unfair decisions which
discriminate against societal groups. The downstream effects of ADMs critically
depend on the decisions made during the systems' design and implementation, as
biases in data can be mitigated or reinforced along the modeling pipeline. Many
of these design decisions are made implicitly, without knowing exactly how they
will influence the final system. It is therefore important to make explicit the
decisions made during the design of ADM systems and understand how these
decisions affect the fairness of the resulting system.

To study this issue, we draw on insights from the field of psychology and
introduce the method of multiverse analysis for algorithmic fairness. In our
proposed method, we turn implicit design decisions into explicit ones and
demonstrate their fairness implications. By combining decisions, we create a
grid of all possible "universes" of decision combinations. For each of these
universes, we compute metrics of fairness and performance. Using the resulting
dataset, one can see how and which decisions impact fairness. We demonstrate
how multiverse analyses can be used to better understand variability and
robustness of algorithmic fairness using an exemplary case study of predicting
public health coverage of vulnerable populations for potential interventions.
Our results illustrate how decisions during the design of a machine learning
system can have surprising effects on its fairness and how to detect these
effects using multiverse analysis.]]></summary>

properties which allow their efficient computation. We prove that the MMD of
Riesz kernels coincides with the MMD of their sliced version. As a consequence,
the computation of gradients of MMDs can be performed in the one-dimensional
setting. Here, for $r=1$, a simple sorting algorithm can be applied to reduce
the complexity from $O(MN+N^2)$ to $O((M+N)\log(M+N))$ for two measures with
$M$ and $N$ support points. As another interesting follow-up result, the MMD of
compactly supported measures can be estimated from above and below by the
Wasserstein-1 distance. For the implementations we approximate the gradient of
the sliced MMD by using only a finite number $P$ of slices. We show that the
resulting error has complexity $O(\sqrt{d/P})$, where $d$ is the data

the most challenging tasks in early discovery research. To tackle this
challenge, biopharma research established a standardized high content imaging
protocol that tags different cellular compartments per image channel. In order
to judge the experimental outcome, the scientist requires knowledge about the
channel importance with respect to a certain phenotype for decoding the
underlying biology. In contrast to traditional image analysis approaches, such
experiments are nowadays preferably analyzed by deep learning based approaches
which, however, lack crucial information about the channel importance. To
overcome this limitation, we present a novel approach which utilizes
multi-spectral information of high content images to interpret a certain aspect
of cellular biology. To this end, we base our method on image blending concepts
with alpha compositing for an arbitrary number of channels. More specifically,
we introduce DCMIX, a lightweight, scaleable and end-to-end trainable mixing
layer which enables interpretable predictions in high content imaging while
retaining the benefits of deep learning based methods. We employ an extensive

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this article, the optimal sample complexity of learning the underlying
interaction/dependencies of a Linear Dynamical System (LDS) over a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG) is studied. The sample complexity of learning a DAG's
structure is well-studied for static systems, where the samples of nodal states
are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). However, such a study is
less explored for DAGs with dynamical systems, where the nodal states are
temporally correlated. We call such a DAG underlying an LDS as \emph{dynamical}
DAG (DDAG). In particular, we consider a DDAG where the nodal dynamics are
driven by unobserved exogenous noise sources that are wide-sense stationary
(WSS) in time but are mutually uncorrelated, and have the same {power spectral
density (PSD)}. Inspired by the static settings, a metric and an algorithm
based on the PSD matrix of the observed time series are proposed to reconstruct
the DDAG. The equal noise PSD assumption can be relaxed such that
identifiability conditions for DDAG reconstruction are not violated. For the
LDS with WSS (sub) Gaussian exogenous noise sources, it is shown that the
optimal sample complexity (or length of state trajectory) needed to learn the
DDAG is $n=\Theta(q\log(p/q))$, where $p$ is the number of nodes and $q$ is the
maximum number of parents per node. To prove the sample complexity upper bound,
a concentration bound for the PSD estimation is derived, under two different
sampling strategies. A matching min-max lower bound using generalized Fano's
inequality also is provided, thus showing the order optimality of the proposed
algorithm.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi fellow computer scientists and engineers,
 ​
 I've been wondering why do we often have a convolution inside every upsample and downsample block. Well, it makes sense, if you intend to upscale some features and use a bilinear interpolation, then some error can be introduced due to interpolation inaccuracies. This is where convolution layer comes handy to help and support the upscaling. But is this really the reason behind it? Or is there a deeper explanation?
 ​
 Also, just for the sake of curiosity. What if the scale_factor of an upsample block was 1. Should we still keep the convolution layer? or just get rid of all the upsample block since there is no actual "upsampling" being done at least in the context of the tensor dimensions.
 ​
 Thank you :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi fellow computer scientists,
 ​
 1) I have been wondering if there is a preferred way to upsample features. I though about 3 options:
 ​
 1.a) Upsample Layer + Conv Layer
 ​
 1.b) Transposed Conv Layer + Conv Layer
 ​
 1.c) PixelShuffle Layer + Conv Layer
 ​
 2) Also, considering option 1.c, should the Conv layer multiply the number of PixelShuffle output features by the scale factor because PixelShuffle does reduce the number of output features? i.e. I have a tensor of dims (B, C, W, H, D) and with shape (1, 60, 64, 64, 64). After the Pixel-shuffle with an upscale factor of 4 I get the tensor of shape (1, 15, 256, 256, 256). Afterwards the following Conv layer should output a tensor like:
 2.a) (1, 15, 256, 256, 256), where in_channels=15 and out_channels=15
 2.b) (1, 60, 256, 256, 256), where in_channels=15 and out_channels=60
 Note the second option reinstates the number of input features.
 ​
 3) I have an additional question that can happens in both 1.a, 1.b and 1.c options. Imagine I need to upsample my features by a factor of 8.
 3.a) Is it preferred to have multiple upsample blocks (Upsample Layer + Conv layer), where the upsample layers have a scale factor of 2, thus for this example we would have 3 upsample blocks (2 ** 3 = 8).
 3.b) Have only one upsample block where the Upsample layer has the full scale factor desired and it is then followed by one Conv layer.
 ​
 Thank you all :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 In the process of writing up a literature review for my master's thesis, I wanted to cover the impact of ReLU on the field which was significant. When looking for an original paper I came across this paper/report: https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08375. There isn't anything special about this work and as a matter of fact, I was surprised that it has thousands of citations (2974 at the moment of writing this post according to Google Scholar). Given this and that this work is not an original ReLU paper but more of a file documenting an implementation of it for a particular setup I found it quite intriguing. Then I started to dig into works that cited this and unexpectedly papers from top conferences such as NeurIPS cited the aforementioned document as a reference to the activation function. Here are some examples:
  
https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/fbb10d319d44f8c3b4720873e4177c65-Paper-Conference.pdf
 https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/69e2f49ab0837b71b0e0cb7c555990f8-Paper-Conference.pdf
  
The researchers who have done that are not referencing the original ReLU paper instead which I think is a bit disrespectful towards the achievement of original authors. On the other hand, maybe I am overthinking it a bit. ReLU has been around for a while and it would be surprising for someone conducting research in deep learning to not knowing it hence as a reader I wouldn't necessarily mind if people did not include the reference to the paper which is widely known. However, I reckon if a reference is made, then it should be meaningful and correct, and not just another extra few lines in a bibliography making it look big.

 My advisor is very understanding, supportive and took a leap of faith to fund me, since I did not have prior experience in research.
 I have been working on a problem for 4 months now and have been getting poor results for the past week. All the literature surveys, digressions within the problem statements and running the experiments to end up with not-so-good results is extremely disheartening.
 ​
 I am still continuing to run additional experiments, figuring out where things can be going wrong and trying to conduct further analysis, but I feel like I have let down my advisor. I still have the entire semester to work on it and possibly other stuff, I am motivated for it, but at times ponder over the huge chunk of time I have spent on the current work.
 ​
 How do you deal with such results and hitting the wall in your research ?
 Does it happen often ? 
 What would you advice I do to continue working ?

 If you want to stay on top of the latest trends and insights in AI, look here first.
 Why is this significant?
  
The AI system, developed by researchers at startup Osmo, can utilize 55 descriptive words to assign a smell or 'aroma' to a chemical compound or 'odorant'.
 This breakthrough might be utilized to enhance the food and cleaning product industries where synthetic scents play an essential role.
  
What’s next for this AI system?
  
The AI's predictions often aligned closer with human consensus than any individual guess, indicating its robustness and potential.
 The next step for this research is to comprehend how different odorants mix and compete to yield a smell that the human brain identifies as unique.
 However, the sheer number of combinations, even with a small set of odorants, poses a daunting task. To quote Stuart Firestein, a neurobiologist at Columbia University, “Predicting what a mix smells like is the next frontier.”

 So far I have tried three...
 GPT4All - limited to only allows for up to 13b parameter LLMs and only on CPUs (currently), also its 'localdocs' implementation I've found to only reference its docs very infrequently when answering.
 H2OGPT - it's implementation of localdocs (I believe via LangChain) seems pretty good. but seems like every time I run an instance, I would have to re-vector my documents. Not sure if there is a way to attach an VectorDB to it so it's ready to go right away.
 PrivateGPT - seems to work very well, currently it's only running on CPUs thus response time is over a minute.
 Curious if the community knows of any other products that do this and are already GPU accelerated.

 I found out that Xformer has implememation for sparse self-attention (link) but not sure whether the same would work for cross-attention. Also Xformer supports only (fixed) 2D attention mask but in my case the mask is arbitary and is different for different input. Can you suggest an efficient implementation for my scenario?

Now you can continuously stream inference responses back to the client when using SageMaker real-time inference to help you build interactive experiences for generative AI applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and music generators. With this new feature, you can start streaming the responses immediately when they’re available instead of waiting for the entire response to be generated. This lowers the time-to-first-byte for your generative AI applications. In this post, we’ll show how to build a streaming web application using SageMaker real-time endpoints with the new response streaming feature for an interactive chat use case.

 So far I have tried three...
 GPT4All - limited to only allows for up to 13b parameter LLMs and only on CPUs (currently), also its 'localdocs' implementation I've found to only reference its docs very infrequently when answering.
 H2OGPT - it's implementation of 'localdocs' (I believe via LangChain) seems pretty good. but seems like every time I run an instance, I would have to re-vector my documents. Not sure if there is a way to attach an VectorDB to it so it's ready to go right away.
 PrivateGPT - seems to work very well, currently it's only running on CPUs thus response time is over a minute.
 Curious if the community knows of any other products that do this and are already GPU accelerated.
 ​
 TY in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was going through the code for Llama-2 text generation on the official github where I stumbled across this code in the generation.py file:
 B_INST, E_INST = "[INST]", "[/INST]" SPECIAL_TAGS = [B_INST, E_INST, "<<SYS>>", "<</SYS>>"] UNSAFE_ERROR = "Error: special tags are not allowed as part of the prompt." ... ... ... unsafe_requests = [] unsafe_requests.append(any([tag in msg["content"] for tag in SPECIAL_TAGS for msg in dialog])) ... ... ... return [ { "generation": { "role": "assistant", "content": self.tokenizer.decode(t) if not unsafe else UNSAFE_ERROR, } } for t, unsafe in zip(generation_tokens, unsafe_requests) ] 
 Is there a reason why we can't have these tokens in the prompt? 
 I am planning to bypass the role based dictionary entries for the prompt and instead building my own prompt generator that'll take the the system prompts and the user prompts and generate a single string to then send to the LLM. Depending on the the user's choice I want the LLM to generate concise or detailed answers(also impose a word limit in the prompt itself), so I am planning to have this as a dropdown a user can choose. based on the system option chosen(concise/detailed answer), I then want to call my prompt generator which will add the instruction tags around the "system" and "user" prompts to generate 1 string I can then pass to the LLM.
 I wanted to know if there was any reason these tags aren't allowed to be in the prompt. Is it only to avoid "confusion" on the different roles and following a conventional way to pass the prompts? If not, and there's a reason those tags aren't supposed to be passed inside the prompts, please do let me know,, because inside the same file the chat_completion() function is doing exactly that; adding the <<SYS>> and <</SYS>> around the system prompts and prepending it to the user prompt.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! I've been working on this project for a few months as part of my thesis in Machine Learning. It's a library that provides an easy-to-use yet flexible API to design and train Diffusion Models. I decided to make it because I wanted to quickly prototype a Diffusion Model but there were no good tools to do it with. I think it really can help people prototype their own Diffusion Models a lot faster and only in a few lines of code.
 The idea is to have a model class that takes different modules corresponding to the different aspects of the Diffusion Model process (noise schedule, noise type, denoising network, loss function, guidance, etc.) and allow the user to mix and match different modules to achieve different results. The library ships with a bunch of prebuilt modules and the plan is to add many more. I also made it super easy to implement your own modules, you just need to extend from one of the base classes available.
 Below is an example of the type of interface you can expect. I'd really appreciate your feedback! Check out the project here: https://github.com/cabralpinto/modular-diffusion

Perplexities are reported relative to the actual number of English-language words in the
 test set (including an EOS token predicted by the model) 
  
How did they compute this number? Did they split sentences by space? Are punctuation symbols considered "English words"? Are chinese characters (which are present in the data) withous spaces counted as one word?
 Or is it some common knowledge that "LM1B test set contains X words"?
 The official implementation https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/d3pm/text is extremely difficult to comprehend. I spent several hours reading throug the code and I still have no idea how they computed the number of words.

 data inspection and interactive exploration is one of the most important tasks for data teams. This is especially true when dealing with unstructured data that requires a deep domain expertise (e.g. healthcare or engineering).
 We have tried many different options for visualizing unstructured datasets in the past: Notebooks, dash apps, custom react apps, HTML reports... However, these options were either very time-consuming to develop/maintain or not interactive enough or both. 
 That is why we developed Spotlight: https://github.com/Renumics/spotlight 
 https://i.redd.it/lxjnlkcmumlb1.gif
 Spotlight supports most unstructured data types including images, audio, text, videos, time-series and geometric data. 
 You can find more info and use case examples for ML and engineering workflows in the repo. 
 Happy to hear your honest feedback!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, so I am a little confused on how many target variable classes does the BERT and RoBERTa models have?
 So I understand these 2 models are pre-trained models, which means the number of target variable classes are fixed (if I am not wrong!). For example, the link below for the RoBERTa model in Hugging Face has fixed 3 target variable classes (Negative, Neutral and Positive):
 https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest
 But when I googled around and also asked ChatGPT and Bard, they tell me these models can have as many target variable classes as the user wants (or rather this depends on how many target variable classes there are in the training dataset). 
 If these are pre-trained models already (which already have the number of target variable classes pre-determined in the model already), then how come some of the google sites and ChatGPT and Bard is telling me the user can choose however many target variable classes that they want?

 Data details : I have consecutive frames of the street in which vehicles are moving.
 So far :
  
I have created a model that detects the objects inside the frame and give me the coordinates(bounding-box) of those objects(vehicles).
 
And I using the optical flow to produce the optical lines on the objects which are moving inside the consecutive frames and I am also able to get the direction(if a object is moving from top to bottom on the frame it means it is in right direction and if bottom to top in the frame it means wrong direction based on change in y-offset of the object).
 
Now the optical lines code is different which is giving me the direction of the object(I am not using any model to detect object in this code it's based on Lucas-Kadane method) and when I say direction I mean I'm using the cv2.imshow() which actually plays the consecutive frames together and draw optical lines on it and shows me the direction visually.
 
 Now the problem is I want the coordinates of the object that is moving in wrong direction (the bounding box coordinates) how can I achieve that?
 Any suggestions and ideas would be helpful please mind I can't use any other technology or model as this are project requirements in professional setting)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The dataset I have consists of around 2,300 observations and 120 variables, of which around 25 are highly correlated, so I narrowed it down to 95 variables.
 I'm using R's boost_tree() with xgboost as my model.
 How do I decide when to stop tuning for number of trees, mtry, min_n, and tree depth, without actually overfitting the data? Because as I increase the number of trees (or any other variable like the ones above), my RMSE obviously goes down, but how do I know it is overfitting the training data? Or is there no overfitting in this case, since I am using cross validation (15 fold) already?
 PS, the test data is 800 observations

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How do you usually do feature extraction for time series data? I used to work on visual domain, so I'm pretty familiar with CVs but recently I was assigned some tasks on multivariate time series data and it's been quite difficult getting used to.
 Major problem is, while features in vision have semantic meaning not just along temporal axis but also "spatially," the multivariate time series does not.
 Also, is it considered a "cheating" if i pre-extract certain features that are already established by experts to have high correlation with the result, rather than letting the machine learning algorithm learn on its own those "certain features" in some way through training?
 Thanks!

I have already completed Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and built the reward model. Now, I need some guidance on how to handle the data.
 Here is an example of the pre-collected data:
 >> User: Give me a tip on how to succeed in drawing.
 >>> ChatGPT: Practice regularly and be patient with yourself. Improvement takes time.
 >>>User: But drawing is hard.
 >>>ChatGPT: It is, and that's okay. It's normal to find it challenging, especially when you're just starting out. Just try to enjoy the process and don't be too hard on yourself.
 ​
 ==========My input Data 1 is :>> User: Give me a tip on how to succeed in drawing.
 Suppose my model outputs the following for Input Data 1: ChatGPT: Practice makes perfect.
 My question is, for Input Data 2, should I use:
 Option A: User: Give me a tip on how to succeed in drawing. ChatGPT: Practice makes perfect. User: But drawing is hard.
 In this option, I use the actual previous term's agent output and append the pre-collected user data.
 Or
 Option B: User: Give me a tip on how to succeed in drawing. ChatGPT: Practice regularly and be patient with yourself. Improvement takes time. User: But drawing is hard.
 In this option, I use all the pre-collected data, which might not even be the current model's output.
 Which option is more appropriate for RLHF, A or B?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am reading the famous paper " Unsupervised Domain Adaptation by Backpropagation" again, but still got confused why the authors had to design this gradient reversal layer.
 To my understanding, simply adding a minus-one (-1) in front of the domain classifier head is good enough. Of course, we need to minimize the original domain classifier head at some point to make it decent. For example, if it is a two-step training like GAN, we can (1) Freeze other parts but only minimize the domain classification loss to update the domain classifier head; and then (2) Freeze the domain classification head, but maximize the domain classificatoin loss to update the feature extractor. We can alternate between (1) and (2).
 Is the main motivation of gradient reversal layer that we can merge (1) and (2) into a single training step?

I've been reading it, but I got stuck trying to understand how they transition from the point where the loss is the distance between parameters to the point where the loss is the distance between gradients. Could someone please explain this process in detail? Apparently, they make the assumption that the initializations are the same and that the distance between parameters is close to zero for every iteration, but I'm still struggling to comprehend how they arrive at the conclusion that the distance is now between gradients.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US government has imposed expanded export restrictions affecting Nvidia’s leading artificial intelligence chips, curbing their exportation beyond China to certain Middle Eastern countries.
 If you want to stay on top of AI advances, look here first.
 https://preview.redd.it/xe7ho00t0ilb1.png?width=1240&format=png&auto=webp&s=61225931bf3e316efd90eab83846402d4148aca2
 Why this matters:
  
Nvidia’s A100 and H100 chips are affected: These AI chips are important and used to accelerate machine-learning tasks on major AI applications like ChatGPT. Despite the restrictions, Nvidia maintains they won’t have an “immediate material impact” on its results.
 Other companies, like AMD, are also affected: They’ve reportedly received similar restrictions notice, hinting at a broader move by the US government to control the distribution of AI chip technology.
 The move is part of a larger geopolitical play: These restrictions form part of the Biden administration’s efforts to curtail Beijing’s ability to capitalize on the AI revolution.
  
How Nvidia and the industry might respond:
  
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has cautioned the US: In a Financial Times interview, Huang warned that imposing such restrictions could lead to “enormous damage” to the US tech industry, predicting China may become self-sufficient in AI chip development.
 Yet, Nvidia still managed impressive earnings recently: Despite these challenges, Nvidia recently reported quarterly revenue of $13.5bn, exceeding predictions by $2bn.
  
Further restrictions could significantly alter the landscape for AI development, potentially fostering greater innovation in countries affected or even a race to develop independent solutions.

 From the text:
  
We believe artificial intelligence has the power to save the world—and that a thriving open source ecosystem is essential to building this future. 
 Thankfully, the open source ecosystem is starting to develop, and we are now seeing open source models that rival closed-source alternatives. Hundreds of small teams and individuals are also working to make these models more useful, accessible, and performant. 
 These projects push the state of the art in open source AI and help provide a more robust and comprehensive understanding of the technology. They include: instruction-tuning base LLMs; removing censorship from LLM outputs; optimizing models for low-powered machines; building novel tooling for model inference; researching LLM security issues; and many others. 
 However, the people behind these projects often don’t have the resources available to pursue their work to conclusion or maintain it in the long run. The situation is more acute in AI than traditional infrastructure, since even fine-tuning models requires significant GPU computing resources, especially as open source models get larger.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a bid to rival the United States’ stronghold in the AI industry, Chinese search engine and AI firm Baidu, has made its ChatGPT-equivalent language model, Ernie Bot, fully available to the public. This marks a significant move on the AI chessboard.
 If you want to stay on top of everything AI, look here first.
 https://preview.redd.it/g68sr07iihlb1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0c873badd448257bcc2fb125188acc198e504d6
 Why does this matter?
  
Baidu's public release of Ernie Bot signals the company's aggressive push in the generative AI market. By opening up its model to the public, Baidu can leverage expansive real-world human feedback to improve Ernie Bot.
 China's determination to lead the AI industry is unabated, with many tech firms launching their own generative models in response to OpenAI's popular ChatGPT. Baidu's move further fuels this rivalry.
 Regulation in China seems to support such AI advancements. CEO Robin Li voiced his optimism about the AI regulations—calling them "more pro-innovation than regulation".
  
What's the broader response?
  
Baidu's latest stride has boosted its stock price by over 3%, underlining the market's high anticipation of Baidu's AI efforts.
 Ernie Bot has rocketed to the top of Apple's iOS free app chart in China. This demonstrates a positive initial response from the public.
  
Regulation is key in China's AI game:
  
China has stringent regulations for the generative AI industry, requiring a security review and government approvals before any product launch. Moreover, companies need to comply with governmental tech and data requests.
 The US, on the other hand, doesn't currently have such regulations in place. A markedly different approach that could significantly influence the development and application of AI technologies.

 Abstract:
  
In recent years, there have been remarkable advancements in the performance of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains. As these LLMs are deployed for increasingly complex tasks, they often face the needs to conduct longer reasoning processes or understanding larger contexts. In these situations, the length generalization failure of LLMs on long sequences become more prominent. Most pre-training schemes truncate training sequences to a fixed length (such as 2048 for LLaMa). LLMs often struggle to generate fluent texts, let alone carry out downstream tasks, after longer contexts, even with relative positional encoding which is designed to cope with this problem. Common solutions such as finetuning on longer …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CoTracker - a 2D point-tracking tool for videos - promises to revolutionize motion tracking. Through the use of a transformer network, it meticulously predicts point trajectories and visibility across video frames, giving insights like never before.
 https://i.redd.it/g0u5t9n1ehlb1.gif
 Here's why CoTracker is turning heads:
  
CoTracker leverages advanced transformer formulation: Utilising a grid of input tokens that evolve to output tokens, CoTracker allocates initial values derived from the track's start point and time.
 It's built to handle extended videos through 'windowed inference': Windowing enables the algorithm to handle videos beyond its maximum window length by splitting them into overlapping segments.
 'Unrolled Learning' caters to semi-overlapping windows effectively: By employing two unique types of losses, only a modest amount of windows are used in loss computation while still handling expansive videos at test time.
 Improved tracking through simultaneous multi-point selection: By tracking multiple points at once, CoTracker is able to better establish correlation and motion paths within videos.
  
Despite its notable strengths, there are limitations. Its sliding-window approach cannot handle long-term occlusions that last longer than a window, and its transformer-based model has a high computational cost that grows quadratically with the number of tracked points.
 According to the authors, “The result is a flexible and powerful tracking algorithm that outperforms state-of-the-art methods in almost all benchmarks”. But it’s yet to be seen how it will perform in real-life tasks. What do you think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 Wanted to share an open source project we've been working on for the last few weeks: Autolabel is an open source Python library to label and enrich text datasets with LLMs (Large Language Models).
 Why?
 Access to clean, labeled data is a huge bottleneck for most ML/data science teams. From experiments across a variety of NLP tasks and datasets, we have found that the most capable LLMs are able to label data at better quality than human annotators, but 20-100x faster.
 Getting Started¶
 You can get started with the library by defining a JSON config, and writing a few lines of code:
 from autolabel import LabelingAgent, AutolabelDataset agent = LabelingAgent('config.json') dataset = AutolabelDataset('dataset.csv', 'config.json') labels = agent.run(dataset) 
  
Installation guide
 Sample notebooks that show how to use the library for different labeling tasks.
 Technical report for benchmarking LLM and human annotator performance across a range of tasks and datasets.
  
Call for Feedback
 We just open sourced this library, and are actively developing it. Feedback is very welcome and so are requests for features. You can open an issue on Github for bugs and request features

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the realm of deep learning, the choice of activation functions and optimization algorithms can significantly impact the training process and the performance of neural networks. A relatively lesser-known gem in this landscape is the "leaky softplus" activation function, which, when paired with momentum-based optimizers like Adam, can lead to exceptionally efficient and effective training outcomes.
 The Leaky Softplus Activation Function
 The leaky softplus activation function combines the benefits of both linearity and non-linearity in a graceful manner. Defined as Math.Log(Math.Exp(x) + 1) + (x / 16), it smoothly transitions between a nearly linear response for negative inputs and a more pronounced non-linear response for positive inputs. This unique characteristic enables it to address…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I built DeepEval - an open-source unit testing framework for LLMs in order to accelerate development and iteration. 
 The problem
 When designing software applications, testing has always been critical for a lot of production applications. However - with the rise of LLM applications, the type of testing required needs to change in order to adapt for the large number of possible queries. We therefore built DeepEval in order to make it easy to write LLM tests in just 1 line of code. We hope this solution is of value to future teams when iterating on their RAG pipelines, migrating LLM models, testing their fine-tuned LLMs.
 The solution
 The DeepEval framework is as follows: We split up testing LLMs into 4 main sections:
 - Answer Relevancy (how relevant an answer is to a question) - measured using a question-answer bi-encoder.
 - Factual consistency (whether the generated answer is hallucinating) - measured using entailment from an NLI model
 - Conceptual similarity (when given a ground truth, how closely does it relate to it - for example How big is it? The size of an orange vs 20 square centimetres.) - measured using vector similarity
 - Bias, Toxic classification (measured through DL classifier models)
 I would love any feedback on what we are building here and welcome any OS contributions!

 DINOv2 has outperformed previous state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods on a variety of computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. It is also more efficient to train than previous methods, making it more accessible to researchers and practitioners.
 DINOv2 is different from existing methods because it provides a new way to train high-performance computer vision models without the need for labeled data. This makes it possible to train models on large datasets of unlabeled images, which can be more cost-effective and time-efficient than collecting and labeling large datasets of images.

But for neural networks, techniques like GANs allow the minimisation of other distances like Mutual Information or Reverse KL. While this is certainly a very cool and insightful approach, it's also highly complex. I wonder wether other approaches to this problem exist for the simpler case, like fitting a gaussian or some other analytic distribution.
 From statistics, I have only encountered maximum likelihood and it's variations like robust statistics.

 Traj_A = [t = 1, t= 2, t=3 ,.... t = 100]
 Traj_B = [t =1 , t=2, ... t= 78] 
 Now, I heard you usually break this down onto mini-batch (say a batchsize of 6). 
 Do you do random sampling?
 eg, one batch is [Traj_A_t=1, Traj_A_t=2, Traj_A_t=100, Traj_A_t=66, Traj_A_t=77, Traj_A_t=55]???
 OR do you need to maintain some sequence [Traj_A_t=1, Traj_A_t=2, Traj_A_t=3, Traj_A_t=4, Traj_A_t=5, Traj_A_t=6]???

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US government is taking steps to address the complex and controversial issues around AI and intellectual property rights. The US Copyright Office is opening a public comment period on August 30th to hear from various stakeholders on the topic.
 Important Details:
  
The agency is asking for comments on three main questions: How should AI be defined and categorized for the purposes of copyright? What are the implications of AI for the rights of authors and owners of works? What are the implications of AI for the liability and responsibility of users and distributors of works?
 The agency also wants to hear about related issues, such as: how AI may affect publicity rights and unfair competition laws. The agency notes that AI may create works that mimic or impersonate the voices, likenesses, or styles of real people, which could raise ethical and legal concerns.
 Finally, they want to determine how AI may affect moral rights and cultural heritage: The agency acknowledges that AI may create works that are derivative or transformative of existing works, which could affect the reputation and integrity of the original creators and their communities.
  
The deadline to submit your comments is October 18th and specific instructions for submitting comments are available on the Copyright Office website.
 P.S. If you like this kind of analysis, I write a free newsletter that tracks the most relevant news and research in AI and tech—stay updated in under 3 mins/day.

 We are looking for AI that can read tables, charts, figures, and spreadsheets, and possibly run statistics on this information.
 We are also looking for AI that can be given a prompt and will write on chosen topic with proper citation of sources. This information will not be used for publication, but rather, to organize main ideas and provide examples.
 An art AI that can draw or mimic images of real insects would be nice as well.
 Preferably these will all be free to use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR: American, Graduated from U of Michigan in 2019 w/ 3.3 GPA Bs in Comp Sci. Worked at Google for 3 years. Samsung Research America for 3 months. No ML specific work experience. No research. Will I get in to European elite ML programs? If not what do I need to do?
 My GF and I want to study our masters together in Europe. She’s doing business I want to do ML/AI.
 I spent the past year kind of goofing off. Got kind of burned out and decided I was going to get into music production so spent the pst year mainly doing that with some software mixed in. 
 Recently been self studying ML, both the math from textbooks and trying my hand at some models in python.
 I do not have any connections to academia currently and wil have to beg a professor who barely knew me from undergrad for a rec. Can get other recs from past bosses.
 My plan right now is to look for job hopefully in AI but maybe just more general software engineering again, but long term I want to get a masters in person.
 My current resume looks like:
 Graduated BS in Comp Sci from univ of Michigan 2019 3.3 GPA
 Worked at Google for 3 years Worked at Samsung Research America for 4 months Some self study I can claim but not much tangible proof
 Recommendation from Google Boss (Maybe) recommendation from UofM CS professor that barely knew me
 My questions to anyone that knows the admissions right now are:
 1) Do you think I get to one off this? (To anyone of these schools)
 2) If not what are the things to prioritize to improve my chances? What are the timeline of these steps? Can I do them in the next few months or have to wait till next year?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm relatively new to the space of AI chatbots and I figured I'd get my hands wet with a small personal project. While researching the topic of long term conversational memory I noticed most people are using text embedding in combination with textual summary to generate a conversation history for the AI's prompt. However, this technique seems to have many drawbacks such as loss of details in the summarization process. I was wondering if anyone has experience using knowledge graph DBs like neo4j for conversational memory instead, and what the pros and cons of such an approach are compared to summarization. I'd be greatly interested in any resources that could further my knowledge in this space as my primary goal is to learn from this project. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent research proposes that Large Language Models (LLMs) may not be as reliable as we think. In fact, the order of options in a multiple-choice question drastically influences the responses from LLMs such as GPT-4 and InstructGPT.
 If you want to stay on top of the latest trends and insights in AI and tech, look here first.
 https://preview.redd.it/k8yaixbjzalb1.png?width=1289&format=png&auto=webp&s=99ac6280a1e7415f46c0c11938ae20e2b77674b4
 What are the findings?
  
LLM sensitivity to multiple-choice arrangement: The study suggests if options in multiple-choice questions are reordered, the LLM's performance varies dramatically— approximately 13% to 75% depending on the benchmark.
 Positional bias shapes responses: When the LLM is uncertain between top-selected answers, the option positioning can artificially lean its predictions. Observations also found that LLMs favor specific placements when unsure of the optimal response among top-selected answers.
 Performance improves when calibration techniques are applied: Making use of two unique calibration methods, the performance of LLMS saw up to eight percentage points of increase across numerous models and benchmarks.
  
Why does this matter?
 This moves us closer to identifying the factors contributing to LLMs' sensitivity and highlights the significance of recognizing and confronting these sensitivities to improve real-world usability and reliability.

I have some data, around 1000's transcribed sentences with their corresponding images of text. TrOCR looked great, but it still makes a lot of mistakes, probably because of the old English phraseology, so I tried to finetune it with my data and see if it improves and that didn't happen. 
 The data I used to train was my 1000 sentences + some public dataset with another 2500 sentences, so just about 3500 sentences in total. Do you think it's because the data is small, that the performance is bad?
 I'm finetuning "microsoft/trocr-base-stage1" using native PyTorch. 
 If not TrOCR do you recommend any OCR/HTR models I can finetune to my handwritten historical data? I truly appreciate any guidance you send my way.

Automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology has made conversations more accessible with live captions in remote conferencing software, mobile applications, and head-worn displays. However, to maintain real-time responsiveness, live caption systems often display interim predictions that are updated as new utterances are received. This can cause text instability (a “flicker” where previously displayed text is updated, shown in the captions on the left in the video below), which can impair users' reading experience due to distraction, fatigue, and difficulty following the conversation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 Hopefully this is of interest to some of you. For those that don't know, normalising flows can be used as black-box unconditional or conditional distribution approximators, that support both exact sampling and density evaluations. For an excellent review see https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02762.
 I am developing flowjax, a Python package for normalising flows, distributions and bijections. It uses Jax for automatic differentiation, and the equinox framework built by Patrick Kidger to allow for a familiar object-oriented design.
 It includes many powerful flows, e.g. masked autoregressive flows, coupling flows and block neural autoregressive flows. In addition to inheriting some benefits from using JAX (easy GPU support, some efficiency gains), here's a few points where I think flowjax has some advantages over other packages:
  
Comprehensive documentation
 Simplified definitions of unconditional/conditional bijections and distributions (particularly nicer handling of the conditional case, which some packages seem to stitch in as an afterthought).
 Easy to plug in different "transformer" bijections to coupling/masked autoregressive flows.
 Use of efficiency tricks to optimize run times (e.g. circumventing recompilation of identical layers using jax.lax.scan over the flow layers)
  
It has been used in a couple of papers already, but it would be great to have some more people using it and some feedback/suggestions/contributions. There are examples in the documentation for those that are interested.

My current strategy is to subset the data into different categories and run iforest on a single column. 
 I feel as though this method might not be the best because it basically creates a tree with a single branch and measures how many nodes away a given record might be. My confidence scores never seem to exceed around -.17 on a scale of [-1,1] where -1 tends to more confidence in anomalous behavior
 Is there a better way?
 Note: Anomalies in my data occur very infrequently

How do you know that your getting the quality output from the model that you need to ship the feature or model? Are the audits ad hoc data sampling and subjective "good/bad" ratings or have you figured out a more rigorous framework? Is it pretty much ~vibes~ based?
 What, if any, tools or processes are you putting into place to monitor and observe the LLM when its interacting with real time user data for weeks or months?
 
 Most of the folks I have spoken with are doing very ad hoc sampled output and writing down on post its or in a spreadsheet a subjective quality ratings. 
 One person had developed a slightly more rigorous 3 question survey on "is the result factual", "is the result cogent" and "is the result useful". Not everyone is logging their LLM responses they show users which feels very risky to me.
 Anyone aware of any industry standards being established around this?

 Is this correct? If so, I see no reason why anyone would use OpenAI's api instead of Azure's, as they cost the same but there's no usage limit. Especially if you expect to increase api usage in the future.

 I'm working on a problem which has a custom gym environment which I've made, and as it interacts with multiple other modules which have their own quirks, I need to use a reinforcement learning library which works in a specific way that I've only seen PFRL use. 
 The training loop needs to be in this format: 'obs, reward, done = agent.step(action)', 'agent.observe(obs, reward, ... )' rather than what I see in most modern RL libraries where you define an agent and then run a '.train()' method. 
 Are there any libraries which work in this way? I'd love to use something like StableBaselines but they don't seem to play nice and I'd rather not rewrite the gym environment if I can avoid it.

 For a couple of months, I've been thinking about how can GPT be utilized to generate fully working apps, and I still haven't seen any project that I think has a good approach. I just don't think that Smol developer or GPT engineer can create a fully working production-ready app from scratch without a developer being involved and without any debugging process.
 So, I came up with an idea that I've outlined thoroughly in the blog post above, but basically, I have 3 main "pillars" that I think a dev tool that generates apps needs to have:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've received a freelance job offer from a company in the banking sector that wants to host their own LLAMA 2 model in-house.
 I'm hesitating to accept the gig. While I'll have access to the hardware (I've estimated that an A100 80GB will be required to host the 16B parameter version and process some fine-tuning & RAG), I'm not familiar with the challenges of self-hosting a model of this scale. I've always relied on managed services like Hugging Face or Replicate for model hosting.
 For those of you who have experience in self-hosting such large models, what do you think will be the main challenges of this mission if I decide to take it on?
 ​
 Edit: Some additional context information
 Size of the company: Very small ~ 60 employees
 Purpose: This service will be combined with a vector store to search content such as Word, Excel and PowerPoint files stored on their servers. I'll implement the RAG pattern and do some prompt engineering with it. They also want me to use it for searching things on specific websites and APIs, such as stock exchanges, so I (probably) need to fine-tune the model based on the search results and the tasks I want the model to do after retrieving the data.

In this note, we present a comprehensive definition of MDPs and provide a detailed derivation of the Bellman equations, along with the optimality results. Our approach aims to ensure a thorough understanding by avoiding the omission of any steps in the mathematical proofs. The primary goal is to facilitate reading classic textbooks on (approximate) dynamic programming, optimal control, and reinforcement learning, where proofs and derivations can sometimes obscure crucial details, making them less accessible to readers from diverse scientific and engineering backgrounds.

 So far I found those and read readme files: https://github.com/dickreuter/neuron_poker https://github.com/fschlatt/clubs_gym https://rlcard.org/ https://www.deepmind.com/open-source/openspiel
 Did anybody work on similar project? Which gym did you use, and what experience do you have with it? 
 Since, adversarial policies tend to work better for high-dimensionality I would prefer to 6players variant. I know that modern poker ai approach are not based on pure RL, but I want to check how vulnerable are classic RL poker models.

 https://preview.redd.it/3q8lcq0k96lb1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=fce7a0e3225c64353ad6c51f65e8b490e795feed
 If you want to stay on top of the latest trends and insights in AI and tech, look here first.
 What's the big idea?
  
Microsoft's AoT aims to fuse the accuracy of algorithms with the nuances of human reasoning. A bold aspiration indeed, but not a new one. The goal to empower computers to learn for themselves – akin to human cognition - has been an AI objective since its inception back in the 1950s.
 The AoT could be seen as an attempt to resolve the drawbacks of the "Chain of Thought" (CoT) approach. LLMs following the CoT approach can provide incorrect steps to the right answer, as they base conclusions on precedent.
 With AoT, the model works to evaluate the soundness of initial steps or "thoughts," reducing the risk of one incorrect step leading to disproportionate results.
  
What could AoT do?
  
Mitigate AI "hallucinations:" These funny— but disconcerting — instances of AI outputting false information.
 Enhance the integrity of AI interaction: programmers suggest that improvement in this aspect is crucial for aligning AGI (artificial general intelligence).
  
The takeaway:
  
AI's ability to understand and process information like a human being is a longstanding goal in the field. With AoT, Microsoft seems to be making strides toward achieving it.
 Much remains to be seen on its efficacy: How it will impact the broader AI ecosystem and the user experiences it can create.

 I'm writing this post to share some of the strategies we use for using LLMs in production, we've served over 2M+ queries so far
 TLDR: Use Caching + Model Fallbacks for reliability. This post goes into detail of our fallbacks implementation
 Using LLMs reliably in production involves the following components:
  
Caching - Cache Embedding() and Completion() for all models
 Model Fallbacks - set fallback_models=['gpt-3.5-turbo', 'command-nightly', 'llama2]. If primary model fails try fallback models. This deals with rate-limiting errors and when Provider APIs go down

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stanford researchers have unveiled a groundbreaking artificial intelligence (AI) framework known as DSPy. Designed to utilize Language Models (LMs) and Retrieval Models (RMs) optimally, DSPy is set to make AI programming more powerful, intuitive, and efficient.
 Why does this matter?
  
DSPy was built with complex tasks in mind. LMs, like GPT-3, generate Human-like text from given inputs, while RMs retrieve relevant data. DSPy combines their capabilities, enabling tasks like summarizing information from databases.
 It works on Pythonic syntax, using declarative and composable modules to instruct LMs.
 DSPy's automatic compiler finetunes the LM to run any program's steps. it replaces manual intermediate-stage labeling and string manipulation with systematic modular pieces.
  
What's unique about DSPy?
  
It introduces "Signatures" and "Teleprompters" that compile your program. A 'signature' explains the task and inputs for the LM, while Teleprompters improve the effectiveness of prompts.
 Compared to other libraries, DSPy requires minimal labeling and bootstraps any needed intermediate labels.
  
In short, DSPy simplifies delivering more nuanced instructions to AI and retrieving more detailed and accurate responses, thus widening the spectrum of tasks AIs can accomplish.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I'm trying to understand how to get an LLM to imitate someone, say Shakespeare. It's easy enough to get all of Shakespeare's work.
 If I've understood the current state of play for LLMs, there are three options:
  
Fine tune an LLM
 Vectorize your knowledge using something like ChromaDB. Do a similarity search after each prompt and get the LLM to "read" the top n docs
 Do both
  
I have a feeling that to imitate Shakespeare, fine tuning an LLM might work best.
 However, if my understanding is correct, the inputs to finetune an LLM must be formatted this way:
 <human>: "To be" <system>: "Or not to be" 
 The gap I'm having trouble bridging is how do I go from a large text file to this input format? The only idea I've come across is format all of the text like so:
 <human>: "sentence_1" <system>: "sentence_2" <human>: "sentence_2" <system>: "sentence_3" 
 Are there best practices around this problem? How should I be thinking about this?
 I've seen companies like character.ai create bots that imitate Elon Musk accurately for example so I know it's doable. I just wonder if they've done it by finetuning an LLM or training one from scratch or something else entirely.

DeepMind's head of research, Pushmeet Kohli, shared the following details:

 Despite any subsequent cropping or editing, the watermark remains identifiable by DeepMind's software. Colors, contrast, or size changes won't affect it.
  
Calls for a standard approach to AI-generated image identification continue:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Surely something like this has been tried, but here’s the setup in my head. Tell me if it’s crazy or what you think. 
 Given input vector X do a hidden layer but instead of an activation function pair up neighboring dimensions of the hidden layer vector result and rotate them about the origin in 2d. This would give some kind of nonlinearity surely? The amount they are rotated can be selected by a trainable variable. Of course this requires your hidden layer dimension be divisible by 2. Then this hidden layer can go to an output layer Y.
 Curious what smarter more experienced people think of this kind of nonlinearity via paired rotation. 
 My thinking was that if you take the vector A representing all the possible data from your generating function for your dataset (maybe even an infinite dimensional vector if you can generate unlimited data) . Then if you rotate A along so many dimensions you could reach the output vector P which is all the Y values corresponding to A. 
 One way to kind of do this would be to split your dataset in half, and then you could have multiple iterations of each dataset rotated by a trainable angle each. This would rotate only each 2 grouped dimensions that you chose when you split the dataset. 
 Hopefully I’m using the right words to convey this. I’m just a hobbyist. Thanks for the feedback!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quite recently, I jumped on the boat of trying out llama. I noticed codellama did not provide any inference code. Yes, it provided python files which lets you run the inference but not a programming method rather terminal approach. 
 Terminal approach is great as it allows experts to run and perform inference+evaluation easily. But, if you are just starting out/new/non-seasoned programmer/individual in AI, it is frustrating. Because one, you can't play with actual code, limiting learning opportunities and two, it does not produces the curiosity in most cases to read all the code. 
 On top of that, I realised there was a lack of repositories and articles on this subject to load code-llama even with third-party methods. Which is why, I wrote two notebooks which outlines the process of how you can load code-llama from FAIR repository using code. [Believe me it's fun and filled with learning opportunities] and two how you can use Huggingface to load the model and perform inference. 
 Few points:
 1. Performing inference from FAIR repo, requires significant amount of computing resources even for 7B model.
 2. Huggingface method can be loaded using free Google Colab subscription.

 In short; we are in the process of developing an FX Macroeconomic Sentiment Divergence Trading Algorithm. There are currently 4 participants in the project (2 Developers and 2 Traders), 3 of whom work for Tier1 IBs in market-facing roles. 1 of the Developers is likely going to leave the project and we are interested in speaking to someone about picking up his part of the project.
 There are 3 parts to the project. The first part is mostly complete, now leaving the other 2 parts for us to start working on. We have manually backtested the strategy and it proves to be very profitable - more details can be shared about the strategy and results upon engagement.
 We are all VP-level in our roles and have around 10-15 years of experience in our requisite field. The tech stack for the project is Python, Java, Kafka, MongoDB and Springboot. We are also very interested in integrating some AI/ML modeling, so if you have any experience in this field that would be a big advantage
 A Banking background and being UK-based is a non-negotiable. If you feel like this could apply to you, get in touch! :)

I have an app that needs GPUs for DL inference (I don’t need GPUs for training, I own a 3070 TI). My DL model inference is pretty slow (the model framework I'm using is known to be slow) so either one machine with multiple beefy GPUs or multiple GPUs on separate machines will be necessary. My machines will be running custom docker containers.
 Slow inference:
  
I was planning on putting a few GPU instances behind nginx load balancer and running pytriton on the instances. Since inference is pretty slow, I’m worried if multiple people send requests to a server at the same time, there will be significant delays on responses. Has anyone ran into this before and have insight on streamlining slow inference/scaling demand?

 Github: https://github.com/shibhansh/loss-of-plasticity
 Abstract:
  
Modern deep-learning systems are specialized to problem settings in which training occurs once and then never again, as opposed to continual-learning settings in which training occurs continually. If deep-learning systems are applied in a continual learning setting, then it is well known that they may fail to remember earlier examples. More fundamental, but less well known, is that they may also lose their ability to learn on new examples, a phenomenon called loss of plasticity. We provide direct demonstrations of loss of plasticity using the MNIST and ImageNet datasets repurposed for continual learning as sequences of tasks. In ImageNet, binary classification performance dropped from 89\% accuracy on an early task down to 77\%, about the level of a linear network, on the 2000th task. Loss of plasticity occurred with a wide range of deep network architectures, optimizers, activation functions, batch normalization, dropout, but was substantially eased by L2-regularization, particularly when combined with weight perturbation. Further, we introduce a new algorithm -- continual backpropagation -- which slightly modifies conventional backpropagation to reinitialize a small fraction of less-used units after each example and appears to maintain plasticity indefinitely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introducing SelFee—a reinvented and powerful language model that uses self-feedback and self-revision to generate high-quality responses backed by a team of researchers from KAIST. Unlike previous models, SelFee doesn't rely on external, large-scale language or task-specific models, tipping the scales in the AI world.
 If you want to stay ahead of the curve in AI and tech, look here first.
 https://i.redd.it/bgszhpai43lb1.gif
 Why it matters?
  
SelFee, built on the base of LLaMA-based instruction-following model and fine-tuned, offers a fresh approach - generating an initial solution and self-feedback sequences and then revising its answers until a high-quality response is achieved.
 Data used for its training and model evaluation was collected from varied sources and fine-tuned with OpenAI API calls, beating the 13B SelFee model with a minimal 7B SelFee model that generated at least three revisions.
 SelFee proves the potential of iterative revision in enhancing language model responses, indicating that an increase in inference computation of a model may be superior to merely magnifying its size.
  
Features and Limitations:
  
SelFee's effective use of self-feedback significantly improves response quality, avoiding the requirement of external, large-scale language or task-specific models, translating into faster, cost-effective LLM solutions.
 However, lacking in certain areas compared to ChatGPT, such as math, reasoning, factuality, and coding, SelFee has room for further improvement and growth.
  
The revolution in the AI language model landscape is promising but still an evolving journey, with SelFee being the latest participant driving this change.

 Unlike polynomial interpolants in equispaced points, interpolants in Chebyshev nodes have excellent approximation properties (see Myth 1 of [1]). If a function is Lipchitz continuous, they converge; if a function is smooth with v derivatives and bounded variation for the v-th derivative, then they converge O(n^-v); and if a function is analytic, they converge geometrically.
 The Chebyshev Gauss-Lobatto nodes define a sequence of nested points, X^1, X^2, ..., that make it possible to build Smolyak sparse grids at Chebyshev nodes ([2], [3]).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently thinking about how to implement the "similar keywords" feature. I've prepared a table with keywords that are extracted from several hundred other tables. It includes basic information such as "keyword," "type," "words" (indicating the number of words in a keyword, e.g., "first name" will have "words" = 2), as well as some technical fields (such as database, table, etc.).
 In our data product, after entering a specific keyword, we have various pieces of information (which I'm not currently focusing on), and among them, we have "SIMILAR KEYWORDS." The results are displayed based on simple SQL queries, for instance:
 ​
 SELECT word, SUM(CASE WHEN type IN ('N', 'T') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS count, COUNT(\*) \* CASE WHEN (word + '%') LIKE u/word \+ '%' THEN 1.5 ELSE 1 END AS score FROM object_keywords WHERE ('% ' + word + '%') LIKE '%' + u/word + '%' AND (database_id = u/database_id OR u/database_id IS NULL) AND ( .... more technical information here. 
 ​
 I'm wondering how to improve this process. Would it be worth considering some AI solutions, or should I focus on enhancing the current SQL scripts (e.g., think about a more advanced scoring system)?
 What are your thoughts on this? Has anyone worked on something similar?

Pg 44, para 2, part 1 : "advantage of viewing inductive inference systems in terms of their inductive bias is that it provides a nonprocedural means of characterizing their policy for generalizing"
  
 Are there any general procedures to identify and validate the inductive bias of a system?
 Are there any guidelines to ensure the inferred definition of inductive bias is without errors?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The usage and fear surrounding ChatGPT aren't as prevalent as you might think, according to a recent poll from Pew Research. Only 18% of Americans have reportedly used ChatGPT. The demographic that uses it the most? Men aged 18-29 that are college-educated, but even that's just a 30-40% usage rate.
 https://preview.redd.it/0ax222gxczkb1.jpg?width=620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d3b04169d5de1985d1c52dce7962b5f3a543b014
 Why does this matter?
  
ChatGPT has still managed to gain a remarkable level of popularity, despite low usage. This suggests that even though not many people are using it, they are aware of it and its potential capabilities. More people reported using ChatGPT for entertainment or to educate themselves rather than for work.
 People anticipate AI to have a greater impact on jobs such as software engineers, graphic designers, and journalists. But the expectation is that AI as a whole, not just ChatGPT, will be the driving force behind this.
 Concern about AI is increasing, not decreasing. 47% of respondents said AI makes them more worried than excited, compared to 31% last year. This concern seems to rise with the level of AI knowledge one possesses.
  
Industries unshaken by AI:
  
As per the survey, employed individuals who are aware of ChatGPT don't see it drastically affecting their jobs. The sectors like hospitality, entertainment, construction, and manufacturing feel the least threatened.

 Several top news publications like The New York Times, CNN and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) have blocked Microsoft-backed OpenAI to access their content to train its AI models.[2]
 Intel on Monday said a new data center chip coming out next year will handle more than double the amount of computing work that can be done for each watt of power used, part of a broader industry push to lower electricity consumption.[3]
 OpenAI unveiled the new service, dubbed “ChatGPT Enterprise,” in a company blog post and said it will be available to business clients for purchase as of Monday. The new offering promises to provide “enterprise-grade security and privacy” combined with “the most powerful version of ChatGPT yet” for businesses looking to jump on the generative AI bandwagon.[4]

Right now I am trying to make an ML model that predicts "legendary" QBs of the past performances against current NFL teams. I'll be using Jupyter and Sklearn to do this. However, and maybe this is me overthinking things, I'm not sure how sklearn is going to interpret the data in the dataset. Right now I have a dataset containing all these QBs data (passing stats, strengths and weaknesses, etc.). My teams version of the data is essentially going to be the inverse of all these things. I'm just not quite sure what to target when im testing the data that will determine the "prediction" of the legend QBs stat line against the current team. In better words, how will the computer know that I'm trying to find the yards and touchdowns a QB would produce against a certain team when there's not really any target data for this. I feel as though all I have is data that contributes to a potential target data but I lack target data itself and I'm not sure what to do in that regard. I’m making use of supervised learning and decisión trees btw.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll start with the obvious - AWS guides are the worst. We all felt it. So, trying to build automation with them becomes M:I, or better yet, Oppenheimer.
 For the first time, our MLOps team had to build a CI/CD pipeline for ML training and deployment using SageMaker. We had ZERO ideas on how to do it, so we had to go through the rigorous process of using AWS guides and tutorials, scattered over a gazillion places, just to figure out how to configure our project with SageMaker and build infra for CI/CD.
 Usually, when this thing happens, we extend the project lifecycle and have a team member document the process so we can refer back to it when we need to do it again.
 Knowing this can be beneficial to the community, we decided to share a series of 3 blogs that guide you through the process of building CI/CD pipelines for continuous training and deployment with AWS SageMaker.
 We published the first blog, which covers the configuration part, and plan to publish the rest in the following week.
 Check it out: https://dagshub.com/blog/setup-sagemaker-for-ci-cd-pipelines/
 I'm sure we can improve this tutorial, and would love to learn from your experience on how we can do it! 🤗

 Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13418

 Abstract:
  
Scientific knowledge is predominantly stored in books and scientific journals, often in the form of PDFs. However, the PDF format leads to a loss of semantic information, particularly for mathematical expressions. We propose Nougat (Neural Optical Understanding for Academic Documents), a Visual Transformer model that performs an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) task for processing scientific documents into a markup language, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a new dataset of scientific documents. The proposed approach offers a promising solution to enhance the accessibility of scientific knowledge in the digital age, by bridging the gap between human-readable documents and machine-readable text. We release the models and code to accelerate future work on scientific text recognition.

 It would not matter so much if the models had high failure rate, but as the models are getting closer and closer to 100%, the wrong answers will matter more and more.

Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing tasks. However, their practical deployment is hindered by their immense memory and computation requirements. Although recent post-training quantization (PTQ) methods are effective in reducing memory footprint and improving the computational efficiency of LLM, they hand-craft quantization parameters, which leads to low performance and fails to deal with extremely low-bit quantization. To tackle this issue, we introduce an Omnidirectionally calibrated Quantization (OmniQuant) technique for LLMs, which achieves good performance in …]]></summary>

 I am starting my career transition, and would be interested to know how long it might take me to acquire the skills needed to work for a company. Likewise, I would like to know if it is necessary (or important) to have a professional degree to get a job.
 Just to give you some context about me, I am currently a recently graduated lawyer, so my degree has not given me a strong mathematical background. However, my strongest area of learning has always been mathematics, so despite not having a very advanced background, I consider myself to be a pretty good and fairly quick learner.
 I would also like to know if you consider if my professional career could be useful in some machine learning context.
 If you could recommend me some courses, inputs or guide to study in an organized way on the subject I would be very grateful.
 Thank you very much in advance.

However, these models are not always aligned with human preferences and values and may produce harmful or undesirable content if not properly guided. Aligning LLMs with human preferences can also improve their performance on downstream tasks. One way to achieve this alignment is to use reinforcement learning from feedback (RLHF), which learns a reward model from human input and then fine-tunes the LLM using a reinforcement learning (RL) objective.
 However, RLHF methods often face challenges such as computational cost, reward hacking, and data quality. To address these issues, researchers from DeepMind propose a new method called Reinforced Self-Training (ReST), which is inspired by gro…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I am at a bit of a crossroads and hope for some advice from the community. I also hope the answers would help others who are in my situation right now.
 I used to work on vision-related problems utilizing Deep learning back in a day, with all fun included: trying out new models, implementing data pipelines, evaluating various metrics... It was a rather big company with its own data collection efforts and enough resources for training. So, I am definitely not a beginner and have some experience.
 At my current job, I am not doing any ML/DL at the momemt, and while the stuff I am doing is still cool and I enjoy it, I am missing good old ML and having a feeling that I am hanging behind as the time goes by. So I figured it would be nice to start a hobby project, preferably in the area of vision-related applications of deep learning. However, I feel a bit lost as in what would be the most efficient approach taking into account I would only have a coule of hours per week for it.
 Here are possible ways to go I am thinking of:
  
take a paper, implement it from scratch with PyTorch
 clone an existing project, contribute with code improvements/better test coverage
 take an existing pre-trained model, adapt to a slightly different task and fine-tune
  
While the first option is of cource the most exciting, the problem is you have to pay for a powerful GPU and data storage which might be impractical (my PC has a 4 GB GTX 1650 TI). Cloud storages exist, and I would be willing to even spend something on training but would like to avoid the costs.
 So, the question would be: has enyone faced similar situation? Which way did you end up going? Any general tips? Thanks!

 This, to me, amounts to a bait and switch where a high quality chatbot is offered for a certain price, then swapped out with an inferior product capable only of reproducing past interactions. This is made worse by the fact that they advertise temperature as one of the variables you can set. Temperature is a variable that can only apply to uniquely generated output and has no effect on simple repetition of previous responses. This makes their practice doubly deceptive, and makes it clear (in my view) that they are trying to deceive customers.

An output of another LLM (embedding model) or any other way (maybe just an average of a few tokens as an example)?
 Essentially - I am curious if there's a NLP approach analogy to Textual Inversion techniques in image generation models. I could imagine this being useful for things like RAG or personalization (if you could have a "user" token). Surely I'm not the first to think of this so I would love some pointers to any papers/blogs etc in this space.

To overcome this, the open-vocabulary detection task (OVD) has emerged, utilizing image-text pairs for training and incorporating new category names at test time by associating them with the image content. By treating categories as text embeddings, open-vocabulary detectors can predict a wide range of unseen objects. Various techniqu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I’ve heard countless times people saying “I want to integrate ML in my product” and recently “I love ChatGPT, I should integrate it in my product”. Yet, as I dived deeper, seeking the genuine reasons and pain points driving this request, I regularly found the same pattern: many had no clear motive for their AI aspirations. It seemed as if they were only jumping on the trend because “everyone else is doing it”, or because their “CEO” told them to do so.
 So my question is : why do you integrate AI/ML into your products? Is it to enhance your user experience? Is to automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks? Is it to stay ahead of your competition? or is it just because everyone is doing it?

It's based on a Biomimicry principle and has some really cool features. I've tested it using various pre-loaded library datasets like CIFAR and MINST, as well as adapting it to a few Kaggle competitions. It has achieved some pretty amazing results by using it's unique adaptability; which comes down to figuring out how the Holistic and Reductionist model architectures can best utilize their roles and how they can combine dynamically.

This could lead to new philosophical and ethical questions around what it means to be human and what our role should be in a world where machines are more capable than we are. 
 There is also the risk that AI systems could be used for malicious purposes, such as cyber attacks or surveillance. Like an alien invasion, the emergence of super-intelligent AI could represent a significant disruption to human society and our way of life. 
 How can we balance the potential benefits of AI with the need to address the potential risks and uncertainties that it poses?

 I am wondering what the best way to inform these agents of this cumulative action constraint? I have appended it to my state vector but since the observation without this cumulative action is still a 625*1 vector, I think adding that constraint as just one additional state is causing it to be drowned out by the state size.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Slack questions are a huge time sink. For the person asking, they generally have no idea how to find the info and may not hear back for hours. For the person answering, it’s a distraction and often requires digging up old knowledge.
 The idea is simple: give an LLM your organizational context and plop it in Slack to answer things for you.
 DanswerBot is free to use and open source (MIT). You can connect it to Slack, Google Drive, GitHub, Confluence, Jira, local files, websites, and much more.
 Quick Demo Vid: https://youtu.be/EjDDvt5GbS8 
 Some additional neat features you may be interested in:
  
LLM generated answers backed by quotes to reduce hallucination
 
Supports a wide range of LLMs (both open source and proprietary)
 
Multi-Vector embeddings for accurate vector search
 
BM-25 Keyword search
 
Learning from user feedback
 
Custom NLP model to classify user intent
 
Polls your data sources every 10 minutes to keep knowledge up to date
 
Links back to your document sources
 
Document level access control
 
Admin dashboard to configure connectors to 14 (for now) of the most popular workplace tools
 
 If you aren’t a slack user (or if you just prefer a more tailored UI), there’s also a web interface to ask questions against your knowledge base. A short demo for that can be found at: https://youtu.be/cWWtnuVCUX0
 If you’re interested in testing this out yourself, the docs to help you launch Danswer with a single command can be found at https://docs.danswer.dev/quickstart!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12013
  
Generative models realized with machine learning techniques are powerful tools to infer complex and unknown data distributions from a finite number of training samples in order to produce new synthetic data. Diffusion models are an emerging framework that have recently overcome the performance of the generative adversarial networks in creating synthetic text and high-quality images. Here, we propose and discuss the quantum generalization of diffusion models, i.e., three quantum-noise-driven generative diffusion models that could be experimentally tested on real quantum systems. The idea is to harness unique quantum features, in particular the non-trivial interplay among coherence, entanglement and noise that the currently available noisy quantum processors do unavoidably suffer from, in order to overcome the main computational burdens of classical diffusion models during inference. Hence, we suggest to exploit quantum noise not as an issue to be detected and solved but instead as a very remarkably beneficial key ingredient to generate much more complex probability distributions that would be difficult or even impossible to express classically, and from which a quantum processor might sample more efficiently than a classical one. Therefore, our results are expected to pave the way for new quantum-inspired or quantum-based generative diffusion algorithms addressing more powerfully classical tasks as data generation/prediction with widespread real-world applications ranging from climate forecasting to neuroscience, from traffic flow analysis to financial forecasting.

 I’m currently doing my undergrad in Economics but am heavily interested in Compsci/Datasci and related topics. Though to be completely honest, I’m not completely sure which area my interests lie in. 
 I was wondering if picking up coding/ theoretical knowledge that a com scientist or data scientist needs will be hard when I am already working. 
 The question is if it is necessary to switch my degree to Math and Economics to gain a firmer foundation in the mathematical/ statistical concepts that ground com science. Or will an undergrad in Economics be sufficiently rigorous for me to pick up com sci/ data sci myself. 
 For context, I’m thinking of taking courses on Real Analysis, Linear Algebra 2, Discrete Mathematics, Algorithms and Data Structures, Optimisation, Probability and Statistics.

Suffice it to say, these things are getting really good, and I mean really good. Assuming this is just the beginning, and these things keep learning more and getting better, where does this end up?
 I genuinely think there’s going to be the need for world wide regulation on these things. But we all know that worldwide consensus is difficult if not impossible. in case a few countries decide to regulate or govern this tech, developers will take advantage of regulatory arbitrage and just deploy their models and register their companies on servers in countries with no regulation. Since this is tech, and everything is on servers, escaping regulation is basically childs play.
 Also, what about mental health concerns? We all know that porn, webcams and OnlyFans are already screwing up male-female relationships and marriages. Look at any statistics about this and the numbers speak for themselves. And this is before AI. So now what’s going to happen 5 years from now when GPU’s are faster and cheaper, and when these companies have gathered 100x more data about their customers, and when models are 50x better.
 We are just at the beginning and AI is moving really quick, especially generative AI. I think it’s officially time to start worrying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm attempting to train an agent using A2C, where the agent generates a vector as its action at each time step. This vector represents a bidding curve, and a crucial property is that it must always increase monotonically. Otherwise, the bid is considered invalid. For example, [0, 1.2, 4.5, 58, 92.65, 104.3, 104.3] is valid because each number is greater than or equal to the previous one. I'm looking for guidance on how to design this setup, impose these constraints, and handle cases where the agent violates the sequence. While using negative rewards might not be effective due to the potential for generating numerous invalid bids, I'm unsure about the right approach. Could someone assist me with this?

 Abstract:
  
Current literature, aiming to surpass the "Chain-of-Thought" approach, often resorts to an external modus operandi involving halting, modifying, and then resuming the generation process to boost Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning capacities. This mode escalates the number of query requests, leading to increased costs, memory, and computational overheads. Addressing this, we propose the Algorithm of Thoughts -- a novel strategy that propels LLMs through algorithmic reasoning pathways, pioneering a new mode of in-context learning. By employing algorithmic examples, we exploit the innate recurrence dynamics of LLMs, expanding their idea exploration with merely one or a few queries. Our technique outperforms earlier single-query methods and stands on par with a recent multi-query strategy that employs an extensive tree search algorithm. Intriguingly, our results suggest that instructing an LLM using an algorithm can lead to performance surpassing that of the algorithm itself, hinting at LLM's inherent ability to weave its intuition into optimized searches. We probe into the underpinnings of our method's efficacy and its nuances in application.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Complex tasks with LLMs like ChatGPT/GPT4 are best broken down by first asking ChatGPT to outline the steps and then asking the LLM to execute against those steps that it defined. I first came across this interesting technique on Twitter recently.
 While it’s OK to do this once in OpenAI’s playground, it's difficult to make this repeatable and streamlined. When I wanted an LLM to do something complex, I wanted to be able to plug into a template instead of thinking about and setting up the contextual decomposition process.
 I made this Contextual Decomposition Template to help solve this problem: https://lastmileai.dev/workbooks/cllqfl5c600rdpgnhh2su2fa0
 With a document and objective, this template allows you to quickly get to the answer through defining intermediate steps and executing according. Parameters are set up so you can easily change the goal, document, and objective and click 'Run All' to get the final results.
 Please let me know if you have feedback! I'm also very curious if you have other interesting techniques with complex tasks and workflows working with LLMs.

 Background
 I have 20tb of text data (size in mongo) and 80tb of images (stored at 800x600-800) on my homelab on ssd's which i'm in the process of vectorizing and creating embeddings for. I have a 3090 with two python scripts, each script does the same thing, fetches a batch of records from mongo, grabs the image from the ssd, downsizes the image, creates embeddings, then uploads to qdrant (vector search engine) in a batch.

 Current setup
  
Ryzen 9 7950x, 64gb ddr5, rtx 3090 -this is the one creating the embeddings currently.
 1st gen 32 core epyc with 512gb ddr4 and ~200tb of ssd storage - holds all the data and databases and…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I started to study some Machine Learning algorithms, specifically K-means, but I'm not sure if I did it correctly for several reasons:
 - In the Kmeans that I did, I normalize the data because they mention that it helps a lot, but if I don't, the algorithm stops classifying normally and shows me badly grouped points.
 - As I mentioned, when looking at the graphs of the grouped points, I can see how many of the points are clearly closer to certain centroids, but he classified them as others, this reaches the level of a misclassified point next to the centroid when that should belong
 - Despite the fact that it has a threshold to be making iterations, the algorithm ends in less than 10 even though it has placed 100 iterations. I know that it can depend on the dataset and the generated centroids, but it seems excessive to me that it ends so soon and with results like Iris datset (60, 13, 77) when it should be (50, 50, 50) or a minimum to be maintained for those values.
 I leave the code in GH in case someone can help me: https://github.com/vanstrouble/kmeans-from-scratch.git

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in the strange position of having the task of developing a machine learning pipeline/system/process in an academic environment without the benefit of much in the way of formal training in ML (I'm more of a classical stats for hypothesis testing kinda guy).
 The particular project is using machine learning on medical images (head CT scans) to detect a relatively rare condition. As usual the goal is to eventually have some automatic process for diagnosis support. This particular condition is something that diagnostic radiologists can always detect if they look in the right place on the image, the problem is that they often don't look in the right place. After talking to colleagues with more experience (but less time) it's something which in principle can be achieved with more or less "off the shelf" code put together in the right order and with appropriate hyperparameters.
 This stage of the project is aiming for a proof of principle, rather than anything deployable. We're lucky to have a decent amount of data inside a trusted research environment.
 I've done some hobby-level stuff and tutorials, but overall I'm coming into this with a lot more experience with medical imaging than with computer vision or machine learning.
 After all that preamble here's my question:
 What does a decent CV/ML experiment look like?
 Left to my own direction I can see myself picking 3 different approaches of varying complexity, trying to get the best out of each of them, and then presenting a comparison of performance or accuracy of all of them. I then claim the "best one" as the one we move on with.
 There are a lot of tools out there for experiment tracking (eg neptune.ai), but I'm really not sure whether that sort of thing is over the top for what I need to do.
 Any tips or experience that you folks don't mind sharing?

 TLDR: How do I change the orientation of portrait frames to landscape frames while keeping the mockup essence the same.
 Link: https://ibb.co/album/hx6wp3
 Basically, I have two portrait frame mockups that came in a bundle and the bundle had no landscape frame mockups at all. So, naturally I'd like to make my own since I have a lot of landscape artworks that could be displayed in the mockups.
 How can I change the orientation display of my mockup? I've tried using Photoshop's generative AI software and got nowhere. It keeps giving me a new frame design when I want to keep the original frame so it matches the set.
 Any leads on how this can be done would be appreciated.

 Per my understanding what would need to be done is to train some smaller language model on the product data, create embeddings from the product info and make the model use this as a body of knowledge.
 My issue is that if this was ever to be done on commercial scale it seems very complex to me, since the embeddings would have to be re-created every time a new product is introduced?
 Let me know what you think or how you would approach this, as I'm trying to see different PoV's and everyone here has more experience than me.

 In other words, what I need is a library that offers the most granular RL components (different losses, replay buffers, return estimators like GAE, etc) instead of full algorithm implementations. Which libraries do you recommend for this purpose?

 Problem is that MuJoCo runs on CPU and I need lots of parallel enviroments and for this I would use envpool https://github.com/sail-sg/envpool.
 The question is what (if any) RL library should I use as a wrapper.
 The options are Stable-Baselines3, Tianshou, ACME, CleanRL, or rl_games.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In machine learning and deep learning problems, a lot of effort goes into preparing the data. Data is usually messy and needs to be preprocessed before it can be used for training a model. If the data is not prepared correctly, the model won’t be able to generalize well. Some of the common steps required […]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two-dimensional tensors are analogous to two-dimensional metrics. Like a two-dimensional metric, a two-dimensional tensor also has $n$ number of rows and columns. Let’s take a gray-scale image as an example, which is a two-dimensional matrix of numeric values, commonly known as pixels. Ranging from ‘0’ to ‘255’, each number represents a pixel intensity value. Here, […]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My husband Jeremy and I never intended to homeschool, and yet we have now, unexpectedly, committed to homeschooling long-term. Prior to the pandemic, we both worked full-time in careers that we loved and found meaningful, and we sent our daughter to a full-day Montessori school. Although I struggled with significant health issues, I felt unbelievably lucky and fulfilled in both my family life and my professional life. The pandemic upended my careful balance. Every family is different, with different needs, circumstances, and constraints, and what works for one may not work for others. My intention here is primarily to share the journey of my own (very privileged) family.
