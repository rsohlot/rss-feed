        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aquatic locomotion is a classic fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problem of
interest to biologists and engineers. Solving the fully coupled FSI equations
for incompressible Navier-Stokes and finite elasticity is computationally
expensive. Optimizing robotic swimmer design within such a system generally
involves cumbersome, gradient-free procedures on top of the already costly
simulation. To address this challenge we present a novel, fully differentiable
hybrid approach to FSI that combines a 2D direct numerical simulation for the
deformable solid structure of the swimmer and a physics-constrained neural
network surrogate to capture hydrodynamic effects of the fluid. For the
deformable simulation of the swimmer's body, we use state-of-the-art techniques
from the field of computer graphics to speed up the finite-element method
(FEM). For the fluid simulation, we use a U-Net architecture trained with a
physics-based loss function to predict the flow field at each time step. The
pressure and velocity field outputs from the neural network are sampled around
the boundary of our swimmer using an immersed boundary method (IBM) to compute
its swimming motion accurately and efficiently. We demonstrate the
computational efficiency and differentiability of our hybrid simulator on a 2D
carangiform swimmer. Since both the solid simulator and the hydrodynamics model
are automatically differentiable, we obtain a fully differentiable FSI
simulator that can be used for computational co-design of geometry and controls
for rigid and soft bodies immersed in fluids, such as minimizing drag,
maximizing speed, or maximizing efficiency via direct gradient-based
optimization.]]></summary>

to support the learning tasks without expert knowledge. Moreover, due to the
proposed network system's flexibility, powerful AI-enabled networking

a detector by means of models tunned to data which build parametric maps from

When the underlying model is unknown it is difficult to apply this method, and
often, simplifying assumptions are made introducing modeling errors. In this

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Research in cognitive science has provided extensive evidence of human
cognitive ability in performing physical reasoning of objects from noisy
perceptual inputs. Such a cognitive ability is commonly known as intuitive
physics. With advancements in deep learning, there is an increasing interest in
building intelligent systems that are capable of performing physical reasoning
from a given scene for the purpose of building better AI systems. As a result,
many contemporary approaches in modelling intuitive physics for machine
cognition have been inspired by literature from cognitive science. Despite the
wide range of work in physical reasoning for machine cognition, there is a
scarcity of reviews that organize and group these deep learning approaches.
Especially at the intersection of intuitive physics and artificial
intelligence, there is a need to make sense of the diverse range of ideas and
approaches. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent
advances and techniques in intuitive physics-inspired deep learning approaches
for physical reasoning. The survey will first categorize existing deep learning
approaches into three facets of physical reasoning before organizing them into
three general technical approaches and propose six categorical tasks of the
field. Finally, we highlight the challenges of the current field and present
some future research directions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Practical use of neural networks often involves requirements on latency,
energy and memory among others. A popular approach to find networks under such
requirements is through constrained Neural Architecture Search (NAS). However,
previous methods use complicated predictors for the accuracy of the network.
Those predictors are hard to interpret and sensitive to many hyperparameters to
be tuned, hence, the resulting accuracy of the generated models is often
harmed. In this work we resolve this by introducing Bilinear Interpretable
Neural Architecture Search (BINAS), that is based on an accurate and simple
bilinear formulation of both an accuracy estimator and the expected resource
requirement, together with a scalable search method with theoretical
guarantees. The simplicity of our proposed estimator together with the
intuitive way it is constructed bring interpretability through many insights
about the contribution of different design choices. For example, we find that
in the examined search space, adding depth and width is more effective at
deeper stages of the network and at the beginning of each resolution stage. Our
experiments show that BINAS generates comparable to or better architectures
than other state-of-the-art NAS methods within a reduced marginal search cost,
while strictly satisfying the resource constraints.]]></summary>

flexible model capturing global and local features in data popularized as
Robust PCA (Candes et al., 2011; Chandrasekaran et al., 2009). Compressed
sensing, matrix completion, and their variants (Eldar and Kutyniok, 2012;
Foucart and Rauhut, 2013) have established that data satisfying low complexity
models can be efficiently measured and recovered from a number of measurements
proportional to the model complexity rather than the ambient dimension. This
manuscript develops similar guarantees showing that $m\times n$ matrices that
can be expressed as the sum of a rank-$r$ matrix and a $s$-sparse matrix can be
recovered by computationally tractable methods from
$\mathcal{O}(r(m+n-r)+s)\log(mn/s)$ linear measurements. More specifically, we
establish that the low-rank plus sparse matrix set is closed provided the
incoherence of the low-rank component is upper bounded as
$\mu<\sqrt{mn}/(r\sqrt{s})$, and subsequently, the restricted isometry
constants for the aforementioned matrices remain bounded independent of problem
size provided $p/mn$, $s/p$, and $r(m+n-r)/p$ remain fixed. Additionally, we
show that semidefinite programming and two hard threshold gradient descent
algorithms, NIHT and NAHT, converge to the measured matrix provided the
measurement operator's RIC's are sufficiently small. These results also
provably solve convex and non-convex formulation of Robust PCA with the
asymptotically optimal fraction of corruptions $\alpha=\mathcal{O}\left(1/(\mu
r) \right)$, where $s = \alpha^2 mn$, and improve the previously best known
guarantees by not requiring that the fraction of corruptions is spread in every
column and row by being upper bounded by $\alpha$. Numerical experiments
illustrating these results are shown for synthetic problems,
dynamic-foreground/static-background separation, and multispectral imaging.]]></summary>

to training data that it uses to compute the gradients while a server decides
when to stop iterative computation based on its target accuracy or delay
constraints. The server receives all its information about the problem instance
from the worker via a rate-limited noiseless communication channel. We
introduce the principle we call Differential Quantization (DQ) that prescribes
compensating the past quantization errors to direct the descent trajectory of a
quantized algorithm towards that of its unquantized counterpart. Assuming that
the objective function is smooth and strongly convex, we prove that
Differentially Quantized Gradient Descent (DQ-GD) attains a linear contraction
factor of $\max\{\sigma_{\mathrm{GD}}, \rho_n 2^{-R}\}$, where
$\sigma_{\mathrm{GD}}$ is the contraction factor of unquantized gradient
descent (GD), $\rho_n \geq 1$ is the covering efficiency of the quantizer, and
$R$ is the bitrate per problem dimension $n$. Thus at any $R\geq\log_2 \rho_n
/\sigma_{\mathrm{GD}}$ bits, the contraction factor of DQ-GD is the same as
that of unquantized GD, i.e., there is no loss due to quantization. We show
that no algorithm within a certain class can converge faster than
$\max\{\sigma_{\mathrm{GD}}, 2^{-R}\}$. Since quantizers exist with $\rho_n \to
1$ as $n \to \infty$ (Rogers, 1963), this means that DQ-GD is asymptotically
optimal. The principle of differential quantization continues to apply to
gradient methods with momentum such as Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent,
and Polyak's heavy ball method. For these algorithms as well, if the rate is
above a certain threshold, there is no loss in contraction factor obtained by
the differentially quantized algorithm compared to its unquantized counterpart.
Experimental results on least-squares problems validate our theoretical

tutorials, and examples to be out of sync with changing interfaces and
frameworks. Relying on outdated documentation and examples can lead programs to
fail or be less efficient or even less secure. In response, programmers need to
regularly turn to other resources on the web such as StackOverflow for examples
to guide them in writing software. We recognize that this inconvenient,
error-prone, and expensive process can be improved by using machine learning
applied to software usage data. In this paper, we present our practical system
which uses machine learning on large-scale telemetry data and documentation
corpora, generating appropriate and complex examples that can be used to
improve documentation. We discuss both feature-based and transformer-based
machine learning approaches and demonstrate that our system achieves 100%
coverage for the used functionalities in the product, providing up-to-date
examples upon every release and reduces the numbers of PRs submitted by
software owners writing and editing documentation by >68%. We also share
valuable lessons learnt during the 3 years that our production quality system
has been deployed for Azure Cloud Command Line Interface (Azure CLI).]]></summary>

However, the mainstream optimization algorithms that seek to minimize error
will trap the deep learning model in sub-optimums when facing extreme class
imbalance. It seriously harms the classification precision, especially on the
minor classes. The essential reason is that the gradients of the classifier
weights are imbalanced among the components from different classes. In this
paper, we propose Attraction-Repulsion-Balanced Loss (ARB-Loss) to balance the
different components of the gradients. We perform experiments on the
large-scale classification and segmentation datasets and our ARB-Loss can
achieve state-of-the-art performance via only one-stage training instead of
2-stage learning like nowadays SOTA works.]]></summary>

cold-start problem and the filter-bubble problem when users suffer the
familiar, repeated, and even predictable recommendations, making them boring
and unsatisfied. To address the above issues, serendipity-oriented RSs are
proposed to recommend appealing and valuable items significantly deviating from
users' historical interactions and thus satisfying them by introducing
unexplored but relevant candidate items to them. In this paper, we devise a
novel serendipity-oriented recommender system (\textbf{G}enerative
\textbf{S}elf-\textbf{S}erendipity \textbf{R}ecommender \textbf{S}ystem,
\textbf{GS$^2$-RS}) that generates users' self-serendipity preferences to
enhance the recommendation performance. Specifically, this model extracts
users' interest and satisfaction preferences, generates virtual but convincible
neighbors' preferences from themselves, and achieves their self-serendipity
preference. Then these preferences are injected into the rating matrix as
additional information for RS models. Note that GS$^2$-RS can not only tackle
the cold-start problem but also provides diverse but relevant recommendations
to relieve the filter-bubble problem. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets illustrate that the proposed GS$^2$-RS model can significantly
outperform the state-of-the-art baseline approaches in serendipity measures
with a stable accuracy performance.]]></summary>

limiting step in drug discovery. While deep learning models have been proposed
to accelerate the identification process, we show that state-of-the-art models
fail to generalize to novel (i.e., never-before-seen) structures. We first
unveil the mechanisms responsible for this shortcoming, demonstrating how
models rely on shortcuts that leverage the topology of the protein-ligand
bipartite network, rather than learning the node features. Then, we introduce
AI-Bind, a pipeline that combines network-based sampling strategies with
unsupervised pre-training, allowing us to limit the annotation imbalance and
improve binding predictions for novel proteins and ligands. We illustrate the
value of AI-Bind by predicting drugs and natural compounds with binding
affinity to SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins and the associated human proteins. We
also validate these predictions via auto-docking simulations and comparison
with recent experimental evidence, and step up the process of interpreting
machine learning prediction of protein-ligand binding by identifying potential
active binding sites on the amino acid sequence. Overall, AI-Bind offers a
powerful high-throughput approach to identify drug-target combinations, with
the potential of becoming a powerful tool in drug discovery.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Existing multi-view classification algorithms focus on promoting accuracy by
exploiting different views, typically integrating them into common
representations for follow-up tasks. Although effective, it is also crucial to
ensure the reliability of both the multi-view integration and the final
decision, especially for noisy, corrupted and out-of-distribution data.
Dynamically assessing the trustworthiness of each view for different samples
could provide reliable integration. This can be achieved through uncertainty
estimation. With this in mind, we propose a novel multi-view classification
algorithm, termed trusted multi-view classification (TMC), providing a new
paradigm for multi-view learning by dynamically integrating different views at
an evidence level. The proposed TMC can promote classification reliability by
considering evidence from each view. Specifically, we introduce the variational
Dirichlet to characterize the distribution of the class probabilities,
parameterized with evidence from different views and integrated with the
Dempster-Shafer theory. The unified learning framework induces accurate
uncertainty and accordingly endows the model with both reliability and
robustness against possible noise or corruption. Both theoretical and
experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed model in
accuracy, robustness and trustworthiness.]]></summary>

algorithms has been about uncovering a rather mysterious heavy-tailed nature of
the stationary distribution of these algorithms, even when the data
distribution is not so. Moreover, the heavy-tail index is known to show
interesting dependence on the input dimension of the net, the mini-batch size
and the step size of the algorithm. In this short note, we undertake an
experimental study of this index for S.G.D. while training a $\relu$ gate (in
the realizable and in the binary classification setup) and for a variant of
S.G.D. that was proven in Karmakar and Mukherjee (2022) for ReLU realizable
data. From our experiments we conjecture that these two algorithms have similar
heavy-tail behaviour on any data where the latter can be proven to converge.
Secondly, we demonstrate that the heavy-tail index of the late time iterates in
this model scenario has strikingly different properties than either what has
been proven for linear hypothesis classes or what has been previously
demonstrated for large nets.]]></summary>

scalable software stack based on PyTorch and pair it with the new evolution of
Zion platform, namely ZionEX. We demonstrate the capability to train very large
DLRMs with up to 12 Trillion parameters and show that we can attain 40X speedup
in terms of time to solution over previous systems. We achieve this by (i)
designing the ZionEX platform with dedicated scale-out network, provisioned
with high bandwidth, optimal topology and efficient transport (ii) implementing
an optimized PyTorch-based training stack supporting both model and data
parallelism (iii) developing sharding algorithms capable of hierarchical
partitioning of the embedding tables along row, column dimensions and load
balancing them across multiple workers; (iv) adding high-performance core
operators while retaining flexibility to support optimizers with fully
deterministic updates (v) leveraging reduced precision communications,
multi-level memory hierarchy (HBM+DDR+SSD) and pipelining. Furthermore, we

However, the mainstream optimization algorithms that seek to minimize error
will trap the deep learning model in sub-optimums when facing extreme class
imbalance. It seriously harms the classification precision, especially on the
minor classes. The essential reason is that the gradients of the classifier
weights are imbalanced among the components from different classes. In this
paper, we propose Attraction-Repulsion-Balanced Loss (ARB-Loss) to balance the
different components of the gradients. We perform experiments on the
large-scale classification and segmentation datasets and our ARB-Loss can

three-quarters of these deaths occur in lower-income communities.
Electrocardiography (ECG), an electrical measurement capturing the cardiac
activities, is a gold-standard to diagnose CVDs. However, ECG is infeasible for
continuous cardiac monitoring due to its requirement for user participation.
Meanwhile, photoplethysmography (PPG) is easy to collect, but the limited
accuracy constrains its clinical usage. In this research, a novel
Transformer-based architecture, Performer, is invented to reconstruct ECG from
PPG and to create a novel digital biomarker, PPG along with its reconstructed
ECG, as multiple modalities for CVD detection. This architecture, for the first
time, performs Transformer sequence to sequence translation on biomedical
waveforms, while also utilizing the advantages of the easily accessible PPG and
the well-studied base of ECG. Shifted Patch-based Attention (SPA) is created to
maximize the signal features by fetching the various sequence lengths as
hierarchical stages into the training while also capturing cross-patch
connections through the shifted patch mechanism. This architecture generates a
state-of-the-art performance of 0.29 RMSE for reconstructing ECG from PPG,
achieving an average of 95.9% diagnosis for CVDs on the MIMIC III dataset and
75.9% for diabetes on the PPG-BP dataset. Performer, along with its novel
digital biomarker, offers a low-cost and non-invasive solution for continuous
cardiac monitoring, only requiring the easily extractable PPG data to
reconstruct the not-as-accessible ECG data. As a prove of concept, an earring
wearable, named PEARL (prototype), is designed to scale up the point-of-care
(POC) healthcare system.]]></summary>

certain inferences is as crucial as the accuracy of such inferences. Some ML
models like the decision tree possess inherent interpretability that can be
directly comprehended by humans. Others like artificial neural networks (ANN),
however, rely on external methods to uncover the deduction mechanism. SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is one of such external methods, which requires a
background dataset when interpreting ANNs. Generally, a background dataset
consists of instances randomly sampled from the training dataset. However, the
sampling size and its effect on SHAP remain to be unexplored. In our empirical
study on the MIMIC-III dataset, we show that the two core explanations - SHAP
values and variable rankings fluctuate when using different background datasets
acquired from random sampling, indicating that users cannot unquestioningly
trust the one-shot interpretation from SHAP. Luckily, such fluctuation
decreases with the increase of the background dataset size. Also, we notice an
U-shape in the stability assessment of SHAP variable rankings, demonstrating
that SHAP is more reliable in ranking the most and least important variables
compared to moderately important ones. Overall, our results suggest that users
should take into account how background data affects SHAP results, with
improved SHAP stability as the background sample size increases.]]></summary>

through manifold learning; the reduced latent space is discovered using
Diffusion Maps (a manifold learning technique) on time series data. A second
round of Diffusion Maps on those latent coordinates allows the approximation of
the reduced dynamical models. This second round enables mapping the latent
space coordinates back to the full ambient space (what is called lifting); it
also enables the approximation of full state functions of interest in terms of
the reduced coordinates. In our work, we develop and test three different
reduced numerical simulation methodologies, either through pre-tabulation in
the latent space and integration on the fly or by going back and forth between
the ambient space and the latent space. The data-driven latent space simulation
results, based on the three different approaches, are validated through (a) the
latent space observation of the full simulation through the Nystr\"om Extension
formula, or through (b) lifting the reduced trajectory back to the full ambient
space, via Latent Harmonics. Latent space modeling often involves additional
regularization to favor certain properties of the space over others, and the
mapping back to the ambient space is then constructed mostly independently from
these properties; here, we use the same data-driven approach to construct the
latent space and then map back to the ambient space.]]></summary>

which one fundamental challenge is to understand the influence of data quality
to ML training -- "Which training examples are 'guilty' in making the trained
ML model predictions inaccurate or unfair?" Modeling data influence for ML
training has attracted intensive interest over the last decade, and one popular
framework is to compute the Shapley value of each training example with respect
to utilities such as validation accuracy and fairness of the trained ML model.
Unfortunately, despite recent intensive interest and research, existing methods
only consider a single ML model "in isolation" and do not consider an
end-to-end ML pipeline that consists of data transformations, feature
extractors, and ML training.

We present DataScope (ease.ml/datascope), the first system that efficiently
computes Shapley values of training examples over an end-to-end ML pipeline,
and illustrate its applications in data debugging for ML training. To this end,
we first develop a novel algorithmic framework that computes Shapley value over
a specific family of ML pipelines that we call canonical pipelines: a positive
relational algebra query followed by a K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) classifier. We
show that, for many subfamilies of canonical pipelines, computing Shapley value
is in PTIME, contrasting the exponential complexity of computing Shapley value
in general. We then put this to practice -- given an sklearn pipeline, we
approximate it with a canonical pipeline to use as a proxy. We conduct
extensive experiments illustrating different use cases and utilities. Our
results show that DataScope is up to four orders of magnitude faster over
state-of-the-art Monte Carlo-based methods, while being comparably, and often
even more, effective in data debugging.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Explainability is crucial for probing graph neural networks (GNNs), answering
questions like "Why the GNN model makes a certain prediction?". Feature
attribution is a prevalent technique of highlighting the explanatory subgraph
in the input graph, which plausibly leads the GNN model to make its prediction.
Various attribution methods exploit gradient-like or attention scores as the
attributions of edges, then select the salient edges with top attribution
scores as the explanation. However, most of these works make an untenable
assumption - the selected edges are linearly independent - thus leaving the
dependencies among edges largely unexplored, especially their coalition effect.
We demonstrate unambiguous drawbacks of this assumption - making the
explanatory subgraph unfaithful and verbose. To address this challenge, we
propose a reinforcement learning agent, Reinforced Causal Explainer
(RC-Explainer). It frames the explanation task as a sequential decision process
- an explanatory subgraph is successively constructed by adding a salient edge
to connect the previously selected subgraph. Technically, its policy network
predicts the action of edge addition, and gets a reward that quantifies the
action's causal effect on the prediction. Such reward accounts for the
dependency of the newly-added edge and the previously-added edges, thus
reflecting whether they collaborate together and form a coalition to pursue
better explanations. As such, RC-Explainer is able to generate faithful and
concise explanations, and has a better generalization power to unseen graphs.
When explaining different GNNs on three graph classification datasets,
RC-Explainer achieves better or comparable performance to SOTA approaches
w.r.t. predictive accuracy and contrastivity, and safely passes sanity checks
and visual inspections. Codes are available at
https://github.com/xiangwang1223/reinforced_causal_explainer.]]></summary>

air pollution monitoring, benefit significantly from accurate long-term
spatio-temporal forecasting (LSTF). LSTF makes use of long-term dependency
between spatial and temporal domains, contextual information, and inherent
pattern in the data. Recent studies have revealed the potential of multi-graph
neural networks (MGNNs) to improve prediction performance. However, existing
MGNN methods cannot be directly applied to LSTF due to several issues: the low
level of generality, insufficient use of contextual information, and the
imbalanced graph fusion approach. To address these issues, we construct new
graph models to represent the contextual information of each node and the
long-term spatio-temporal data dependency structure. To fuse the information
across multiple graphs, we propose a new dynamic multi-graph fusion module to
characterize the correlations of nodes within a graph and the nodes across
graphs via the spatial attention and graph attention mechanisms. Furthermore,
we introduce a trainable weight tensor to indicate the importance of each node
in different graphs. Extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets
demonstrate that our proposed approaches significantly improve the performance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We study algorithms for approximating pairwise similarity matrices that arise
in natural language processing. Generally, computing a similarity matrix for
$n$ data points requires $\Omega(n^2)$ similarity computations. This quadratic
scaling is a significant bottleneck, especially when similarities are computed
via expensive functions, e.g., via transformer models. Approximation methods
reduce this quadratic complexity, often by using a small subset of exactly
computed similarities to approximate the remainder of the complete pairwise
similarity matrix.

Significant work focuses on the efficient approximation of positive
semidefinite (PSD) similarity matrices, which arise e.g., in kernel methods.
However, much less is understood about indefinite (non-PSD) similarity
matrices, which often arise in NLP. Motivated by the observation that many of
these matrices are still somewhat close to PSD, we introduce a generalization
of the popular Nystr\"{o}m method to the indefinite setting. Our algorithm can
be applied to any similarity matrix and runs in sublinear time in the size of
the matrix, producing a rank-$s$ approximation with just $O(ns)$ similarity
computations.

We show that our method, along with a simple variant of CUR decomposition,
performs very well in approximating a variety of similarity matrices arising in
NLP tasks. We demonstrate high accuracy of the approximated similarity matrices
in the downstream tasks of document classification, sentence similarity, and
cross-document coreference.]]></summary>

feedback. In this setting, losses of an action are split into $d$ components,
spreading over consecutive rounds after the action is chosen. And in each
round, the algorithm observes the aggregation of losses that come from the
latest $d$ rounds. Previous works focus on oblivious adversarial setting, while
we investigate the harder non-oblivious setting. We show non-oblivious setting
incurs $\Omega(T)$ pseudo regret even when the loss sequence is bounded memory.
However, we propose a wrapper algorithm which enjoys $o(T)$ policy regret on
many adversarial bandit problems with the assumption that the loss sequence is
bounded memory. Especially, for $K$-armed bandit and bandit convex
optimization, we have $\mathcal{O}(T^{2/3})$ policy regret bound. We also prove
a matching lower bound for $K$-armed bandit. Our lower bound works even when
the loss sequence is oblivious but the delay is non-oblivious. It answers the
open problem proposed in \cite{wang2021adaptive}, showing that non-oblivious
delay is enough to incur $\tilde{\Omega}(T^{2/3})$ regret.]]></summary>

algorithms in terms of predictive ability and model interpretation on
structured or tabular data. The algorithms considered were scikit-learn
implementations of extreme gradient boosting machines (XGB) and random forests
(RFs), and feedforward neural networks (FFNNs) from TensorFlow. The paper is
organized in a findings-based manner, with each section providing general
conclusions supported by empirical results from simulation studies that cover a
wide range of model complexity and correlation structures among predictors. We
considered both continuous and binary responses of different sample sizes.

Overall, XGB and FFNNs were competitive, with FFNNs showing better
performance in smooth models and tree-based boosting algorithms performing
better in non-smooth models. This conclusion held generally for predictive
performance, identification of important variables, and determining correct
input-output relationships as measured by partial dependence plots (PDPs).
FFNNs generally had less over-fitting, as measured by the difference in
performance between training and testing datasets. However, the difference with
XGB was often small. RFs did not perform well in general, confirming the
findings in the literature. All models exhibited different degrees of bias seen
in PDPs, but the bias was especially problematic for RFs. The extent of the
biases varied with correlation among predictors, response type, and data set
sample size. In general, tree-based models tended to over-regularize the fitted
model in the tails of predictor distributions. Finally, as to be expected,
performances were better for continuous responses compared to binary data and
with larger samples.]]></summary>

tasks. Current transfer learning methods generally assume at least one of (i)
source and target task label spaces must overlap, (ii) source datasets are
available, and (iii) target network architectures are consistent with source
ones. However, these all assumptions are difficult to hold in practical
settings because the target task rarely has the same labels as the source task,
the source dataset access is restricted due to licensing and storage costs, and
the target architecture is often specialized to each task. To transfer source
knowledge without these assumptions, we propose a transfer learning method that
uses deep generative models and is composed of the following two stages: pseudo
pre-training (PP) and pseudo semi-supervised learning (P-SSL). PP trains a
target architecture with a synthesized dataset by using conditional source
generative models. P-SSL applies SSL algorithms to labeled target data and
unlabeled pseudo samples, which are generated by cascading the source
classifier and generative models to condition them with target samples. Our
experimental results indicate that our method can outperform baselines of

computer vision fields. These legacy images often suffer from severe and
commingled degradations such as cracks, noise, and color-fading, while lack of
large-scale paired old photo datasets makes this restoration task very
challenging. In this work, we present a novel reference-based end-to-end
learning framework that can jointly repair and colorize the degraded legacy
pictures. Specifically, the proposed framework consists of three modules: a
restoration sub-network for degradation restoration, a similarity sub-network
for color histogram matching and transfer, and a colorization subnet that
learns to predict the chroma elements of the images conditioned on chromatic
reference signals. The whole system takes advantage of the color histogram
priors in a given reference image, which vastly reduces the dependency on
large-scale training data. Apart from the proposed method, we also create, to
our knowledge, the first public and real-world old photo dataset with paired
ground truth for evaluating old photo restoration models, wherein each old
photo is paired with a manually restored pristine image by PhotoShop experts.
Our extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts both
quantitatively and qualitatively.]]></summary>

This is undesirable as most smart home devices now support multiple enrolled

previously developed an attention-based speaker selection mechanism and applied
it to VoiceFilter-Lite. However, the original multi-user VoiceFilter-Lite model
suffers from significant performance degradation compared with single-user
models. In this paper, we devised a series of experiments to improve the
multi-user VoiceFilter-Lite model. By incorporating a dual learning rate
schedule and by using feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) to condition the
model with the attended speaker embedding, we successfully closed the
performance gap between multi-user and single-user VoiceFilter-Lite models on

workhorse for solving minimax problems. However, in contrast to the
well-studied stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with differential privacy (DP)
constraints, there is little work on understanding the generalization (utility)
of SGDA with DP constraints. In this paper, we use the algorithmic stability
approach to establish the generalization (utility) of DP-SGDA in different
settings. In particular, for the convex-concave setting, we prove that the
DP-SGDA can achieve an optimal utility rate in terms of the weak primal-dual
population risk in both smooth and non-smooth cases. To our best knowledge,
this is the first-ever-known result for DP-SGDA in the non-smooth case. We
further provide its utility analysis in the nonconvex-strongly-concave setting
which is the first-ever-known result in terms of the primal population risk.
The convergence and generalization results for this nonconvex setting are new
even in the non-private setting. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted
to demonstrate the effectiveness of DP-SGDA for both convex and nonconvex

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This work proposes a novel deep neural network (DNN) architecture, Implicit
Segmentation Neural Network (ISNet), to solve the task of image segmentation
followed by classification. It substitutes the common pipeline of two DNNs with
a single model. We designed the ISNet for high flexibility and performance: it
allows virtually any classification neural network architecture to analyze a
common image as if it had been previously segmented. Furthermore, in relation
to the unmodified classifier, the ISNet does not cause any increment in
computational cost at run-time. We test the architecture with two applications:
COVID-19 detection in chest X-rays, and facial attribute estimation. We
implement an ISNet based on a DenseNet121 classifier, and compare the model to
a U-net (performing lung/face segmentation) followed by a DenseNet121, and to a
standalone DenseNet121. The new architecture matched the other DNNs in facial
attribute estimation. Moreover, it strongly surpassed them in COVID-19
detection, according to an external test dataset. The ISNet precisely ignored
the image regions outside of the lungs or faces. Therefore, in COVID-19
detection it reduced the effects of background bias and shortcut learning, and
it improved security in facial attribute estimation. ISNet presents an
accurate, fast, and light methodology. The successful implicit segmentation,
considering two largely diverse fields, highlights the architecture's general
applicability.]]></summary>

incorporating information from an external textual document. These methods do
not require the exact document to be known during training and rely on the use
of a retrieval system to fetch relevant documents from a large index. The
documents used to generate the responses are modeled as latent variables whose
prior probabilities need to be estimated. Models such as RAG and REALM,
marginalize the document probabilities over the documents retrieved from the
index to define the log likelihood loss function which is optimized end-to-end.

In this paper, we develop a variational approach to the above technique
wherein, we instead maximize the Evidence Lower bound (ELBO). Using a
collection of three publicly available open-conversation datasets, we
demonstrate how the posterior distribution, that has information from the
ground-truth response, allows for a better approximation of the objective
function during training. To overcome the challenges associated with sampling
over a large knowledge collection, we develop an efficient approach to
approximate the ELBO. To the best of our knowledge we are the first to apply
variational training for open-scale unsupervised knowledge grounded dialog
systems.]]></summary>

algorithms has been about uncovering a rather mysterious heavy-tailed nature of
the stationary distribution of these algorithms, even when the data

interesting dependence on the input dimension of the net, the mini-batch size
and the step size of the algorithm. In this short note, we undertake an

the realizable and in the binary classification setup) and for a variant of
S.G.D. that was proven in Karmakar and Mukherjee (2022) for ReLU realizable
data. From our experiments we conjecture that these two algorithms have similar
heavy-tail behaviour on any data where the latter can be proven to converge.
Secondly, we demonstrate that the heavy-tail index of the late time iterates in
this model scenario has strikingly different properties than either what has
been proven for linear hypothesis classes or what has been previously
demonstrated for large nets.]]></summary>

acquisition process in MRI by acquiring limited measurements. Often
sophisticated reconstruction algorithms are deployed to maintain high image

We propose an accompanying alternating-type training framework with a
mask-backward procedure that efficiently generates training labels for the
sampler network and jointly trains an image reconstruction network.
Experimental results on the fastMRI knee dataset demonstrate the ability of the
proposed learned undersampling network to generate object-specific masks at
fourfold and eightfold acceleration that achieve superior image reconstruction

settings where domain knowledge is required, such as behavior analysis. Weak
supervision has been studied to reduce annotation costs by using weak labels

However, domain experts still need to hand-craft different LFs for different
tasks, limiting scalability. To reduce expert effort, we present AutoSWAP: a
framework for automatically synthesizing data-efficient task-level LFs. The key
to our approach is to efficiently represent expert knowledge in a reusable
domain-specific language and more general domain-level LFs, with which we use
state-of-the-art program synthesis techniques and a small labeled dataset to
generate task-level LFs. Additionally, we propose a novel structural diversity
cost that allows for efficient synthesis of diverse sets of LFs, further
improving AutoSWAP's performance. We evaluate AutoSWAP in three behavior
analysis domains and demonstrate that AutoSWAP outperforms existing approaches
using only a fraction of the data. Our results suggest that AutoSWAP is an

and noise is of critical importance in many applications. Existing scatter
correction and density reconstruction methods may not provide the high accuracy
needed in many applications and can break down in the presence of unmodeled or
anomalous scatter and other experimental artifacts. Incorporating
machine-learned models could prove beneficial for accurate density
reconstruction particularly in dynamic imaging, where the time-evolution of the
density fields could be captured by partial differential equations or by
learning from hydrodynamics simulations. In this work, we demonstrate the
ability of learned deep neural networks to perform artifact removal in noisy
density reconstructions, where the noise is imperfectly characterized. We use a
Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN), where the generator serves
as a denoiser that removes artifacts in densities obtained from traditional
reconstruction algorithms. We train the networks from large density time-series
datasets, with noise simulated according to parametric random distributions
that may mimic noise in experiments. The WGAN is trained with noisy density
frames as generator inputs, to match the generator outputs to the distribution
of clean densities (time-series) from simulations. A supervised loss is also
included in the training, which leads to improved density restoration
performance. In addition, we employ physics-based constraints such as mass
conservation during network training and application to further enable highly
accurate density reconstructions. Our preliminary numerical results show that
the models trained in our frameworks can remove significant portions of unknown
noise in density time-series data.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Machine learning assisted optimal power flow (OPF) aims to reduce the
computational complexity of these non-linear and non-convex constrained
optimization problems by consigning expensive (online) optimization to offline
training. The majority of work in this area typically employs fully connected
neural networks (FCNN). However, recently convolutional (CNN) and graph (GNN)
neural networks have also been investigated, in effort to exploit topological
information within the power grid. Although promising results have been
obtained, there lacks a systematic comparison between these architectures
throughout literature. Accordingly, we introduce a concise framework for
generalizing methods for machine learning assisted OPF and assess the
performance of a variety of FCNN, CNN and GNN models for two fundamental
approaches in this domain: regression (predicting optimal generator set-points)
and classification (predicting the active set of constraints). For several
synthetic power grids with interconnected utilities, we show that locality
properties between feature and target variables are scarce and subsequently
demonstrate marginal utility of applying CNN and GNN architectures compared to
FCNN for a fixed grid topology. However, with variable topology (for instance,
modeling transmission line contingency), GNN models are able to
straightforwardly take the change of topological information into account and
outperform both FCNN and CNN models.]]></summary>

and demanding task. Often after initially released, it undergoes several
revisions later (maybe due to human or technical constraints) - as a result, it
may take weeks until the data reaches to a stable value. This so-called
'backfill' phenomenon and its effect on model performance has been barely
studied in the prior literature. In this paper, we introduce the multi-variate
backfill problem using COVID-19 as the motivating example. We construct a
detailed dataset composed of relevant signals over the past year of the
pandemic. We then systematically characterize several patterns in backfill
dynamics and leverage our observations for formulating a novel problem and
neural framework Back2Future that aims to refines a given model's predictions
in real-time. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our method refines the
performance of top models for COVID-19 forecasting, in contrast to non-trivial
baselines, yielding 18% improvement over baselines, enabling us obtain a new
SOTA performance. In addition, we show that our model improves model evaluation
too; hence policy-makers can better understand the true accuracy of forecasting

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this work, we formulate a visual dialog as an information flow in which
each piece of information is encoded with the joint visual-linguistic
representation of a single dialog round. Based on this formulation, we consider
the visual dialog task as a sequence problem consisting of ordered
visual-linguistic vectors. For featurization, we use a Dense Symmetric
Co-Attention network as a lightweight vison-language joint representation
generator to fuse multimodal features (i.e., image and text), yielding better
computation and data efficiencies. For inference, we propose two Sequential
Dialog Networks (SeqDialN): the first uses LSTM for information propagation
(IP) and the second uses a modified Transformer for multi-step reasoning (MR).
Our architecture separates the complexity of multimodal feature fusion from
that of inference, which allows simpler design of the inference engine. IP
based SeqDialN is our baseline with a simple 2-layer LSTM design that achieves
decent performance. MR based SeqDialN, on the other hand, recurrently refines
the semantic question/history representations through the self-attention stack
of Transformer and produces promising results on the visual dialog task. On
VisDial v1.0 test-std dataset, our best single generative SeqDialN achieves
62.54% NDCG and 48.63% MRR; our ensemble generative SeqDialN achieves 63.78%
NDCG and 49.98% MRR, which set a new state-of-the-art generative visual dialog
model. We fine-tune discriminative SeqDialN with dense annotations and boost
the performance up to 72.41% NDCG and 55.11% MRR. In this work, we discuss the
extensive experiments we have conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our
model components. We also provide visualization for the reasoning process from
the relevant conversation rounds and discuss our fine-tuning methods. Our code

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Variable-density cellular structures can overcome connectivity and
manufacturability issues of topologically optimized structures, particularly
those represented as discrete density maps. However, the optimization of such
cellular structures is challenging due to the multiscale design problem. Past
work addressing this problem generally either only optimizes the volume
fraction of single-type unit cells but ignores the effects of unit cell
geometry on properties, or considers the geometry-property relation but builds
this relation via heuristics. In contrast, we propose a simple yet more
principled way to accurately model the property to geometry mapping using a
conditional deep generative model, named Inverse Homogenization Generative
Adversarial Network (IH-GAN). It learns the conditional distribution of unit
cell geometries given properties and can realize the one-to-many mapping from
properties to geometries. We further reduce the complexity of IH-GAN by using
the implicit function parameterization to represent unit cell geometries.
Results show that our method can 1) generate various unit cells that satisfy
given material properties with high accuracy ($R^2$-scores between target
properties and properties of generated unit cells $>98\%$) and 2) improve the
optimized structural performance over the conventional variable-density
single-type structure. In the minimum compliance example, our IH-GAN generated
structure achieves a $79.7\%$ reduction in concentrated stress and an extra
$3.03\%$ reduction in displacement. In the target deformation examples, our
IH-GAN generated structure reduces the target matching error by $86.4\%$ and
$79.6\%$ for two test cases, respectively. We also demonstrated that the
connectivity issue for multi-type unit cells can be solved by transition layer
blending.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Knowledge graph (KG), integrating complex information and containing rich
semantics, is widely considered as side information to enhance the
recommendation systems. However, most of the existing KG-based methods
concentrate on encoding the structural information in the graph, without
utilizing the collaborative signals in user-item interaction data, which are
important for understanding user preferences. Therefore, the representations
learned by these models are insufficient for representing semantic information
of users and items in the recommendation environment. The combination of both
kinds of data provides a good chance to solve this problem. To tackle this
research gap, we propose a novel duet representation learning framework named
\sysname to fuse local information (user-item interaction data) and global
information (external knowledge graph) for the top-$N$ recommendation, which is
composed of two separate sub-models. One learns the local representations by
discovering the inner correlations in local information with a knowledge-aware
co-attention mechanism, and another learns the global representations by
encoding the knowledge associations in global information with a relation-aware
attention network. The two sub-models are jointly trained as part of the
semantic fusion network to compute the user preferences, which discriminates
the contribution of the two sub-models under the special context. We conduct
experiments on two real-world datasets, and the evaluations show that KADM
significantly outperforms state-of-art methods. Further ablation studies
confirm that the duet architecture performs significantly better than either
sub-model on the recommendation tasks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this paper, we address the problem of convergence of sequential
variational inference filter (VIF) through the application of a robust
variational objective and Hinf-norm based correction for a linear Gaussian
system. As the dimension of state or parameter space grows, performing the full
Kalman update with the dense covariance matrix for a large scale system
requires increased storage and computational complexity, making it impractical.
The VIF approach, based on mean-field Gaussian variational inference, reduces
this burden through the variational approximation to the covariance usually in
the form of a diagonal covariance approximation. The challenge is to retain
convergence and correct for biases introduced by the sequential VIF steps. We
desire a framework that improves feasibility while still maintaining reasonable
proximity to the optimal Kalman filter as data is assimilated. To accomplish
this goal, a Hinf-norm based optimization perturbs the VIF covariance matrix to
improve robustness. This yields a novel VIF- Hinf recursion that employs
consecutive variational inference and Hinf based optimization steps. We explore
the development of this method and investigate a numerical example to
illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed filter.]]></summary>

minimize residual terms directly, RCL alternatively builds a connection between
residuals and CL by defining a novel instance discrimination pretext task,
using residuals as the discriminative feature. Our formulation mitigates the
severe task misalignment between instance discrimination pretext tasks and
downstream image reconstruction tasks, present in existing CL frameworks.
Experimentally, we find that RCL can learn robust and transferable
representations that improve the performance of various downstream tasks, such
as denoising and super resolution, in comparison with recent self-supervised

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has proven highly effective in promoting the
performance of Semi-Supervised Node Classification (SSNC). However, existing
GCL methods are generally transferred from other fields like CV or NLP, whose
underlying working mechanism remains under-explored. In this work, we first
deeply probe the working mechanism of GCL in SSNC, and find that the promotion
brought by GCL is severely unevenly distributed: the improvement mainly comes
from subgraphs with less annotated information, which is fundamentally
different from contrastive learning in other fields. However, existing GCL
methods generally ignore this uneven distribution of annotated information and
apply GCL evenly to the whole graph. To remedy this issue and further improve
GCL in SSNC, we propose the Topology InFormation gain-Aware Graph Contrastive
Learning (TIFA-GCL) framework that considers the annotated information
distribution across graph in GCL. Extensive experiments on six benchmark graph
datasets, including the enormous OGB-Products graph, show that TIFA-GCL can
bring a larger improvement than existing GCL methods in both transductive and
inductive settings. Further experiments demonstrate the generalizability and
interpretability of TIFA-GCL.]]></summary>

management practices is of great importance for sustainable and resilient
agriculture against climate change. Recent developments in the field of causal
machine learning enable the estimation of intervention impacts on an outcome of
interest, for samples described by a set of observed characteristics. We
introduce an extensible data-driven framework that leverages earth observations
and frames agricultural land suitability as a geospatial impact assessment
problem, where the estimated effects of agricultural practices on
agroecosystems serve as a land suitability score and guide decision making. We
formulate this as a causal machine learning task and discuss how this approach
can be used for agricultural planning in a changing climate. Specifically, we
extract the agricultural management practices of "crop rotation" and "landscape
crop diversity" from crop type maps, account for climate and land use data, and
use double machine learning to estimate their heterogeneous effect on Net
Primary Productivity (NPP), within the Flanders region of Belgium from 2010 to
2020. We find that the effect of crop rotation was insignificant, while
landscape crop diversity had a small negative effect on NPP. Finally, we
observe considerable effect heterogeneity in space for both practices and
analyze it.]]></summary>

to training data that it uses to compute the gradients while a server decides
when to stop iterative computation based on its target accuracy or delay
constraints. The server receives all its information about the problem instance
from the worker via a rate-limited noiseless communication channel. We
introduce the principle we call Differential Quantization (DQ) that prescribes
compensating the past quantization errors to direct the descent trajectory of a
quantized algorithm towards that of its unquantized counterpart. Assuming that
the objective function is smooth and strongly convex, we prove that
Differentially Quantized Gradient Descent (DQ-GD) attains a linear contraction
factor of $\max\{\sigma_{\mathrm{GD}}, \rho_n 2^{-R}\}$, where
$\sigma_{\mathrm{GD}}$ is the contraction factor of unquantized gradient
descent (GD), $\rho_n \geq 1$ is the covering efficiency of the quantizer, and
$R$ is the bitrate per problem dimension $n$. Thus at any $R\geq\log_2 \rho_n
/\sigma_{\mathrm{GD}}$ bits, the contraction factor of DQ-GD is the same as
that of unquantized GD, i.e., there is no loss due to quantization. We show
that no algorithm within a certain class can converge faster than
$\max\{\sigma_{\mathrm{GD}}, 2^{-R}\}$. Since quantizers exist with $\rho_n \to
1$ as $n \to \infty$ (Rogers, 1963), this means that DQ-GD is asymptotically
optimal. The principle of differential quantization continues to apply to
gradient methods with momentum such as Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent,
and Polyak's heavy ball method. For these algorithms as well, if the rate is
above a certain threshold, there is no loss in contraction factor obtained by
the differentially quantized algorithm compared to its unquantized counterpart.
Experimental results on least-squares problems validate our theoretical
analysis.]]></summary>

for decades. An important area of research is to study how well real networks
can be described with a small selection of metrics, furthermore how well
network models can capture the relations between graph metrics observed in real
networks. In this paper, we apply machine learning techniques to investigate
the aforementioned problems. We study 500 real-world networks along with 2,000
synthetic networks generated by four frequently used network models with
previously calibrated parameters to make the generated graphs as similar to the
real networks as possible. This paper unifies several branches of data-driven
complex network analysis, such as the study of graph metrics and their
pair-wise relationships, network similarity estimation, model calibration, and
graph classification. We find that the correlation profiles of the structural
measures significantly differ across network domains and the domain can be
efficiently determined using a small selection of graph metrics. The structural
properties of the network models with fixed parameters are robust enough to
perform parameter calibration. The goodness-of-fit of the network models highly
depends on the network domain. By solving classification problems, we find that
the models lack the capability of generating a graph with a high clustering
coefficient and relatively large diameter simultaneously. On the other hand,
models are able to capture exactly the degree-distribution-related metrics.]]></summary>

it becomes imperative to detect such fraudulent activities in advance, to
inform potentially susceptible investors before they become victims. In this
paper, we focus on the target coin prediction task, i.e., to predict the pump
probability of all coins listed in the target exchange before a pump. We
conduct a comprehensive study of the latest P&Ds, investigate 709 events
organized in Telegram channels from Jan. 2019 to Jan. 2022, and unearth some
abnormal yet interesting patterns of P&Ds. Empirical analysis demonstrates that
pumped coins exhibit intra-channel homogeneity and inter-channel heterogeneity,
which inspires us to develop a novel sequence-based neural network named SNN.
Specifically, SNN encodes each channel's pump history as a sequence
representation via a positional attention mechanism, which filters useful
information and alleviates the noise introduced when the sequence length is
long. We also identify and address the coin-side cold-start problem in a
practical setting. Extensive experiments show a lift of 1.6% AUC and 41.0% Hit
Ratio@3 brought by our method, making it well-suited for real-world
application. As a side contribution, we release the source code of our entire

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Allocation strategies improve the efficiency of crowdsourcing by decreasing
the work needed to complete individual tasks accurately. However, these
algorithms introduce bias by preferentially allocating workers onto easy tasks,
leading to sets of completed tasks that are no longer representative of all
tasks. This bias challenges inference of problem-wide properties such as
typical task difficulty or crowd properties such as worker completion times,
important information that goes beyond the crowd responses themselves. Here we
study inference about problem properties when using an allocation algorithm to
improve crowd efficiency. We introduce Decision-Explicit Probability Sampling
(DEPS), a novel method to perform inference of problem properties while
accounting for the potential bias introduced by an allocation strategy.
Experiments on real and synthetic crowdsourcing data show that DEPS outperforms
baseline inference methods while still leveraging the efficiency gains of the
allocation method. The ability to perform accurate inference of general
properties when using non-representative data allows crowdsourcers to extract
more knowledge out of a given crowdsourced dataset.]]></summary>

machine learning algorithm's urge need for massive labeled data. Requester
posts tasks on crowdsourcing platforms, which employ online workers over the
Internet to complete tasks, then aggregate and return results to requester. How
to model the interaction between different types of workers and tasks is a hot
spot. In this paper, we try to model workers as four types based on their
ability: expert, normal worker, sloppy worker and spammer, and divide tasks
into hard, medium and easy task according to their difficulty. We believe that
even experts struggle with difficult tasks while sloppy workers can get easy
tasks right, and spammers always give out wrong answers deliberately. So, good
examination tasks should have moderate degree of difficulty and
discriminability to score workers more objectively. Thus, we first score
workers' ability mainly on the medium difficult tasks, then reducing the weight
of answers from sloppy workers and modifying the answers from spammers when
inferring the tasks' ground truth. A probability graph model is adopted to
simulate the task execution process, and an iterative method is adopted to
calculate and update the ground truth, the ability of workers and the
difficulty of the task successively. We verify the rightness and effectiveness

key to reinforcement learning (RL) solving real world problems. Traditionally
in goal-conditioned RL, an agent is provided with the exact goal they intend to

before performing a task. A more scalable framework would allow us to provide
the agent with an example of an analogous task, and have the agent then infer
what the goal should be for its current state. We propose a new form of state
abstraction called goal-conditioned bisimulation that captures functional
equivariance, allowing for the reuse of skills to achieve new goals. We learn
this representation using a metric form of this abstraction, and show its
ability to generalize to new goals in simulation manipulation tasks. Further,
we prove that this learned representation is sufficient not only for goal
conditioned tasks, but is amenable to any downstream task described by a

binary sequence generated by an adversarial nature. Following the seminal paper
of Foster and Vohra (1998), nature is often modeled as an adaptive adversary
who sees all activity of the forecaster except the randomization that the
forecaster may deploy. A number of papers have proposed randomized forecasting
strategies that achieve an $\epsilon$-calibration error rate of
$O(1/\sqrt{T})$, which we prove is tight in general. On the other hand, it is
well known that it is not possible to be calibrated without randomization, or
if nature also sees the forecaster's randomization; in both cases the
calibration error could be $\Omega(1)$. Inspired by the equally seminal works
on the "power of two choices" and imprecise probability theory, we study a
small variant of the standard online calibration problem. The adversary gives
the forecaster the option of making two nearby probabilistic forecasts, or
equivalently an interval forecast of small width, and the endpoint closest to
the revealed outcome is used to judge calibration. This power of two choices,
or imprecise forecast, accords the forecaster with significant power -- we show
that a faster $\epsilon$-calibration rate of $O(1/T)$ can be achieved even
without deploying any randomization.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Humans have a remarkably large capacity to store detailed visual information
in long-term memory even after a single exposure, as demonstrated by classic
experiments in psychology. For example, Standing (1973) showed that humans
could recognize with high accuracy thousands of pictures that they had seen
only once a few days prior to a recognition test. In deep learning, the primary
mode of incorporating new information into a model is through gradient descent
in the model's parameter space. This paper asks whether deep learning via
gradient descent can match the efficiency of human visual long-term memory to
incorporate new information in a rigorous, head-to-head, quantitative
comparison. We answer this in the negative: even in the best case, models
learning via gradient descent appear to require approximately 10 exposures to
the same visual materials in order to reach a recognition memory performance
humans achieve after only a single exposure. Prior knowledge induced via
pretraining and bigger model sizes improve performance, but these improvements
are not very visible after a single exposure (it takes a few exposures for the
improvements to become apparent), suggesting that simply scaling up the
pretraining data size or model size might not be enough for the model to reach
human-level memory efficiency.]]></summary>

task-oriented dialogue (ToD) systems, with the aim to provide a much more
challenging evaluation environment for dialogue NLU models, up to date with the
current application and industry requirements. NLU++ is divided into two
domains (BANKING and HOTELS) and brings several crucial improvements over
current commonly used NLU datasets. \textbf{1)} NLU++ provides fine-grained
domain ontologies with a large set of challenging \textit{multi-intent}
sentences, introducing and validating the idea of \textit{intent modules} that
can be combined into complex intents that convey complex user goals, combined
with finer-grained and thus more challenging slot sets. \textbf{2)} The
ontology is divided into \textit{domain-specific} and \textit{generic} (i.e.,
domain-universal) intent modules that overlap across domains, promoting
cross-domain reusability of annotated examples. \textbf{3)} The dataset design
has been inspired by the problems observed in industrial ToD systems, and
\textbf{4)} it has been collected, filtered and carefully annotated by dialogue
NLU experts, yielding high-quality annotated data. Finally, we benchmark a
series of current state-of-the-art NLU models on NLU++; the results demonstrate
the challenging nature of the dataset, especially in low-data regimes, the
validity of `intent modularisation', and call for further research on ToD NLU.]]></summary>

representations when biases exist in the dataset. This results in a poor
generalization to unbiased datasets, as the predictions strongly rely on
peripheral and confounding factors, which are erroneously learned by the
network. Many existing works deal with this issue by either employing an
explicit supervision on the bias attributes, or assuming prior knowledge about
the bias. In this work we study this problem in a more difficult scenario, in
which no explicit annotation about the bias is available, and without any prior
knowledge about its nature. We propose a fully unsupervised debiasing
framework, consisting of three steps: first, we exploit the natural preference
for learning malignant biases, obtaining a bias-capturing model; then, we
perform a pseudo-labelling step to obtain bias labels; finally we employ
state-of-the-art supervised debiasing techniques to obtain an unbiased model.
We also propose a theoretical framework to assess the biasness of a model, and
provide a detailed analysis on how biases affect the training of neural
networks. We perform experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, showing
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in a variety of settings,

that demand the coordination of learning agents. However, strong coordination
often leads to expensive exploration over the exponentially large state-action
space. A powerful approach is to decompose team works into roles, which are
ideally assigned to agents with the relevant skills. Training agents to
adaptively choose and play emerging roles in a team thus allows the team to
scale to complex tasks and quickly adapt to changing environments. These
promises, however, have not been fully realised by current role-based
multi-agent reinforcement learning methods as they assume either a pre-defined
role structure or a fixed team size. We propose a framework to learn role
assignment and transfer across team sizes. In particular, we train a role
assignment network for small teams by demonstration and transfer the network to
larger teams, which continue to learn through interaction with the environment.
We demonstrate that re-using the role-based credit assignment structure can
foster the learning process of larger reinforcement learning teams to achieve
tasks requiring different roles. Our proposal outperforms competing techniques
in enriched role-enforcing Prey-Predator games and in new scenarios in the

domain knowledge of analog circuit design (e.g., circuit topology and couplings

incorporating such key domain knowledge into policy training with a multimodal
network, the method best learns the complex relations between circuit
parameters and design targets, enabling optimal decisions in the optimization
process. Experimental results on exemplary circuits show it achieves
human-level design accuracy (99%) 1.5X efficiency of existing best-performing

we describe the procedure for generating a labelled stencil dataset and use a

pointNet to implement a model that can be used to classify differently sized
stencils and compare it against models dedicated to a single stencil size. The

variational inference filter (VIF) through the application of a robust
variational objective and Hinf-norm based correction for a linear Gaussian
system. As the dimension of state or parameter space grows, performing the full
Kalman update with the dense covariance matrix for a large scale system
requires increased storage and computational complexity, making it impractical.
The VIF approach, based on mean-field Gaussian variational inference, reduces
this burden through the variational approximation to the covariance usually in
the form of a diagonal covariance approximation. The challenge is to retain
convergence and correct for biases introduced by the sequential VIF steps. We
desire a framework that improves feasibility while still maintaining reasonable
proximity to the optimal Kalman filter as data is assimilated. To accomplish
this goal, a Hinf-norm based optimization perturbs the VIF covariance matrix to
improve robustness. This yields a novel VIF- Hinf recursion that employs
consecutive variational inference and Hinf based optimization steps. We explore
the development of this method and investigate a numerical example to
illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed filter.]]></summary>

the work needed to complete individual tasks accurately. However, these
algorithms introduce bias by preferentially allocating workers onto easy tasks,
leading to sets of completed tasks that are no longer representative of all
tasks. This bias challenges inference of problem-wide properties such as
typical task difficulty or crowd properties such as worker completion times,
important information that goes beyond the crowd responses themselves. Here we
study inference about problem properties when using an allocation algorithm to
improve crowd efficiency. We introduce Decision-Explicit Probability Sampling
(DEPS), a novel method to perform inference of problem properties while
accounting for the potential bias introduced by an allocation strategy.
Experiments on real and synthetic crowdsourcing data show that DEPS outperforms
baseline inference methods while still leveraging the efficiency gains of the

years. Current deep learning models for code summarization generally follow the
principle in neural machine translation and adopt the encoder-decoder
framework, where the encoder learns the semantic representations from source
code and the decoder transforms the learnt representations into human-readable
text that describes the functionality of code snippets. Despite they achieve
the new state-of-the-art performance, we notice that current models often
either generate less fluent summaries, or fail to capture the core
functionality, since they usually focus on a single type of code
representations. As such we propose GypSum, a new deep learning model that
learns hybrid representations using graph attention neural networks and a
pre-trained programming and natural language model. We introduce particular
edges related to the control flow of a code snippet into the abstract syntax
tree for graph construction, and design two encoders to learn from the graph
and the token sequence of source code, respectively. We modify the
encoder-decoder sublayer in the Transformer's decoder to fuse the
representations and propose a dual-copy mechanism to facilitate summary
generation. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of GypSum

binary sequence generated by an adversarial nature. Following the seminal paper
of Foster and Vohra (1998), nature is often modeled as an adaptive adversary
who sees all activity of the forecaster except the randomization that the
forecaster may deploy. A number of papers have proposed randomized forecasting
strategies that achieve an $\epsilon$-calibration error rate of
$O(1/\sqrt{T})$, which we prove is tight in general. On the other hand, it is
well known that it is not possible to be calibrated without randomization, or
if nature also sees the forecaster's randomization; in both cases the
calibration error could be $\Omega(1)$. Inspired by the equally seminal works
on the "power of two choices" and imprecise probability theory, we study a
small variant of the standard online calibration problem. The adversary gives
the forecaster the option of making two nearby probabilistic forecasts, or
equivalently an interval forecast of small width, and the endpoint closest to
the revealed outcome is used to judge calibration. This power of two choices,
or imprecise forecast, accords the forecaster with significant power -- we show
that a faster $\epsilon$-calibration rate of $O(1/T)$ can be achieved even
without deploying any randomization.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[VoiceFilter-Lite is a speaker-conditioned voice separation model that plays a
crucial role in improving speech recognition and speaker verification by
suppressing overlapping speech from non-target speakers. However, one
limitation of VoiceFilter-Lite, and other speaker-conditioned speech models in
general, is that these models are usually limited to a single target speaker.
This is undesirable as most smart home devices now support multiple enrolled
users. In order to extend the benefits of personalization to multiple users, we
previously developed an attention-based speaker selection mechanism and applied
it to VoiceFilter-Lite. However, the original multi-user VoiceFilter-Lite model
suffers from significant performance degradation compared with single-user
models. In this paper, we devised a series of experiments to improve the
multi-user VoiceFilter-Lite model. By incorporating a dual learning rate
schedule and by using feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) to condition the
model with the attended speaker embedding, we successfully closed the
performance gap between multi-user and single-user VoiceFilter-Lite models on
single-speaker evaluations. At the same time, the new model can also be easily
extended to support any number of users, and significantly outperforms our
previously published model on multi-speaker evaluations.]]></summary>

tractable likelihood function, and is based on a feed-forward neural network
(FFNN). There are two versions of the PBN: stochastic and deterministic

implementation of the PBN requires an iterative algorithm that includes the
inversion of a symmetric matrix of size M X M in each layer, where M is the
layer output dimension. This, and the fact that the network must be always
dimension-reducing in each layer, can limit the types of problems where the PBN
can be applied. In this paper, we describe techniques to avoid or mitigate
these restrictions and use the PBN effectively at high dimension. We apply the
discriminatively aligned PBN (PBN-DA) to classifying and auto-encoding
high-dimensional spectrograms of acoustic events. We also present the

manufacturability issues of topologically optimized structures, particularly
those represented as discrete density maps. However, the optimization of such
cellular structures is challenging due to the multiscale design problem. Past
work addressing this problem generally either only optimizes the volume
fraction of single-type unit cells but ignores the effects of unit cell
geometry on properties, or considers the geometry-property relation but builds
this relation via heuristics. In contrast, we propose a simple yet more
principled way to accurately model the property to geometry mapping using a
conditional deep generative model, named Inverse Homogenization Generative
Adversarial Network (IH-GAN). It learns the conditional distribution of unit
cell geometries given properties and can realize the one-to-many mapping from
properties to geometries. We further reduce the complexity of IH-GAN by using
the implicit function parameterization to represent unit cell geometries.
Results show that our method can 1) generate various unit cells that satisfy
given material properties with high accuracy ($R^2$-scores between target
properties and properties of generated unit cells $>98\%$) and 2) improve the
optimized structural performance over the conventional variable-density
single-type structure. In the minimum compliance example, our IH-GAN generated
structure achieves a $79.7\%$ reduction in concentrated stress and an extra
$3.03\%$ reduction in displacement. In the target deformation examples, our
IH-GAN generated structure reduces the target matching error by $86.4\%$ and
$79.6\%$ for two test cases, respectively. We also demonstrated that the
connectivity issue for multi-type unit cells can be solved by transition layer
blending.]]></summary>

forecasting of Foreign Exchange (FX) rates. To address this problem, we
introduce a parameter-free regression network termed RegPred Net. The exchange
rate to forecast is treated as a stochastic process. It is assumed to follow a
generalization of Brownian motion and the mean-reverting process referred to as
the generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, with time-dependent
coefficients. Using past observed values of the input time series, these
coefficients can be regressed online by the cells of the first half of the
network (Reg). The regressed coefficients depend only on - but are very
sensitive to - a small number of hyperparameters required to be set by a global
optimization procedure for which, Bayesian optimization is an adequate
heuristic. Thanks to its multi-layered architecture, the second half of the
regression network (Pred) can project time-dependent values for the OU process
coefficients and generate realistic trajectories of the time series.
Predictions can be easily derived in the form of expected values estimated by
averaging values obtained by Monte Carlo simulation. The forecasting accuracy
on a 100 days horizon is evaluated for several of the most important FX rates
such as EUR/USD, EUR/CNY, and EUR/GBP. Our experimental results show that the
RegPred Net significantly outperforms ARMA, ARIMA, LSTMs, and Autoencoder-LSTM

distribution over the space of parameters of a model given a data set. As more
data becomes available this probability distribution becomes updated via the
application of Bayes' theorem. We present a treatment of this Bayesian updating
process as a continuous dynamical system. Statistical inference is then
governed by a first order differential equation describing a trajectory or flow
in the information geometry determined by a parametric family of models. We
solve this equation for some simple models and show that when the
Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound is saturated the learning rate is governed by a simple
$1/T$ power-law, with $T$ a time-like variable denoting the quantity of data.
The presence of hidden variables can be incorporated in this setting, leading
to an additional driving term in the resulting flow equation. We illustrate
this with both analytic and numerical examples based on Gaussians and Gaussian
Random Processes and inference of the coupling constant in the 1D Ising model.
Finally we compare the qualitative behaviour exhibited by Bayesian flows to the
training of various neural networks on benchmarked data sets such as MNIST and
CIFAR10 and show how that for networks exhibiting small final losses the simple
power-law is also satisfied.]]></summary>

communication-efficient problem in recent studies of Federated Learning (FL).
However, due to the large variance of the selected subset's update, prior
selection approaches with a limited sampling ratio cannot perform well on
convergence and accuracy in heterogeneous FL. To address this problem, in this
paper, we propose a novel stratified client selection scheme to reduce the
variance for the pursuit of better convergence and higher accuracy.
Specifically, to mitigate the impact of heterogeneity, we develop
stratification based on clients' local data distribution to derive approximate
homogeneous strata for better selection in each stratum. Concentrating on a
limited sampling ratio scenario, we next present an optimized sample size
allocation scheme by considering the diversity of stratum's variability, with
the promise of further variance reduction. Theoretically, we elaborate the
explicit relation among different selection schemes with regard to variance,
under heterogeneous settings, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our selection
scheme. Experimental results confirm that our approach not only allows for
better performance relative to state-of-the-art methods but also is compatible
with prevalent FL algorithms.]]></summary>

hypothesis class complexity in ERM, our DRO bounds depend on the ambiguity set
geometry and its compatibility with the true loss function. Notably, when using
maximum mean discrepancy as a DRO distance metric, our analysis implies
generalization bounds that depend solely on the true loss function. To the best
of our knowledge, it is the first generalization bound in the literature that
is entirely independent of any other candidates in the hypothesis class. We

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Practical use of neural networks often involves requirements on latency,
energy and memory among others. A popular approach to find networks under such
requirements is through constrained Neural Architecture Search (NAS). However,
previous methods use complicated predictors for the accuracy of the network.
Those predictors are hard to interpret and sensitive to many hyperparameters to
be tuned, hence, the resulting accuracy of the generated models is often
harmed. In this work we resolve this by introducing Bilinear Interpretable
Neural Architecture Search (BINAS), that is based on an accurate and simple
bilinear formulation of both an accuracy estimator and the expected resource
requirement, together with a scalable search method with theoretical
guarantees. The simplicity of our proposed estimator together with the
intuitive way it is constructed bring interpretability through many insights
about the contribution of different design choices. For example, we find that
in the examined search space, adding depth and width is more effective at
deeper stages of the network and at the beginning of each resolution stage. Our
experiments show that BINAS generates comparable to or better architectures
than other state-of-the-art NAS methods within a reduced marginal search cost,
while strictly satisfying the resource constraints.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper investigates a new online learning problem with doubly-streaming
data, where the data streams are described by feature spaces that constantly
evolve, with new features emerging and old features fading away. The challenges
of this problem are two folds: 1) Data samples ceaselessly flowing in may carry
shifted patterns over time, requiring learners to update hence adapt
on-the-fly. 2) Newly emerging features are described by very few samples,
resulting in weak learners that tend to make error predictions. A plausible
idea to overcome the challenges is to establish relationship between the
pre-and-post evolving feature spaces, so that an online learner can leverage
the knowledge learned from the old features to better the learning performance
on the new features. Unfortunately, this idea does not scale up to
high-dimensional media streams with complex feature interplay, which suffers an
tradeoff between onlineness (biasing shallow learners) and
expressiveness(requiring deep learners). Motivated by this, we propose a novel
OLD^3S paradigm, where a shared latent subspace is discovered to summarize
information from the old and new feature spaces, building intermediate feature
mapping relationship. A key trait of OLD^3S is to treat the model capacity as a
learnable semantics, yields optimal model depth and parameters jointly, in
accordance with the complexity and non-linearity of the input data streams in
an online fashion. Both theoretical analyses and empirical studies substantiate
the viability and effectiveness of our proposal.]]></summary>

faced with the task of solving a business problem using data-driven methods
such as machine learning (ML) algorithms. Deployment of ML within large
software systems brings new challenges that are not addressed by standard
engineering practices and as a result businesses observe high rate of ML
deployment project failures. Data Oriented Architecture (DOA) is an emerging
approach that can support data scientists and software developers when
addressing such challenges. However, there is a lack of clarity about how DOA
systems should be implemented in practice. This paper proposes to consider
Flow-Based Programming (FBP) as a paradigm for creating DOA applications. We
empirically evaluate FBP in the context of ML deployment on four applications
that represent typical data science projects. We use Service Oriented
Architecture (SOA) as a baseline for comparison. Evaluation is done with
respect to different application domains, ML deployment stages, and code
quality metrics. Results reveal that FBP is a suitable paradigm for data
collection and data science tasks, and is able to simplify data collection and
discovery when compared with SOA. We discuss the advantages of FBP as well as
the gaps that need to be addressed to increase FBP adoption as a standard

efficient neural network architectures, especially for mobile and embedded
vision applications. Although recent research has proposed ways of quickly
estimating latency on unseen hardware devices with just a few samples, little
focus has been given to the challenges of estimating latency on runtimes using
optimized graphs, such as TensorRT and specifically for edge devices. In this
work, we propose MAPLE-Edge, an edge device-oriented extension of MAPLE, the
state-of-the-art latency predictor for general purpose hardware, where we train
a regression network on architecture-latency pairs in conjunction with a
hardware-runtime descriptor to effectively estimate latency on a diverse pool
of edge devices. Compared to MAPLE, MAPLE-Edge can describe the runtime and
target device platform using a much smaller set of CPU performance counters
that are widely available on all Linux kernels, while still achieving up to
+49.6% accuracy gains against previous state-of-the-art baseline methods on
optimized edge device runtimes, using just 10 measurements from an unseen
target device. We also demonstrate that unlike MAPLE which performs best when
trained on a pool of devices sharing a common runtime, MAPLE-Edge can
effectively generalize across runtimes by applying a trick of normalizing
performance counters by the operator latency, in the measured hardware-runtime
descriptor. Lastly, we show that for runtimes exhibiting lower than desired
accuracy, performance can be boosted by collecting additional samples from the
target device, with an extra 90 samples translating to gains of nearly +40%.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Neural text matching models have been used in a range of applications such as
question answering and natural language inference, and have yielded a good
performance. However, these neural models are of a limited adaptability,
resulting in a decline in performance when encountering test examples from a
different dataset or even a different task. The adaptability is particularly
important in the few-shot setting: in many cases, there is only a limited
amount of labeled data available for a target dataset or task, while we may
have access to a richly labeled source dataset or task. However, adapting a
model trained on the abundant source data to a few-shot target dataset or task
is challenging. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Meta-Weight Regulator
(MWR), which is a meta-learning approach that learns to assign weights to the
source examples based on their relevance to the target loss. Specifically, MWR
first trains the model on the uniformly weighted source examples, and measures
the efficacy of the model on the target examples via a loss function. By
iteratively performing a (meta) gradient descent, high-order gradients are
propagated to the source examples. These gradients are then used to update the
weights of source examples, in a way that is relevant to the target
performance. As MWR is model-agnostic, it can be applied to any backbone neural
model. Extensive experiments are conducted with various backbone text matching
models, on four widely used datasets and two tasks. The results demonstrate
that our proposed approach significantly outperforms a number of existing
adaptation methods and effectively improves the cross-dataset and cross-task
adaptability of the neural text matching models in the few-shot setting.]]></summary>

their broad applicability to graph-related problems such as quantum chemistry,
drug discovery, and high energy physics. However, meeting demand for novel GNN
models and fast inference simultaneously is challenging because of the gap
between developing efficient accelerators and the rapid creation of new GNN
models. Prior art focuses on the acceleration of specific classes of GNNs, such
as Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), but lacks the generality to support a
wide range of existing or new GNN models. Meanwhile, most work rely on graph
pre-processing to exploit data locality, making them unsuitable for real-time
applications. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose a generic
dataflow architecture for GNN acceleration, named FlowGNN, which can flexibly
support the majority of message-passing GNNs. The contributions are three-fold.
First, we propose a novel and scalable dataflow architecture, which flexibly
supports a wide range of GNN models with message-passing mechanism. The
architecture features a configurable dataflow optimized for simultaneous
computation of node embedding, edge embedding, and message passing, which is
generally applicable to all models. We also propose a rich library of
model-specific components. Second, we deliver ultra-fast real-time GNN
inference without any graph pre-processing, making it agnostic to dynamically
changing graph structures. Third, we verify our architecture on the Xilinx
Alveo U50 FPGA board and measure the on-board end-to-end performance. We
achieve a speed-up of up to 51-254x against CPU (6226R) and 1.3-477x against
GPU (A6000) (with batch sizes 1 through 1024); we also outperform the SOTA GNN
accelerator I-GCN by 1.03x and 1.25x across two datasets. Our implementation
code and on-board measurement are publicly available on GitHub.]]></summary>

increase the effectiveness of networks with fewer parameters compared to added

reduction more effective. When used in restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),

for improving access to data as a means to encourage productive partnerships.
One issue inherent to DP is that the "privacy budget" is generally "spent"
evenly across features in the data set. This leads to good statistical parity
with the real data, but can undervalue the conditional probabilities and
marginals that are critical for predictive quality of synthetic data. Further,
loss of predictive quality may be non-uniform across the data set, with subsets
that correspond to minority groups potentially suffering a higher loss.

In this paper, we develop ensemble methods that distribute the privacy budget
"wisely" to maximize predictive accuracy of models trained on DP data, and
"fairly" to bound potential disparities in accuracy across groups and reduce
inequality. Our methods are based on the insights that feature importance can
inform how privacy budget is allocated, and, further, that per-group feature
importance and fairness-related performance objectives can be incorporated in
the allocation. These insights make our methods tunable to social contexts,
allowing data owners to produce balanced synthetic data for predictive
analysis.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Head pose estimation is a crucial challenge for many real-world applications,
such as attention and human behavior analysis. This paper aims to estimate head
pose from a single image by applying notions of network curvature. In the real
world, many complex networks have groups of nodes that are well connected to
each other with significant functional roles. Similarly, the interactions of
facial landmarks can be represented as complex dynamic systems modeled by
weighted graphs. The functionalities of such systems are therefore
intrinsically linked to the topology and geometry of the underlying graph. In
this work, using the geometric notion of Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC) on
weighted graphs as input to the XGBoost regression model, we show that the
intrinsic geometric basis of ORC offers a natural approach to discovering
underlying common structure within a pool of poses. Experiments on the BIWI,
AFLW2000 and Pointing'04 datasets show that the ORC_XGB method performs well
compared to state-of-the-art methods, both landmark-based and image-only.]]></summary>

heart wall and a protective layer around the heart called the pericardium. The
volume and thickness of epicardial adipose tissue are linked to various
cardiovascular diseases. It is shown to be an independent cardiovascular
disease risk factor. Fully automatic and reliable measurements of epicardial
adipose tissue from CT scans could provide better disease risk assessment and
enable the processing of large CT image data sets for a systemic epicardial
adipose tissue study. This paper proposes a method for fully automatic semantic
segmentation of epicardial adipose tissue from CT images using a deep neural
network. The proposed network uses a U-Net-based architecture with slice depth
information embedded in the input image to segment a pericardium region of
interest, which is used to obtain an epicardial adipose tissue segmentation.
Image augmentation is used to increase model robustness. Cross-validation of
the proposed method yields a Dice score of 0.86 on the CT scans of 20 patients.]]></summary>

distribution over the space of parameters of a model given a data set. As more
data becomes available this probability distribution becomes updated via the
application of Bayes' theorem. We present a treatment of this Bayesian updating
process as a continuous dynamical system. Statistical inference is then
governed by a first order differential equation describing a trajectory or flow
in the information geometry determined by a parametric family of models. We
solve this equation for some simple models and show that when the
Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound is saturated the learning rate is governed by a simple
$1/T$ power-law, with $T$ a time-like variable denoting the quantity of data.
The presence of hidden variables can be incorporated in this setting, leading
to an additional driving term in the resulting flow equation. We illustrate
this with both analytic and numerical examples based on Gaussians and Gaussian
Random Processes and inference of the coupling constant in the 1D Ising model.
Finally we compare the qualitative behaviour exhibited by Bayesian flows to the
training of various neural networks on benchmarked data sets such as MNIST and
CIFAR10 and show how that for networks exhibiting small final losses the simple
power-law is also satisfied.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many deep learning applications, like keyword spotting, require the
incorporation of new concepts (classes) over time, referred to as Class
Incremental Learning (CIL). The major challenge in CIL is catastrophic
forgetting, i.e., preserving as much of the old knowledge as possible while
learning new tasks. Various techniques, such as regularization, knowledge
distillation, and the use of exemplars, have been proposed to resolve this
issue. However, prior works primarily focus on the incremental learning step,
while ignoring the optimization during the base model training. We hypothesize
that a more transferable and generalizable feature representation from the base
model would be beneficial to incremental learning.

In this work, we adopt multitask learning during base model training to
improve the feature generalizability. Specifically, instead of training a
single model with all the base classes, we decompose the base classes into
multiple subsets and regard each of them as a task. These tasks are trained
concurrently and a shared feature extractor is obtained for incremental
learning. We evaluate our approach on two datasets under various
configurations. The results show that our approach enhances the average
incremental learning accuracy by up to 5.5%, which enables more reliable and
accurate keyword spotting over time. Moreover, the proposed approach can be
combined with many existing techniques and provides additional performance
gain.]]></summary>

forecasting of Foreign Exchange (FX) rates. To address this problem, we
introduce a parameter-free regression network termed RegPred Net. The exchange
rate to forecast is treated as a stochastic process. It is assumed to follow a
generalization of Brownian motion and the mean-reverting process referred to as
the generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, with time-dependent
coefficients. Using past observed values of the input time series, these
coefficients can be regressed online by the cells of the first half of the
network (Reg). The regressed coefficients depend only on - but are very
sensitive to - a small number of hyperparameters required to be set by a global
optimization procedure for which, Bayesian optimization is an adequate
heuristic. Thanks to its multi-layered architecture, the second half of the
regression network (Pred) can project time-dependent values for the OU process
coefficients and generate realistic trajectories of the time series.
Predictions can be easily derived in the form of expected values estimated by
averaging values obtained by Monte Carlo simulation. The forecasting accuracy
on a 100 days horizon is evaluated for several of the most important FX rates
such as EUR/USD, EUR/CNY, and EUR/GBP. Our experimental results show that the
RegPred Net significantly outperforms ARMA, ARIMA, LSTMs, and Autoencoder-LSTM

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graph pooling has been increasingly considered for graph neural networks
(GNNs) to facilitate hierarchical graph representation learning. Existing graph
pooling methods commonly consist of two stages, i.e., selecting the top-ranked
nodes and removing the rest nodes to construct a coarsened graph
representation. However, local structural information of the removed nodes
would be inevitably dropped in these methods, due to the inherent coupling of
nodes (location) and their features (signals). In this paper, we propose an
enhanced three-stage method via lifting, named LiftPool, to improve
hierarchical graph representation by maximally preserving the local structural
information in graph pooling. LiftPool introduces an additional stage of graph
lifting before graph coarsening to preserve the local information of the
removed nodes and decouple the processes of node removing and feature
reduction. Specifically, for each node to be removed, its local information is
obtained by subtracting the global information aggregated from its neighboring
preserved nodes. Subsequently, this local information is aligned and propagated
to the preserved nodes to alleviate information loss in graph coarsening.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed LiftPool is localized and
permutation-invariant. The proposed graph lifting structure is general to be
integrated with existing downsampling-based graph pooling methods. Evaluations
on benchmark graph datasets show that LiftPool substantially outperforms the
state-of-the-art graph pooling methods in the task of graph classification.]]></summary>

algorithms in terms of predictive ability and model interpretation on
structured or tabular data. The algorithms considered were scikit-learn
implementations of extreme gradient boosting machines (XGB) and random forests
(RFs), and feedforward neural networks (FFNNs) from TensorFlow. The paper is
organized in a findings-based manner, with each section providing general
conclusions supported by empirical results from simulation studies that cover a
wide range of model complexity and correlation structures among predictors. We
considered both continuous and binary responses of different sample sizes.

Overall, XGB and FFNNs were competitive, with FFNNs showing better
performance in smooth models and tree-based boosting algorithms performing
better in non-smooth models. This conclusion held generally for predictive
performance, identification of important variables, and determining correct
input-output relationships as measured by partial dependence plots (PDPs).
FFNNs generally had less over-fitting, as measured by the difference in
performance between training and testing datasets. However, the difference with
XGB was often small. RFs did not perform well in general, confirming the
findings in the literature. All models exhibited different degrees of bias seen
in PDPs, but the bias was especially problematic for RFs. The extent of the
biases varied with correlation among predictors, response type, and data set
sample size. In general, tree-based models tended to over-regularize the fitted
model in the tails of predictor distributions. Finally, as to be expected,
performances were better for continuous responses compared to binary data and

tasks. Current transfer learning methods generally assume at least one of (i)
source and target task label spaces must overlap, (ii) source datasets are

ones. However, these all assumptions are difficult to hold in practical
settings because the target task rarely has the same labels as the source task,
the source dataset access is restricted due to licensing and storage costs, and
the target architecture is often specialized to each task. To transfer source
knowledge without these assumptions, we propose a transfer learning method that
uses deep generative models and is composed of the following two stages: pseudo
pre-training (PP) and pseudo semi-supervised learning (P-SSL). PP trains a
target architecture with a synthesized dataset by using conditional source
generative models. P-SSL applies SSL algorithms to labeled target data and
unlabeled pseudo samples, which are generated by cascading the source
classifier and generative models to condition them with target samples. Our

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In past years, the world has switched to many-core and multi-core shared
memory architectures.

As a result, there is a growing need to utilize these architectures by
introducing shared memory parallelization schemes to software applications.
OpenMP is the most comprehensive API that implements such schemes,
characterized by a readable interface. Nevertheless, introducing OpenMP into
code is challenging due to pervasive pitfalls in management of parallel shared
memory. To facilitate the performance of this task, many source-to-source (S2S)
compilers have been created over the years, tasked with inserting OpenMP
directives into code automatically.

In addition to having limited robustness to their input format, these
compilers still do not achieve satisfactory coverage and precision in locating
parallelizable code and generating appropriate directives.

In this work, we propose leveraging recent advances in ML techniques,
specifically in natural language processing (NLP), to replace S2S compilers
altogether.

We create a database (corpus), Open-OMP, specifically for this goal. Open-OMP
contains over 28,000 code snippets, half of which contain OpenMP directives
while the other half do not need parallelization at all with high probability.

We use the corpus to train systems to automatically classify code segments in

We train several transformer models, named PragFormer, for these tasks, and
show that they outperform statistically-trained baselines and automatic S2S
parallelization compilers in both classifying the overall need for an OpenMP
directive and the introduction of private and reduction clauses.

in any spatial dimension $n\geq 1$, we derive the first theoretically rigorous
scheme for learning the associated Green's function $G$. Until now, rigorously
learning Green's functions associated with parabolic operators has been a major
challenge in the field of scientific machine learning because $G$ may not be
square-integrable when $n>1$, and time-dependent PDEs have transient dynamics.
By combining the hierarchical low-rank structure of $G$ together with the
randomized singular value decomposition, we construct an approximant to $G$
that achieves a relative error of
$\smash{\mathcal{O}(\Gamma_\epsilon^{-1/2}\epsilon)}$ in the $L^1$-norm with
high probability by using at most
$\smash{\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-\frac{n+2}{2}}\log(1/\epsilon))}$ input-output
training pairs, where $\Gamma_\epsilon$ is a measure of the quality of the
training dataset for learning $G$, and $\epsilon>0$ is sufficiently small.
Along the way, we extend the low-rank theory of Bebendorf and Hackbusch from
elliptic PDEs in dimension $1\leq n\leq 3$ to parabolic PDEs in any dimensions,
which shows that Green's functions associated with parabolic PDEs admit a
low-rank structure on well-separated domains.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep operator networks (DeepONets) are powerful architectures for fast and
accurate emulation of complex dynamics. As their remarkable generalization
capabilities are primarily enabled by their projection-based attribute, we
investigate connections with low-rank techniques derived from the singular
value decomposition (SVD). We demonstrate that some of the concepts behind
proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-neural networks can improve DeepONet's
design and training phases. These ideas lead us to a methodology extension that
we name SVD-DeepONet. Moreover, through multiple SVD analyses, we find that
DeepONet inherits from its projection-based attribute strong inefficiencies in
representing dynamics characterized by symmetries. Inspired by the work on
shifted-POD, we develop flexDeepONet, an architecture enhancement that relies
on a pre-transformation network for generating a moving reference frame and
isolating the rigid components of the dynamics. In this way, the physics can be
represented on a latent space free from rotations, translations, and stretches,
and an accurate projection can be performed to a low-dimensional basis. In
addition to flexibility and interpretability, the proposed perspectives
increase DeepONet's generalization capabilities and computational efficiencies.
For instance, we show flexDeepONet can accurately surrogate the dynamics of 19
variables in a combustion chemistry application by relying on 95% less
trainable parameters than the ones of the vanilla architecture. We argue that
DeepONet and SVD-based methods can reciprocally benefit from each other. In
particular, the flexibility of the former in leveraging multiple data sources
and multifidelity knowledge in the form of both unstructured data and
physics-informed constraints has the potential to greatly extend the
applicability of methodologies such as POD and PCA.]]></summary>

we dispense with the persistence of excitation condition traditionally imposed

Most existing approaches emphasize the contrastive relations among videos,
including appearance and motion consistency. However, two main issues remain
for existing pre-training methods: 1) the learned representation is neutral and
not informative for a specific task; 2) multi-task learning-based pre-training
sometimes leads to sub-optimal solutions due to inconsistent domains of
different tasks. To address the above issues, we propose a novel action
recognition pre-training framework, which exploits human-centered prior
knowledge that generates more informative representation, and avoids the
conflict between multiple tasks by using task-dependent representations.
Specifically, we distill knowledge from a human parsing model to enrich the
semantic capability of representation. In addition, we combine knowledge
distillation with contrastive learning to constitute a task-dependent
multi-task framework. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on two popular
benchmarks for action recognition task, i.e., UCF101 and HMDB51, verifying the

been widely used in image denoising and achieved satisfactory performance.
However, the previous works mostly use a single head to receive the noisy

multiple heads (MH) named MHCNN is proposed in this paper, whose heads will
receive the input images rotated by different rotation angles. MH makes MHCNN
simultaneously utilize features of rotated images to remove noise. We also
present a novel multi-path attention mechanism (MPA) to integrate these
features effectively. Unlike previous attention mechanisms that handle
pixel-level, channel-level, and patch-level features, MPA focuses on features
at the image level. Experiments show MHCNN surpasses other state-of-the-art CNN
models on additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) denoising and real-world image
denoising. Its peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) results are higher than other

Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games which are considered as one of the
most popular online video game genres around the world. When playing MOBA
games, players go through a draft stage, where they alternately select a
virtual character to play. When drafting, players select characters by not only
considering their character preferences, but also the synergy and competence of
their team's character combination. However, the complexity of drafting induces
difficulties for beginners to choose the appropriate characters based on the
characters of their team while considering their own champion preferences. To
alleviate this problem, we propose DraftRec, a novel hierarchical model which
recommends characters by considering each player's champion preferences and the
interaction between the players. DraftRec consists of two networks: the player
network and the match network. The player network captures the individual
player's champion preference, and the match network integrates the complex
relationship between the players and their respective champions. We train and
evaluate our model from a manually collected 280,000 matches of League of
Legends and a publicly available 50,000 matches of Dota2. Empirically, our

without disclosing their private data to a central aggregating server. Most
existing FL algorithms require models of identical architecture to be deployed
across the clients and server, making it infeasible to train large models due
to clients' limited system resources. In this work, we propose a novel ensemble
knowledge transfer method named Fed-ET in which small models (different in
architecture) are trained on clients, and used to train a larger model at the
server. Unlike in conventional ensemble learning, in FL the ensemble can be
trained on clients' highly heterogeneous data. Cognizant of this property,
Fed-ET uses a weighted consensus distillation scheme with diversity
regularization that efficiently extracts reliable consensus from the ensemble
while improving generalization by exploiting the diversity within the ensemble.
We show the generalization bound for the ensemble of weighted models trained on
heterogeneous datasets that supports the intuition of Fed-ET. Our experiments
on image and language tasks show that Fed-ET significantly outperforms other
state-of-the-art FL algorithms with fewer communicated parameters, and is also

set of results provides sharp lower bounds in the worst-case scenario for the
discrepancy between any data-based pricing strategies and the theoretical
optimal third-degree price discrimination (3PD) strategy (respectively, uniform
pricing strategy) derived from the distribution (where the sample is drawn)
ranging over a large class of distributions. Consequently, there is an
inevitable gap between revenues based on any data-based pricing strategy and
the revenue based on the theoretical optimal 3PD (respectively, uniform
pricing) strategy. We then propose easy-to-implement data-based 3PD and uniform
pricing strategies and show each strategy is minimax optimal in the sense that
the gap between their respective revenue and the revenue based on the
theoretical optimal 3PD (respectively, uniform pricing) strategy matches our
worst-case lower bounds up to constant factors (that are independent of the
sample size $n$). We show that 3PD strategies are revenue superior to uniform
pricing strategies if and only if the sample size $n$ is large enough. In other
words, if $n$ is below a threshold, uniform pricing strategies are revenue
superior to 3PD strategies. We further provide upper bounds for the gaps
between the welfare generated by our minimax optimal 3PD (respectively, uniform
pricing) strategy and the welfare based on the theoretical optimal 3PD
(respectively, uniform pricing) strategy.]]></summary>

feedback. In this setting, losses of an action are split into $d$ components,
spreading over consecutive rounds after the action is chosen. And in each

latest $d$ rounds. Previous works focus on oblivious adversarial setting, while
we investigate the harder non-oblivious setting. We show non-oblivious setting
incurs $\Omega(T)$ pseudo regret even when the loss sequence is bounded memory.
However, we propose a wrapper algorithm which enjoys $o(T)$ policy regret on
many adversarial bandit problems with the assumption that the loss sequence is
bounded memory. Especially, for $K$-armed bandit and bandit convex
optimization, we have $\mathcal{O}(T^{2/3})$ policy regret bound. We also prove
a matching lower bound for $K$-armed bandit. Our lower bound works even when

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graph clustering discovers groups or communities within networks. Deep
learning methods such as autoencoders (AE) extract effective clustering and
downstream representations but cannot incorporate rich structural information.
While Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have shown great success in encoding graph
structure, typical GNNs based on convolution or attention variants suffer from
over-smoothing, noise, heterophily, are computationally expensive and typically
require the complete graph being present. Instead, we propose Self-Supervised
Contrastive Graph Clustering (SCGC), which imposes graph-structure via
contrastive loss signals to learn discriminative node representations and
iteratively refined soft cluster labels. We also propose SCGC*, with a more
effective, novel, Influence Augmented Contrastive (IAC) loss to fuse richer
structural information, and half the original model parameters. SCGC(*) is
faster with simple linear units, completely eliminate convolutions and
attention of traditional GNNs, yet efficiently incorporates structure. It is
impervious to layer depth and robust to over-smoothing, incorrect edges and
heterophily. It is scalable by batching, a limitation in many prior GNN models,
and trivially parallelizable. We obtain significant improvements over
state-of-the-art on a wide range of benchmark graph datasets, including images,
sensor data, text, and citation networks efficiently. Specifically, 20% on ARI

deviation of the health states and contribute to the stability of mechanical
systems. In practice, very limited target bearing data are available to conduct
EFD, which makes it hard to adapt to the EFD task of new bearings. To address
this problem, many transfer learning based EFD methods utilize historical data
to learn transferable domain knowledge and conduct early fault detection on new
target bearings. However, most existing methods only consider the distribution
drift across different working conditions but ignore the difference between
bearings under the same working condition, which is called Unit-to-Unit
Variability (UtUV). The setting of EFD with limited target data considering
UtUV can be formulated as a Few-shot Anomaly Detection task. Therefore, this
paper proposes a novel EFD method based on meta-learning considering UtUV. The
proposed method can learn a generic metric based on Relation Network (RN) to
measure the similarity between normal data and the new arrival target bearing
data. Besides, the proposed method utilizes a health state embedding strategy
to decrease false alarms. The performance of proposed method is tested on two
bearing datasets. The results show that the proposed method can detect
incipient faults earlier than the baselines with lower false alarms.]]></summary>

engineering and scientific literature for solving a range of differential
equations with applications in weather modeling, healthcare, manufacturing, and
so on. Poor scalability is one of the barriers to utilizing PINNs for many
real-world problems. To address this, a Self-scalable tanh (Stan) activation
function is proposed for the PINNs. The proposed Stan function is smooth,
non-saturating, and has a trainable parameter. During training, it can allow
easy flow of gradients to compute the required derivatives and also enable
systematic scaling of the input-output mapping. It is also shown theoretically
that the PINN with the proposed Stan function has no spurious stationary points
when using gradient descent algorithms. The proposed Stan is tested on a couple
of numerical studies involving general regression problems. It is subsequently
used for solving multiple forward problems, which involve second-order
derivatives and multiple dimensions, and an inverse problem where the thermal
diffusivity is predicted through heat conduction in a rod. Our results of these
case studies establish empirically that the Stan activation function can
achieve better training and more accurate predictions than the state-of-the-art

problem, in which a group of agents are solving the same contextual multi-armed
bandit (CMAB) problem. However, the contexts are observed by a remotely
connected entity, i.e., the decision-maker, that updates the policy to maximize
the returned rewards, and communicates the arms to be sampled by the agents to
a controller over a rate-limited communications channel. This framework can be
applied to personalized ad placement, whenever the content owner observes the
website visitors, and hence has the context, but needs to transmit the ads to
be shown to a controller that is in charge of placing the marketing content.
Consequently, the rate-constrained CMAB (RC-CMAB) problem requires the study of
lossy compression schemes for the policy to be employed whenever the constraint
on the channel rate does not allow the uncompressed transmission of the
decision-maker's intentions. We characterize the fundamental information
theoretic limits of this problem by letting the number of agents go to
infinity, and study the regret that can be achieved, identifying the two
distinct rate regions leading to linear and sub-linear regrets respectively. We
then analyze the optimal compression scheme achievable in the limit with
infinite agents, when using the forward and reverse KL divergence as distortion
metric. Based on this, we also propose a practical coding scheme, and provide

logged data without further environment interaction. Model-based algorithms,
which learn a model of the environment from the dataset and perform
conservative policy optimisation within that model, have emerged as a promising
approach to this problem. In this work, we present Robust Adversarial
Model-Based Offline RL (RAMBO), a novel approach to model-based offline RL. To
achieve conservatism, we formulate the problem as a two-player zero sum game
against an adversarial environment model. The model is trained minimise the
value function while still accurately predicting the transitions in the
dataset, forcing the policy to act conservatively in areas not covered by the
dataset. To approximately solve the two-player game, we alternate between
optimising the policy and optimising the model adversarially. The problem
formulation that we address is theoretically grounded, resulting in a PAC
performance guarantee and a pessimistic value function which lower bounds the
value function in the true environment. We evaluate our approach on widely
studied offline RL benchmarks, and demonstrate that our approach achieves state

trolling or malicious content targeting users or communities. One way of
trolling users is by creating memes, which in most cases unites an image with a
short piece of text embedded on top of it. The situation is more complex for
multilingual(e.g., Tamil) memes due to the lack of benchmark datasets and
models. We explore several models to detect Troll memes in Tamil based on the
shared task, "Troll Meme Classification in DravidianLangTech2022" at ACL-2022.
We observe while the text-based model MURIL performs better for Non-troll meme
classification, the image-based model VGG16 performs better for Troll-meme
classification. Further fusing these two modalities help us achieve stable
outcomes in both classes. Our fusion model achieved a 0.561 weighted average F1
score and ranked second in this task.]]></summary>

compound-protein binding affinities (CPAs) could be improved by the
introduction of protein 3D structure information. However, most of these models
still suffer from a low accuracy due to the lack of an efficient approach to
encode informative protein features. The major challenge is how to combine the
multi-modal information such as the residue sequence of the protein, residue
atom coordinates and the torsion angles. To tackle this problem, we develop
Fast Evolutional Attention and Thoroughgoing-graph Neural Networks (FeatNN) to
facilitate the application of protein 3D structure information for predicting
CPAs. Specifically, we established a novel end-to-end architecture to jointly
embed torsion matrix, discrete distance matrix, and sequence information of
protein and extract compound features with deep graph convolution layers. In
addition, a new pairwise mapping attention mechanism is introduced to
comprehensively learn potential interaction information between proteins and
compounds. FeatNN considerably outperforms various state-of-the-art baselines
in CPA prediction with the Pearson value elevated by about 35.7%. Thus, FeatNN
provides an outstanding method for highly accurate CPA prediction and
facilitates high-throughput virtual screening of drug candidates.]]></summary>

idling and excess accelerations, contributing to fuel consumption and CO2
emissions. There has thus been a line of work studying eco-driving control
strategies to reduce fuel consumption and emission levels at intersections.
However, methods to devise effective control strategies across a variety of
traffic settings remain elusive. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement
learning (RL) approach to learn effective eco-driving control strategies. We
analyze the potential impact of a learned strategy on fuel consumption, CO2
emission, and travel time and compare with naturalistic driving and model-based
baselines. We further demonstrate the generalizability of the learned policies
under mixed traffic scenarios. Simulation results indicate that scenarios with
100% penetration of connected autonomous vehicles (CAV) may yield as high as
18% reduction in fuel consumption and 25% reduction in CO2 emission levels
while even improving travel speed by 20%. Furthermore, results indicate that
even 25% CAV penetration can bring at least 50% of the total fuel and emission
reduction benefits.]]></summary>

complexity of these real-world systems. The resulting complexity translates
into high computational costs for these systems' mathematical formulations and
simulation models. Research has illustrated the benefits of using machine
learning surrogate models as substitutes for computationally expensive models
during optimisation. This paper extends recent research into optimising
chemical plant design and operation. The study further explores Surrogate
Assisted Genetic Algorithms (SA-GA) in more complex variants of the original
plant design and optimisation problems, such as the inclusion of parallel and
feedback components. The novel extension to the original algorithm proposed in
this study, Surrogate Assisted NSGA-\Romannum{2} (SA-NSGA), was tested on a
popular literature case, the Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) system. We further
provide extensive experimentation, comparing various meta-heuristic
optimisation techniques and numerous machine learning models as surrogates. The
results for both sets of systems illustrate the benefits of using Genetic
Algorithms as an optimisation framework for complex chemical plant system
design and optimisation for both single and multi-objective scenarios. We
confirm that Random Forest surrogate assisted Evolutionary Algorithms can be
scaled to increasingly complex chemical systems with parallel and feedback
components. We further find that combining a Genetic Algorithm framework with
Machine Learning Surrogate models as a substitute for long-running simulation
models yields significant computational efficiency improvements, 1.7 - 1.84
times speedup for the increased complexity examples and a 2.7 times speedup for
the Pressure Swing Adsorption system.]]></summary>

Repeated exposure to abusive speech has created physiological effects on the

through manifold learning; the reduced latent space is discovered using
Diffusion Maps (a manifold learning technique) on time series data. A second
round of Diffusion Maps on those latent coordinates allows the approximation of
the reduced dynamical models. This second round enables mapping the latent
space coordinates back to the full ambient space (what is called lifting); it
also enables the approximation of full state functions of interest in terms of
the reduced coordinates. In our work, we develop and test three different
reduced numerical simulation methodologies, either through pre-tabulation in
the latent space and integration on the fly or by going back and forth between
the ambient space and the latent space. The data-driven latent space simulation
results, based on the three different approaches, are validated through (a) the
latent space observation of the full simulation through the Nystr\"om Extension
formula, or through (b) lifting the reduced trajectory back to the full ambient
space, via Latent Harmonics. Latent space modeling often involves additional
regularization to favor certain properties of the space over others, and the
mapping back to the ambient space is then constructed mostly independently from
these properties; here, we use the same data-driven approach to construct the
latent space and then map back to the ambient space.]]></summary>

multimodal approach learns to extract complementary information from TC and H&E
graphs corresponding to each stain while simultaneously learning an optimal
policy to combine this information. We report up to 20% improvement in

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many neural-based recommender systems were proposed in recent years and part
of them used Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to model user-item
interactions. However, the exploration of Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty
(WGAN-GP) on recommendation has received relatively less scrutiny. In this
paper, we focus on two questions: 1- Can we successfully apply WGAN-GP on
recommendation and does this approach give an advantage compared to the best
GAN models? 2- Are GAN-based recommender systems relevant? To answer the first
question, we propose a recommender system based on WGAN-GP called CFWGAN-GP
which is founded on a previous model (CFGAN). We successfully applied our
method on real-world datasets on the top-k recommendation task and the
empirical results show that it is competitive with state-of-the-art GAN
approaches, but we found no evidence of significant advantage of using WGAN-GP
instead of the original GAN, at least from the accuracy point of view. As for
the second question, we conduct a simple experiment in which we show that a
well-tuned conceptually simpler method outperforms GAN-based models by a
considerable margin, questioning the use of such models.]]></summary>

framework from an information-theoretic point of view. We extend the
traditional information bottleneck principle to learn common information among
different views in a self-supervised manner, and accordingly establish a new
framework called Self-supervised Information Bottleneck based Multi-view
Subspace Clustering (SIB-MSC). Inheriting the advantages from information
bottleneck, SIB-MSC can learn a latent space for each view to capture common
information among the latent representations of different views by removing
superfluous information from the view itself while retaining sufficient
information for the latent representations of other views. Actually, the latent
representation of each view provides a kind of self-supervised signal for
training the latent representations of other views. Moreover, SIB-MSC attempts
to learn the other latent space for each view to capture the view-specific
information by introducing mutual information based regularization terms, so as
to further improve the performance of multi-view subspace clustering. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore information bottleneck
for multi-view subspace clustering. Extensive experiments on real-world
multi-view data demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance over
the related state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Federated learning reduces the risk of information leakage, but remains
vulnerable to attacks. We investigate how several neural network design
decisions can defend against gradients inversion attacks. We show that
overlapping gradients provides numerical resistance to gradient inversion on
the highly vulnerable dense layer. Specifically, we propose to leverage
batching to maximise mixing of gradients by choosing an appropriate loss
function and drawing identical labels. We show that otherwise it is possible to
directly recover all vectors in a mini-batch without any numerical optimisation
due to the de-mixing nature of the cross entropy loss. To accurately assess
data recovery, we introduce an absolute variation distance (AVD) metric for
information leakage in images, derived from total variation. In contrast to
standard metrics, e.g. Mean Squared Error or Structural Similarity Index, AVD
offers a continuous metric for extracting information in noisy images. Finally,
our empirical results on information recovery from various inversion attacks
and training performance supports our defense strategies. These strategies are
also shown to be useful for deep convolutional neural networks such as LeNET
for image recognition. We hope that this study will help guide the development
of further strategies that achieve a trustful federation policy.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Federated Learning (FL) has recently made significant progress as a new
machine learning paradigm for privacy protection. Due to the high communication
cost of traditional FL, one-shot federated learning is gaining popularity as a
way to reduce communication cost between clients and the server. Most of the
existing one-shot FL methods are based on Knowledge Distillation; however,
distillation based approach requires an extra training phase and depends on
publicly available data sets. In this work, we consider a novel and challenging
setting: performing a single round of parameter aggregation on the local models
without server-side training on a public data set. In this new setting, we
propose an effective algorithm for Model Aggregation via Exploring Common
Harmonized Optima (MA-Echo), which iteratively updates the parameters of all
local models to bring them close to a common low-loss area on the loss surface,
without harming performance on their own data sets at the same time. Compared
to the existing methods, MA-Echo can work well even in extremely non-identical
data distribution settings where the support categories of each local model
have no overlapped labels with those of the others. We conduct extensive
experiments on two popular image classification data sets to compare the
proposed method with existing methods and demonstrate the effectiveness of
MA-Echo, which clearly outperforms the state-of-the-arts.]]></summary>

 Edit: I apologize if some of you felt tricked into completing the survey by the original version of the post. It does have about 50 questions but they are mostly just yes/no, good/bad, so it shouldn't take longer than 10 minutes. I intend to write a piece about how AI assistants are doing and prepare a compilation of AI fails. I will share the results :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, first of all sorry for my poor English. 
 I am fairly new to Deep RL, and RL in general. I want to implement custom environment with multiple robots in it. Each robot would be given same task to do, so what I am trying to do is simulate parallelism. 
 My question is: if i have 100 robots in simulation, do i have to instantiate 100 agents (neural networks) to control those robots or single network with batch size of 100 will suffice? Does batch of observations in anyway disturbs agent action (network) output? It would be much more memory efficient with single neural network. 
 So far, I've seen that in process of acting in env agent takes observation of batch size 1 and outputs corresponding action for that observation. Since each observation from the batch is propagated trough the network without calculating gradient it should not be affected by the batch size. If anyone could explain to me if my way of thinking is wrong, and why. :)

I am thinking I need a bot to skim through pdf's and through trial and error, I can take the pdf's and make the bot come up with suggestions to scripts or books.However I need to use an AI which already has training in English grammatical and sentence structure and langue/information flow. not nescceecarily interpretation meaning or philosophy or other higher levels of language proficiency.
 Say I wanted to write a novel about sailors. I'd let it skim some 100 novels on sailing, and generate inputs. then I'd match it up against a separate set of Ai to fact check each other. or even with form blogs from some sailing subreddits or news feeds. I could do this with any topic. medicine, engineering, biology, drama novels etc.
 Are there any free/opensource bots who already know the English language and might read books and make suggestions based on guided inputs?

 What do you think about the blog posts? Any blog posts that you particularly like or that are definitely worth reading? Any blog posts that actually have interesting contributions and/or that you plan to cite?
 But maybe more importantly: how do you think this will evolve? They seem to have decided to organise the blog post track again for next year's ICLR already. Do you think these kind of publications could have an impact on how we do science or is this rather a nice extra on top of scientific work?
 There has only been one post in this subreddit on one of the accepted blog posts (since the announcement). I think there are some nice blog posts in there, so I expected to find some discussions here, but it seems like it is either ignored or not worth discussing. Therefore, I thought it would be interesting to (try to) start a discussion. 
 TL;DR: what do you think of the ICLR blog post track and/or the accepted blog posts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on a ML model for data extraction out of documents. The model is trained and deployed into production. For fine tuning the model and improving performance I added the possibility for users to correct the extracted data. A concrete example would be: the model labels a word in the document as "company_name" the user corrects it to "street_name". This correction is then used to fine tune the model.
 Currently the fine tuning is done manually. That is, if the number of corrections exceeds some threshold I take them and start a new training and evaluate the new model before putting it into production. My question would be: is there an MLOps tool that automates this process? Or should I write one myself? I am aware of the tool seldon core that offers A/B testing for comparing the old model with the new one and putting it into production. But unfortunately it does not offer automatic fine tuning. Or that's what I understood from their website.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I’m working as a Data Scientist currently and I realized that most of my time is spent on feature engineering.
 My general practice is that I create aggregations of data (via sql because of the amount of data that needs to be processed) like sum, mean, avg, std, median, q25, q75. I need to do it on a few dozen features. Also I am calculating these aggregations on different time windows: previous week, previous month, previous 3 month. 
 At the end I end up with hundreds of features and I need to select the ones that make any sense, contain relevant information. Currently I am applying pandas profiling, or sweetviz on this huge dataset and trying to analyze it by eyeballing the results. 
 My main challenge is that this process is highly repetitive and manual. I am wondering if there is any tool out there that could help me automate this process and make some parts reusable? I like having a UI especially for visualizing the data.
 Am I doing something wrong or is there a tool that I’m clearly not aware of?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am faced with something that I thought was simpe but I have been thinking about it so much that I now very confused. Any suggestions are helpful ! 
 Let's assume the scenario that you have a database of cars. For each car you have a brand, model, colour etc. 
 You have an api for this db which you can call, with a car id, and surface the car data. People rely on this api for fast and up to date car information. You have 1 million cars in the db.
 Assume now there is a requirement to predict a yes/no if the car has a black front bumper (completely made up requirement). This has to be surfaced to the api users along with the car data. You have built a classifier for this, and it takes some time to surface a prediction, e.g. 2 mins. You select what you think is the best operating point for your classifier.
 When a new car gets added into the db you can now run your predictor and you get back a probability and depending on the operating point a yes/no.
 What is the best approach here now ? 
 Do you store the result of this prediction in the database (probability, model_version and boolean result) alongside the rest of the car data ? Less flexible as if you decide to tweak the operating point you will need to recalculate the new boolean values for all cars - but you have consistency wrt to what you have in the db and what you return to your users. If there is a mistake you can readily fix it by altering the boolean field.
 Do you just store the probabilities and decide on the yes/no using the model_version & operating point only when you surface the data to the end user ? More flexible if you decide to tweak the opearting point of the classifier.
 or would you have a completely different approach ? 
 Would you change anything, if for some cars you have the ground truth data of they have a black bumper or not in the db already ?
 Thanks for reading !

 What are some real world tasks that it can help with? I've seen it used a lot for playing games, self driving cars, and manufacturing robotics. Anything else that it can be applied to? Will it likely be used for autonomous robots when they become more common?
 What are some areas that can be improved upon? What are the most recent advancements and what is a good topic to focus on for future research?

 My plan, as it stands, is to use python in concert with some sort of generic voice to text software to get a list of timestamps for any F words, and then use that list of timestamps to generate an FFMPEG command to cut the audio at each timestamp and remerge into a new video. Does anyone have any recommendations for audio processing packages or better approaches? I'm keen to use anything with hardware acceleration (because making a script to abuse my shiny new graphics card is half my motivation).
 P.S. I haven't touched python much since graduating, can't wait to dig my claws back in. Although... if anyone has an audio processing package in C# that would be hecking cool too

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am working on compression of deep neural networks using reinforcement learning. There is one agent that learns to compress convolutional layers using C actions and another one that compresses dense layers using D actions. If there are two conv layers and 3 dense layers, 5 actions have to be selected in a sequence using both agents in order to fully compress the model. I read the paper AdaDeep and found it really useful for my research, but I don't get why the authors select all actions and they only calculate the reward after completely compressing the network instead of getting the reward after each action. In their place I would select the action, calculate the reward of that action and store it in the replay. By only using immediate reward, the agent should be able to learn which sequence of actions would work the best for the current model. Why assign the same reward to the selected actions for each layer? Is it only because the outcome was due to the combination of actions and they want to speed up training? If my understanding is correct, assigning the immediate reward to each action would yield the same results in the long run. Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I was wondering how long it would take or if it would be possible for a model with 6 billion neurons to become able to predict that for 6 7 8 the next number should be 9, given only a single training example 1 2 3. Let's say we use an architecture like the ones used in GPT.
 Essentially, I am trying to make sense of something here: is the human design component in DL the weak link in the AGI chain? Much like we could not achieve a true AI by manually coding each rule with if's and else, perhaps we cannot achieve true intelligence by manually designing the networks.
 Can we grow a model organically so it immediately gets this right from a single training example, and continue using the same network to keep on learning from rich input and making new observations. For guidance, the network can use what it already knows, learning outward. A pre-programmed inherent ability to find motifs, for example with STUMPY and Time Series Analysis, allows it to make relationship observations, and is how the agent immediately guesses that a numeric pattern increments by 1 from a single training example.
 Putting this into DL, perhaps we can achieve something less organic but still good using a model-agnostic architecture with multi-resolution 'tiles' of neurons. Some property of the information would theoretically allow deciding if the tile should be upgraded to a higher resolution (more neurons), and a side buffer keeps track of the connections between these tiles and tries to move the topology forward, adding some small clusters, removing others, attempting to connect them, etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reading the original diffusion models paper and the improved diffusion model by openAI, I noticed they are using EMA (exponential moving average) to update the parameters of the models.
 so I started looking at the code openAI published for their version of the diffusion models, and when looking at the code, I see that the model during the training process has its params stored in a variable called "master_params" and then they create a deep copy of the params and call them ema_params.
 when looking at the "optimize_normal" method, I see that they update the model params using AdamW and gradient descent, and then after that, they update the ema param variable using the EMA equation, so that means the actual model params do a full gradient descent step to the reach minimum of the loss function, and then they do a pseudo step from the original parameters before the optimizer and making them closer to the params after the optimizer.
 but then looking at the rest of the code, all I see is that they just save a checkpoint of the ema params to the disk but never update the model params using them or anything.
 so my question is, what is the EMA for if it is not used during training and the model is fully updated using "classical" machine learning optimization with gradient descent?
 only at inference time do they load the EMA params to generate images, instead of the regular params that were updated using the AdamW?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have reached a blocking point in a current project. We are using K-Prototypes to segment two populations (one with 100k elements and the other with 1M). In order to evaluate the clustering, during our K-Means stage we used silhouettes which are already implemented in sklearn.
 For the second stage, this became a problem. Either it was a time issue or a memory issue. So, for the 100k dataset, finding the silhouette profile took around 50 hours using a custom distance metric function. 
 While this is feasible in the project's scope, for the 1M dataset the computation time would be highly impractical.
 As such, at the moment, we are stuck without a proper evaluation metric for our model. Sure, we can run Davies-Bouldin or other similar metrics, but the silhouette profile gave us much more detailed information.
 We are also moving the project to databricks. At first, the pyspark clustering evaluator had me hopeful, but it has very limited options regarding distance metrics.
 This is also an issue because the model is to be deployed in production and should have some metric informing when it needs to be retrained. While this point is still fluid, this is the preferred course of action.
 Has anyone faced similar issues using K-Prototypes? Or just silhouette profiles with custom distance metrics?

What I mean is, among the training/validation/test quotas, the number of hidden layers, the type of activation functions, the size of each layers, how do I iterate to find the optimal combination without having to try every little mix?
 Is there a way to rank the impact of these 4 components on the mse and iterate one at a time to select each aspect? Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not going to make this vague. Specifically I'm seeing a lot of comments related to Elon Musk saying he's going to remove bots from Twitter. There's a lot of speculation on how this could be done with comments suggesting a captcha-based system for every post/reply (or maybe every action?). More specifically people seem fixated on captcha systems that can't be botted. (Ignore for a moment the accessibility issues and audio fallbacks that might be required).
 I'm aware that Tesla transitioned to using more massive synthetic datasets for training, so this might be somewhat outdated. That said they do have a lot of data collection of new real world data from their sensors. This has me curious on the estimated value of large-scale captcha systems directly tied with a company that might need large-scale labeling services.
 I'm sure researchers here have run numbers on labeling services and how to best to utilize them. (Goes without saying the prices vary quite a bit and cover a wide range of tasks from simple bounding boxes to relatively expensive polygons for semantic labeling. For example just as a reference: https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/data-labeling/pricing ). Most services don't list prices for like 500 million tasks which makes sense given that's a lot.
 A captcha system would have independent users redoing tasks multiple times to find baselines, but in general it would average to find a ground truth label. This redundant work isn't wasted in this sense as it can find say difficult scenarios and refine labels.
 I could naively say 500 million / (10 USD/1000 tasks) = 5 million USD a day not counting server costs and development. Not super scientific though and it seems high. (I have doubts on if gathering 500 million samples of value a day to even get labeled is realistic).
 I digress, what would you say is the hypothetical value of such a system using short captcha tasks?

There are 55 different task-specific modules that MRKL currently supports. If the router is unsure which module is best, it calls on Jurassic-1. Jurassic also helps compose the contextual language around MRKL’s response. This allows MRKL to give factual answers with up-to-date information instead of being limited to its training data alone, and gives it the ability to carry out a much wider range of NLP tasks as compared to other LLM's like Google's PaLM or OpenAI's GPT-3

 I personally do not own such a CPU yet but I'm considering upgrading to one soon, so I am looking for experiences of people with such a CPU on training reinforcement models. Does everything work as expected? Are there annoyances?
 I'm using Ray Tune + RLlib in which I assign a single core per trial. In this case I'm expecting that trials running on E-cores will simply run (much) slower than those running on P-cores.
 In case a single trial gets assigned both a P-core and an E-core, I do expect a serious slow-down. 
 These are all guesses really, so I'm looking for people with actual experience here.
 Thanks.

 I managed to implement the policy iteration from Sutton & Barto, 2018 on the FrozenLake-v1 and wanted to do the same now Taxi-v3 environment.
 My code has been running now for 45min so I guess there is something wrong, but I can't wrap my head around what it could be.
 Would appreciate some input on what I need to change so that it will work.
 Please see my code here:
 ```[python] import gym # openAi gym import torch import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from tqdm import trange # progressbar

 env = gym.make('Taxi-v3')
 def policy_evaluation(env: gym.Env, policy: torch.Tensor, gamma: float, threshold: float): V = torch.zeros(env.observation_space.n) delta = float("inf")

 Automatic curriculum generation is one of the most promising avenues for Reinforcement Learning today. Multiple approaches have been proposed, each with their own set of advantages and drawbacks. This paper presents ACCEL, which takes the next step into the direction of constructing curricula for multi-capable agents. ACCEL combines the adversarial adaptiveness of regret-based sampling methods with the capabilities of level-editing, usually found in Evolutionary Methods.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello hivemind.
 Context
 I am working on streamlined design strategies for (manual) neural architecture design. I recently came across a simple, receptive field-based strategy that allows me to reliably improve the architectures of some SOTA models like EfficientNet by up +1.5% top1-accuracy.That being said, there seems to be a trade-off between performance and number of computations I put into the same number of parameters.Basically, the more computationally expensive the architectural change is, the better the performance turns out to be. The number of parameters does not change in the process. The model becomes therefore more parameter efficient but computationally less efficient, which you could consider a somewhat Pyrrhic victory.
 Now to my question:
 Is there use for parameter efficiency in models when it does not also coincide with computational efficiency? Is there any literature on the topic you can recommend?

 GitHub Actions solved a DevOps burden many of us felt by providing an easy-to-configure CI/CD tool to build, test, and deploy pipelines. However, when it comes to ML pipelines, and working with data, models, and experimentation in mind, the workflow is not as well defined and can get tricky to implement.
 DagsHub is kind of like GitHub for machine learning, which extends what GitHub did for code management to track data, models, experiments, and data pipelines. We do this by integrating awesome open source tools like DVC, MLflow, Label Studio, and more. One of our most requested features was a deeper integration with GitHub that will let…]]></summary>

Offline reinforcement learning allows learning policies from previously collected data, which has profound implications for applying RL in domains where running trial-and-error learning is impractical or dangerous, such as safety-critical settings like autonomous driving or medical treatment planning. In such scenarios, online exploration is simply too risky, but offline RL methods can learn effective policies from logged data collected by humans or heuristically designed controllers.  Prior learning-based control methods have also approached learning from existing data as imitation learning: if the data is generally “goo…]]></summary>

 Hi everyone!

You might find them interesting if you're looking for new ideas for spare-time or even post-grad research projects.
  
We've open-sourced a dataset of about 50k labeled product web pages from roughly 8000 distinct e-commerce merchants, available as MHTML and WebTraversalLibrary clones (see next point :) ), along with the corresponding screenshots. Not all of the MHTMLs render correctly, but the ones that do also have screenshots in a corresponding dataset for CV applications. You can find doc…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite it's immense popularity in academia, it's surprisingly difficult to download the ImageNet Object Localization dataset. As far as I can tell this is due to legal issues -- no single entity owns the copyright to the images, so no entity can host the whole dataset.
 The result is that if you want to use ImageNet you're forced to either manually scrape a million URLs (requiring both cpu time, your time, and imposing costs on a million unsuspecting websites), know somebody who has already done that, or fetch it from a legally questionable source.
 So I have a couple questions:
  
Is the owner of the ImageNet dataset on Kaggle performing a selfless public service, thanklessly accepting legal liability to make ImageNet more accessible? Or is she protected (e.g. by fair use)? Is she required to accept DMCA requests?
 If I'd like to share ImageNet (I've recently downloaded it and processed it to be ~10 GB, which seems like a helpful thing to share), is there any legally safe path for me to do this?

 Currently I am writing my thesis on the effects of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on employee performance through employee engagement.
 If you work in a company that uses AI and you:
 - have a direct relationship (e.g. data scientist) or indirect relationship (e.g. business manager) with AI
 - often or sometimes use AI in your daily work
 then your insights are essential for my master thesis research and I would really appreciate it if you would fill out the survey below (5-10 min / English & Dutch translation).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a few questions about implementing the N Step version of Prioritized Replay Buffer (for Rainbow DQN). I'm implementing the Atari version of this buffer. To conserve memory, I'm only storing the states (and the last state of each episode) in an unstacked manner. That is, if the frame stack is 4, and the shape of states returned by the environment is 4, I'm storing only the last state of the stacked states. This way the buffer contains all transitions from each episode. As for the N Steps part, I'm only calculating the n_step states when getting states from the buffer instead of storing the N Step transitions directly.
  
For the prioritized version, how do the priorities work? If I wasn't trying to conserve memory, I would have stored the N Step stacked states directly and update the priorities for the segment trees and the segment tree pointers only when moving the data from the N Step buffer to the main buffer. But now that I'm calculating the N Step experience directly when sampling and not when adding data to the buffer, when do I update the priorities and the tree pointer? Once per state? Once per stacked state? Once per N Step stacked state?
 When I update the priorities for the sampled batch, the priorities are associated with multiple states (because the states are stacked). But because I don't store the stacked states and only the raw unstacked states, to which of these states should I update the priority for? And because I don't store the n step transitions anymore, to which of the N Steps should the priorities be associated with?
 If I want to create such a buffer for a vector env, how would I go about doing it? I'm thinking of maintaining a separate segment tree for each env. Is that correct? Is there a better way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Consider a fixed maze with size (100x400) and fixed start and endpoints (1,1) and (99,399), where doors dynamically appear around the agent every time an observation has been made. The doors disapear after some time step n (for simplicity say n=1). For pitty sake lets say the optimum path length is 1000 steps and there is only one way to reach it.
 I have two questions: 
 (1) What would be the most appropriate way to frame reward function? I have tested both volatile aproach (i.e. episodeis terminated if agent steps into wall or previosuly made path, otherwise is rewarded in "cheese" every 5 steps) and not-so-volatile approach (i.e. free roam for maximum 2000 steps with cheese reward every 5 steps). Evidently these do not work, are there other perhaps more promising approaches or such large mazes?
 (2) Does the colour of objects in a frame matter to the (convolutional) DQN's learning of the maze. Considering a 3 channel RGB input, is there perhaps a smarter way to colour code the walls/emptypath/etc.? Its a bit of a weird question but my curiosity arises from short-term memory examples (namely, space invaders) where the input, multiple greyscale frames, is chosen over one rgb frame - so to this degree channels can be understood as higher-level "features" of a frame, hence, can the colours of different objects be optimised? If so is there a logical way of viewing such optimisation?
 Any other advice is always welcome :)
 ​
 N.B. yes, this could probably be solved with other easier methods but lets just say DQN (or other deep-Q alternatives) is needed.

Ok the manner of teching is different but the concept is the same. Then, in a second phase, we test the model with a test set.
 My question is, if I choose RL for classification problem, what is the contribution that we can have compared to another algorithm?

From time to time, it gets stuck around the obstacle corner and fails to move anymore. Like the picture shows below. I guess it relates to my bad design for giving the next observation for an action that can't make the agent move forward. Currently, my design evenly separates the action into 10 substeps, and returns the observation which corresponds to the step right before the agent meets an obstacle.
 It looks like I won't have this issue for mujoco environment like Ant. But it is really hard to see their design.

 From what I saw, most examples of this on the internet are using an Adam optimizer for this with a learning rate of 0.1 and a weight decay of 1e-6. 
 This doesn't seem quite right with me, So if any of you know what's the source for this convention and if there are other alternatives I'd appreciate this information very much.

As for other games, if we have enough human resources and computing performance, we also can get similar results.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is about a project that I am working on; Hope the ML community can help me!
 I have collected few hours of air pollutants data using Aeroqual sensors and custom made sensors. 3 types of data is available in the project; aeroqual, custom, council data. Where council data can be taken for granted (It comes from the govt installed high spec sensor).
 Aeroqual is a commercial sensor manufacturing company, its data should be accurate. The first part of the project is about checking the accuracy of custom sensor. So, I have done few analysis on the data; and found that custom sensor data has similarity (but not same, there are so much variation in the custom sensor data) with council sensor data but aeroqual data is way different.
 I am attaching the plot below which I have done.
 ​
  
So I need to know is there any method that I can find relationship between these three datasets?
 Is it possible to make these data align togather?
 I need to build an ML model to predict the air pollutant level using this data. any tips for getting this thing working?
  
- Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My problem is probably what you have guessed: it's understanding the technical specifications which are usually written in a non-coding-friendly way. Sometimes crucial information is completely missing from the paper ex: loss function description for a DL algorithm. For the lucky cases where there are already available implementations on github to a given paper, usually they are either very distinguishable from each other in terms of code structure which questions their validity or whether they match what the paper authors intended specially with varying measurable results, or they are almost exact copies from one another. There are numerous examples where I can show specific papers with varying degrees of complexity, and discuss why the conversion can be tricky but they may require standalone discussions themselves, likely outside the scope of this one. Is there a way to approach the problem assuming the absence of reference code?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I host an important org level meeting (~100 attendees) every week, and need to share minutes after the meeting. I am so tired of listening to conversations again just to capture important points, summarise discussion and action items. Is there any model/api which can help me do that? I use Amazon transcribe to generate transcripts, which helps, but it is not very accurate. For me the priority would be: 1) Model/api which is better than Amazon transcribe 2) Auto Identify speakers / speaker diarization (since mostly the same set of people speak) 3) Summarise the conversations into topics (we have time and agenda based discussion)
 I am sure this might be a problem across the industry since most of the meetings happen online, and someone wastes hours after meeting to send notes. I did find some tools which summarise the transcript, but i need to auto send in a specific format and identify topics based on conversion (maybe we can input the agenda in advance). Also this is private information, so I need something on premise, hence looking for a repo or model which i can use to build something on top.
 Please let me know if something exists or someone working on similar projects. Happy to collaborate and contribute.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am training PPO2 model on stable-baseline library. I have tabular data with 15000 rows, thus length of the episodes is 15000. I am using nminibatches=4, n_envs=1. For example, I have set total_timesteps=10000. During the training process agent will see 15000 rows several times and updates actions for each rows, but in some particular point, the rest of the time total_timesteps will not be enough to see the full episode, and only part of episodes is available in the last step of learning. To be concrete. For simplicity, lets say we have 10 raws, 23 total_timesteps. The agent will see the full episode 2 times, and only the first 3 rows in the third times and rest of the 7 raws have not seen during last step.
 I want to stop the learning process when Agent reaches the last time full episodes (above example stop learning at when total_timesteps=20) or define total_timesteps in such a way to see full episodes at the end of the training step.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This research will test the human ability to distinguish human written text from text generated by artificial intelligence. Participating will only take 10 minutes. You will receive 2 short news articles about the same topic. One will be written by a human, the other one will be generated by artificial intelligence. It is up to you to find out which one is written by artificial intelligence. You will be asked to do this for four different subjects, namely: Science, Economics & Politics, Society and Sports. At the end of the survey you will receive feedback on how well you have performed.
 The human written articles were collected from various news websites. The Articles created by artificial intelligence were generated using GPT-3 from OpenAI.
 Purpose of the research: We are trying to find out how well GPT-3 performs across subjects. Are there any subject GPT-3 is better at writing about, or is he equally good across all subjects. Secondly we are testing the ability of GPT-3 to generate articles about events that happened after the training of the model.

I have my final interview with the VP of Engineering. When asked how best to prepare myself, they said they would like to test my ability to write "production quality" code in python. While I do have some experience, the downside is I worked in small R&D teams for a long time. Though I am knowledgeable in python, perhaps, I might have not followed all the industry best practices.
 If you are a hiring manager or interviewer, how would you test this ability? How do I prepare myself to prove my ability to write production grade code?
 Thank you all so much in advance.

In general, I want to use the images that I generate with the generator to train a classifier while being as realistic as possible. At first, I wanted to let them train for 24 hours each, define some early stopping criteria and save the checkpoints with the lowest loss through a callback. But it seems that the lower loss does not always lead to more realistic images. So how do I compare the different models in a scientific way? Because the results highly depend on the epoch I choose and my subjective feeling, which images look the best.

 if one would want to get into AI and especially human like AI, would you still recommend getting into machine learning first? As far as i know machine learning doesnt even try to develop "human like" AI/"bottom up AI", but rather focuses on training algorythms to solve specific problems.
 I know human like AI is something thats highly complex and we still need years if not even decades to achieve something even close to it but i would appreciate tips and ideas nonetheless.
 (after reading through my question again this sounds like a generic question thats being asked here everyday, if thats the case please send me a link to a similar post if there is one :) )

where papers get accepted to journals, conferences, or other venues on the
basis of reviews from other researchers, who ideally are subject area experts
and thus are qualified to evaluate the paper. The reviewers also cannot have a
conflict of interest with the authors, and should not be overwhelmed with too
many papers to review. This is the ideal world, and is not always what happens
in practice.
From my experience in the robotics academic community (and this may apply to
other disciplines), it generally seems like there is no standard definition of
an “appropriate” or “maximum” reviewing load for a reviewer. This is difficult
to define as different papers mandate different reviewing efforts; a massive

 If you are using jax and you need to pass some pytrees between processes, I may have something for you :)
 I developed a "treequeue". It is a queue that is made for pytree's nested arrays.
 The transfer speed is up to 10 times higher than regular queues. This is done by utilizing shared memory arrays and avoiding pickling data. This can be very useful when developing distributed architecture, e.g. distributed reinforcement learning where speed is at the upmost importance.
 In my case this implementation was very useful to remove bottlenecks when implementing PBT algorithms!

In the derivation of VPG, the tutorial said"The environment has no dependence on /theta(the parameter of policy), so gradients of R(/tau)(total return of the trajectory) with respect of /theta is 0. 
 However, the trajectory depends on our policy, and our policy depends on /theta. As a result, I am confused why total return of trajectory is independent from /theta.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From improving the user experience to making the computational infrastructure more effective, AI is a crucial aspect of making current software systems and products perform as well as possible. AI is often more effective than even precisely developed human-crafted heuristic tactics today, whether it’s reducing latency, boosting the quality of a video stream, or streamlining the interfaces to match a specific person’s demands. But, to use AI more effectively in various products, several challenges must be addressed: the system must accommodate software engineers without machine learning backgrounds; it must provide mechanisms to optimize for a variety of product goals, which may differ from closed-form machine learning loss functions; it must distinguish causal connections from data correlations; and it must scale efficiently to train, host, and monitor vast numbers of AI models. 
 Meta Researchers Develop ‘Looper,’ an end-to-end AI platform that has been designed with easy-to-use APIs for optimization, personalization, and feedback collecting to answer these needs. Looper may be used to support the entire machine learning lifecycle, from model training to deployment and inference to product evaluation and optimization. Looper allows us to modify the existing products to leverage AI for personalized optimizations rather than having to rebuild them around AI models. Currently, the Looper platform hosts 700 AI models and produces 4 million AI outputs every second.

A ResNet50 architecture is used as an encoder network with the input being an RGB image + depth map concatenated as (224 x 224 x 4). In the paper it is argued that a point cloud can also be used, or some other sensor modality would also work
 The encoder network output (feature map of 7 x 7 x 2048) is fed into a decoder network that takes it back to (224 x 224 x 5) with pixel wise semantic segmentation of 5 classes: lane, road line, sidewalk, vehicles or pedestrians, and others

straightforward and simple kernel based approximation for manifold learning
that does not require the knowledge of anything about the manifold, except for
its dimension. In this paper, we examine how the pointwise error in
approximation using least squares optimization based on similarly localized
kernels depends upon the data characteristics and deteriorates as one goes away
from the training data. The theory is presented with an abstract localized
kernel, which can utilize any prior knowledge about the data being located on
an unknown sub-manifold of a known manifold.

We demonstrate the performance of our approach using a publicly available
micro-Doppler data set, and investigate the use of different preprocessing
measures, kernels, and manifold dimensions. Specifically, it is shown that the
localized kernel introduced in the above mentioned paper when used with PCA
components leads to a near-competitive performance to deep neural networks, and
offers significant improvements in training speed and memory requirements. To
demonstrate the fact that our methods are agnostic to the domain knowledge, we
examine the classification problem in a simple video data set.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sepsis is a life-threatening condition with organ dysfunction and is a
leading cause of death and critical illness worldwide. Accurate detection of
sepsis during emergency department triage would allow early initiation of lab
analysis, antibiotic administration, and other sepsis treatment protocols. The
purpose of this study was to determine whether EHR data can be extracted and
synthesized with the latest machine learning algorithms (KATE Sepsis) and
clinical natural language processing to produce accurate sepsis models, and
compare KATE Sepsis performance with existing sepsis screening protocols, such
as SIRS and qSOFA. A machine learning model (KATE Sepsis) was developed using
patient encounters with triage data from 16 participating hospitals. KATE
Sepsis, SIRS, standard screening (SIRS with source of infection) and qSOFA were
tested in three settings. Cohort-A was a retrospective analysis on medical
records from a single Site 1. Cohort-B was a prospective analysis of Site 1.
Cohort-C was a retrospective analysis on Site 1 with 15 additional sites.
Across all cohorts, KATE Sepsis demonstrates an AUC of 0.94-0.963 with
73-74.87% TPR and 3.76-7.17% FPR. Standard screening demonstrates an AUC of
0.682-0.726 with 39.39-51.19% TPR and 2.9-6.02% FPR. The qSOFA protocol
demonstrates an AUC of 0.544-0.56, with 10.52-13.18% TPR and 1.22-1.68% FPR.
For severe sepsis, across all cohorts, KATE Sepsis demonstrates an AUC of
0.935-0.972 with 70-82.26% TPR and 4.64-8.62% FPR. For septic shock, across all
cohorts, KATE Sepsis demonstrates an AUC of 0.96-0.981 with 85.71-89.66% TPR
and 4.85-8.8% FPR. SIRS, standard screening, and qSOFA demonstrate low AUC and
TPR for severe sepsis and septic shock detection. KATE Sepsis provided
substantially better sepsis detection performance in triage than commonly used

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inspired by the human cognitive system, attention is a mechanism that
imitates the human cognitive awareness about specific information, amplifying
critical details to focus more on the essential aspects of data. Deep learning
has employed attention to boost performance for many applications.
Interestingly, the same attention design can suit processing different data
modalities and can easily be incorporated into large networks. Furthermore,
multiple complementary attention mechanisms can be incorporated in one network.
Hence, attention techniques have become extremely attractive. However, the
literature lacks a comprehensive survey specific to attention techniques to
guide researchers in employing attention in their deep models. Note that,
besides being demanding in terms of training data and computational resources,
transformers only cover a single category in self-attention out of the many
categories available. We fill this gap and provide an in-depth survey of 50
attention techniques categorizing them by their most prominent features. We
initiate our discussion by introducing the fundamental concepts behind the
success of attention mechanism. Next, we furnish some essentials such as the
strengths and limitations of each attention category, describe their
fundamental building blocks, basic formulations with primary usage, and
applications specifically for computer vision. We also discuss the challenges
and open questions related to attention mechanism in general. Finally, we
recommend possible future research directions for deep attention.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep learning has recently achieved initial success in program analysis tasks
such as bug detection. Lacking real bugs, most existing works construct
training and test data by injecting synthetic bugs into correct programs.
Despite achieving high test accuracy (e.g. >90%), the resulting bug detectors
are found to be surprisingly unusable in practice, i.e., <10% precision when
used to scan real software repositories. In this work, we argue that this
massive performance difference is caused by distribution shift, i.e., a
fundamental mismatch between the real bug distribution and the synthetic bug
distribution used to train and evaluate the detectors. To address this key
challenge, we propose to train a bug detector in two phases, first on a
synthetic bug distribution to adapt the model to the bug detection domain, and
then on a real bug distribution to drive the model towards the real
distribution. During these two phases, we leverage a multi-task hierarchy,
focal loss, and contrastive learning to further boost performance. We evaluate
our approach extensively on three widely studied bug types, for which we
construct new datasets carefully designed to capture the real bug distribution.
The results demonstrate that our approach is practically effective and
successfully mitigates the distribution shift: our learned detectors are highly
performant on both our constructed test set and the latest version of open
source repositories.]]></summary>

discussion forums on topics ranging from political campaigns to relationship
consultation. Enhancing people's ability to write persuasive arguments could
not only practice their critical thinking and reasoning but also contribute to
the effectiveness and civility in online communication. It is, however, not an
easy task in online discussion settings where written words are the primary
communication channel. In this paper, we derived four design goals for a tool
that helps users improve the persuasiveness of arguments in online discussions
through a survey with 123 online forum users and interviews with five debating
experts. To satisfy these design goals, we analyzed and built a labeled dataset
of fine-grained persuasive strategies (i.e., logos, pathos, ethos, and
evidence) in 164 arguments with high ratings on persuasiveness from
ChangeMyView, a popular online discussion forum. We then designed an
interactive visual system, Persua, which provides example-based guidance on
persuasive strategies to enhance the persuasiveness of arguments. In
particular, the system constructs portfolios of arguments based on different
persuasive strategies applied to a given discussion topic. It then presents
concrete examples based on the difference between the portfolios of user input
and high-quality arguments in the dataset. A between-subjects study shows
suggestive evidence that Persua encourages users to submit more times for
feedback and helps users improve more on the persuasiveness of their arguments
than a baseline system. Finally, a set of design considerations was summarized
to guide future intelligent systems that improve the persuasiveness in text.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learning to hash pictures a list-wise sorting problem. Its testing metrics,
e.g., mean-average precision, count on a sorted candidate list ordered by
pair-wise code similarity. However, scarcely does one train a deep hashing
model with the sorted results end-to-end because of the non-differentiable
nature of the sorting operation. This inconsistency in the objectives of
training and test may lead to sub-optimal performance since the training loss
often fails to reflect the actual retrieval metric. In this paper, we tackle
this problem by introducing Naturally-Sorted Hashing (NSH). We sort the Hamming
distances of samples' hash codes and accordingly gather their latent
representations for self-supervised training. Thanks to the recent advances in
differentiable sorting approximations, the hash head receives gradients from
the sorter so that the hash encoder can be optimized along with the training
procedure. Additionally, we describe a novel Sorted Noise-Contrastive
Estimation (SortedNCE) loss that selectively picks positive and negative
samples for contrastive learning, which allows NSH to mine data semantic
relations during training in an unsupervised manner. Our extensive experiments
show the proposed NSH model significantly outperforms the existing unsupervised
hashing methods on three benchmarked datasets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The reconstruction of electrons and photons in CMS depends on topological
clustering of the energy deposited by an incident particle in different
crystals of the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL). These clusters are formed
by aggregating neighbouring crystals according to the expected topology of an
electromagnetic shower in the ECAL. The presence of upstream material
(beampipe, tracker and support structures) causes electrons and photons to
start showering before reaching the calorimeter. This effect, combined with the
3.8T CMS magnetic field, leads to energy being spread in several clusters
around the primary one. It is essential to recover the energy contained in
these satellite clusters in order to achieve the best possible energy
resolution for physics analyses. Historically satellite clusters have been
associated to the primary cluster using a purely topological algorithm which
does not attempt to remove spurious energy deposits from additional pileup
interactions (PU). The performance of this algorithm is expected to degrade
during LHC Run 3 (2022+) because of the larger average PU levels and the
increasing levels of noise due to the ageing of the ECAL detector. New methods
are being investigated that exploit state-of-the-art deep learning
architectures like Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and self-attention algorithms.
These more sophisticated models improve the energy collection and are more
resilient to PU and noise, helping to preserve the electron and photon energy
resolution achieved during LHC Runs 1 and 2. This work will cover the
challenges of training the models as well the opportunity that this new
approach offers to unify the ECAL energy measurement with the particle
identification steps used in the global CMS photon and electron reconstruction.]]></summary>

based on Gaussian and Bayesian algorithms can detect the anomalous sensor data

based on Graph convolutional network, Residual algorithm and Long short-term

transferring learned knowledge across different tasks. However, MTL must deal
with challenges such as: overfitting to low resource tasks, catastrophic
forgetting, and negative task transfer, or learning interference. Often, in
Natural Language Processing (NLP), a separate model per task is needed to
obtain the best performance. However, many fine-tuning approaches are both
parameter inefficient, i.e., potentially involving one new model per task, and
highly susceptible to losing knowledge acquired during pretraining. We propose
a novel Transformer architecture consisting of a new conditional attention
mechanism as well as a set of task-conditioned modules that facilitate weight
sharing. Through this construction (a hypernetwork adapter), we achieve more
efficient parameter sharing and mitigate forgetting by keeping half of the
weights of a pretrained model fixed. We also use a new multi-task data sampling
strategy to mitigate the negative effects of data imbalance across tasks. Using
this approach, we are able to surpass single task fine-tuning methods while
being parameter and data efficient (using around 66% of the data for weight
updates). Compared to other BERT Large methods on GLUE, our 8-task model
surpasses other Adapter methods by 2.8% and our 24-task model outperforms by
0.7-1.0% models that use MTL and single task fine-tuning. We show that a larger
variant of our single multi-task model approach performs competitively across
26 NLP tasks and yields state-of-the-art results on a number of test and
development sets. Our code is publicly available at

patients, how patients interact with healthcare providers, and how healthcare
information is disseminated to both healthcare providers and patients.
Analytical models that were trained and tested pre-pandemic may no longer be
performing up to expectations, providing unreliable and irrelevant learning
(ML) models given that ML depends on the basic principle that what happened in
the past are likely to repeat in the future. ML faced to two important
degradation principles, concept drift, when the underlying properties and
characteristics of the variables change and data drift, when the data
distributions, probabilities, co-variates, and other variable relationships
change, both of which are prime culprits of model failure. Therefore, detecting
and diagnosing drift in existing models is something that has become an
imperative. And perhaps even more important is a shift in our mindset towards a
conscious recognition that drift is inevitable, and model building must
incorporate intentional resilience, the ability to offset and recover quickly
from failure, and proactive robustness, avoiding failure by developing models
that are less vulnerable to drift and disruption.]]></summary>

cyber-threat detection to equipment maintenance and health monitoring. However,
choosing a suitable algorithm for a given application remains a challenging
design decision, often informed by the literature on anomaly detection
algorithms. We extensively reviewed twelve of the most popular unsupervised
anomaly detection methods. We observed that, so far, they have been compared
using inconsistent protocols - the choice of the class of interest or the
positive class, the split of training and test data, and the choice of
hyperparameters - leading to ambiguous evaluations. This observation led us to
define a coherent evaluation protocol which we then used to produce an updated
and more precise picture of the relative performance of the twelve methods on
five widely used tabular datasets. While our evaluation cannot pinpoint a
method that outperforms all the others on all datasets, it identifies those
that stand out and revise misconceived knowledge about their relative
performances.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The COVID-19 pandemic has been severely impacting global society since
December 2019. Massive research has been undertaken to understand the
characteristics of the virus and design vaccines and drugs. The related
findings have been reported in biomedical literature at a rate of about 10,000
articles on COVID-19 per month. Such rapid growth significantly challenges
manual curation and interpretation. For instance, LitCovid is a literature
database of COVID-19-related articles in PubMed, which has accumulated more
than 200,000 articles with millions of accesses each month by users worldwide.
One primary curation task is to assign up to eight topics (e.g., Diagnosis and
Treatment) to the articles in LitCovid. Despite the continuing advances in
biomedical text mining methods, few have been dedicated to topic annotations in
COVID-19 literature. To close the gap, we organized the BioCreative LitCovid
track to call for a community effort to tackle automated topic annotation for
COVID-19 literature. The BioCreative LitCovid dataset, consisting of over
30,000 articles with manually reviewed topics, was created for training and
testing. It is one of the largest multilabel classification datasets in
biomedical scientific literature. 19 teams worldwide participated and made 80
submissions in total. Most teams used hybrid systems based on transformers. The
highest performing submissions achieved 0.8875, 0.9181, and 0.9394 for macro
F1-score, micro F1-score, and instance-based F1-score, respectively. The level
of participation and results demonstrate a successful track and help close the
gap between dataset curation and method development. The dataset is publicly
available via https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/lu/LitCovid/biocreative/ for
benchmarking and further development.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We introduce an unsupervised clustering algorithm to improve training
efficiency and accuracy in predicting energies using molecular-orbital-based
machine learning (MOB-ML). This work determines clusters via the Gaussian
mixture model (GMM) in an entirely automatic manner and simplifies an earlier
supervised clustering approach [J. Chem. Theory Comput., 15, 6668 (2019)] by
eliminating both the necessity for user-specified parameters and the training
of an additional classifier. Unsupervised clustering results from GMM have the
advantage of accurately reproducing chemically intuitive groupings of frontier
molecular orbitals and having improved performance with an increasing number of
training examples. The resulting clusters from supervised or unsupervised
clustering is further combined with scalable Gaussian process regression (GPR)
or linear regression (LR) to learn molecular energies accurately by generating
a local regression model in each cluster. Among all four combinations of
regressors and clustering methods, GMM combined with scalable exact Gaussian
process regression (GMM/GPR) is the most efficient training protocol for
MOB-ML. The numerical tests of molecular energy learning on thermalized
datasets of drug-like molecules demonstrate the improved accuracy,
transferability, and learning efficiency of GMM/GPR over not only other
training protocols for MOB-ML, i.e., supervised regression-clustering combined
with GPR(RC/GPR) and GPR without clustering. GMM/GPR also provide the best
molecular energy predictions compared with the ones from literature on the same
benchmark datasets. With a lower scaling, GMM/GPR has a 10.4-fold speedup in
wall-clock training time compared with scalable exact GPR with a training size
of 6500 QM7b-T molecules.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Online learning with expert advice is a fundamental problem of sequential
prediction. In this problem, the algorithm has access to a set of $n$ "experts"
who make predictions on each day. The goal on each day is to process these
predictions, and make a prediction with the minimum cost. After making a
prediction, the algorithm sees the actual outcome on that day, updates its
state, and then moves on to the next day. An algorithm is judged by how well it
does compared to the best expert in the set.

The classical algorithm for this problem is the multiplicative weights
algorithm. However, every application, to our knowledge, relies on storing
weights for every expert, and uses $\Omega(n)$ memory. There is little work on
understanding the memory required to solve the online learning with expert
advice problem, or run standard sequential prediction algorithms, in natural
streaming models, which is especially important when the number of experts, as
well as the number of days on which the experts make predictions, is large.

We initiate the study of the learning with expert advice problem in the
streaming setting, and show lower and upper bounds. Our lower bound for i.i.d.,
random order, and adversarial order streams uses a reduction to a custom-built
problem using a novel masking technique, to show a smooth trade-off for regret
versus memory. Our upper bounds show novel ways to run standard sequential
prediction algorithms in rounds on small "pools" of experts, thus reducing the
necessary memory. For random-order streams, we show that our upper bound is
tight up to low order terms. We hope that these results and techniques will
have broad applications in online learning, and can inspire algorithms based on
standard sequential prediction techniques, like multiplicative weights, for a
wide range of other problems in the memory-constrained setting.]]></summary>

leading performances in many generative tasks. However, the inherited iterative
sampling process costs hindered their applications to speech synthesis. This
paper proposes FastDiff, a fast conditional diffusion model for high-quality
speech synthesis. FastDiff employs a stack of time-aware location-variable
convolutions of diverse receptive field patterns to efficiently model long-term
time dependencies with adaptive conditions. A noise schedule predictor is also
adopted to reduce the sampling steps without sacrificing the generation
quality. Based on FastDiff, we design an end-to-end text-to-speech synthesizer,
FastDiff-TTS, which generates high-fidelity speech waveforms without any
intermediate feature (e.g., Mel-spectrogram). Our evaluation of FastDiff
demonstrates the state-of-the-art results with higher-quality (MOS 4.28) speech
samples. Also, FastDiff enables a sampling speed of 58x faster than real-time
on a V100 GPU, making diffusion models practically applicable to speech
synthesis deployment for the first time. We further show that FastDiff
generalized well to the mel-spectrogram inversion of unseen speakers, and
FastDiff-TTS outperformed other competing methods in end-to-end text-to-speech
synthesis. Audio samples are available at \url{https://FastDiff.github.io/}.]]></summary>

can effectively erase backdoor triggers from DNNs, it still suffers from
non-negligible Attack Success Rate (ASR) together with lowered classification
ACCuracy (ACC), since NAD focuses on backdoor defense using attention features
(i.e., attention maps) of the same order. In this paper, we introduce a novel
backdoor defense framework named Attention Relation Graph Distillation (ARGD),
which fully explores the correlation among attention features with different
orders using our proposed Attention Relation Graphs (ARGs). Based on the
alignment of ARGs between both teacher and student models during knowledge
distillation, ARGD can eradicate more backdoor triggers than NAD. Comprehensive
experimental results show that, against six latest backdoor attacks, ARGD
outperforms NAD by up to 94.85% reduction in ASR, while ACC can be improved by

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Contrastive learning is widely used for recommendation model learning, where
selecting representative and informative negative samples is critical. Existing
methods usually focus on centralized data, where abundant and high-quality
negative samples are easy to obtain. However, centralized user data storage and
exploitation may lead to privacy risks and concerns, while decentralized user
data on a single client can be too sparse and biased for accurate contrastive
learning. In this paper, we propose a federated contrastive learning method
named FedCL for privacy-preserving recommendation, which can exploit
high-quality negative samples for effective model training with privacy well
protected. We first infer user embeddings from local user data through the
local model on each client, and then perturb them with local differential
privacy (LDP) before sending them to a central server for hard negative
sampling. Since individual user embedding contains heavy noise due to LDP, we
propose to cluster user embeddings on the server to mitigate the influence of
noise, and the cluster centroids are used to retrieve hard negative samples
from the item pool. These hard negative samples are delivered to user clients
and mixed with the observed negative samples from local data as well as
in-batch negatives constructed from positive samples for federated model
training. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show FedCL can
empower various recommendation methods in a privacy-preserving way.]]></summary>

representation learning technique. Several research directions improve
traditional contrastive approaches, e.g., prototypical contrastive methods
better capture the semantic similarity among instances and reduce the
computational burden by considering cluster prototypes or cluster assignments,
while adversarial instance-wise contrastive methods improve robustness against
a variety of attacks. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work jointly
considers robustness, cluster-wise semantic similarity and computational
efficiency. In this work, we propose SwARo, an adversarial contrastive

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Differentiable architecture search has gradually become the mainstream
research topic in the field of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for its high
efficiency compared with the early NAS (EA-based, RL-based) methods. Recent
differentiable NAS also aims at further improving the search performance and
reducing the GPU-memory consumption. However, these methods are no longer
naturally capable of tackling the non-differentiable objectives, e.g., energy,
resource-constrained efficiency, and other metrics, let alone the
multi-objective search demands. Researches in the multi-objective NAS field
target this but requires vast computational resources cause of the sole
optimization of each candidate architecture. In light of this discrepancy, we
propose the TND-NAS, which is with the merits of the high efficiency in
differentiable NAS framework and the compatibility among non-differentiable
metrics in Multi-objective NAS. Under the differentiable NAS framework, with
the continuous relaxation of the search space, TND-NAS has the architecture
parameters ($\alpha$) been optimized in discrete space, while resorting to the
progressive search space shrinking by $\alpha$. Our representative experiment
takes two objectives (Parameters, Accuracy) as an example, we achieve a series
of high-performance compact architectures on CIFAR10 (1.09M/3.3\%, 2.4M/2.95\%,
9.57M/2.54\%) and CIFAR100 (2.46M/18.3\%, 5.46/16.73\%, 12.88/15.20\%)
datasets. Favorably, compared with other multi-objective NAS methods, TND-NAS
is less time-consuming (1.3 GPU-days on NVIDIA 1080Ti, 1/6 of that in
NSGA-Net), and can be conveniently adapted to real-world NAS scenarios
(resource-constrained, platform-specialized).]]></summary>

adapted to a downstream NLP task. However, theoretical analysis of these models
is scarce and challenging since the pretraining and downstream tasks can be
very different. We propose an analysis framework that links the pretraining and
downstream tasks with an underlying latent variable generative model of text --
the downstream classifier must recover a function of the posterior distribution
over the latent variables. We analyze head tuning (learning a classifier on top
of the frozen pretrained model) and prompt tuning in this setting. The
generative model in our analysis is either a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) or an
HMM augmented with a latent memory component, motivated by long-term
dependencies in natural language. We show that 1) under certain non-degeneracy
conditions on the HMM, simple classification heads can solve the downstream
task, 2) prompt tuning obtains downstream guarantees with weaker non-degeneracy
conditions, and 3) our recovery guarantees for the memory-augmented HMM are
stronger than for the vanilla HMM because task-relevant information is easier
to recover from the long-term memory. Experiments on synthetically generated
data from HMMs back our theoretical findings.]]></summary>

keypoints is typically large (~ 17) and this necessitates the use of robust
neural network architectures and training pipelines that can capture the
relevant features from the input image. These features are then aggregated to
make accurate heatmap predictions from which the final keypoints of human body
parts can be inferred. Many papers in literature use CNN-based architectures
for the backbone, and/or combine it with a transformer, after which the
features are aggregated to make the final keypoint predictions [1]. In this
paper, we consider the recently proposed Bottleneck Transformers [2], which
combine CNN and multi-head self attention (MHSA) layers effectively, and we
integrate it with a Transformer encoder and apply it to the task of 2D human
pose estimation. We consider different backbone architectures and pre-train
them using the DINO self-supervised learning method [3], this pre-training is
found to improve the overall prediction accuracy. We call our model BTranspose,
and experiments show that on the COCO validation set, our model achieves an AP
of 76.4, which is competitive with other methods such as [1] and has fewer
network parameters. Furthermore, we also present the dependencies of the final

there are always domain gaps between training datasets and the open-world which
must be understood. In this work, we investigate the domain gaps between
high-resolution and low-resolution LiDAR sensors in object detection networks.
Using a unique dataset, which enables us to study sensor resolution domain gaps
independent of other effects, we show two distinct domain gaps - an inference
domain gap and a training domain gap. The inference domain gap is characterised
by a strong dependence on the number of LiDAR points per object, while the
training gap shows no such dependence. These fndings show that different

(IRM), have recently emerged as promising approaches for Domain Generalization
(DG). Despite the promising theory, invariance principle-based approaches fail
in common classification tasks due to the mixture of the true invariant
features and the spurious invariant features. In this paper, we propose a
framework based on the conditional entropy minimization principle to filter out
the spurious invariant features leading to a new algorithm with a better
generalization capability. We theoretically prove that under some particular
assumptions, the representation function can precisely recover the true
invariant features. In addition, we also show that the proposed approach is
closely related to the well-known Information Bottleneck (IB) framework. Both

data is critically important in fields such as climate science, healthcare, and
economics. Recent work focuses on designing neural-network architectures and
regularization functions to allow for scalable estimation of average and
individual-level dose response curves from high-dimensional, large-sample data.
Such methodologies assume ignorability (all confounding variables are observed)
and positivity (all levels of treatment can be observed for every unit
described by a given covariate value), which are especially challenged in the
continuous treatment regime. Developing scalable sensitivity and uncertainty
analyses that allow us to understand the ignorance induced in our estimates
when these assumptions are relaxed receives less attention. Here, we develop a
continuous treatment-effect marginal sensitivity model (CMSM) and derive bounds
that agree with both the observed data and a researcher-defined level of hidden
confounding. We introduce a scalable algorithm to derive the bounds and
uncertainty-aware deep models to efficiently estimate these bounds for
high-dimensional, large-sample observational data. We validate our methods
using both synthetic and real-world experiments. For the latter, we work in
concert with climate scientists interested in evaluating the climatological
impacts of human emissions on cloud properties using satellite observations
from the past 15 years: a finite-data problem known to be complicated by the
presence of a multitude of unobserved confounders.]]></summary>

typical SOTA system is composed of four main modules -- mapper, global planner,
local planner, and command-tracking controller -- in a hierarchical manner. In
this paper, we build a robust and safe local planner which is designed to
generate a velocity plan to track a coarsely planned path from the global
planner. Previous works used waypoint-based methods (e.g.
Proportional-Differential control and pure pursuit) which simplify the path
tracking problem to local point-goal navigation. However, they suffer from
frequent collisions in geometrically complex and narrow environments because of
two reasons; the global planner uses a coarse and inaccurate model and the
local planner is unable to track the global plan sufficiently well. Currently,
deep learning methods are an appealing alternative because they can learn
safety and path feasibility from experience more accurately. However, existing
deep learning methods are not capable of planning for a long horizon. In this
work, we propose a learning-based fully autonomous navigation framework
composed of three innovative elements: a learned forward dynamics model (FDM),
an online sampling-based model-predictive controller, and an informed
trajectory sampler (ITS). Using our framework, a quadruped robot can
autonomously navigate in various complex environments without a collision and
generate a smoother command plan compared to the baseline method. Furthermore,
our method can reactively handle unexpected obstacles on the planned path and
avoid them. Project page

interest" from co-registered bi-temporal images. The performance of existing
deep supervised CD methods is attributed to the large amounts of annotated data
used to train the networks. However, annotating large amounts of remote sensing
images is labor-intensive and expensive, particularly with bi-temporal images,
as it requires pixel-wise comparisons by a human expert. On the other hand, we
often have access to unlimited unlabeled multi-temporal RS imagery thanks to
ever-increasing earth observation programs. In this paper, we propose a simple
yet effective way to leverage the information from unlabeled bi-temporal images
to improve the performance of CD approaches. More specifically, we propose a
semi-supervised CD model in which we formulate an unsupervised CD loss in
addition to the supervised Cross-Entropy (CE) loss by constraining the output
change probability map of a given unlabeled bi-temporal image pair to be
consistent under the small random perturbations applied on the deep feature
difference map that is obtained by subtracting their latent feature
representations. Experiments conducted on two publicly available CD datasets
show that the proposed semi-supervised CD method can reach closer to the
performance of supervised CD even with access to as little as 10% of the
annotated training data. Code available at https://github.com/wgcban/SemiCD]]></summary>

classifier trained on labeled source data. They are widely used for adapting a
model to unlabeled data, e.g., in a semi-supervised learning setting.

Our key insight is that pseudo-labels are naturally imbalanced due to
intrinsic data similarity, even when a model is trained on balanced source data
and evaluated on balanced target data. If we address this previously unknown
imbalanced classification problem arising from pseudo-labels instead of
ground-truth training labels, we could remove model biases towards false
majorities created by pseudo-labels.

We propose a novel and effective debiased learning method with pseudo-labels,
based on counterfactual reasoning and adaptive margins: The former removes the
classifier response bias, whereas the latter adjusts the margin of each class
according to the imbalance of pseudo-labels. Validated by extensive
experimentation, our simple debiased learning delivers significant accuracy
gains over the state-of-the-art on ImageNet-1K: 26% for semi-supervised
learning with 0.2% annotations and 9% for zero-shot learning. Our code is

data is limited in low-resource scenarios, and highly expressive speech has
large acoustic variety. To address this issue, we propose a novel data
augmentation method that combines pitch-shifting and VC techniques. Because
pitch-shift data augmentation enables the coverage of a variety of pitch
dynamics, it greatly stabilizes training for both VC and TTS models, even when
only 1,000 utterances of the target speaker's neutral data are available.

binary classification problems. They traditionally assume equal
misclassification costs for each class; however, real-world problems may have
an uneven class distribution. This article introduces EBCS-SVM: evolutionary
bilevel cost-sensitive SVMs. EBCS-SVM handles imbalanced classification
problems by simultaneously learning the support vectors and optimizing the SVM
hyperparameters, which comprise the kernel parameter and misclassification
costs. The resulting optimization problem is a bilevel problem, where the lower
level determines the support vectors and the upper level the hyperparameters.
This optimization problem is solved using an evolutionary algorithm (EA) at the
upper level and sequential minimal optimization (SMO) at the lower level. These
two methods work in a nested fashion, that is, the optimal support vectors help
guide the search of the hyperparameters, and the lower level is initialized
based on previous successful solutions. The proposed method is assessed using
70 datasets of imbalanced classification and compared with several
state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results, supported by a Bayesian
test, provided evidence of the effectiveness of EBCS-SVM when working with

analysis of morphological, spatial, and topological information across
biological scales. The development of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) has
created the opportunity to address this information complexity via graph-driven
architectures, since GCNs can perform feature aggregation, interaction, and
reasoning with remarkable flexibility and efficiency. These GCNs capabilities
have spawned a new wave of research in medical imaging analysis with the
overarching goal of improving quantitative disease understanding, monitoring,
and diagnosis. Yet daunting challenges remain for designing the important
image-to-graph transformation for multi-modality medical imaging and gaining
insights into model interpretation and enhanced clinical decision support. In
this review, we present recent GCNs developments in the context of medical
image analysis including imaging data from radiology and histopathology. We
discuss the fast-growing use of graph network architectures in medical image
analysis to improve disease diagnosis and patient outcomes in clinical
practice. To foster cross-disciplinary research, we present GCNs technical
advancements, emerging medical applications, identify common challenges in the
use of image-based GCNs and their extensions in model interpretation,
large-scale benchmarks that promise to transform the scope of medical image
studies and related graph-driven medical research.]]></summary>

automatically from data for the case of systems which have lumped states

examine how similar techniques are able to construct models of systems which
have spatially distributed rather than lumped states. We describe several novel

tomography (IVOCT) has significant advantages for guiding percutaneous coronary
interventions. To aid IVOCT research studies, we developed the Optical
Coherence TOmography PlaqUe and Stent (OCTOPUS) analysis software. To automate
image analysis results, the software includes several important algorithmic
steps: pre-processing, deep learning plaque segmentation, machine learning
identification of stent struts, and registration of pullbacks. Interactive
visualization and manual editing of segmentations were included in the
software. Quantifications include stent deployment characteristics (e.g., stent
strut malapposition), strut level analysis, calcium angle, and calcium
thickness measurements. Interactive visualizations include (x,y) anatomical, en
face, and longitudinal views with optional overlays. Underlying plaque
segmentation algorithm yielded excellent pixel-wise results (86.2% sensitivity
and 0.781 F1 score). Using OCTOPUS on 34 new pullbacks, we determined that
following automated segmentation, only 13% and 23% of frames needed any manual
touch up for detailed lumen and calcification labeling, respectively. Only up
to 3.8% of plaque pixels were modified, leading to an average editing time of
only 7.5 seconds/frame, an approximately 80% reduction compared to manual
analysis. Regarding stent analysis, sensitivity and precision were both greater
than 90%, and each strut was successfully classified as either covered or
uncovered with high sensitivity (94%) and specificity (90%). We introduced and
evaluated the clinical application of a highly automated software package,
OCTOPUS, for quantitative plaque and stent analysis in IVOCT images. The
software is currently used as an offline tool for research purposes; however,
the software's embedded algorithms may also be useful for real-time treatment
planning.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The freeform architectural modeling process often involves two important
stages: concept design and digital modeling. In the first stage, architects
usually sketch the overall 3D shape and the panel layout on a physical or
digital paper briefly. In the second stage, a digital 3D model is created using
the sketch as a reference. The digital model needs to incorporate geometric
requirements for its components, such as the planarity of panels due to
consideration of construction costs, which can make the modeling process more
challenging. In this work, we present a novel sketch-based system to bridge the
concept design and digital modeling of freeform roof-like shapes represented as
planar quadrilateral (PQ) meshes. Our system allows the user to sketch the
surface boundary and contour lines under axonometric projection and supports
the sketching of occluded regions. In addition, the user can sketch feature
lines to provide directional guidance to the PQ mesh layout. Given the 2D
sketch input, we propose a deep neural network to infer in real-time the
underlying surface shape along with a dense conjugate direction field, both of
which are used to extract the final PQ mesh. To train and validate our network,
we generate a large synthetic dataset that mimics architect sketching of
freeform quadrilateral patches. The effectiveness and usability of our system
are demonstrated with quantitative and qualitative evaluation as well as user
studies.]]></summary>

transit ridership has drawn increasing interest. However, challenges stemming
from spatio-temporal dependency and non-stationarity have not been fully
addressed in modelling and predicting transit ridership under the influence of
weather conditions especially with the traditional statistical approaches.
Drawing on three-month smart card data in Brisbane, Australia, this research
adopts and assesses a suite of machine-learning algorithms, i.e., random
forest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Tweedie XGBoost, to model and
predict near real-time bus ridership in relation to sudden change of weather
conditions. The study confirms that there indeed exists a significant level of
spatio-temporal variability of weather-ridership relationship, which produces
equally dynamic patterns of prediction errors. Further comparison of model
performance suggests that Tweedie XGBoost outperforms the other two
machine-learning algorithms in generating overall more accurate prediction
outcomes in space and time. Future research may advance the current study by
drawing on larger data sets and applying more advanced machine and

ongoing evaluation series conducted by the U.S. National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) since 1996. It was the second large-scale multimodal
speaker/person recognition evaluation organized by NIST (the first one being
SRE19). Similar to SRE19, it featured two core evaluation tracks, namely audio
and audio-visual, as well as an optional visual track. In addition to offering
fixed and open training conditions, it also introduced new challenges for the
community, thanks to a new multimodal (i.e., audio, video, and selfie images)
and multilingual (i.e., with multilingual speakers) corpus, termed WeCanTalk,
collected outside North America by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC). These
challenges included: 1) trials (target and non-target) with enrollment and test
segments originating from different domains (i.e., telephony versus video), and
2) trials (target and non-target) with enrollment and test segments spoken in
different languages (i.e., cross-lingual trials). This paper presents an
overview of SRE21 including the tasks, performance metric, data, evaluation
protocol, results and system performance analyses. A total of 23 organizations
(forming 15 teams) from academia and industry participated in SRE21 and
submitted 158 valid system outputs. Evaluation results indicate: audio-visual
fusion produce substantial gains in performance over audio-only or visual-only
systems; top performing speaker and face recognition systems exhibited
comparable performance under the matched domain conditions present in this
evaluation; and, the use of complex neural network architectures (e.g., ResNet)
along with angular losses with margin, data augmentation, as well as long
duration fine-tuning contributed to notable performance improvements for the
audio-only speaker recognition task.]]></summary>

state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithm applied to the
morphological classification of radio galaxies. We test if SSL with fewer
labels can achieve test accuracies comparable to the supervised
state-of-the-art and whether this holds when incorporating previously unseen
data. We find that for the radio galaxy classification problem considered, SSL
provides additional regularisation and outperforms the baseline test accuracy.
However, in contrast to model performance metrics reported on computer science
benchmarking data-sets, we find that improvement is limited to a narrow range
of label volumes, with performance falling off rapidly at low label volumes.
Additionally, we show that SSL does not improve model calibration, regardless
of whether classification is improved. Moreover, we find that when different
underlying catalogues drawn from the same radio survey are used to provide the
labelled and unlabelled data-sets required for SSL, a significant drop in
classification performance is observered, highlighting the difficulty of
applying SSL techniques under dataset shift. We show that a class-imbalanced
unlabelled data pool negatively affects performance through prior probability
shift, which we suggest may explain this performance drop, and that using the
Frechet Distance between labelled and unlabelled data-sets as a measure of
data-set shift can provide a prediction of model performance, but that for
typical radio galaxy data-sets with labelled sample volumes of O(1000), the
sample variance associated with this technique is high and the technique is in
general not sufficiently robust to replace a train-test cycle.]]></summary>

nonparametric regression problems with a focus on NN's ability to adaptively
estimate functions with heterogeneous smoothness -- a property of functions in
Besov or Bounded Variation (BV) classes. Existing work on this problem requires
tuning the NN architecture based on the function spaces and sample sizes. We
consider a "Parallel NN" variant of deep ReLU networks and show that the
standard weight decay is equivalent to promoting the $\ell_p$-sparsity
($0<p<1$) of the coefficient vector of an end-to-end learned function bases,
i.e., a dictionary. Using this equivalence, we further establish that by tuning
only the weight decay, such Parallel NN achieves an estimation error
arbitrarily close to the minimax rates for both the Besov and BV classes.
Notably, it gets exponentially closer to minimax optimal as the NN gets deeper.
Our research sheds new lights on why depth matters and how NNs are more
powerful than kernel methods.]]></summary>

proximal gradient algorithm for feedback controls of finite-time horizon
stochastic control problems. The state dynamics are continuous time nonlinear
diffusions with controlled drift and possibly degenerate noise, and the
objectives are nonconvex in the state and nonsmooth in the control. We prove
under suitable conditions that the algorithm converges linearly to a stationary
point of the control problem, and is stable with respect to policy updates by
approximate gradient steps. The convergence result justifies the recent
reinforcement learning heuristics that adding entropy regularization or a
fictitious discount factor to the optimization objective accelerates the
convergence of policy gradient methods. The proof exploits careful regularity

and diagnosing drift in existing models is something that has become an
imperative. And perhaps even more important is a shift in our mindset towards a
conscious recognition that drift is inevitable, and model building must
incorporate intentional resilience, the ability to offset and recover quickly
from failure, and proactive robustness, avoiding failure by developing models
that are less vulnerable to drift and disruption.]]></summary>

hyperparameters (such as learning rates and momenta) or take several times

develop an approximate hypergradient-based hyperparameter optimiser which is
applicable to any continuous hyperparameter appearing in a differentiable model
weight update, yet requires only one training episode, with no restarts. We
also provide a motivating argument for convergence to the true hypergradient,
and perform tractable gradient-based optimisation of independent learning rates
for each model parameter. Our method performs competitively from varied random
hyperparameter initialisations on several UCI datasets and Fashion-MNIST (using

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We describe how the Fink broker early supernova Ia classifier optimizes its
ML classifications by employing an active learning (AL) strategy. We
demonstrate the feasibility of implementation of such strategies in the current
Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) public alert data stream. We compare the
performance of two AL strategies: uncertainty sampling and random sampling. Our
pipeline consists of 3 stages: feature extraction, classification and learning
strategy. Starting from an initial sample of 10 alerts (5 SN Ia and 5 non-Ia),
we let the algorithm identify which alert should be added to the training
sample. The system is allowed to evolve through 300 iterations. Our data set
consists of 23 840 alerts from the ZTF with confirmed classification via
cross-match with SIMBAD database and the Transient name server (TNS), 1 600 of
which were SNe Ia (1 021 unique objects). The data configuration, after the
learning cycle was completed, consists of 310 alerts for training and 23 530
for testing. Averaging over 100 realizations, the classifier achieved 89%
purity and 54% efficiency. From 01/November/2020 to 31/October/2021 Fink has
applied its early supernova Ia module to the ZTF stream and communicated
promising SN Ia candidates to the TNS. From the 535 spectroscopically
classified Fink candidates, 459 (86%) were proven to be SNe Ia. Our results
confirm the effectiveness of active learning strategies for guiding the
construction of optimal training samples for astronomical classifiers. It
demonstrates in real data that the performance of learning algorithms can be
highly improved without the need of extra computational resources or
overwhelmingly large training samples. This is, to our knowledge, the first
application of AL to real alerts data.]]></summary>

systems in varied domains such as weather prediction, text prediction and
several others. Often one wishes to supplement the experimentally observed
dynamics with prior knowledge or intuition about the system. While the
recurrent nature of these networks allows them to model arbitrarily long
memories in the time series used in training, it makes it harder to impose
prior knowledge or intuition through generic constraints. In this work, we
present a path sampling approach based on principle of Maximum Caliber that
allows us to include generic thermodynamic or kinetic constraints into
recurrent neural networks. We show the method here for a widely used type of
recurrent neural network known as long short-term memory network in the context
of supplementing time series collected from different application domains.
These include classical Molecular Dynamics of a protein and Monte Carlo
simulations of an open quantum system continuously losing photons to the

generalized to other generative artificial intelligence models and to generic
time series in different areas of physical and social sciences, where one

tuning the NN architecture based on the function spaces and sample sizes. We
consider a "Parallel NN" variant of deep ReLU networks and show that the
standard weight decay is equivalent to promoting the $\ell_p$-sparsity
($0<p<1$) of the coefficient vector of an end-to-end learned function bases,
i.e., a dictionary. Using this equivalence, we further establish that by tuning
only the weight decay, such Parallel NN achieves an estimation error
arbitrarily close to the minimax rates for both the Besov and BV classes.
Notably, it gets exponentially closer to minimax optimal as the NN gets deeper.
Our research sheds new lights on why depth matters and how NNs are more

transfer learning. Existing studies usually assume that the learned new feature
representation is \emph{domain-invariant}, and thus train a transfer model
$\mathcal{M}$ on the source domain. In this paper, we consider a more realistic
scenario where the new feature representation is suboptimal and small
divergence still exists across domains. We propose a new transfer model called
Randomized Transferable Machine (RTM) to handle such small divergence of
domains. Specifically, we work on the new source and target data learned from
existing feature-based transfer methods. The key idea is to enlarge source
training data populations by randomly corrupting the new source data using some
noises, and then train a transfer model $\widetilde{\mathcal{M}}$ that performs
well on all the corrupted source data populations. In principle, the more
corruptions are made, the higher the probability of the new target data can be
covered by the constructed source data populations, and thus better transfer
performance can be achieved by $\widetilde{\mathcal{M}}$. An ideal case is with
infinite corruptions, which however is infeasible in reality. We develop a
marginalized solution that enables to train an $\widetilde{\mathcal{M}}$
without conducting any corruption but equivalent to be trained using infinite
source noisy data populations. We further propose two instantiations of
$\widetilde{\mathcal{M}}$, which theoretically show the transfer superiority
over the conventional transfer model $\mathcal{M}$. More importantly, both
instantiations have closed-form solutions, leading to a fast and efficient
training process. Experiments on various real-world transfer tasks show that
RTM is a promising transfer model.]]></summary>

success in dealing with graph-structured data. Nevertheless, it is well known
that deep GCNs suffer from the over-smoothing problem, where node
representations tend to be indistinguishable as more layers are stacked up. The
theoretical research to date on deep GCNs has focused primarily on expressive
power rather than trainability, an optimization perspective. Compared to
expressivity, trainability attempts to address a more fundamental question:
Given a sufficiently expressive space of models, can we successfully find a
good solution via gradient descent-based optimizers? This work fills this gap
by exploiting the Graph Neural Tangent Kernel (GNTK), which governs the
optimization trajectory under gradient descent for wide GCNs. We formulate the
asymptotic behaviors of GNTK in the large depth, which enables us to reveal the
dropping trainability of wide and deep GCNs at an exponential rate in the
optimization process. Additionally, we extend our theoretical framework to
analyze residual connection-based techniques, which are found to be merely able
to mitigate the exponential decay of trainability mildly. Inspired by our
theoretical insights on trainability, we propose Critical DropEdge, a
connectivity-aware and graph-adaptive sampling method, to alleviate the
exponential decay problem more fundamentally. Experimental evaluation
consistently confirms using our proposed method can achieve better results

guarantees for in-distribution generalization of quantum neural networks

out-of-distribution generalization in QML, where we require a trained model to
perform well even on data drawn from a distribution different from the training

task of learning an unknown unitary using a QNN and for a broad class of
training and testing distributions. In particular, we show that one can learn
the action of a unitary on entangled states using only product state training
data. We numerically illustrate this by showing that the evolution of a
Heisenberg spin chain can be learned using only product training states. Since
product states can be prepared using only single-qubit gates, this advances the
prospects of learning quantum dynamics using near term quantum computers and
quantum experiments, and further opens up new methods for both the classical

(PCRs), for both finite-dimensional (parametric) and infinite-dimensional
(nonparametric) Bayesian models. Critical to our approach is the combination of
an assumption of local Lipschitz-continuity for the posterior distribution with
a dynamic formulation of the Wasserstein distance, here referred to as
Wasserstein dynamics, which allows to set forth a connection between the
problem of establishing PCRs and some classical problems in mathematical
analysis, probability theory and mathematical statistics: the Laplace method
for approximating integrals, Sanov's large deviation principles in the
Wasserstein distance, rates of convergence of the mean Glivenko-Cantelli
theorem, and estimates of weighted Poincar\'e-Wirtinger constants. Under
dominated Bayesian models, we present two main results: i) a theorem on PCRs
for the regular infinite-dimensional exponential family of statistical models;
ii) a theorem on PCRs for a general dominated statistical model. Some
applications of our results are presented for the regular parametric model, the
multinomial model, the finite-dimensional and the infinite-dimensional
logistic-Gaussian model and the infinite-dimensional linear regression. In
general, our results lead to optimal PCRs in finite dimension, whereas in
infinite dimension it is shown how the prior distribution may affect PCRs. With
regards to infinite-dimensional Bayesian models for density estimation, our
approach to PCRs is the first to consider strong norm distances on parameter
spaces of functions, such as Sobolev-like norms, as most of the approaches in
the classical (frequentist) and Bayesian literature deal with spaces of density
functions endowed with $\mathrm{L}^p$ norms or the Hellinger distance.]]></summary>

presence of selection bias. A current promising solution for the bias is the
inverse propensity score (IPS) estimation. However, the performance of existing
propensity-based methods can suffer significantly from the propensity
estimation bias. In fact, most of the previous IPS-based methods require some
amount of missing-completely-at-random (MCAR) data to accurately estimate the
propensity. This leads to a critical self-contradiction; IPS is ineffective
without MCAR data, even though it originally aims to learn recommenders from
only missing-not-at-random feedback. To resolve this propensity contradiction,
we derive a propensity-independent generalization error bound and propose a
novel algorithm to minimize the theoretical bound via adversarial learning. Our
theory and algorithm do not require a propensity estimation procedure, thereby
leading to a well-performing rating predictor without the true propensity
information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is
superior to a range of existing methods both in rating prediction and ranking

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite the success of reinforcement learning (RL) for Markov decision
processes (MDPs) with function approximation, most RL algorithms easily fail if
the agent only has partial observations of the state. Such a setting is often
modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). Existing
sample-efficient algorithms for POMDPs are restricted to the tabular setting
where the state and observation spaces are finite. In this paper, we make the
first attempt at tackling the tension between function approximation and
partial observability. In specific, we focus on a class of undercomplete POMDPs
with linear function approximations, which allows the state and observation
spaces to be infinite. For such POMDPs, we show that the optimal policy and
value function can be characterized by a sequence of finite-memory Bellman
operators. We propose an RL algorithm that constructs optimistic estimators of
these operators via reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) embedding.
Moreover, we theoretically prove that the proposed algorithm finds an
$\varepsilon$-optimal policy with $\tilde O (1/\varepsilon^2)$ episodes of
exploration. Also, this sample complexity only depends on the intrinsic
dimension of the POMDP polynomially and is independent of the size of the state
and observation spaces. To our best knowledge, we develop the first provably
sample-efficient algorithm for POMDPs with function approximation.]]></summary>

and jamming loss. We analyze the arms race of the game and derive an optimal
frequency hopping policy at each stage of the arms race based on the Markov
decision process (MDP). It is analytically shown that the arms race reaches an
equilibrium after a few rounds, and a frequency hopping policy and a jamming
strategy at the equilibrium are characterized. We propose two kinds of
collision avoidance protocols to ensure that at most one user communicates in
each frequency band, and provide various numerical results that show the
effects of the reward parameters and collision avoidance protocols on the
optimal frequency hopping policy and the expected rewards at the equilibrium.
Moreover, we discuss about equilibria for the case where the jammer adopts some

computationally and statistically. Convex approaches have been proven
statistically optimal but suffer from high computational costs, especially
since robust loss functions are usually non-smooth. More recently,
computationally fast non-convex approaches via sub-gradient descent are
proposed, which, unfortunately, fail to deliver a statistically consistent
estimator even under sub-Gaussian noise. In this paper, we introduce a novel
Riemannian sub-gradient (RsGrad) algorithm which is not only computationally
efficient with linear convergence but also is statistically optimal, be the
noise Gaussian or heavy-tailed. Convergence theory is established for a general
framework and specific applications to absolute loss, Huber loss, and quantile
loss are investigated. Compared with existing non-convex methods, ours reveals
a surprising phenomenon of dual-phase convergence. In phase one, RsGrad behaves
as in a typical non-smooth optimization that requires gradually decaying
stepsizes. However, phase one only delivers a statistically sub-optimal
estimator which is already observed in the existing literature. Interestingly,
during phase two, RsGrad converges linearly as if minimizing a smooth and
strongly convex objective function and thus a constant stepsize suffices.
Underlying the phase-two convergence is the smoothing effect of random noise to
the non-smooth robust losses in an area close but not too close to the truth.
Lastly, RsGrad is applicable for low-rank tensor estimation under heavy-tailed
noise where a statistically optimal rate is attainable with the same phenomenon
of dual-phase convergence, and a novel shrinkage-based second-order moment
method is guaranteed to deliver a warm initialization. Numerical simulations
confirm our theoretical discovery and showcase the superiority of RsGrad over
prior methods.]]></summary>

adapted to a downstream NLP task. However, theoretical analysis of these models
is scarce and challenging since the pretraining and downstream tasks can be
very different. We propose an analysis framework that links the pretraining and
downstream tasks with an underlying latent variable generative model of text --
the downstream classifier must recover a function of the posterior distribution
over the latent variables. We analyze head tuning (learning a classifier on top
of the frozen pretrained model) and prompt tuning in this setting. The
generative model in our analysis is either a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) or an
HMM augmented with a latent memory component, motivated by long-term
dependencies in natural language. We show that 1) under certain non-degeneracy
conditions on the HMM, simple classification heads can solve the downstream
task, 2) prompt tuning obtains downstream guarantees with weaker non-degeneracy
conditions, and 3) our recovery guarantees for the memory-augmented HMM are
stronger than for the vanilla HMM because task-relevant information is easier
to recover from the long-term memory. Experiments on synthetically generated

purposes. The carrier selection is done in a flexible manner with the support
of the context database located at the roadside unit (edge of wireless
communication infrastructure). However, as the database delivers only context
information to the platoons' leaders, the final decision is made separately by
the individual platoons, following the suggestions made by the artificial

Q-learning solution, that could be successfully implemented in each car for

Network (GNN), in which each node's representation is computed recursively by
aggregating representations (messages) from its immediate neighbors akin to a
star-shaped pattern. MPNNs are appealing for being efficient and scalable,
how-ever their expressiveness is upper-bounded by the 1st-order
Weisfeiler-Lehman isomorphism test (1-WL). In response, prior works propose
highly expressive models at the cost of scalability and sometimes
generalization performance. Our work stands between these two regimes: we
introduce a general framework to uplift any MPNN to be more expressive, with
limited scalability overhead and greatly improved practical performance. We
achieve this by extending local aggregation in MPNNs from star patterns to
general subgraph patterns (e.g.,k-egonets):in our framework, each node
representation is computed as the encoding of a surrounding induced subgraph
rather than encoding of immediate neighbors only (i.e. a star). We choose the
subgraph encoder to be a GNN (mainly MPNNs, considering scalability) to design
a general framework that serves as a wrapper to up-lift any GNN. We call our
proposed method GNN-AK(GNN As Kernel), as the framework resembles a
convolutional neural network by replacing the kernel with GNNs. Theoretically,
we show that our framework is strictly more powerful than 1&2-WL, and is not
less powerful than 3-WL. We also design subgraph sampling strategies which
greatly reduce memory footprint and improve speed while maintaining
performance. Our method sets new state-of-the-art performance by large margins
for several well-known graph ML tasks; specifically, 0.08 MAE on ZINC,74.79%
and 86.887% accuracy on CIFAR10 and PATTERN respectively.]]></summary>

transferring learned knowledge across different tasks. However, MTL must deal
with challenges such as: overfitting to low resource tasks, catastrophic
forgetting, and negative task transfer, or learning interference. Often, in
Natural Language Processing (NLP), a separate model per task is needed to
obtain the best performance. However, many fine-tuning approaches are both
parameter inefficient, i.e., potentially involving one new model per task, and
highly susceptible to losing knowledge acquired during pretraining. We propose
a novel Transformer architecture consisting of a new conditional attention
mechanism as well as a set of task-conditioned modules that facilitate weight
sharing. Through this construction (a hypernetwork adapter), we achieve more
efficient parameter sharing and mitigate forgetting by keeping half of the
weights of a pretrained model fixed. We also use a new multi-task data sampling
strategy to mitigate the negative effects of data imbalance across tasks. Using
this approach, we are able to surpass single task fine-tuning methods while
being parameter and data efficient (using around 66% of the data for weight
updates). Compared to other BERT Large methods on GLUE, our 8-task model
surpasses other Adapter methods by 2.8% and our 24-task model outperforms by
0.7-1.0% models that use MTL and single task fine-tuning. We show that a larger
variant of our single multi-task model approach performs competitively across
26 NLP tasks and yields state-of-the-art results on a number of test and
development sets. Our code is publicly available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Self-training algorithms, which train a model to fit pseudolabels predicted
by another previously-learned model, have been very successful for learning
with unlabeled data using neural networks. However, the current theoretical
understanding of self-training only applies to linear models. This work
provides a unified theoretical analysis of self-training with deep networks for
semi-supervised learning, unsupervised domain adaptation, and unsupervised
learning. At the core of our analysis is a simple but realistic "expansion"
assumption, which states that a low probability subset of the data must expand
to a neighborhood with large probability relative to the subset. We also assume
that neighborhoods of examples in different classes have minimal overlap. We
prove that under these assumptions, the minimizers of population objectives
based on self-training and input-consistency regularization will achieve high
accuracy with respect to ground-truth labels. By using off-the-shelf
generalization bounds, we immediately convert this result to sample complexity
guarantees for neural nets that are polynomial in the margin and Lipschitzness.
Our results help explain the empirical successes of recently proposed
self-training algorithms which use input consistency regularization.]]></summary>

models of time-series having stationary increments. A complex wavelet transform
computes signal variations at each scale. Dependencies across scales are
captured by the joint covariance across time and scales of complex wavelet
coefficients and their modulus. This covariance is nearly diagonalized by a
second wavelet transform, which defines the scattering covariance. We show that
this set of moments characterizes a wide range of non-Gaussian properties of
multi-scale processes. This is analyzed for a variety of processes, including
fractional Brownian motions, Poisson, multifractal random walks and Hawkes
processes. We prove that self-similar processes have a scattering covariance
matrix which is scale invariant. This property can be estimated numerically and
defines a class of wide-sense self-similar processes. We build maximum entropy
models conditioned by scattering covariance coefficients, and generate new
time-series with a microcanonical sampling algorithm. Applications are shown
for highly non-Gaussian financial and turbulence time-series.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two types of states are widely used in quantum mechanics, namely
(deterministic-coefficient) pure states and statistical mixtures. A density
operator can be associated with each of them. We here address a third type of
states, that we previously introduced in a more restricted framework. These
states generalize pure ones by replacing each of their deterministic ket
coefficients by a random variable. We therefore call them Random-Coefficient
Pure States, or RCPS. We analyze their properties and their relationships with
both types of usual states. We show that RCPS contain much richer information
than the density operator and mean of observables that we associate with them.
This occurs because the latter operator only exploits the second-order
statistics of the random state coefficients, whereas their higher-order
statistics contain additional information. That information can be accessed in
practice with the multiple-preparation procedure that we propose for RCPS, by
using second-order and higher-order statistics of associated random
probabilities of measurement outcomes. Exploiting these higher-order statistics
opens the way to a very general approach for performing advanced quantum
information processing tasks. We illustrate the relevance of this approach with
a generic example, dealing with the estimation of parameters of a quantum
process and thus related to quantum process tomography. This parameter
estimation is performed in the non-blind (i.e. supervised) or blind (i.e.
unsupervised) mode. We show that this problem cannot be solved by using only
the density operator \rho of an RCPS and the associated mean value Tr(\rho A)
of the operator A that corresponds to the considered physical quantity. We
succeed in solving this problem by exploiting a fourth-order statistical
parameter of state coefficients, in addition to second-order statistics.
Numerical tests validate this result.]]></summary>

connecting devices to the Internet, are prone to performance issues due to the
scarcity of space in the radio spectrum. As a response, IEEE 802.11ax and
subsequent amendments aim at increasing the spatial reuse of a radio channel by
allowing the dynamic update of two key parameters in wireless transmission: the
transmission power (TX_POWER) and the sensitivity threshold (OBSS_PD). In this
paper, we present INSPIRE, a distributed solution performing local Bayesian
optimizations based on Gaussian processes to improve the spatial reuse in
WLANs. INSPIRE makes no explicit assumptions about the topology of WLANs and
favors altruistic behaviors of the access points, leading them to find adequate
configurations of their TX_POWER and OBSS_PD parameters for the "greater good"
of the WLANs. We demonstrate the superiority of INSPIRE over other
state-of-the-art strategies using the ns-3 simulator and two examples inspired
by real-life deployments of dense WLANs. Our results show that, in only a few
seconds, INSPIRE is able to drastically increase the quality of service of
operational WLANs by improving their fairness and throughput.]]></summary>

applications. This is partly due to the transparency associated with the

namely: k-nearest neighbors algorithm, decision tree, random forest, multilayer
perceptron, and XGBoost. The results show that the accuracy rates of these
machine learning models on our proposed dataset are between 93.24% and 96.71%.
We also analyze the proposed features and their relationships from the

learning models, requiring an estimate of the kernel covariance matrix for
every prediction. In large and complex domains, such as graphs, sets, or
images, the choice of suitable kernel can also be non-trivial to determine,
providing an additional obstacle to the learning task. Over the last decade,
these challenges have resulted in significant advances being made in terms of
scalability and expressivity, exemplified by, e.g., the use of inducing points
and neural network kernel approximations. In this paper, we propose inducing
Gaussian process networks (IGN), a simple framework for simultaneously learning
the feature space as well as the inducing points. The inducing points, in
particular, are learned directly in the feature space, enabling a seamless
representation of complex structured domains while also facilitating scalable
gradient-based learning methods. We consider both regression and (binary)
classification tasks and report on experimental results for real-world data
sets showing that IGNs provide significant advances over state-of-the-art
methods. We also demonstrate how IGNs can be used to effectively model complex

presence of selection bias. A current promising solution for the bias is the
inverse propensity score (IPS) estimation. However, the performance of existing
propensity-based methods can suffer significantly from the propensity
estimation bias. In fact, most of the previous IPS-based methods require some
amount of missing-completely-at-random (MCAR) data to accurately estimate the
propensity. This leads to a critical self-contradiction; IPS is ineffective
without MCAR data, even though it originally aims to learn recommenders from
only missing-not-at-random feedback. To resolve this propensity contradiction,
we derive a propensity-independent generalization error bound and propose a
novel algorithm to minimize the theoretical bound via adversarial learning. Our
theory and algorithm do not require a propensity estimation procedure, thereby
leading to a well-performing rating predictor without the true propensity
information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is
superior to a range of existing methods both in rating prediction and ranking

costly Bayesian inference. In this paper, we propose a simple yet very
efficient majorization-minimization algorithm for maximum a posteriori

analytics only when necessary. Moreover, our work is complementary to existing
work that focuses on improving hardware and software efficiency. We evaluate
our approach on a city-scale parking dataset having 76 streets spread across
the city. Our analysis demonstrates how streets have various parking patterns,
highlighting the importance of an adaptive policy. Our approach can learn such
an adaptive policy that can reduce the average energy consumption by 76.38% and
achieve an average accuracy of more than 98% in performing video analytics.]]></summary>

limited success in systematic generalization. The situation is especially
frustrating in the case of algorithmic tasks, where they often fail to find
intuitive solutions that route relevant information to the right node/operation

the learning of useful control flow, we propose two modifications to the
Transformer architecture, copy gate and geometric attention. Our novel Neural
Data Router (NDR) achieves 100% length generalization accuracy on the classic
compositional table lookup task, as well as near-perfect accuracy on the simple

adversarial examples, which aim to mislead DNNs by adding perturbations with
small magnitude. To defend against such attacks, both empirical and theoretical
defense approaches have been extensively studied for a single ML model. In this
work, we aim to analyze and provide the certified robustness for ensemble ML
models, together with the sufficient and necessary conditions of robustness for
different ensemble protocols. Although ensemble models are shown more robust
than a single model empirically; surprisingly, we find that in terms of the
certified robustness the standard ensemble models only achieve marginal
improvement compared to a single model. Thus, to explore the conditions that
guarantee to provide certifiably robust ensemble ML models, we first prove that
diversified gradient and large confidence margin are sufficient and necessary
conditions for certifiably robust ensemble models under the model-smoothness
assumption. We then provide the bounded model-smoothness analysis based on the
proposed Ensemble-before-Smoothing strategy. We also prove that an ensemble
model can always achieve higher certified robustness than a single base model
under mild conditions. Inspired by the theoretical findings, we propose the
lightweight Diversity Regularized Training (DRT) to train certifiably robust
ensemble ML models. Extensive experiments show that our DRT enhanced ensembles
can consistently achieve higher certified robustness than existing single and
ensemble ML models, demonstrating the state-of-the-art certified L2-robustness

also provide a motivating argument for convergence to the true hypergradient,

for each model parameter. Our method performs competitively from varied random

(HDR) and high-speed conditions remains an open challenge for image-based
algorithms due to severe image degradations. Event cameras promise to address
these challenges since they feature a much higher dynamic range and are
resilient to motion blur. Nonetheless, semantic segmentation with event cameras
is still in its infancy which is chiefly due to the novelty of the sensor, and
the lack of high-quality, labeled datasets. In this work, we introduce ESS,
which tackles this problem by directly transferring the semantic segmentation
task from existing labeled image datasets to unlabeled events via unsupervised
domain adaptation (UDA). Compared to existing UDA methods, our approach aligns
recurrent, motion-invariant event embeddings with image embeddings. For this
reason, our method neither requires video data nor per-pixel alignment between
images and events and, crucially, does not need to hallucinate motion from
still images. Additionally, to spur further research in event-based semantic
segmentation, we introduce DSEC-Semantic, the first large-scale event-based
dataset with fine-grained labels. We show that using image labels alone, ESS
outperforms existing UDA approaches, and when combined with event labels, it
even outperforms state-of-the-art supervised approaches on both DDD17 and
DSEC-Semantic. Finally, ESS is general-purpose, which unlocks the vast amount
of existing labeled image datasets and paves the way for new and exciting
research directions in new fields previously inaccessible for event cameras.]]></summary>

examples include the implementation of additional security measures when an
intrusion is detected, or activating a cooling mechanism when temperature
thresholds are surpassed. Tactic volatility occurs in real-world systems and is
defined as variable behavior in the attributes of a tactic, such as its latency
or cost. A system's inability to effectively account for tactic volatility
adversely impacts its efficiency and resiliency against the dynamics of
real-world environments. To enable systems' efficiency against tactic
volatility, we propose a Tactic Volatility Aware (TVA-E) process utilizing
evolved Recurrent Neural Networks (eRNN) to provide accurate tactic
predictions. TVA-E is also the first known process to take advantage of
uncertainty reduction tactics to provide additional information to the
decision-making process and reduce uncertainty. TVA-E easily integrates into
popular adaptation processes enabling it to immediately benefit a large number
of existing self-adaptive systems. Simulations using 52,106 tactic records
demonstrate that: I) eRNN is an effective prediction mechanism, II) TVA-E
represents an improvement over existing state-of-the-art processes in
accounting for tactic volatility, and III) Uncertainty reduction tactics are
beneficial in accounting for tactic volatility. The developed dataset and tool

conducting a second iteration of the CTS challenge since August 2020. The
current iteration of the CTS Challenge is a leaderboard-style speaker
recognition evaluation using telephony data extracted from the unexposed
portions of the Call My Net 2 (CMN2) and Multi-Language Speech (MLS) corpora
collected by the LDC. The CTS Challenge is currently organized in a similar
manner to the SRE19 CTS Challenge, offering only an open training condition
using two evaluation subsets, namely Progress and Test. Unlike in the SRE19
Challenge, no training or development set was initially released, and NIST has
publicly released the leaderboards on both subsets for the CTS Challenge. Which
subset (i.e., Progress or Test) a trial belongs to is unknown to challenge
participants, and each system submission needs to contain outputs for all of
the trials. The CTS Challenge has also served, and will continue to do so, as a
prerequisite for entrance to the regular SREs (such as SRE21). Since August
2020, a total of 53 organizations (forming 33 teams) from academia and industry
have participated in the CTS Challenge and submitted more than 4400 valid
system outputs. This paper presents an overview of the evaluation and several
analyses of system performance for some primary conditions in the CTS
Challenge. The CTS Challenge results thus far indicate remarkable improvements
in performance due to 1) speaker embeddings extracted using large-scale and
complex neural network architectures such as ResNets along with angular margin
losses for speaker embedding extraction, 2) extensive data augmentation, 3) the
use of large amounts of in-house proprietary data from a large number of
labeled speakers, 4) long-duration fine-tuning.]]></summary>

learning. Despite their rapid development, GNNs also faces some challenges,
such as over-fitting, over-smoothing, and non-robustness. Previous works
indicate that these problems can be alleviated by random dropping methods,
which integrate noises into models by randomly masking parts of the input.
However, some open-ended problems of random dropping on GNNs remain to solve.
First, it is challenging to find a universal method that are suitable for all
cases considering the divergence of different datasets and models. Second,
random noises introduced to GNNs cause the incomplete coverage of parameters
and unstable training process. In this paper, we propose a novel random
dropping method called DropMessage, which performs dropping operations directly
on the message matrix and can be applied to any message-passing GNNs.
Furthermore, we elaborate the superiority of DropMessage: it stabilizes the
training process by reducing sample variance; it keeps information diversity
from the perspective of information theory, which makes it a theoretical upper
bound of other methods. Also, we unify existing random dropping methods into
our framework and analyze their effects on GNNs. To evaluate our proposed
method, we conduct experiments that aims for multiple tasks on five public
datasets and two industrial datasets with various backbone models. The
experimental results show that DropMessage has both advantages of effectiveness
and generalization.]]></summary>

spatial dependency among discrete points sampled irregularly from unstructured
grids, thanks to the great expressiveness of graph neural networks. However,
these models are usually spatially-transductive -- only fitting the signals for
discrete spatial nodes fed in models but unable to generalize to `unseen'
spatial points with zero-shot. In comparison, for forecasting tasks on
continuous space such as temperature prediction on the earth's surface, the
\textit{spatially-inductive} property allows the model to generalize to any
point in the spatial domain, demonstrating models' ability to learn the
underlying mechanisms or physics laws of the systems, rather than simply fit
the signals. Besides, in temporal domains, \textit{irregularly-sampled} time
series, e.g. data with missing values, urge models to be temporally-continuous.
Motivated by the two issues, we propose a spatio-temporal framework based on
neural operators for PDEs, which learn the underlying mechanisms governing the
dynamics of spatially-continuous physical quantities. Experiments show our
model's improved performance on forecasting spatially-continuous physic
quantities, and its superior generalization to unseen spatial points and
ability to handle temporally-irregular data.]]></summary>

data is critically important in fields such as climate science, healthcare, and
economics. Recent work focuses on designing neural-network architectures and
regularization functions to allow for scalable estimation of average and
individual-level dose response curves from high-dimensional, large-sample data.
Such methodologies assume ignorability (all confounding variables are observed)
and positivity (all levels of treatment can be observed for every unit
described by a given covariate value), which are especially challenged in the
continuous treatment regime. Developing scalable sensitivity and uncertainty
analyses that allow us to understand the ignorance induced in our estimates
when these assumptions are relaxed receives less attention. Here, we develop a
continuous treatment-effect marginal sensitivity model (CMSM) and derive bounds
that agree with both the observed data and a researcher-defined level of hidden
confounding. We introduce a scalable algorithm to derive the bounds and
uncertainty-aware deep models to efficiently estimate these bounds for
high-dimensional, large-sample observational data. We validate our methods
using both synthetic and real-world experiments. For the latter, we work in
concert with climate scientists interested in evaluating the climatological
impacts of human emissions on cloud properties using satellite observations
from the past 15 years: a finite-data problem known to be complicated by the
presence of a multitude of unobserved confounders.]]></summary>

over-parameterization, which smooths the optimization landscape without
degrading the generalization ability. Despite the benefits of
over-parameterization, a huge amount of parameters makes deep networks
cumbersome in daily life applications. Though techniques such as pruning and
distillation are developed, they are expensive in fully training a dense
network as backward selection methods, and there is still a void on
systematically exploring forward selection methods for learning structural
sparsity in deep networks. To fill in this gap, this paper proposes a new
approach based on differential inclusions of inverse scale spaces, which
generate a family of models from simple to complex ones along the dynamics via
coupling a pair of parameters, such that over-parameterized deep models and
their structural sparsity can be explored simultaneously. This kind of
differential inclusion scheme has a simple discretization, dubbed Deep
structure splitting Linearized Bregman Iteration (DessiLBI), whose global
convergence in learning deep networks could be established under the
Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz framework. Experimental evidence shows that our method
achieves comparable and even better performance than the competitive optimizers
in exploring the sparse structure of several widely used backbones on the
benchmark datasets. Remarkably, with early stopping, our method unveils
`winning tickets' in early epochs: the effective sparse network structures with
comparable test accuracy to fully trained over-parameterized models, that are
further transferable to similar alternative tasks. Furthermore, our method is
able to grow networks efficiently with adaptive filter configurations,
demonstrating a good performance with much less computational cost. Codes and

requirements of Quantum Machine Learning (QML). Recent work has established
guarantees for in-distribution generalization of quantum neural networks
(QNNs), where training and testing data are assumed to be drawn from the same
data distribution. However, there are currently no results on
out-of-distribution generalization in QML, where we require a trained model to
perform well even on data drawn from a distribution different from the training
distribution. In this work, we prove out-of-distribution generalization for the
task of learning an unknown unitary using a QNN and for a broad class of
training and testing distributions. In particular, we show that one can learn
the action of a unitary on entangled states using only product state training
data. We numerically illustrate this by showing that the evolution of a
Heisenberg spin chain can be learned using only product training states. Since
product states can be prepared using only single-qubit gates, this advances the
prospects of learning quantum dynamics using near term quantum computers and
quantum experiments, and further opens up new methods for both the classical

second wavelet transform, which defines the scattering covariance. We show that
this set of moments characterizes a wide range of non-Gaussian properties of

ever-evolving high-profile network attacks, including DDoS, botnet, and
ransomware, due to their unique ability to extract complex patterns hidden in
data streams. These approaches are however routinely validated with data
collected in the same environment, and their performance degrades when deployed
in different network topologies and/or applied on previously unseen traffic, as
we uncover. This suggests malicious/benign behaviors are largely learned
superficially and ML-based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) need
revisiting, to be effective in practice. In this paper we dive into the
mechanics of large-scale network attacks, with a view to understanding how to
use ML for Network Intrusion Detection (NID) in a principled way. We reveal
that, although cyberattacks vary significantly in terms of payloads, vectors
and targets, their early stages, which are critical to successful attack
outcomes, share many similarities and exhibit important temporal correlations.
Therefore, we treat NID as a time-sensitive task and propose NetSentry, perhaps
the first of its kind NIDS that builds on Bidirectional Asymmetric LSTM
(Bi-ALSTM), an original ensemble of sequential neural models, to detect network
threats before they spread. We cross-evaluate NetSentry using two practical
datasets, training on one and testing on the other, and demonstrate F1 score
gains above 33% over the state-of-the-art, as well as up to 3 times higher
rates of detecting attacks such as XSS and web bruteforce. Further, we put
forward a novel data augmentation technique that boosts the generalization
abilities of a broad range of supervised deep learning algorithms, leading to
average F1 score gains above 35%.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a common type of Graph Neural
Network (GNN), in which each node's representation is computed recursively by
aggregating representations (messages) from its immediate neighbors akin to a
star-shaped pattern. MPNNs are appealing for being efficient and scalable,
how-ever their expressiveness is upper-bounded by the 1st-order
Weisfeiler-Lehman isomorphism test (1-WL). In response, prior works propose
highly expressive models at the cost of scalability and sometimes
generalization performance. Our work stands between these two regimes: we
introduce a general framework to uplift any MPNN to be more expressive, with
limited scalability overhead and greatly improved practical performance. We
achieve this by extending local aggregation in MPNNs from star patterns to
general subgraph patterns (e.g.,k-egonets):in our framework, each node
representation is computed as the encoding of a surrounding induced subgraph
rather than encoding of immediate neighbors only (i.e. a star). We choose the
subgraph encoder to be a GNN (mainly MPNNs, considering scalability) to design
a general framework that serves as a wrapper to up-lift any GNN. We call our
proposed method GNN-AK(GNN As Kernel), as the framework resembles a
convolutional neural network by replacing the kernel with GNNs. Theoretically,
we show that our framework is strictly more powerful than 1&2-WL, and is not
less powerful than 3-WL. We also design subgraph sampling strategies which
greatly reduce memory footprint and improve speed while maintaining
performance. Our method sets new state-of-the-art performance by large margins
for several well-known graph ML tasks; specifically, 0.08 MAE on ZINC,74.79%
and 86.887% accuracy on CIFAR10 and PATTERN respectively.]]></summary>

tackle catastrophic forgetting. However, the noisy label, which is inevitable
in a real-world scenario, seems to exacerbate the situation. While very few
studies have addressed the issue of continual learning under noisy labels, long
training time and complicated training schemes limit their applications in most
cases. In contrast, we propose a simple purification technique to effectively
cleanse the online data stream that is both cost-effective and more accurate.
After purification, we perform fine-tuning in a semi-supervised fashion that
ensures the participation of all available samples. Training in this fashion
helps us learn a better representation that results in state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance. Through extensive experimentation on 3 benchmark datasets, MNIST,
CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, we show the effectiveness of our proposed approach. We
achieve a 24.8% performance gain for CIFAR10 with 20% noise over previous SOTA
methods. Our code is publicly available.]]></summary>

various malicious scenarios, such as phishing, fraud, blackmail and
malvertisement. Traditional anti-spam gateway commonly requires to maintain a
greylist to filter out unexpected emails based on suspicious vocabularies

cannot effectively discover novel and unknown suspicious emails that utilize
various hot topics at present, such as COVID-19 and US election. To address the
problem, in this paper, we present Holmes, an efficient and lightweight
semantic based engine for anomalous email detection. Holmes can convert each
event log of email to a sentence through word embedding then extract
interesting items among them by novelty detection. Based on our observations,
we claim that, in an enterprise environment, there is a stable relation between
senders and receivers, but suspicious emails are commonly from unusual sources,
which can be detected through the rareness selection. We evaluate the
performance of Holmes in a real-world enterprise environment, in which it sends
and receives around 5,000 emails each day. As a result, Holmes can achieve a
high detection rate (output around 200 suspicious emails per day) and maintain
a low false alarm rate for anomaly detection.]]></summary>

by another previously-learned model, have been very successful for learning
with unlabeled data using neural networks. However, the current theoretical
understanding of self-training only applies to linear models. This work
provides a unified theoretical analysis of self-training with deep networks for
semi-supervised learning, unsupervised domain adaptation, and unsupervised
learning. At the core of our analysis is a simple but realistic "expansion"
assumption, which states that a low probability subset of the data must expand
to a neighborhood with large probability relative to the subset. We also assume
that neighborhoods of examples in different classes have minimal overlap. We
prove that under these assumptions, the minimizers of population objectives
based on self-training and input-consistency regularization will achieve high
accuracy with respect to ground-truth labels. By using off-the-shelf
generalization bounds, we immediately convert this result to sample complexity
guarantees for neural nets that are polynomial in the margin and Lipschitzness.
Our results help explain the empirical successes of recently proposed
self-training algorithms which use input consistency regularization.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Safe deployment of deep learning systems in critical real world applications
requires models to make very few mistakes, and only under predictable
circumstances. In this work, we address this problem using an abstaining
classifier that is tuned to have $>$95% accuracy, and then identify the
determinants of abstention using LIME. Essentially, we are training our model
to learn the attributes of pathology reports that are likely to lead to
incorrect classifications, albeit at the cost of reduced sensitivity. We
demonstrate an abstaining classifier in a multitask setting for classifying
cancer pathology reports from the NCI SEER cancer registries on six tasks of
interest. For these tasks, we reduce the classification error rate by factors
of 2--5 by abstaining on 25--45% of the reports. For the specific task of
classifying cancer site, we are able to identify metastasis, reports involving
lymph nodes, and discussion of multiple cancer sites as responsible for many of
the classification mistakes, and observe that the extent and types of mistakes
vary systematically with cancer site (e.g., breast, lung, and prostate). When
combining across three of the tasks, our model classifies 50% of the reports
with an accuracy greater than 95% for three of the six tasks\edit, and greater
than 85% for all six tasks on the retained samples. Furthermore, we show that
LIME provides a better determinant of classification than measures of word
occurrence alone. By combining a deep abstaining classifier with feature
identification using LIME, we are able to identify concepts responsible for
both correctness and abstention when classifying cancer sites from pathology
reports. The improvement of LIME over keyword searches is statistically
significant, presumably because words are assessed in context and have been
identified as a local determinant of classification.]]></summary>

improve recommendation performance. However, most of existing SSL methods use a
uniform data augmentation scheme, which loses the sequence correlation of an
original sequence. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Learnable Model
Augmentation self-supervised learning for sequential Recommendation (LMA4Rec).
Specifically, LMA4Rec first takes model augmentation as a supplementary method
for data augmentation to generate views. Then, LMA4Rec uses learnable Bernoulli
dropout to implement model augmentation learnable operations. Next,
self-supervised learning is used between the contrastive views to extract
self-supervised signals from an original sequence. Finally, experiments on
three public datasets show that the LMA4Rec method effectively improves

wide applications in AR/VR and autonomous driving. These applications require
low latency and high accuracy to provide real-time user experience and ensure
user safety. Unlike conventional dense workloads, the sparse and irregular
nature of point clouds poses severe challenges to running sparse CNNs
efficiently on the general-purpose hardware. Furthermore, existing sparse
acceleration techniques for 2D images do not translate to 3D point clouds. In
this paper, we introduce TorchSparse, a high-performance point cloud inference
engine that accelerates the sparse convolution computation on GPUs. TorchSparse
directly optimizes the two bottlenecks of sparse convolution: irregular
computation and data movement. It applies adaptive matrix multiplication
grouping to trade computation for better regularity, achieving 1.4-1.5x speedup
for matrix multiplication. It also optimizes the data movement by adopting
vectorized, quantized and fused locality-aware memory access, reducing the
memory movement cost by 2.7x. Evaluated on seven representative models across
three benchmark datasets, TorchSparse achieves 1.6x and 1.5x measured

Second, we feed ego-motion information to the model via cross-attention. We

over-parameterization, which smooths the optimization landscape without
degrading the generalization ability. Despite the benefits of
over-parameterization, a huge amount of parameters makes deep networks
cumbersome in daily life applications. Though techniques such as pruning and
distillation are developed, they are expensive in fully training a dense
network as backward selection methods, and there is still a void on
systematically exploring forward selection methods for learning structural
sparsity in deep networks. To fill in this gap, this paper proposes a new
approach based on differential inclusions of inverse scale spaces, which
generate a family of models from simple to complex ones along the dynamics via
coupling a pair of parameters, such that over-parameterized deep models and
their structural sparsity can be explored simultaneously. This kind of
differential inclusion scheme has a simple discretization, dubbed Deep
structure splitting Linearized Bregman Iteration (DessiLBI), whose global
convergence in learning deep networks could be established under the
Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz framework. Experimental evidence shows that our method
achieves comparable and even better performance than the competitive optimizers
in exploring the sparse structure of several widely used backbones on the
benchmark datasets. Remarkably, with early stopping, our method unveils
`winning tickets' in early epochs: the effective sparse network structures with
comparable test accuracy to fully trained over-parameterized models, that are
further transferable to similar alternative tasks. Furthermore, our method is
able to grow networks efficiently with adaptive filter configurations,
demonstrating a good performance with much less computational cost. Codes and

etc., are powered by hardware with a constrained specification (low memory,
clock speed and processor) which is insufficient to accommodate and execute
large, high-quality models. On such resource-constrained devices, manufacturers
still manage to provide attractive functionalities (to boost sales) by
following the traditional approach of programming IoT devices/products to
collect and transmit data (image, audio, sensor readings, etc.) to their
cloud-based ML analytics platforms. For decades, this online approach has been
facing issues such as compromised data streams, non-real-time analytics due to
latency, bandwidth constraints, costly subscriptions, recent privacy issues
raised by users and the GDPR guidelines, etc. In this paper, to enable
ultra-fast and accurate AI-based offline analytics on resource-constrained IoT
devices, we present an end-to-end multi-component model optimization sequence
and open-source its implementation. Researchers and developers can use our
optimization sequence to optimize high memory, computation demanding models in
multiple aspects in order to produce small size, low latency, low-power
consuming models that can comfortably fit and execute on resource-constrained
hardware. The experimental results show that our optimization components can
produce models that are; (i) 12.06 x times compressed; (ii) 0.13% to 0.27% more
accurate; (iii) Orders of magnitude faster unit inference at 0.06 ms. Our
optimization sequence is generic and can be applied to any state-of-the-art
models trained for anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, robotics, voice
recognition, and machine vision.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Motivated by the growing importance of reducing unfairness in ML predictions,
Fair-ML researchers have presented an extensive suite of algorithmic
"fairness-enhancing" remedies. Most existing algorithms, however, are agnostic
to the sources of the observed unfairness. As a result, the literature
currently lacks guiding frameworks to specify conditions under which each
algorithmic intervention can potentially alleviate the underpinning cause of
unfairness. To close this gap, we scrutinize the underlying biases (e.g., in
the training data or design choices) that cause observational unfairness. We
present a bias-injection sandbox tool to investigate fairness consequences of
various biases and assess the effectiveness of algorithmic remedies in the
presence of specific types of bias. We call this process the
bias(stress)-testing of algorithmic interventions. Unlike existing toolkits,
ours provides a controlled environment to counterfactually inject biases in the
ML pipeline. This stylized setup offers the distinct capability of testing
fairness interventions beyond observational data and against an unbiased
benchmark. In particular, we can test whether a given remedy can alleviate the
injected bias by comparing the predictions resulting after the intervention in
the biased setting with true labels in the unbiased regime -- that is, before
any bias injection. We illustrate the utility of our toolkit via a
proof-of-concept case study on synthetic data. Our empirical analysis showcases
the type of insights that can be obtained through our simulations.]]></summary>

assurance, and while humans can easily detect anomalies in components given a
few examples, designing a generic automated system that can perform at human or
above human capabilities remains a challenge. In this work, we present a simple
new anomaly detection algorithm called FADS (feature-based anomaly detection
system) which leverages pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNN) to
generate a statistical model of nominal inputs by observing the activation of
the convolutional filters. During inference the system compares the
convolutional filter activation of the new input to the statistical model and
flags activations that are outside the expected range of values and therefore
likely an anomaly. By using a pretrained network, FADS demonstrates excellent
performance similar to or better than other machine learning approaches to
anomaly detection while at the same time FADS requires no tuning of the CNN
weights. We demonstrate FADS ability by detecting process parameter changes on
a custom dataset of additively manufactured lattices. The FADS localization
algorithm shows that textural differences that are visible on the surface can
be used to detect process parameter changes. In addition, we test FADS on
benchmark datasets, such as the MVTec Anomaly Detection dataset, and report
good results.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Predicting incoming failures and scheduling maintenance based on sensors
information in industrial machines is increasingly important to avoid downtime
and machine failure. Different machine learning formulations can be used to
solve the predictive maintenance problem. However, many of the approaches
studied in the literature are not directly applicable to real-life scenarios.
Indeed, many of those approaches usually either rely on labelled machine
malfunctions in the case of classification and fault detection, or rely on
finding a monotonic health indicator on which a prediction can be made in the
case of regression and remaining useful life estimation, which is not always
feasible. Moreover, the decision-making part of the problem is not always
studied in conjunction with the prediction phase. This paper aims to design and
compare different formulations for predictive maintenance in a two-level
framework and design metrics that quantify both the failure detection
performance as well as the timing of the maintenance decision. The first level
is responsible for building a health indicator by aggregating features using a
learning algorithm. The second level consists of a decision-making system that
can trigger an alarm based on this health indicator. Three degrees of
refinements are compared in the first level of the framework, from simple
threshold-based univariate predictive technique to supervised learning methods
based on the remaining time before failure. We choose to use the Support Vector
Machine (SVM) and its variations as the common algorithm used in all the
formulations. We apply and compare the different strategies on a real-world
rotating machine case study and observe that while a simple model can already
perform well, more sophisticated refinements enhance the predictions for
well-chosen parameters.]]></summary>

role in route planning and preventing congestion on highways. These methods
utilize data collected from traffic recording stations at different timestamps
to predict the future status of traffic. Hence, data collection, transmission,
storage, and extraction techniques can have a significant impact on the
performance of the traffic flow model. On the other hand, a comprehensive
database can provide the opportunity for using complex, yet reliable predictive
models such as deep learning methods. However, most of these methods have
difficulties in handling missing values and outliers. This study focuses on
hybrid deep neural networks to predict traffic flow in the California Freeway
Performance Measurement System (PeMS) with missing values. The proposed
networks are based on a combination of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to
consider the temporal dependencies in the data recorded in each station and
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to take the spatial correlations in the
adjacent stations into account. Various architecture configurations with series
and parallel connections are considered based on RNNs and CNNs, and several
prevalent data imputation techniques are used to examine the robustness of the
hybrid networks to missing values. A comprehensive analysis performed on two
different datasets from PeMS indicates that the proposed series-parallel hybrid
network with the mean imputation technique achieves the lowest error in
predicting the traffic flow and is robust to missing values up until 21%
missing ratio in both complete and incomplete training data scenarios when
applied to an incomplete test data.]]></summary>

most frequent risk factor for thrombosis and acute coronary syndrome.
Intravascular optical coherence tomography (IVOCT) can identify TCFA and assess
cap thickness, which provides an opportunity to assess plaque vulnerability. We
developed an automated method that can detect lipidous plaque and assess
fibrous cap thickness in IVOCT images. This study analyzed a total of 4,360
IVOCT image frames of 77 lesions among 41 patients. To improve segmentation
performance, preprocessing included lumen segmentation, pixel-shifting, and
noise filtering on the raw polar (r, theta) IVOCT images. We used the
DeepLab-v3 plus deep learning model to classify lipidous plaque pixels. After
lipid detection, we automatically detected the outer border of the fibrous cap
using a special dynamic programming algorithm and assessed the cap thickness.
Our method provided excellent discriminability of lipid plaque with a
sensitivity of 85.8% and A-line Dice coefficient of 0.837. By comparing lipid
angle measurements between two analysts following editing of our automated
software, we found good agreement by Bland-Altman analysis (difference 6.7+/-17
degree; mean 196 degree). Our method accurately detected the fibrous cap from
the detected lipid plaque. Automated analysis required a significant
modification for only 5.5% frames. Furthermore, our method showed a good
agreement of fibrous cap thickness between two analysts with Bland-Altman
analysis (4.2+/-14.6 micron; mean 175 micron), indicating little bias between
users and good reproducibility of the measurement. We developed a fully
automated method for fibrous cap quantification in IVOCT images, resulting in
good agreement with determinations by analysts. The method has great potential
to enable highly automated, repeatable, and comprehensive evaluations of TCFAs.]]></summary>

conducting a second iteration of the CTS challenge since August 2020. The
current iteration of the CTS Challenge is a leaderboard-style speaker
recognition evaluation using telephony data extracted from the unexposed
portions of the Call My Net 2 (CMN2) and Multi-Language Speech (MLS) corpora
collected by the LDC. The CTS Challenge is currently organized in a similar
manner to the SRE19 CTS Challenge, offering only an open training condition
using two evaluation subsets, namely Progress and Test. Unlike in the SRE19
Challenge, no training or development set was initially released, and NIST has
publicly released the leaderboards on both subsets for the CTS Challenge. Which
subset (i.e., Progress or Test) a trial belongs to is unknown to challenge
participants, and each system submission needs to contain outputs for all of
the trials. The CTS Challenge has also served, and will continue to do so, as a
prerequisite for entrance to the regular SREs (such as SRE21). Since August
2020, a total of 53 organizations (forming 33 teams) from academia and industry
have participated in the CTS Challenge and submitted more than 4400 valid
system outputs. This paper presents an overview of the evaluation and several
analyses of system performance for some primary conditions in the CTS
Challenge. The CTS Challenge results thus far indicate remarkable improvements
in performance due to 1) speaker embeddings extracted using large-scale and
complex neural network architectures such as ResNets along with angular margin
losses for speaker embedding extraction, 2) extensive data augmentation, 3) the
use of large amounts of in-house proprietary data from a large number of
labeled speakers, 4) long-duration fine-tuning.]]></summary>

have frequently been shown to outperform their non-distributional counterparts
on many challenging control tasks. Examples of this behavior include the D4PG
and DMPO algorithms as compared to DDPG and MPO, respectively [Barth-Maron et
al., 2018; Hoffman et al., 2020]. However, both agents rely on the C51 critic
for value estimation.One major drawback of the C51 approach is its requirement
of prior knowledge about the minimum andmaximum values a policy can attain as
well as the number of bins used, which fixes the resolution ofthe
distributional estimate. While the DeepMind control suite of tasks utilizes
standardized rewards and episode lengths, thus enabling the entire suite to be
solved with a single setting of these hyperparameters, this is often not the
case. This paper revisits a natural alternative that removes this requirement,
namelya mixture of Gaussians, and a simple sample-based loss function to train
it in an off-policy regime. We empirically evaluate its performance on a broad
range of continuous control tasks and demonstrate that it eliminates the need
for these distributional hyperparameters and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on a variety of challenging tasks (e.g. the humanoid, dog,
quadruped, and manipulator domains). Finallywe provide an implementation in the
Acme agent repository.]]></summary>

security-critical areas like autonomous driving raises the need for their
systematic testing. Coverage-guided testing (CGT) is an approach that applies
mutation or fuzzing according to a predefined coverage metric to find inputs
that cause misbehavior. With the introduction of a neuron coverage metric, CGT
has also recently been applied to DNNs. In this work, we apply CGT to the task
of person detection in crowded scenes. The proposed pipeline uses YOLOv3 for
person detection and includes finding DNN bugs via sampling and mutation, and
subsequent DNN retraining on the updated training set. To be a bug, we require
a mutated image to cause a significant performance drop compared to a clean
input. In accordance with the CGT, we also consider an additional requirement
of increased coverage in the bug definition. In order to explore several types
of robustness, our approach includes natural image transformations,
corruptions, and adversarial examples generated with the Daedalus attack. The
proposed framework has uncovered several thousand cases of incorrect DNN
behavior. The relative change in mAP performance of the retrained models
reached on average between 26.21\% and 64.24\% for different robustness types.
However, we have found no evidence that the investigated coverage metrics can
be advantageously used to improve robustness.]]></summary>

the neighborhood of a victim node tends to have two competing group forces,
pushing the node classification results towards the original label and the
targeted label, respectively. Based on this observation, we propose to detect

from complex backgrounds in computer vision, machine learning, and medical
imaging, e.g., extracting moving contrast-filled vessels from the complex and
noisy backgrounds of X-ray coronary angiography (XCA). However, the challenges
caused by dynamic backgrounds, overlapping heterogeneous environments and
complex noises still exist in video decomposition. To solve these problems,
this study is the first to introduce a flexible visual working memory model in
video decomposition tasks to provide interpretable and high-performance
hierarchical deep architecture, integrating the transformative representations
between sensory and control layers from the perspective of visual and cognitive
neuroscience. Specifically, robust PCA unrolling networks acting as a
structure-regularized sensor layer decompose XCA into sparse/low-rank
structured representations to separate moving contrast-filled vessels from
noisy and complex backgrounds. Then, patch recurrent convolutional LSTM
networks with a backprojection module embody unstructured random
representations of the control layer in working memory, recurrently projecting
spatiotemporally decomposed nonlocal patches into orthogonal subspaces for
heterogeneous vessel retrieval and interference suppression. This video
decomposition deep architecture effectively restores the heterogeneous profiles
of intensity and the geometries of moving objects against the complex
background interferences. Experiments show that the proposed method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accurate moving
contrast-filled vessel extraction with excellent flexibility and computational
efficiency.]]></summary>

aspect in judging their suitability for specific tasks, and thus, ultimately,
for generating trust in the models. We show that the widely used concept of
adversarial robustness and closely related metrics based on counterfactuals are
not necessarily valid metrics for determining the robustness of ML models
against perturbations that occur "naturally", outside specific adversarial
attack scenarios. Additionally, we argue that generic robustness metrics in
principle are insufficient for determining real-world-robustness. Instead we
propose a flexible approach that models possible perturbations in input data
individually for each application. This is then combined with a probabilistic
approach that computes the likelihood that a real-world perturbation will
change a prediction, thus giving quantitative information of the robustness of
the trained machine learning model. The method does not require access to the
internals of the classifier and thus in principle works for any black-box
model. It is, however, based on Monte-Carlo sampling and thus only suited for
input spaces with small dimensions. We illustrate our approach on two dataset,
as well as on analytically solvable cases. Finally, we discuss ideas on how
real-world robustness could be computed or estimated in high-dimensional input

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Outlier detection is an important topic in machine learning and has been used
in a wide range of applications. Outliers are objects that are few in number
and deviate from the majority of objects. As a result of these two properties,
we show that outliers are susceptible to a mechanism called fluctuation. This
article proposes a method called fluctuation-based outlier detection (FBOD)
that achieves a low linear time complexity and detects outliers purely based on
the concept of fluctuation without employing any distance, density or isolation
measure. Fundamentally different from all existing methods. FBOD first converts
the Euclidean structure datasets into graphs by using random links, then
propagates the feature value according to the connection of the graph. Finally,
by comparing the difference between the fluctuation of an object and its
neighbors, FBOD determines the object with a larger difference as an outlier.
The results of experiments comparing FBOD with seven state-of-the-art
algorithms on eight real-world tabular datasets and three video datasets show
that FBOD outperforms its competitors in the majority of cases and that FBOD
has only 5% of the execution time of the fastest algorithm. The experiment

cognizing brain activities. Being fed massive electroencephalogram (EEG) data,
the time-frequency spectrograms are conventionally projected into the
episode-wise feature matrices (seen as tier-1). A spiking neural network (SNN)
based tier is designed to distill the principle information in terms of
spike-streams from the rare features, which maintains the temporal implication
in the nature of EEGs. The proposed tier-3 transposes time- and space-domain of
spike patterns from the SNN; and feeds the transposed pattern-matrices into an
artificial neural network (ANN, Transformer specifically) known as tier-4,
where a special spanning topology is proposed to match the two-dimensional
input form. In this manner, cognition such as classification is conducted with
high accuracy. For proof-of-concept, the sleep stage scoring problem is
demonstrated by introducing multiple EEG datasets with the largest comprising
42,560 hours recorded from 5,793 subjects. From experiment results, our
platform achieves the general cognition overall accuracy of 87% by leveraging
sole EEG, which is 2% superior to the state-of-the-art. Moreover, our developed
multi-tier methodology offers visible and graphical interpretations of the
temporal characteristics of EEG by identifying the critical episodes, which is

Two key features of our models are the use of both pre- and post-gap data, and
the exploitation of a correlated time series (the external temperature) in
order to predict the target one (the internal temperature). Our approach
manages to capture the fluctuating nature of the data and shows good accuracy

databases. Recently the concept of learned index has been explored actively to
replace or supplement traditional index structures with machine learning models

query processing in high-dimensional metric spaces remains to be an open
challenge. In this paper, a novel indexing approach called LIMS is proposed to
use data clustering and pivot-based data transformation techniques to build
learned indexes for efficient similarity query processing in metric spaces. The
underlying data is partitioned into clusters such that each cluster follows a
relatively uniform data distribution. Data redistribution is achieved by
utilizing a small number of pivots for each cluster. Similar data are mapped
into compact regions and the mapped values are totally ordinal. Machine
learning models are developed to approximate the position of each data record
on the disk. Efficient algorithms are designed for processing range queries and
nearest neighbor queries based on LIMS, and for index maintenance with dynamic
updates. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate
the superiority of LIMS compared with traditional indexes and state-of-the-art

learning models, requiring an estimate of the kernel covariance matrix for
every prediction. In large and complex domains, such as graphs, sets, or
images, the choice of suitable kernel can also be non-trivial to determine,
providing an additional obstacle to the learning task. Over the last decade,
these challenges have resulted in significant advances being made in terms of
scalability and expressivity, exemplified by, e.g., the use of inducing points
and neural network kernel approximations. In this paper, we propose inducing
Gaussian process networks (IGN), a simple framework for simultaneously learning
the feature space as well as the inducing points. The inducing points, in
particular, are learned directly in the feature space, enabling a seamless
representation of complex structured domains while also facilitating scalable
gradient-based learning methods. We consider both regression and (binary)

i.e. address single tasks. The core idea of transfer learning (TL) is that
knowledge gained in learning to perform one task (source) can be leveraged to
improve learning performance in a related, but different, task (target). TL
leverages and transfers previously acquired knowledge to address the expense of
data acquisition and labeling, potential computational power limitations, and
the dataset distribution mismatches. Although significant progress has been

and uncertainty quantification in partial differential equations. In this work,
we propose a novel TL framework for task-specific learning under conditional
shift with a deep operator network (DeepONet). Inspired by the conditional
embedding operator theory, we measure the statistical distance between the
source domain and the target feature domain by embedding conditional
distributions onto a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Task-specific operator
learning is accomplished by fine-tuning task-specific layers of the target
DeepONet using a hybrid loss function that allows for the matching of
individual target samples while also preserving the global properties of the
conditional distribution of target data. We demonstrate the advantages of our
approach for various TL scenarios involving nonlinear PDEs under conditional
shift. Our results include geometry domain adaptation and show that the
proposed TL framework enables fast and efficient multi-task operator learning,
despite significant differences between the source and target domains.]]></summary>

over the years. However, despite their promising performance on various graph
analytical tasks, most of these algorithms lack fairness considerations. As a
consequence, they could lead to discrimination towards certain populations when
exploited in human-centered applications. Recently, algorithmic fairness has
been extensively studied in graph-based applications. In contrast to
algorithmic fairness on independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data,
fairness in graph mining has exclusive backgrounds, taxonomies, and fulfilling
techniques. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and up-to-date
introduction of existing literature under the context of fair graph mining.
Specifically, we propose a novel taxonomy of fairness notions on graphs, which
sheds light on their connections and differences. We further present an
organized summary of existing techniques that promote fairness in graph mining.
Finally, we summarize the widely used datasets in this emerging research field
and provide insights on current research challenges and open questions, aiming
at encouraging cross-breeding ideas and further advances.]]></summary>

best possible model; however, research in machine learning often prioritizes
the latter. The development of marginal feature importance methods, such as
marginal contribution feature importance, attempts to break this trend by

interpretable fashion. In this work, we generalize the framework of marginal
contribution feature importance to improve performance with regards to
detecting correlated interactions and reducing runtime. To do so, we consider
"information subsets" of the set of features $F$ and show that our importance
metric can be computed directly after applying fair representation learning
methods from the AI fairness literature. The methods of optimal transport and
linear regression are considered and explored experimentally for removing all
the information of our feature of interest $f$ from the feature set $F$. Given
these implementations, we show on real and simulated data that ultra marginal

importance, with substantially faster computation time and better performance
in the presence of correlated interactions and unrelated features.]]></summary>

networks (DNNs) are able to solve tasks in an ever-expanding landscape of
scenarios, but our eagerness to apply these powerful models leads us to focus
on their performance and deprioritises our ability to understand them. Current
research in the field of explainable AI tries to bridge this gap by developing
various perturbation or gradient-based explanation techniques. For images,
these techniques fail to fully capture and convey the semantic information
needed to elucidate why the model makes the predictions it does. In this work,
we develop a new form of explanation that is radically different in nature from
current explanation methods, such as Grad-CAM. Perception visualization
provides a visual representation of what the DNN perceives in the input image
by depicting what visual patterns the latent representation corresponds to.
Visualizations are obtained through a reconstruction model that inverts the
encoded features, such that the parameters and predictions of the original
models are not modified. Results of our user study demonstrate that humans can
better understand and predict the system's decisions when perception
visualizations are available, thus easing the debugging and deployment of deep

between medical features and learn better patient health representations.
Existing methods try to estimate feature correlations only from data, or
increase the quality of estimation by introducing task-specific medical
knowledge. However, such methods either are difficult to estimate the feature
correlations due to insufficient training samples, or cannot be generalized to
other tasks due to reliance on specific knowledge. There are medical research
revealing that not all the medical features are strongly correlated. Thus, to
address the issues, we expect to group up strongly correlated features and
learn feature correlations in a group-wise manner to reduce the learning
complexity without losing generality. In this paper, we propose a general
patient health representation learning framework MedFACT. We estimate
correlations via measuring similarity between temporal patterns of medical
features with kernel methods, and cluster features with strong correlations
into groups. The feature group is further formulated as a correlation graph,
and we employ graph convolutional networks to conduct group-wise feature
interactions for better representation learning. Experiments on two real-world
datasets demonstrate the superiority of MedFACT. The discovered medical
findings are also confirmed by literature, providing valuable medical insights

processes (MDPs) with function approximation, most RL algorithms easily fail if
the agent only has partial observations of the state. Such a setting is often
modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). Existing
sample-efficient algorithms for POMDPs are restricted to the tabular setting
where the state and observation spaces are finite. In this paper, we make the
first attempt at tackling the tension between function approximation and
partial observability. In specific, we focus on a class of undercomplete POMDPs
with linear function approximations, which allows the state and observation
spaces to be infinite. For such POMDPs, we show that the optimal policy and
value function can be characterized by a sequence of finite-memory Bellman
operators. We propose an RL algorithm that constructs optimistic estimators of
these operators via reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) embedding.
Moreover, we theoretically prove that the proposed algorithm finds an
$\varepsilon$-optimal policy with $\tilde O (1/\varepsilon^2)$ episodes of
exploration. Also, this sample complexity only depends on the intrinsic
dimension of the POMDP polynomially and is independent of the size of the state

heterogeneity across devices are two of the main bottlenecks for federated
learning (FL). To tackle these challenges, we first devise a novel FL framework
with partial model aggregation (PMA), which only aggregates the lower layers of
neural networks responsible for feature extraction while the upper layers
corresponding to complex pattern recognition remain at devices for
personalization. The proposed PMA-FL is able to address the data heterogeneity
and reduce the transmitted information in wireless channels. We then obtain a
convergence bound of the framework under a non-convex loss function setting.
With the aid of this bound, we define a new objective function, named the
scheduled data sample volume, to transfer the original inexplicit optimization
problem into a tractable one for device scheduling, bandwidth allocation,
computation and communication time division. Our analysis reveals that the
optimal time division is achieved when the communication and computation parts
of PMA-FL have the same power. We also develop a bisection method to solve the
optimal bandwidth allocation policy and use the set expansion algorithm to
address the optimal device scheduling. Compared with the state-of-the-art
benchmarks, the proposed PMA-FL improves 2.72% and 11.6% accuracy on two
typical heterogeneous datasets, i.e., MINIST and CIFAR-10, respectively. In
addition, the proposed joint dynamic device scheduling and resource
optimization approach achieve slightly higher accuracy than the considered
benchmarks, but they provide a satisfactory energy and time reduction: 29%
energy or 20% time reduction on the MNIST; and 25% energy or 12.5% time

purposes. In fact, the content marketing industry is set to be worth $412.88
billion by the end of 2021. However, according to the Content Marketing
Institute, creating engaging content is the #1 challenge that marketers face
today. We under-stand that producing great content requires great writers who
understand the business and can weave their message into reader (and search
engine) friendly content. In this project, the team has attempted to bridge the
gap between writers and projects by using AI and ML tools. We used NLP
techniques to analyze thou-sands of publicly available business articles
(corpora) to extract various defining factors for each writing sample. Through
this project we aim to automate the highly time-consuming, and often biased
task of manually shortlisting the most suitable writer for a given content
writing requirement. We believe that a tool like this will have far reaching
positive implications for both parties - businesses looking for suitable talent
for niche writing jobs as well as experienced writers and Subject Matter
Experts (SMEs) wanting to lend their services to content marketing projects.
The business gets the content they need, the content writer/ SME gets a chance
to leverage his or her talent, while the reader gets authentic content that
adds real value.]]></summary>

survive the environment. Many features they developed can be inspirational and
beneficial for solving technical problems in modern industries. This leads to a
novel form of design-by-analogy called bio-inspired design (BID). Although BID
as a design method has been proven beneficial, the gap between biology and
engineering continuously hinders designers from effectively applying the
method. Therefore, we explore the recent advance of artificial intelligence
(AI) for a computational approach to bridge the gap. This paper proposes a
generative design approach based on the pre-trained language model (PLM) to
automatically retrieve and map biological analogy and generate BID in the form
of natural language. The latest generative pre-trained transformer, namely
GPT-3, is used as the base PLM. Three types of design concept generators are
identified and fine-tuned from the PLM according to the looseness of the
problem space representation. Machine evaluators are also fine-tuned to assess
the correlation between the domains within the generated BID concepts. The
approach is then tested via a case study in which the fine-tuned models are
applied to generate and evaluate light-weighted flying car concepts inspired by
nature. The results show our approach can generate BID concepts with good
performance.]]></summary>

factorization. We consider the family of mean-parametrized Bernoulli models, a
class of generative models that are well suited for modeling binary data and
enables interpretability of the factors. We factorize the Bernoulli parameter
and consider an additional Beta prior on one of the factors to further improve
the model's expressive power. While similar models have been proposed in the
literature, they only exploit the Beta prior as a proxy to ensure a valid
Bernoulli parameter in a Bayesian setting; in practice it reduces to a uniform
or uninformative prior. Besides, estimation in these models has focused on
costly Bayesian inference. In this paper, we propose a simple yet very
efficient majorization-minimization algorithm for maximum a posteriori
estimation. Our approach leverages the Beta prior whose parameters can be tuned
to improve performance in matrix completion tasks. Experiments conducted on
three public binary datasets show that our approach offers an excellent
trade-off between prediction performance, computational complexity, and
interpretability.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Super-resolution suffers from an innate ill-posed problem that a single
low-resolution (LR) image can be from multiple high-resolution (HR) images.
Recent studies on the flow-based algorithm solve this ill-posedness by learning
the super-resolution space and predicting diverse HR outputs. Unfortunately,
the diversity of the super-resolution outputs is still unsatisfactory, and the
outputs from the flow-based model usually suffer from undesired artifacts which
causes low-quality outputs. In this paper, we propose FS-NCSR which produces
diverse and high-quality super-resolution outputs using frequency separation
and noise conditioning compared to the existing flow-based approaches. As the
sharpness and high-quality detail of the image rely on its high-frequency
information, FS-NCSR only estimates the high-frequency information of the
high-resolution outputs without redundant low-frequency components. Through
this, FS-NCSR significantly improves the diversity score without significant
image quality degradation compared to the NCSR, the winner of the previous
NTIRE 2021 challenge.]]></summary>

 I'm thinking of training it with "the angle of the sun at that time", "temp", "humidity", and "ac/heater/fan state"(3) and then extracting data pairs spaced by 5 minutes where the system was in that state for the entire interval. Then I'm thinking I should use the 5-minute-later apparent temp as the training output.
 So the NN ultimately answers the question "what would be the apparent temperature if the system were to be in the given state for the next 5 minutes?"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 this is my first post please go easy on me.
 I'm currently playing around with a bigger Model in tf-agents. I worked only with structured data (TF, SKlearn, Pandas...). Now I'm struggling a bit with the preprocessing and where in the architecture to place it. I use multiple Inputs and encoding layers for each of them. For the training of the Encoders I used some SKLearn pre-processor (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, KBinsDiscretizer). I try to reuse the pre-processing pipeline in the model or extract the information for other pre-processing mechanisms(e.g. pre-processing tf layers)
 My current options I came up with:
  
Incorporate it directly into the Environment and return the pre-processed observation 
 Pro easy, can probably use my SKlearn pipeline 
 Contra I'd like to keep the architecture clean, so the environment should only give out raw values and not prepared values for a certain model
 
 Use an environment wrapper around the "raw" environment 
 Pro "raw" environment needs no tuning
 Contra not sure if I can use my pipeline here and not sure if I'm taking a bad path here 
 
 Use pre-processing TF layers 
 Pro most of the API is there and can be used in my Encodernetworks, seems to be the TFic way
 Contra the SKlearn pre-processor have values for each column. The layers (e.g. rescale ) seems to only take one configuration for a whole tensor. I could probably create a layer for each value in the Tensor but that doesn't feel that it is supposed to be like that.
 
  
If you have more options or can share your experience one of the options mentioned above I would be very glad.

Object detection is a long-standing computer vision task that attempts to recognize and localize all objects of interest in an image. The complexity arises when trying to identify or localize all object instances while also avoiding duplication. Existing approaches, like Faster R-CNN and DETR, are carefully designed and highly customized in the choice of architecture and loss function. This specialization of existing systems has created two major barriers: (1) it adds complexity in tuning and training the different parts of the system (e.g., region proposal network, graph matching with GIOU loss, etc.), and (2), it can reduce the ability of a model to generalize, necessitating a redesign of the model for…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When comes to evaluating and selecting a model, should one focus on minimizing loss (i.e., sparse categorical crossentropy) or obtain high rated metrics (i.e., f1)?
 Often time the model highest rated metrics would generate higher loss than ones with lower ratings in metrics during validation/test sets.
 Some would say focus on metrics as loss are for the machine to optimize learning, what stays in the training, stays in the training. However, wouldn't loss be also an important element to consider since it also describe the performance of the model, particularly when obtained from the test set?
 How should one prioritize? Metrics/loss rules all or seek for balance?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking for any papers that do the following: use neural networks in the RL pipeline as the state space is too large for calculating the optimal policy using the traditional tabular value iteration or policy iteration. In this setting, the model is completely known, i.e., no learning.
 Most papers I see with DeepRL assume that the transition probabilities are unknown and that they have access to a simulator that gives them the ability to query data points. I am looking for existing work in DeepRL where the transition probabilities are known but the problem is intractable using tabular methods. Any direction would be appreciated, thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, im making a new post as i couldnt find any answers to this before (although this reddit post is similar to my issue)
 I am trying to implement a simple multivariate Gaussian policy without neural networks, basically using a standard policy gradient update with SGD + score function gradient, without batches. The reason for this is to avoid unstable updates, meaning too large updates in mean/variance. The idea is thus to use a trust region update, to keep the updates within some reasonable size.
 I am a little confused regarding the maximization of the surrogate objective. As seen in this stackoverflow post, we wish to maximize [pi/pi_old] , compared to [log(pi)] in vanilla PG.
 Since i do not use automatic differentiation, but one single stochastic descent, how do I find the gradient of pi/pi_old ?
 To my understanding, the flow of the algorithm is this:
 sample experience -> compute new policy parameters -> compare with previous policy -> construct surrogate function -> perform SGD on surrogate to get the actual new policy
 It is the last step i am struggling with.

 Is there any work that explores how to optimize the clustering in 1) to achieve the best performance in the downstream task 2)?
 One example would be a differentiable clustering algorithm that receives gradients from the downstream task or a parametrized clustering algorithm whose parameters are automatically tuned to increase the performance of the downstream task.
 I have found very little on this topic in the literature, could you point me to some relevant work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am classifying social media posts (facebook, instagram), with emojis being upwards of 100% of content. For example, you may want to tag "🤮🤮🤮" as in need for moderation, and "🤔🤔🤔" as prioritized for a response.
 Looking for a good model to fine tune I found BerTweet, which seems at least somewhat emoji aware. However it also has a ton of out-of-vocabulary results, both for emoji and semi-common English words, despite it's liberal use of emoji.demojize and splitting up more complex emoji:
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/t6ai3o8le1v81.png?width=687&format=png&auto=webp&s=c16157addbe1b3d34858708f3e6c7517e64d26ec
 A model like `xlm-roberta-base with a larger vocabulary (250k) and more robust tokenization seems to have some 500 emoji directly in its vocabulary directly, without converting them to text. This seems potentially more promising, but also guarantees a token like 🤮 is just out of vocabulary rather than being interpreted by word pieces.
 Has anyone here had experience with dealing with emoji in text classification, and what approaches were most successful?

 For example, in the case of an inverted pendulum or cartpole, I train the model for the pole to be at 0 degrees (vertical) and it works. Then I want this same model to keep the pole at another position, for example, 3 degrees, do I have to train this model again for achieving this to or can I somehow use the model I already trained and what it learnt and input the new position I want it to be?
 idk if I explained myself
 I guess its mostly doubts about how to interact with the model and how to properly use a model that has already been trained. If anyone has some example of code (python, gym), on interacting with a trained model it would be really helpful.

 https://preview.redd.it/7olwqyze5yu81.png?width=2041&format=png&auto=webp&s=25aecb9733366720a2be5cecc2048eb2a734c9b9
 Here are some key features:
  
It helps to estimate the runtime of algorithms on a different GPU.
 It measures GPU processing speed independent of GPU memory capacity.
 It contains adjustable weightings through interactive UIs.
  
The project page also explains how this benchmark differs from existing ones, and why this benchmark is more relevant to academic research.
 I would love to know what you think!

Given that I run all experiment on gpu dedicated servers, my laptop serves me as a typewriter, it's ok, but I'd like to get more out of it. Frankly I'm a bit disappointed by 2021 Macbooks, hope they'll be improved in 2022.
 Recently lambda labs together with razer announced their tensorbook https://lambdalabs.com/deep-learning/laptops/tensorbook , their pricing looks weird to me, the more you pay the more years of support you have, that's the only thing which differentiates base bundle from enterprise. Also there is no option to customize hardware for it, though basic bundle itself looks ok, its price is $3500 like M1 Max's. What's your opinion about this laptop in particular? would you buy it?
 generally this laptop looks like a cool thing to have for local model development even from a tent somewhere in Nepal, given that you have enough power banks to charge it. :)
 What's your choice of a laptop for DL? My biggest requirement is a durable laptop which will serve at least 5 years, better with NVIDA GPU for development and debugging.

The AI would generate the content after being given a prompt. There are already a few tools trying this, but the quality doesn't seem to be very high.
 Are there better tools that I'm missing, or is the consumer-facing software so early-stage that it would be better to hire a data scientist and train an AI system specifically for this purpose?

As consumer electronics and internet-connected appliances are becoming more common, homes are beginning to embrace various types of connected devices that offer functionality like music control, voice assistance, and home automation. A graceful integration of devices requires adaptation to existing aesthetics and user styles rather than simply adding screens, which can easily disrupt a visual space, especially when they become monolithic surfaces or black screens when powered down or not actively used. Thus there is an increasing desire to create connected ambient computing devices and appliances that can preserve the aesthetics of everyday materials, while providing …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep neural network (DNN) models for object recognition and classification, such as Yolo, ResNet, and EfficientNet, are used in video analytics applications such as urban mobility and smart automobiles. There is a symbiotic link between edge computing and video analytics, claiming that live video analytics is the “killer app” for edge computing. Edge devices come in various sizes and designs, but they are always resource-constrained compared to the cloud. Video analytics deployments send the videos to on-premises edge servers. The article handles the difficulty of supporting inference and retraining jobs on edge servers simultaneously, which necessitates navigating the fundamental tradeoff between the accuracy of the retrained model and the accuracy of the inference. Edge computation is preferred for video analytics because it eliminates the need for expensive network lines to broadcast videos to the cloud while simultaneously preserving video privacy. Edge computation has a finite amount of resources (e.g., with weak GPUs). The mismatch between the increasing rate of model compute needs, and the total cycles of processors exacerbate this problem. As a result, model compression is used in edge deployments.

I know it's been proven that the set of optimal policies for a classic MDP is nonempty, and intuitively I feel like the same should hold for POMDPs, but I'm having a hard time finding a particular source proving such a thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the first edition of the textbook, the section on actor-critic methods (link) describes the classical approach of using the temporal difference error 𝛿 to modify the probability of selecting action a in state s:

 Then they briefly mention that one variation on the classical approach is to scale temporal difference error 𝛿 by the inverse of the probability of selecting the action a, where that probability is given by 𝜋(s, a):

 They say: " These issues were explored early on, primarily for the immediate reward case (Sutton, 1984; Williams, 1992) and have not been brought fully up to date."
 This idea is relevant to a project I'm working on, and I'd like to read more about it. But the references seem to be dead ends: Sutton 1984 is his PhD thesis, which I can't find a digital copy of, and Williams 1992 is this paper, which doesn't seem to contain this idea. Also this section doesn't seem to appear in the second edition of the textbook.
 You folks are much smarter than I am: Does modifying the update in this way mean anything to you? Are there modern approaches that do something like this? Or should I assume it was a little-explored idea in the early days that has been more-or-less forgotten?
 Thanks very much!

I've seen this post How to deal with the time delay in reinforcement learning? - Artificial Intelligence Stack Exchange however it's rather brief and I wondered if there were any more recent advancements.
 I am also struggling to understand partial trajectory resampling ( 2010.02966.pdf (arxiv.org) ) and the code in the accompanying repo. GitHub - rmst/rlrd: PyTorch implementation of our paper Reinforcement Learning with Random Delays (ICLR 2020) 
 I was wondering how we can resample actions in environments with constant delays if those actions are used in the state space for all subsequent chosen actions?

 This seems like a problem of imbalanced data. For classification, I can oversample minority classes. What is the equivalent for regression? Is there an equivalent technique for regression where we oversample "outliers" and undersample central values.

 I have been studying super-resolution with gans and took a look at SRGAN et ESRGAN. 
 I have spent the whole day running experiments in order to find if I can manage to overfit on a single batch of 16 / 32 / 128 examples (MNIST). 
 I have found out that it's almost impossible to use this tactic as a sanity check because it simply cannot generate good quality samples. 
 I would like to know what are your thoughts on this, and how you would run sanity checks regarding GANs.

 I have csv-files (~300) with a fixed set of columns (~40) but varying number of rows (sum of all rows ~300 000) and multiple labels per csv that I want to predict.
 Because of the limited number of csv-files and as a first try I am predicting the labels row-wise (attaching the label to all the rows of one csv-file) which works well for some labels but not for others.
 Currently, I am calculating some features for every row and just appending them to the row and some features for the whole csv-file and appending them to every row.
 Two problems are now arising that I would like to hear some input about:
  
The number of features per csv is growing and it seems like a waste to copy them to every row.
 For some labels it is probably reasonable to throw away most of the rows and only feed in a handful.
  
How would you design a structure that incorporates the limited number of csv-files and the different ways to treat features (row vs. csv)?

 I want to understand how different is the publication process for conferences? I also wanted recommendations on conferences in the NLP and Speech area, considering this will be my first conference paper.

 How do you guys find recent papers in your area of interest which are promising besides following what is published at major conferences?
 I believe the website is "too lightweight". For example, what if I am interested in computer vision papers and I specify that in the tags field (i.e. explicitly typing "computer vision"). How can I list the papers based on a score (basically goodness of the paper)?
 Why does using shortcuts (basically links) like `````recommend over last week or recommend over last 3 days always (at least for me) end up with 0 results? I've never used the original arxiv-sanity before so I strongly believe that there is something that I am missing.

 The goal is to introduce these ideas in a single place, without having to parse many papers, try to get a working code sample, and then spend time debugging. With the accompanying codelabs, we hope that our readers can make their models 4-20x smaller, faster, and better in quality.

 This video is an interview with Barret Zoph and William Fedus of Google Brain about Sparse Expert Models.
 Sparse Expert models have been hugely successful at distributing parts of models, mostly Transformers, across large array of machines and use a routing function to effectively route signals between them. This means that even though these models have a huge number of parameters, the computational load for a given signal does not increase because the model is only sparsely activated. Sparse expert models, such as Switch Transformers and GLAM can scale up to trillions of parameters and bring a number of desirable properties. We discuss everything from the fundamentals, history, strengths and weaknesses, up to the current state of the art of these models.

 OUTLINE:
 0:00 - Intro
 0:30 - What are sparse expert models?
 4:25 - Start of Interview
 5:55 - What do you mean by sparse experts?
 8:10 - How does routing work in these models?
 12:10 - What is the history of sparse experts?
 14:45 - What does an individual expert learn?
 19:25 - When are these models appropriate?
 22:30 - How comparable are sparse to dense models?

 1. Research Background
 High dynamic range images (HDR) are mainly oriented to picture display technology. In a certain scene, if the range of high and low luminance areas exceeds the maximum luminance range of the image, the display effect will be greatly reduced, and HDR is to better solve this problem, it can record a broader range of luminance images, so as to obtain a more effective display effect.
 The current solution to the problem of generating high dynamic range images (HDR) focuses on the fusion of two low dynamic range (LDR) images of different exposures taken with the same camera. In such a solution by the camera shake or object movement during the exposure time to produce the proble…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am having trouble finding some general information on this subject. I know I am down the rabbit hole when google doesn't have an answer.
 I want to know best practices and information on using clusters for machine learning with large amounts of data. I believe I have a close to an optimal solution but wanted to get some other opinions on the subject.
 My current setup:
  
AWS EKS Kubernetes for a cluster
 Kubeflow for ML platform
 Katib for HPT jobs
 Pytorch for custom models
 Spot instance GPUs
 Lustre for file serving to the models
  
My Data:
  
Millions of Images stored in S3
 ~50TB of data
  
What is the most efficient way to move my data to the cluster?
 My current approach:
  
Preprocess the data with a dedicated instance and store it in S3
 Master runs on a dedicated node
 Katib spins up a set number of GPU spot nodes
 A claim is made, and an FSx Lustre system is generated for the pod
 Advantages: Very fast training and data movement with spot training
 Disadvantages: I have to spin up several Lustre systems for the training
 Preprocess the data with a dedicated instance and store it in S3
  
Possible alternative
  
Same as above but use EFS as a distributed file system so I don't have to wait for Lustre
 Advantages: Potentially cheaper as I have only one FS
 Disadvantages: Slow throughput, read this was a bad idea
 Master runs on a dedicated node
  
Other alternatives
  
UseKatib spins up a PyTorch streaming function with S3(boosted transfer speed)set number of GPU spot nodes
 Every pod starts a claim is made and downloads data to an EBS
 Give up and switch to SageMakerFSx Lustre system is generated for the pod
  
Anyone with experience in these technologies I would really appreciate hearing your thoughts.

 model = Sequential() model.add(Dense(10000, input_dim=212207, kernel_initializer='normal', activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(100, activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(1, kernel_initializer='normal')) model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam') for i in range(10000000): #X is input with 212207 values #Y is a output value if i<6000000: model.fit(X.transpose(), Y, epochs=30, batch_size=1, verbose=0) else: prediction=model.predict(X.transpose()) 
 I made sure that I am training on different examples and trying predictions on different examples. I am still getting the same prediction value for all testing inputs. I think I made some mistake in defining the model for regression neural network. Can you please check if the code is correct?

Form-based document understanding is a growing research topic because of its practical potential for automatically converting unstructured text data into structured information to gain insight about a document’s contents. Recent sequence modeling, which is a self-attention mechanism that directly models relationships between all words in a selection of text, has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on natural language tasks. A natural approach to handle form document understanding tasks is to first serialize the form documents (usually in a left-to-right, top-to-bottom fashion) and then apply state-of-the-art sequence models to them.  
 However, form documents often have more complex layouts …]]></summary>

 I'm keeping an eye on state of the art in quantum hardware, but what about software? I can think of many questions and maybe some of you are in the field.
  
What should be the impact of quantum on ML/DL, realistically?
 What might be a roadmap for the software? And would quantum simulators do already have some benefits on AI?
 What are the best projects out there? I've seen many but haven't been very convinced

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I've recently started working on a task allocation problem using RL. I'd just like to make sure my thinking is correct on how to best approach the problem. 
 At the moment, we have (effectively) a graph traversal sim for n number of agents, where the goal is to minimize the total distance over an episode, as determined by setting the correct tasks. The task supplied to each agent will determine the route that is taken, and therefore the distance. 
 The current idea is to supply an input graph that also contains information on the current location of the agents. A second input would be the set of available tasks. The expected output would be done through a pointer network, where we produce a reordered set of the tasks in descending order of optimality. 
 When step is called, the sim runs until a new task is needed (agent completes it's route). 
 ​
 In general, does anyone know a good way to represent the inputs and output of this problem? A pointer network seems like it could work to produce actions, but if I need to do a forward pass for every agent, it seems that there would be no consideration of other agents when determining tasks (We shouldn't have 2 agents doing the same task). For the graph representation, a graph nn seems like an obvious choice, but I just wanted to see if anyone had any insight on why they may or may not be used.

I'm starting a freelancing marketplace, tailored only for AI talents, and I especially care about the welfares of freelancers, and plan to add these: (1) you will be more treated as the employees of the platform, thus we provide training(for all), potentially health care plan(for people have stably worked >20 hours a week), and career advance plan, mentors from experienced freelancers where you get to learn (2) open discussion between employers and you so that you can scope the project better, set a reasonable rate, and timeline (3) we potentially provide MLOPs tool to improve your productivity. (4) we avoid global competition by matching business only with local region-freelancer or areas that are more expensive. How attractive do you think this will be?

 Really excited to share a project we've been working on and get your feedback!
 We've made:
 Programmatic — an NLP annotation tool for building large labeled datasets for NLP without manual annotation
 Programmatic is like a REPL for data annotation. You:
 1. Write simple rules/functions that can approximately label the data 2. Get near-instant feedback across your entire corpus 3. Iterate and improve your rules 
 Finally, it uses a Bayesian label model [1] to convert these noisy annotations into a single, large, clean dataset, which you can then use for training machine learning models. You can programmatically label millions of datapoints in the time taken to hand-label hundreds.
 What we do differently from weak supervision packages like Snorkel/skweak[1] is to focus on UI to …]]></summary>

 However, it gets me to think. Several years ago I'm a moderator in a quite large forum, because I don't have enough time to fulfill my responsibilities, then I decided to retire (yes, they can, and I remained as the vip user which only retired moderators can be).
 This is a large community, a machine learning community. Besides continuously removing some of these posts, and no clear rules on it, can we do any better? We got all the data, and we just cannot train the model?
 Here are my three proposal, and please give some excellent ideas besides my poor ones:
  
Self promoting post should have values other than itself, and not having annoying contents
 Self promoting project can be used as a tool in a non self promoting posts, as long as the posts creates valuable contents and the promoting is not obvious and annoying.
 Depends on the number of new project posts, Weekly/Daily project post can be created by moderator and pinned to the top. All the promoting content goes into the comment. We can explore and upvotes.
  
Here are some illustrations:
 1. Direct Promoting Post
 ​
 2. Indirect Promoting Post
 ​
 Weekly/Daily Promoting Post by Moderator, Pinned to Top, Comments by project owner, upvotes/downvotes by us
 Which do you think is acceptable? Or you have better ideas? Leave a comment.
 It's a machine learning sub, don't make machine to solve it better than us.

 https://github.com/remifan/commplax
 I have a research article as a use case demo, https://remifan.github.io/gdbp_study/article.html
 This tool essentially
  
implements adaptive DSP equalizers as stateful NN layers (thanks to Jax's explicit stateful syntax)
 implements compositor interfaces from scratch to wrap up those stateful layers with other regular NN layers so that they can be trained together
  
Homebrew serial compositions of stateful layers
 It is a fun project for me and I feel JAX really elegantly fits this research use.
 What do you think about JAX? I appreciate your comments:)

 The framework is built on Django+React. It is easy to deploy to Heroku or other cloud services. Recently, I made it possible to deploy it to Hugging Face Spaces (faster and larger machines than on free tier Heroku). 
 The process of deployment is simple. You need to create a Gradio app on Spaces (my framework is not supported, yet ;) ). You need to add the app.py file that will run the Mercury server and upload the notebook. You can check the details in the docs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A demonstration of the RvS policy we learn with just supervised learning and a depth-two MLP. It uses no TD learning, advantage reweighting, or Transformers!


Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is conventionally approached using value-based methods based on temporal difference (TD) learning. However, many recent algorithms reframe RL as a supervised learning problem. These algorithms learn conditional policies by conditioning on goal states (Lynch et al., 2019; Ghosh et al., 2021), reward-to-go (Kumar et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2021), or language descriptions of the task (Lynch and Sermanet, 2021).
We find the simplicity of these methods quite appealing. If supervised learning is enough to solve RL problems, then offline RL could become widely accessible and (relatively) easy to implemen…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I read a paper and was a little bit confused:
 In the paper it said: "Imagine you have a two dimensional (binary input) classification (0 or 1) problem and you use Sigmoid as an acitivation function. Since the Sigmoid gives you a real number between 0 and 1, it's not really classification anymore. 
 Therefore you take the input of Sigmoid (y_Sigmoid) and put this into a modified heaviside function H(y-0.5) (so for y_Sigmoid bigger than 0.5, it gives you yHeavi = 1)
 The decision boundary is given by a straight line w1a1+w2a2+w0=0 and this whole process, it only works with the Sigmoid function as first activation function."
 The last paragraph confused me. Why can I assume that the decision boundary is exactly that (It's just the "normal decision boundary" for a SLP, why does it work here a also) 
 and why does it work with only Sigmoid Function as first activation function

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to test the architecture from the following paper with a different dataset:
 https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/19/3834
 The authors state that their objective function is the following:
 https://preview.redd.it/u78f27jb6nu81.png?width=1027&format=png&auto=webp&s=32790a67ec829a1e79b252edd0714b8b3b5a7f4e
 Where:
 -x is the real grayscale image.
 -s is its downsampled version, which should be used both as the initial imput of the generator performing the super-resolution and as a first conditional variable in the learning process.
 -e is another two-dimensional array containing values for a second additional conditional variable.
 The authors, however, state that this should be implemented by using two separate conditional adversarial losses, one for each of the conditional variables. To clarify, the first adversarial loss should be:
 AdvLoss1(ParametersG, ParametersD) = - Log(Discriminator(x,s) - Log(1-Discriminator(Generator(s),s)
 While the second would be:
 AdvLoss2(ParametersG, ParametersD) = - Log(Discriminator(x,e) - Log(1-Discriminator(Generator(s),e)
 Which should be then summed up for the backward pass.
 In my pytorch implementation, however, I have only been able to set up a unique adversarial loss, which could be defined as:
 CurrentAdvLoss(ParametersG, ParametersD) = - Log(Discriminator(x,(s,e)) - Log(1-Discriminator(Generator(s),(s,e)) I have tried to implement implemented as follows:(simplified version)
 which I calculate in the following training loop (simplified version, from the same question asked in the Pytorch forum) as errD and errG after conditioning the network on both s and e at the same time:
 https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/conditional-gan-with-multiple-adversarial-losses/149627
 My question is, is there a way to modify the following loop to obtain outputs that have been separately conditioned only first on s and then on e and thus calculate the two separate adversarial losses originally proposed by the authors instead?

Though it is a very simple app, it got more than 50K installs without much promotion. So, I am thinking about promoting it. But hesitate to do it as it is very simple app. So, I would like to add some useful feature before start promoting it. I would like to add a feature which will allow the users to ask any question related to bible, and it should be giving relevant answer. I assume that some bible data is open source.
 Is there any free tutorial available to know about how to implement AI based chat system for answering any bible related queries after training with bible data.
 Is there any app already providing this feature?

 Personally, I believe from their code on Github, they have a possible data leakage (in the same vein of the current issue raised there) as well as an accuracy of 100% on a test set is fishier than a fish market. However, I am very curious to hear from the court of public opinion. How is everyone feeling about this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a dataset of points cloud where each point in the point cloud has a variable. I am trying to relate the local geometry features to that point variable by using FPFH, This means I am generating my own features from the dataset by first using an area of n-points to compute normal-vector estimations and from x normal vector estimations to compute the FPFH. However, the numbers x and n are arbitrary and other combinations might describe the target variable better. So I wanted to know if there was a method to evaluate how good a given x and n value are at describing the target variable. I considered the correlation between the features (n,x) and the target variable but I read that this assumes linear combination redundancy. I am using scikit-learn. 
 So basically I have features X(x,n) and a target variable Y. Which x and n, in the feature space X(x,n), describes the target variable, Y, best.
 I want to do it before the training because when I try to train it with my random forest regressor it takes 3-4 hours and I want to test for more combinations.

 Deep learning frameworks are the engines and motors for pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence applications, and good deep learning frameworks can dramatically shorten the cycle of algorithm innovation and validation. In this report, we focus on the newly launched MindSpore framework, which has received a lot of industry attention, and systematically explore its model training speed on GPU clusters and compare it with popular international frameworks. In the evaluation experiments, we choose two classical models, ResNet and BERT-base, to test and analyze their performance with the same algorithm, the same dataset, and the same or similar performance hardware platf…]]></summary>

Apologies if these questions should be directed elsewhere.
  
I am planning to use WSL2/Ubuntu but have heard that Intel's thread director isn't implemented well yet in Linux (or Windows 10!), so it doesn't assign tasks properly. Has anyone experienced issues with this firsthand?
 Assuming the thread director is working, are the e-cores utilised at all in any typical DS workflows? E.g. will they get used with joblib or when training scikit-learn/gbms in parallel? 
 Are the e-cores good enough to handle other stuff like web browsing etc whilst the p-cores are maxed out on model training, or is it still necessary to keep at least one p-core free to avoid crashing the PC? Also I have read that in Windows 11 (where the thread director works best) that the active window/tab could be assigned p-cores as a priority, which isn't very helpful for someone who needs to train models in the background etc, but not sure whether this is actually happening in practice.
  
The consensus from benchmarks/reviews is that the hybrid architecture 'just works' and is superior to AMD right now, but those benchmarks are primarily for use in gaming/video editing.

 I hope you have a great day! Currently I want to compare how good multiple GANs (Vanilla GAN, WGAN, DCGAN, ...) are for a given use case. Therefore I trained the various GAN versions with data of two different classes (i.e. apple and banana). Now I want to show that data I generate with the Generator can be used to train i.e. a classifier that can distinguish between real images of apples and bananas.
 Can I somehow create labels for the data I generate with the Generator in a smart way? So that I know that a generated image of the generator should for example be an apple? How do i do that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Luminide introduces a new optimization, called Early Ranking, which makes it easier to build better AI models. Early Ranking achieves the same AI training results with up to 10x less compute – this saves time, reduces costs, and increases model accuracy.
 Luminide's IDE is a customized version of JupyterLab with integrated AI dev tools.
 Luminide used Early Ranking to place Top 1% in the CVPR Plant Pathology Kaggle competition. You can read about how we developed our winning model, and you can too, in our new blog post: Better Automation for Higher Accuracy AI Models.
 Class activation maps give insights into Luminide's winning model.
 Luminide is a new cloud platform for AI model development. Check out our demo video for a quick overview, or try it for yourself (sign up today and receive 100 hours of free GPU cloud compute).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Any reinforcement learning problem can be modeled as a sequential decision problem (SDP), which can always be modeled as a Markov decision process (need to model the state carefully). An example of an SDP is a multiarmed bandit problem, where the state is the vector of beliefs about the performance of each arm (or beliefs about a continuous parametric model). Decisions are made by a policy, and there are four classes of policies. For some reason, the RL community tends to focus on just one of the four classes (UCB policies, which fall in the class of cost function approximations), but there are entire communities using each of the other three classes. See chapter 7 of my new book (https://castlelab.princeton.edu/RLSO/) for a complete summary of the four classes of policies for pure learning problems (aka bandit problems). Note that Sutton and Barto (2nd edition) cover bandit problems in chapter 2, and then introduce MDPs in chapter 3. A bandit problem *is* an MDP!

So far, I know there is toptal, upwork, and freelancers. Checked them out, and seems toptal you still end up working for large corporate and mostly end up as full-time contractor which is not really a different or better option than my current work. Freelancers has too many bidders from developing countries. 
 Besides what platform to use, i have more questions in terms of what obstacles we are facing to be freelancer ML engineer? Even though i am in AI and a researcher, but i have never deployed a model in production. Usually a task at big company takes a team or multiple teams to complete the MLOPs lifecycle, how can you do it as a single person? Any sharing of experience would be of great help.

Supervised learning is a common approach to machine learning (ML) in which the model is trained using data that is labeled appropriately for the task at hand. Ordinary supervised learning trains on independent and identically distributed (IID) data, where all training examples are sampled from a fixed set of classes, and the model has access to these examples throughout the entire training phase. In contrast, continual learning tackles the problem of training a single model on changing data distributions where different classification tasks are presented sequentially.

 For my thesis I would like to interview AI/ML experts from the ASEAN region to talk about the digital development of each country, challenges and potentials. (If you are not native there, but you have a work connection or just knowledge about the region and its AI development, I appreciate that as well.)
 It would be awesome if some of you were open to talk to me. A few sentences are enough, I won't take much of your time. If you want, we can do a video call as well. I will quote you of course.
 Thank you guys.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to find literature on solving the following issue:
 In most probabilistic ML models, we model the joint distribution over a set of random variables, p(x1, ..., xN). If N is very large (e.g. 100, 500, or even 1000), then regardless of how you model this, the distribution's highest point of density is still quite tiny. E.g. if you consider an isotropic multivariate gaussian of 100 dimensions, the highest point of density will be somewhere in the neighbourhood of 1.6e-40. So when it comes time to evaluate log likelihood for a model like this, the probability is numerically 0, so the log probability goes to negative infinity.
 ​
 Is there work around solving these kinds of issues? I.e. by constraining the model in some way, or scaling model output, etc? I've done some googling, but am having a hard time finding papers on the subject. Not even sure what to call the problem... Curse of dimensionality in PGMs?
 ​
 Any recommendations of papers / talks / etc is greatly appreciated!

 Abstract:
 We present a framework for training GANs with explicit control over generated facial images. We are able to control the generated image by settings exact attributes such as age, pose, expression, etc. Most approaches for manipulating GAN-generated images achieve partial control by leveraging the latent space disentanglement properties, obtained implicitly after standard GAN training. Such methods are able to change the relative intensity of certain attributes, but not explicitly set their values. Recently proposed methods, designed for explicit control over human faces, harness morphable 3D face models (3DMM) to allow fine-grained control capabilities in GANs. Unlike these methods, our control is not constrained to 3DMM parameters and is extendable beyond the domain of human faces. Using contrastive learning, we obtain GANs with an explicitly disentangled latent space. This disentanglement is utilized to train control-encoders mapping human-interpretable inputs to suitable latent vectors, thus allowing explicit control. In the domain of human faces we demonstrate control over identity, age, pose, expression, hair color and illumination. We also demonstrate control capabilities of our framework in the domains of painted portraits and dog image generation. We demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance both qualitatively and quantitatively.

 On the other hand, i wasnt able to find information about the funding and profit goals of the leading conferences. Take NeuroIPS for example, i found that it is organized by “NeurIPS Foundation” but what exactly is this foundation - i couldn’t find any information about this subject.
 My point is, if the conferences are non-profit, sounds like they should be preferred over funding a for-profit organizations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, is it currently possible to train a UAV and implement the policy it in real-life? I understand there are different environments for training, e.g. AirSim, GymFC, and others. However, the interesting part for me is the link to the real world: Is there a way to directly implement any learned policy on a real drone, e.g. a commercially available quad-copter? Which UAV would support such a functionality?
 I'd love to get started on training drones for RL purposes (search and rescue, etc), but if there is no way to test it in real-life then this would be disappointing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am having a hard time figuring out what makes the difference between Expected Sarsa for prediction vs for control.
 For off-policy Expected Sarsa I believe it's possible to use one epsilon value for a target policy that is epsilon-greedy and another epsilon value for a behaviour policy that is epsilon-greedy. The target policy would be used within the expected value calculation in the update of Q(S,A), the action value function, and the behaviour policy would be used to choose actions from the current state. But I'm not sure how to differentiate between the control version of the algorithm compared to the prediction version though.
 I think prediction usually finds the state-value function but I know that on-line Sarsa for prediction uses Q(S,A) so I'm not sure how to determine the difference between prediction and control algorithms.

The algorithm never converges, I suspect it is because of the lack of exploration. Since the timesteps are small, the target usually oscillates around center of the screen, it is impossible to explore to go near the border and then explore to fire (to counter incoming missile). What methods should I try?
 Moreover, I have already done reward scaling and frame staking. Any suggestions regarding solving this game is much appreciated. 
 Last question, do you now similar (and common) environments that is solved, maybe solutions show the path to follow.Thank you :)

 I thought it may have been an "Horizon" show, however, I have been through the list of shows from that time and none appear to be right. If anyone has a memory of this show please let me know.
 One of the visuals I remember was a plastic skull with an LED matrix inside showing patterns. Obviously this was just some smoke and mirrors, however, it may trigger a memory. I'm trying to recall something from best part of 30 years ago..

 Best to my knowledge, under the continuous setting, the policy will output mean and std, so why the stdev of action distribution is given as a hyperparameter, and also what is LinearAnneal in detail.

 Dataset - Our custom dataset on Bangla Numerals
 Publications - Though its on (0-9) digits
 We have created a simple speech recognition system for recognizing Bangla numerals from '০-৯৯'(0-99). In this project, audio samples from different genders, age groups, and dialects of Bangladeshi people were used to create a speech dataset of spoken numbers from '০-৯৯'(0-99). The raw speech data is subjected to various audio augmentation techniques such as time shift, speed tuning, background noise mixing, and volume tuning. Then, to extract meaningful features from the data, Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCCs) are used. We have used, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to develop a Bangla number recognition system. The proposed method recognizes '০-৯৯'(0-99) Bangla spoken numbers with 89.61% accuracy across the entire dataset. The model’s effectiveness was also tested using 10-fold cross-validation, with 89.74% accuracy for recognizing '০-৯৯'(0-99) Bangla spoken numbers across the entire dataset.
 I Hope, this work will help you in some way. :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Specifically, I'm talking about workshops of major conferences (NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, etc.).
 If I submit a paper and it gets accepted, is that workshop paper a "final publication"? Or would most people expect the project to continue being developed into a slightly larger/longer paper for submission to the main stream of a conference? And if so, does publishing the earlier workshop paper tend to hinder or harm the later conference submission?
 I recognise there's a variety of workshops, and perhaps each have different expectations or norms. I'm wondering, from my outsider's perspective, how can I tell?
 For example, I have been thinking about submitting to one of these ICML workshops: https://icml-compbio.github.io/ or https://www.tagds.com/workshops/tag-in-machine-learning. Is there an easy way to tell whether either or both of these are "final publication" venues or not?

 This paper out today seems to make the bold claim that maximum likelihood estimation is not a well-posed training objective in deep generative modelling. The manifold hypothesis says that observed high-dimensional data clusters around low-dimensional manifolds, but maximum likelihood methods (e.g. VAE, normalizing flows) learn high-dimensional densities. The paper argues that the mismatch between dimensionalities will lead to a problem called "manifold overfitting".
 Models are able to maximize likelihood in high-dimensions by sending the density to infinity around the low-dimensional manifold, but they can do this while completely ignoring the distribution of data on the manifold. So in other words, high capacity models will learn the data manifold…]]></summary>

 I see this question was asked before but I am still not convinced there is a difference between the two. 
 How is asynchronous distributed RL (A3C) and federated learning different? It seems like the basic idea behind them is the same— the agents train in their own environments and only share gradients with the server. 
 Is the difference only in terms of the domain they are applied in? Is it just ML vs RL?

 So I intend to make an application that, very naively speaking, outputs synonyms of a given word regardless of context (like if word1 is "bank", the model should output both "money" and "river", and the order does not matter). For this, I intend to use a Doc2Vec type of classifier, where the meanings of each word can serve as a document, and then similar words can easily be returned using a cosine similarity function. I chose this over a classic Word2Vec as this will be able to predict uncommon words (which blimey the English language has a lot of) which would otherwise be processed as <UNK> tokens. To this end, I am searching for a suitable dataset. Any ideas?

 I have a series of videos taken at different times, and each video is paired with a physical variable. The videos contain information that correlates with the physical variable. 
 What we want to do is use the information encoded within each video to build a correlation model with the physical quantity, and thereafter use new videos to predict the physical quantity. 
 (We want to avoid the route of video -> CNN -> extract parameters -> build model with parameters. Instead, we want to directly go from the videos to the model without separately extracting parameters.)
 So, in a way, I want to use a series of videos as a time series data set. Is there a way to do this? What should be the starting point for my research into this?
 Thanks in advance! I am not an expert with this area at all, and would greatly appreciate guidance from the community.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Both approaches seem to be able to render complex scenes from a single view, without the need for explicit priors or pretrained feature extractors. Conveniently, AutoRF doesn't mention SinNeRF. What are the similarities and differences among the two approaches? DISCLAIMER - I'm not a NeRF expert. My limited understanding of it is that we train a small MLP to regress the radiance field for a scene, i.e., to predict emitted radiance at a point (x,y,z) in the viewing direction (θ, φ). Once we have the radiance field, we can use some rendering engine to render a 2D view from the 3D field and the camera parameters.
 EDIT: I just realized that I didn't link the papers, how silly of me. Here they are:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone!
 Our NLP team, led by our expert Daria, has recently released a new AI-based paraphrasing feature – Linguix Paraphraser 2.0.
 To measure its quality, we use four important metrics: BLEU, Jaccard similarity index, LaBSE and Perplexity.
 Performance stats:
  
BLEU, which is used for measuring the quality of machine translation. The lower it is for rephrase task, the better. Right now, Linguix Paraphraser 2.0 has the BLEU metric of 0.47 (previous iteration had 0.65). So, we can say that our paraphraser is now smarter, it uses more words to rewrite the sentence, but the overall idea of the content is still preserved.
 Jaccard similarity index is used to measure the likeness of x and y objects. The same as with BLEU, the lower the index for the task, the better. Our current metric is 0.45 compared to 0.51 for the previous iteration.
 LaBSE metric is used to measure the semantic similarity of two sentences. It translates text into vectors so that vectors of texts close in meaning are geometrically close to each other. The higher the metric, the better. The new model has LaBSE similarity slightly less than the previous model: 0.80 vs 0.93, which is normal and correct, because the model generates a variety of variants using other words, but keeping the meaning of the source text in the target.
 Perplexity is used to ensure the rewritten content sounds natural (lower perplexity is better). The naturalness of the rewrites generated by our new paraphraser is much better than before: 0.26 vs 4.99 for the prior version.
  
​
 https://i.redd.it/iaaf7o2iibu81.gif
 As such, for Linguix Paraphraser 2.0 we were able to improve the quality of the rephrased content, while keeping the text meaning at the same level.
 P.S. Daria is somewhat shy, so I asked her to share the update here on her behalf.
 Anyway she'll be pleased to see some feedback!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all - I'm an applied ML researcher working in an oncology research lab at U Chicago, using digital slides of patient's tumors for tumor classification, prognostication, and treatment response prediction. I'm really excited to share with the community the deep learning tools we've been using, and I'm hoping for any feedback you might have (or direction if you think there's a community or subreddit this might be better suited for).
 After years of development, we've released our open-source deep learning framework for digital histology, Slideflow (https://github.com/jamesdolezal/slideflow). It has flexible and highly optimized whole-slide image processing, support for a wide variety of existing and custom architectures (with continuous, categorical, or time-series outcomes), real-time digital stain normalization, a number of explainability tools, and integrated uncertainty quantification. It's compatible with both Tensorflow and PyTorch, available on PyPI and DockerHub, and comes with good documentation (https://slideflow.dev/). We've tried out a number of alternative frameworks over the years, and I think the ease of use, flexibility, and performance optimizations set it apart from other repos you'll find on GitHub.
 We have a handful of local collaborators who are using Slideflow, but I'm hoping to expand our reach and find people in similar fields who are interested in collaborating for ongoing open-source development. I've tried looked for subs relating specifically to computational pathology / digital histology, and haven't found a good community yet - anyone have ideas for how to get connected with like-minded people working in the same field?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, I have received a task in an area I am unfamiliar with and need a little help finding suitable papers, so I am looking for keywords.
 To illustrate the goal, let's say you have 10000 screws (which can be of the same model) and you want to be able to recognize/match each one. You want new screws to be added all the time, so you also want the case that the object could previously be unknown when performing the match.
 The goal is to develop a capturing system that produces suitable images and to find an architecture/algorithm that is as robust as possible. The object images should be invariant to illumination, rotation and translation during acquisition.
 It should be a kind of barcode/hash without any additional symbol, based only on the structure of the object.
 Is there a name for such a task? I think it is not really a classification in the classical sense. I guess it might be just a clever way of finding suitable features for each individual object structure and suitable distance function.
 Sorry for the long post, I appreciate any help.

Goal is to use represent textual rules and world knowledge and then use those represented knowledge for reasoning, so that motion of autonomous agent can be predicted. 
 I have question regarding the current landscape of knowledge representation and reasoning. I see more and more work in data focused model and old Logic and associated paths fading out. Phd project problem itself looks interesting as it focus on work where there will be less need of data and can plan motion in unseen scenarios. But I am concerned about the future career prospective in this domain where this problem is tackled by knowledge representation and reasoning. As I can see there is less and less funding in this domain. 
 What is your take on future landscape of research direction in this domain?

 Anomalies are widespread when it comes to working on data. They become vital in time series. So, It is crucial to propose efficient methods to detect and deal with them. This article illustrates a state-of-the-art model called DGHL for anomaly detection. DGHL includes a ConvNet as a Generator and instead of encoding it maximizes the likelihood with the Alternating Back-Propagation algorithms.

 I'm MB. A very nice and polite guy.
 Why is it called tensorflow and not matrixflow?
 AI is all about matrix multiplications, right? So why use the word tensor instead? I know what a tensor is, kind of. But isn't AI about matrix multiplications primarily rather than tensor multiplications.

 Summary:
 We introduce a novel statistical framework for learning a mixture of local normalizing flows as "chart maps" over the data manifold. Our framework augments the expressivity of recent approaches while preserving the signature property of normalizing flows, that they admit exact density evaluation. We learn a suitable atlas of charts for the data manifold via a vector quantized auto-encoder (VQ-AE) and the distributions over them using a conditional flow. We validate experimentally that our probabilistic framework enables existing approaches to better model data distributions over complex manifolds.​

 See step 15 here: https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/algorithms/sac.html#pseudocode
 I've heard this called polyak averaging.
 Let's say we have two weights from two neural networks: W1 from one network, and W2 is the corresponding weight from the other network. Polyak averaging averages these weights as follows:
 W_average = W1 * p + W2 * (1-p)
 When p is 0.5, it's a evenly weighted average. If p is high, then W1 is weighted more heavily than W2, etc.
 My question is: Does this method of averaging weights lead to numerically unstable neural networks? This technique is often used to gradually transform one neural network into another on a weight by weight basis, but there is no guarantee that all intermediate neural networks are well behaved (at least, none that I'm aware of). Whereas, gradient descent with small enough step sizes should, theoretically, keep a neural network well behaved, I think those same theoretical guarantees apply to polyak averaging neural networks.
 What do you think?

ataxia-specific gait characteristics (risk-prediction), and 2) assess severity
of ataxia from gait (severity-assessment) using computer vision. We created a
dataset of 155 videos from 89 participants, 24 controls and 65 diagnosed with
(or are pre-manifest) spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), performing the gait task
of the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) from 11 medical
sites located in 8 different states across the United States. We develop a
computer vision pipeline to detect, track, and separate out the participants
from their surroundings and construct several features from their body pose
coordinates to capture gait characteristics like step width, step length,
swing, stability, speed, etc. Our risk-prediction model achieves 83.06%
accuracy and an 80.23% F1 score. Similarly, our severity-assessment model
achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) score of 0.6225 and a Pearson's
correlation coefficient score of 0.7268. Our models still performed
competitively when evaluated on data from sites not used during training.
Furthermore, through feature importance analysis, we found that our models
associate wider steps, decreased walking speed, and increased instability with
greater ataxia severity, which is consistent with previously established
clinical knowledge. Our models create possibilities for remote ataxia
assessment in non-clinical settings in the future, which could significantly
improve accessibility of ataxia care. Furthermore, our underlying dataset was
assembled from a geographically diverse cohort, highlighting its potential to
further increase equity. The code used in this study is open to the public, and
the anonymized body pose landmark dataset is also available upon request.]]></summary>

seek to build the brand and spread their messages. Prior research studying the
effects of online reviews has been mainly focused on a single numerical cause,
e.g., ratings or sentiment scores. We argue that such notions of causes entail
three key limitations: they solely consider the effects of single numerical
causes and ignore different effects of multiple aspects -- e.g., Food, Service
-- embedded in the textual reviews; they assume the absence of hidden
confounders in observational studies, e.g., consumers' personal preferences;
and they overlook the indirect effects of numerical causes that can potentially
cancel out the effect of textual reviews on business revenue. We thereby
propose an alternative perspective to this single-cause-based effect estimation
of online reviews: in the presence of hidden confounders, we consider
multi-aspect textual reviews, particularly, their total effects on business
revenue and direct effects with the numerical cause -- ratings -- being the
mediator. We draw on recent advances in machine learning and causal inference
to together estimate the hidden confounders and causal effects. We present
empirical evaluations using real-world examples to discuss the importance and
implications of differentiating the multi-aspect effects in strategizing
business operations.]]></summary>

adapts to an increasing number of tasks encountered sequentially, thereby
potentially leveraging learnings across tasks in a resource-efficient manner. A
major challenge for CL systems is catastrophic forgetting, where earlier tasks
are forgotten while learning a new task. To address this, replay-based CL
approaches maintain and repeatedly retrain on a small buffer of data selected
across encountered tasks. We propose Gradient Coreset Replay (GCR), a novel
strategy for replay buffer selection and update using a carefully designed
optimization criterion. Specifically, we select and maintain a "coreset" that
closely approximates the gradient of all the data seen so far with respect to
current model parameters, and discuss key strategies needed for its effective
application to the continual learning setting. We show significant gains (2%-4%
absolute) over the state-of-the-art in the well-studied offline continual
learning setting. Our findings also effectively transfer to online / streaming
CL settings, showing upto 5% gains over existing approaches. Finally, we
demonstrate the value of supervised contrastive loss for continual learning,
which yields a cumulative gain of up to 5% accuracy when combined with our
subset selection strategy.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gradient descent is slow to converge for ill-conditioned problems and
non-convex problems. An important technique for acceleration is step-size
adaptation. The first part of this paper contains a detailed review of
step-size adaptation methods, including Polyak step-size, L4, LossGrad, Adam,
IDBD, and Hypergradient descent, and the relation of step-size adaptation to
meta-gradient methods. In the second part of this paper, we propose a new class
of methods of accelerating gradient descent that have some distinctiveness from
existing techniques. The new methods, which we call {\em step-size planning},
use the {\em update experience} to learn an improved way of updating the
parameters. The methods organize the experience into $K$ steps away from each
other to facilitate planning. From the past experience, our planning algorithm,
Csawg, learns a step-size model which is a form of multi-step machine that
predicts future updates. We extends Csawg to applying step-size planning
multiple steps, which leads to further speedup. We discuss and highlight the
projection power of the diagonal-matrix step-size for future large scale
applications. We show for a convex problem, our methods can surpass the
convergence rate of Nesterov's accelerated gradient, $1 - \sqrt{\mu/L}$, where
$\mu, L$ are the strongly convex factor of the loss function $F$ and the
Lipschitz constant of $F'$, which is the theoretical limit for the convergence
rate of first-order methods. On the well-known non-convex Rosenbrock function,
our planning methods achieve zero error below 500 gradient evaluations, while
gradient descent takes about 10000 gradient evaluations to reach a $10^{-3}$
accuracy. We discuss the connection of step-size planing to planning in
reinforcement learning, in particular, Dyna architectures.]]></summary>

custom-made dataset of 192 bottle images with pixel-by pixel-polygon annotation
for the automatic segmentation task. The proposed transfer learning scheme
makes use of a Mask R-CNN model pre-trained on the Microsoft COCO dataset. We
present a comprehensive scheme for fine-tuning the base pre-trained Mask-RCNN
model on our custom dataset. Our final fine-tuned model has achieved 59.4
\textit{mean average precision} (mAP), which corresponds to the MS COCO metric.
The results indicate a promising application of deep learning for detecting

performance drastically drops when applied to huge amounts of data. We propose
a new heuristic that is built on the basis of regular K-means for faster and
more accurate big data clustering using the "less is more" and MSSC
decomposition approaches. The main advantage of the proposed algorithm is that
it naturally turns the K-means local search into global one through the process
of decomposition of the MSSC problem. On one hand, decomposition of the MSSC
problem into smaller subproblems reduces the computational complexity and
allows for their parallel processing. On the other hand, the MSSC decomposition
provides a new method for the natural data-driven shaking of the incumbent
solution while introducing a new neighborhood structure for the solution of the
MSSC problem. This leads to a new heuristic that improves K-means in big data
conditions. The scalability of the algorithm to big data can be easily adjusted
by choosing the appropriate number of subproblems and their size. The proposed
algorithm is both scalable and accurate. In our experiments it outperforms all
recent state-of-the-art algorithms for the MSSC in terms of time as well as the

classification and regression settings, these algorithms can guarantee that the
true label lies within the prediction set with high probability. Building on
these ideas, we propose multi-object detection and tracking algorithms that
come with probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantees. They do so by
constructing both a prediction set around each object detection as well as
around the set of edge transitions; given an object, the detection prediction
set contains its true bounding box with high probability, and the edge

optimization algorithms have attracted significant attention for power systems
applications due to their potential for superior scalability, privacy, and
robustness to a single point-of-failure. The Alternating Direction Method of
Multipliers (ADMM) is a popular distributed optimization algorithm; however,
its convergence performance is highly dependent on the selection of penalty
parameters, which are usually chosen heuristically. In this work, we use
reinforcement learning (RL) to develop an adaptive penalty parameter selection
policy for the AC optimal power flow (ACOPF) problem solved via ADMM with the
goal of minimizing the number of iterations until convergence. We train our RL
policy using deep Q-learning, and show that this policy can result in
significantly accelerated convergence (up to a 59% reduction in the number of
iterations compared to existing, curvature-informed penalty parameter selection
methods). Furthermore, we show that our RL policy demonstrates promise for
generalizability, performing well under unseen loading schemes as well as under
unseen losses of lines and generators (up to a 50% reduction in iterations).
This work thus provides a proof-of-concept for using RL for parameter selection
in ADMM for power systems applications.]]></summary>

on the other hand is a distributed technique that can train any GNN type
directly on an entire large graph. The key innovation in SAR is the distributed
sequential rematerialization scheme which sequentially re-constructs then frees
pieces of the prohibitively large GNN computational graph during the backward
pass. This results in excellent memory scaling behavior where the memory
consumption per worker goes down linearly with the number of workers, even for
densely connected graphs. Using SAR, we report the largest applications of
full-batch GNN training to-date, and demonstrate large memory savings as the
number of workers increases. We also present a general technique based on
kernel fusion and attention-matrix rematerialization to optimize both the
runtime and memory efficiency of attention-based models. We show that, coupled

impact on the healthcare domain, and it is being actively studied. Previous
research on structured EHR-QA focuses on converting natural language queries
into query language such as SQL or SPARQL (NLQ2Query), so the problem scope is
limited to pre-defined data types by the specific query language. In order to
expand the EHR-QA task beyond this limitation to handle multi-modal medical
data and solve complex inference in the future, more primitive systemic
language is needed. In this paper, we design the program-based model
(NLQ2Program) for EHR-QA as the first step towards the future direction. We
tackle MIMICSPARQL*, the graph-based EHR-QA dataset, via a program-based
approach in a semi-supervised manner in order to overcome the absence of gold
programs. Without the gold program, our proposed model shows comparable
performance to the previous state-of-the-art model, which is an NLQ2Query model
(0.9% gain). In addition, for a reliable EHR-QA model, we apply the uncertainty
decomposition method to measure the ambiguity in the input question. We

studies in single-objective numerical optimization show that supervised machine
learning methods can predict algorithm performance using landscape features
extracted from the problem instances.

Existing approaches typically treat the algorithms as black-boxes, without
consideration of their characteristics. To investigate in this work if a
selection of landscape features that depends on algorithms properties could
further improve regression accuracy, we regard the modular CMA-ES framework and
estimate how much each landscape feature contributes to the best algorithm
performance regression models. Exploratory data analysis performed on this data
indicate that the set of most relevant features does not depend on the
configuration of individual modules, but the influence that these features have
on regression accuracy does. In addition, we have shown that by using
classifiers that take the features relevance on the model accuracy, we are able
to predict the status of individual modules in the CMA-ES configurations.]]></summary>

ranked as the best, and forecasts are pooled using either simple or weighted

known as few-shot image classification, is a challenging task in statistical
machine learning and computer vision. The performance in few-shot
classification suffers from the bias in the estimation of classifier
parameters; however, an effective underlying bias reduction technique that
could alleviate this issue in training few-shot classifiers has been
overlooked. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Firth bias
reduction in few-shot classification. Theoretically, Firth bias reduction
removes the $O(N^{-1})$ first order term from the small-sample bias of the
Maximum Likelihood Estimator. Here we show that the general Firth bias
reduction technique simplifies to encouraging uniform class assignment
probabilities for multinomial logistic classification, and almost has the same
effect in cosine classifiers. We derive an easy-to-implement optimization
objective for Firth penalized multinomial logistic and cosine classifiers,
which is equivalent to penalizing the cross-entropy loss with a KL-divergence
between the uniform label distribution and the predictions. Then, we
empirically evaluate that it is consistently effective across the board for
few-shot image classification, regardless of (1) the feature representations
from different backbones, (2) the number of samples per class, and (3) the
number of classes. Finally, we show the robustness of Firth bias reduction, in
the case of imbalanced data distribution. Our implementation is available at

requiring search over the operation space. To overcome the efficiency
challenges of naive weight-sharing in this search space, we introduce DASH, a
differentiable NAS algorithm that computes the mixture-of-operations using the
Fourier diagonalization of convolution, achieving both a better asymptotic
complexity and an up-to-10x search time speedup in practice. We evaluate DASH
on NAS-Bench-360, a suite of ten tasks designed for benchmarking NAS in diverse

image generation tasks. However, empirical results on previous research in
diffusion models imply that there is an inverse correlation on performances for
density estimation and sample generation. This paper analyzes that the inverse
correlation arises because density estimation is mostly contributed from small
diffusion time, whereas sample generation mainly depends on large diffusion
time. However, training score network on both small and large diffusion time is
demanding because of the loss imbalance issue. To successfully train the score
network on both small and large diffusion time, this paper introduces a
training technique, Soft Truncation, that softens the truncation time for every
mini-batch update, which is universally applicable to any types of diffusion
models. It turns out that Soft Truncation is equivalent to a diffusion model
with a general weight, and we prove the variational bound of the general
weighted diffusion model. In view of this variational bound, Soft Truncation
becomes a natural way to train the score network. In experiments, Soft
Truncation achieves the state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CelebA,
CelebA-HQ $256\times 256$, and STL-10 datasets.]]></summary>

provides a strategy to train machine learning models while respecting users'
privacy. However, differential privacy can disproportionately degrade the
performance of the models on under-represented groups, as these parts of the
distribution are difficult to learn in the presence of noise. Existing
approaches for enforcing fairness in machine learning models have considered
the centralized setting, in which the algorithm has access to the users' data.
This paper introduces an algorithm to enforce group fairness in private
federated learning, where users' data does not leave their devices. First, the
paper extends the modified method of differential multipliers to empirical risk
minimization with fairness constraints, thus providing an algorithm to enforce
fairness in the central setting. Then, this algorithm is extended to the
private federated learning setting. The proposed algorithm, \texttt{FPFL}, is
tested on a federated version of the Adult dataset and an "unfair" version of
the FEMNIST dataset. The experiments on these datasets show how private
federated learning accentuates unfairness in the trained models, and how FPFL
is able to mitigate such unfairness.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It has long been observed that the performance of evolutionary algorithms and
other randomized search heuristics can benefit from a non-static choice of the
parameters that steer their optimization behavior. Mechanisms that identify
suitable configurations on the fly ("parameter control") or via a dedicated
training process ("dynamic algorithm configuration") are therefore an important
component of modern evolutionary computation frameworks. Several approaches to
address the dynamic parameter setting problem exist, but we barely understand
which ones to prefer for which applications. As in classical benchmarking,
problem collections with a known ground truth can offer very meaningful
insights in this context. Unfortunately, settings with well-understood control
policies are very rare.

One of the few exceptions for which we know which parameter settings minimize
the expected runtime is the LeadingOnes problem. We extend this benchmark by
analyzing optimal control policies that can select the parameters only from a
given portfolio of possible values. This also allows us to compute optimal
parameter portfolios of a given size. We demonstrate the usefulness of our
benchmarks by analyzing the behavior of the DDQN reinforcement learning
approach for dynamic algorithm configuration.]]></summary>

beneficial for a range of visual tasks from classification and detection to
captioning and image manipulation. We investigate the effectiveness of CLIP
visual backbones for Embodied AI tasks. We build incredibly simple baselines,
named EmbCLIP, with no task specific architectures, inductive biases (such as
the use of semantic maps), auxiliary tasks during training, or depth maps --
yet we find that our improved baselines perform very well across a range of
tasks and simulators. EmbCLIP tops the RoboTHOR ObjectNav leaderboard by a huge
margin of 20 pts (Success Rate). It tops the iTHOR 1-Phase Rearrangement
leaderboard, beating the next best submission, which employs Active Neural
Mapping, and more than doubling the % Fixed Strict metric (0.08 to 0.17). It
also beats the winners of the 2021 Habitat ObjectNav Challenge, which employ
auxiliary tasks, depth maps, and human demonstrations, and those of the 2019
Habitat PointNav Challenge. We evaluate the ability of CLIP's visual
representations at capturing semantic information about input observations --
primitives that are useful for navigation-heavy embodied tasks -- and find that
CLIP's representations encode these primitives more effectively than
ImageNet-pretrained backbones. Finally, we extend one of our baselines,
producing an agent capable of zero-shot object navigation that can navigate to
objects that were not used as targets during training. Our code and models are

segments. As an example, for a segment indicating particular interest in a

each single user will belong to the segment. However, there may exist numerous

top of a flat concept representation that summarizes each user's heterogeneous
digital footprints, and uniformly models each of the prediction task using an
approach called "super learning ", that is, combining prediction models with
diverse architectures or learning method that are not compatible with each
other. Following this, we provide an end to end approach that learns to
flexibly attend to best suited heterogeneous experts adaptively, while at the

While many machine learning methods are not new, university classes on machine
learning are largely unavailable to meteorology students and are not required
to become a meteorologist. The lack of formal instruction has contributed to
perception that machine learning methods are 'black boxes' and thus end-users
are hesitant to apply the machine learning methods in their every day workflow.
To reduce the opaqueness of machine learning methods and lower hesitancy
towards machine learning in meteorology, this paper provides a survey of some
of the most common machine learning methods. A familiar meteorological example
is used to contextualize the machine learning methods while also discussing
machine learning topics using plain language. The following machine learning
methods are demonstrated: linear regression; logistic regression; decision
trees; random forest; gradient boosted decision trees; naive Bayes; and support
vector machines. Beyond discussing the different methods, the paper also
contains discussions on the general machine learning process as well as best
practices to enable readers to apply machine learning to their own datasets.
Furthermore, all code (in the form of Jupyter notebooks and Google Colaboratory
notebooks) used to make the examples in the paper is provided in an effort to
catalyse the use of machine learning in meteorology.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Latent Gaussian models and boosting are widely used techniques in statistics
and machine learning. Tree-boosting shows excellent prediction accuracy on many
data sets, but potential drawbacks are that it assumes conditional independence
of samples, produces discontinuous predictions for, e.g., spatial data, and it
can have difficulty with high-cardinality categorical variables. Latent
Gaussian models, such as Gaussian process and grouped random effects models,
are flexible prior models which explicitly model dependence among samples and
which allow for efficient learning of predictor functions and for making
probabilistic predictions. However, existing latent Gaussian models usually
assume either a zero or a linear prior mean function which can be an
unrealistic assumption. This article introduces a novel approach that combines
boosting and latent Gaussian models to remedy the above-mentioned drawbacks and
to leverage the advantages of both techniques. We obtain increased prediction
accuracy compared to existing approaches in both simulated and real-world data
experiments.]]></summary>

improving the test-time performance of an agent in deployment environments with

practice by deploying a straightforward algorithm that tries to match the
distribution of latent features to the agent's prior experience, without
relying on paired data. Although simple, we show that this idea leads to
surprising improvements on a variety of adaptation scenarios without access to
deployment-time rewards, including changes in scene content, camera poses, and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Backdoor attacks insert malicious data into a training set so that, during
inference time, it misclassifies inputs that have been patched with a backdoor
trigger as the malware specified label. For backdoor attacks to bypass human
inspection, it is essential that the injected data appear to be correctly
labeled. The attacks with such property are often referred to as "clean-label
attacks." Existing clean-label backdoor attacks require knowledge of the entire
training set to be effective. Obtaining such knowledge is difficult or
impossible because training data are often gathered from multiple sources
(e.g., face images from different users). It remains a question whether
backdoor attacks still present a real threat.

This paper provides an affirmative answer to this question by designing an
algorithm to mount clean-label backdoor attacks based only on the knowledge of
representative examples from the target class. With poisoning equal to or less
than 0.5% of the target-class data and 0.05% of the training set, we can train
a model to classify test examples from arbitrary classes into the target class
when the examples are patched with a backdoor trigger. Our attack works well
across datasets and models, even when the trigger presents in the physical
world.

We explore the space of defenses and find that, surprisingly, our attack can
evade the latest state-of-the-art defenses in their vanilla form, or after a
simple twist, we can adapt to the downstream defenses. We study the cause of
the intriguing effectiveness and find that because the trigger synthesized by
our attack contains features as persistent as the original semantic features of
the target class, any attempt to remove such triggers would inevitably hurt the
model accuracy first.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lifelong on-device learning is a key challenge for machine intelligence, and
this requires learning from few, often single, samples. Memory augmented neural
network has been proposed to achieve the goal, but the memory module has to be
stored in an off-chip memory due to its size. Therefore the practical use has
been heavily limited. Previous works on emerging memory-based implementation
have difficulties in scaling up because different modules with various
structures are difficult to integrate on the same chip and the small sense
margin of the content addressable memory for the memory module heavily limited
the degree of mismatch calculation. In this work, we implement the entire
memory augmented neural network architecture in a fully integrated memristive
crossbar platform and achieve an accuracy that closely matches standard
software on digital hardware for the Omniglot dataset. The successful
demonstration is supported by implementing new functions in crossbars in
addition to widely reported matrix multiplications. For example, the
locality-sensitive hashing operation is implemented in crossbar arrays by
exploiting the intrinsic stochasticity of memristor devices. Besides, the
content-addressable memory module is realized in crossbars, which also supports
the degree of mismatches. Simulations based on experimentally validated models
show such an implementation can be efficiently scaled up for one-shot learning
on the Mini-ImageNet dataset. The successful demonstration paves the way for
practical on-device lifelong learning and opens possibilities for novel
attention-based algorithms not possible in conventional hardware.]]></summary>

enjoying both high efficiency and low latency. These advantages are achieved by
converting the offline Align-Refine algorithm to be streaming-compatible, with
a novel transformer decoder architecture that performs local self-attentions
for both text and audio, and a time-aligned cross-attention at each layer.
Furthermore, we perform discriminative training of our model with the minimum
word error rate (MWER) criterion, which has not been done in the non-AR
decoding literature. Experiments on voice search datasets and Librispeech show
that with reasonable right context, our streaming model performs as well as the

Latent Dirichlet allocation describes a patient as a mixture of topics
corresponding to genetic variants. This can be generalized as a Bayesian tensor
decomposition to account for multiple feature variables. Our most significant
contributions are with hierarchical topic modeling. We design distinct methods
of incorporating hierarchical topic modeling, based on nested Chinese
restaurant processes and Pachinko Allocation Machine, into Bayesian tensor
decomposition. We apply these models to examine patients with one of four
common types of cancer (breast, lung, prostate, and colorectal) and siblings
with and without autism spectrum disorder. We linked the genes with their

counts of their genetic variants, and the genes' membership in pathways. We

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) have emerged as a promising solution for
reducing the memory footprint and compute costs of deep neural networks. BNNs,
on the other hand, suffer from information loss because binary activations are
limited to only two values, resulting in reduced accuracy. To improve the
accuracy, previous studies have attempted to control the distribution of binary
activation by manually shifting the threshold of the activation function or
making the shift amount trainable. During the process, they usually depended on
statistical information computed from a batch. We argue that using statistical
data from a batch fails to capture the crucial information for each input
instance in BNN computations, and the differences between statistical
information computed from each instance need to be considered when determining
the binary activation threshold of each instance. Based on the concept, we
propose the Binary Neural Network with INSTAnce-aware threshold (INSTA-BNN),
which decides the activation threshold value considering the difference between
statistical data computed from a batch and each instance. The proposed
INSTA-BNN outperforms the baseline by 2.5% and 2.3% on the ImageNet
classification task with comparable computing cost, achieving 68.0% and 71.7%
top-1 accuracy on ResNet-18 and MobileNetV1 based models, respectively.]]></summary>

to learn a model on labeled training graphs and generalize it to infer node
labels on unlabeled test graphs. This problem has been extensively studied with
graph neural networks (GNNs) by learning effective node representations, as
well as traditional structured prediction methods for modeling the structured
output of node labels, e.g., conditional random fields (CRFs). In this paper,
we present a new approach called the Structured Proxy Network (SPN), which
combines the advantages of both worlds. SPN defines flexible potential
functions of CRFs with GNNs. However, learning such a model is nontrivial as it
involves optimizing a maximin game with high-cost inference. Inspired by the
underlying connection between joint and marginal distributions defined by
Markov networks, we propose to solve an approximate version of the optimization
problem as a proxy, which yields a near-optimal solution, making learning more
efficient. Extensive experiments on two settings show that our approach
outperforms many competitive baselines.]]></summary>

to predict the difference in advance. The second part of our strategy evolves
patterns by selecting for mobility and conservation of mean cell value. We
validate our pattern evolution method by re-discovering gliders in 17 of 17
Lenia CA, and also report 5 new evolved CA that support evolved glider

transmission technique to improve the spectral efficiency (SE) of future
communication systems. However, such improvements of the SE are at the cost of
additional computational complexity to remove the intentionally introduced
intersymbol interference. In this paper, we investigate the use of deep
learning (DL) to reduce the detection complexity of FTN signaling. To eliminate
the need of having a noise whitening filter at the receiver, we first present
an equivalent FTN signaling model based on using a set of orthonormal basis
functions and identify its operation region. Second, we propose a DL-based list
sphere decoding (DL-LSD) algorithm that selects and updates the initial radius
of the original LSD to guarantee a pre-defined number $N_{\text{L}}$ of lattice
points inside the hypersphere. This is achieved by training a neural network to
output an approximate initial radius that includes $N_{\text{L}}$ lattice
points. At the testing phase, if the hypersphere has more than $N_{\text{L}}$
lattice points, we keep the $N_{\text{L}}$ closest points to the point
corresponding to the received FTN signal; however, if the hypersphere has less
than $N_{\text{L}}$ points, we increase the approximate initial radius by a
value that depends on the standard deviation of the distribution of the output
radii from the training phase. Then, the approximate value of the
log-likelihood ratio (LLR) is calculated based on the obtained $N_{\text{L}}$
points. Simulation results show that the computational complexity of the
proposed DL-LSD is lower than its counterpart of the original LSD by orders of
magnitude.]]></summary>

acoustic model predicts senone state posteriors for each speaker. These are
later used by a single-talker decoder which is applied on each speaker-specific

sub-optimal and propose a principled solution that decodes all speakers
jointly. We modify the acoustic model to predict joint state posteriors for all
speakers, enabling the network to express uncertainty about the attribution of
parts of the speech signal to the speakers. We employ a joint decoder that can
make use of this uncertainty together with higher-level language information.
For this, we revisit decoding algorithms used in factorial generative models in
early multi-talker speech recognition systems. In contrast with these early

we want to deploy large, powerful models in production and/or edge devices. One
common technique used to achieve this goal is knowledge distillation.
Typically, the output of a static pre-defined teacher (a large base network) is
used as soft labels to train and transfer information to a student (or smaller)
network. In this paper, we introduce Adjoined Networks, or AN, a learning
paradigm that trains both the original base network and the smaller compressed
network together. In our training approach, the parameters of the smaller
network are shared across both the base and the compressed networks. Using our
training paradigm, we can simultaneously compress (the student network) and
regularize (the teacher network) any architecture. In this paper, we focus on
popular CNN-based architectures used for computer vision tasks. We conduct an
extensive experimental evaluation of our training paradigm on various
large-scale datasets. Using ResNet-50 as the base network, AN achieves 71.8%
top-1 accuracy with only 1.8M parameters and 1.6 GFLOPs on the ImageNet
data-set. We further propose Differentiable Adjoined Networks (DAN), a training
paradigm that augments AN by using neural architecture search to jointly learn
both the width and the weights for each layer of the smaller network. DAN
achieves ResNet-50 level accuracy on ImageNet with $3.8\times$ fewer parameters

several distinct sections. We approach MSA within a compression framework,
under the hypothesis that the structure is more easily revealed by a simplified

the hypothesis that MSA is correlated with similarities occurring at the bar
scale, this article introduces the use of linear and non-linear compression
schemes on barwise audio signals. Compressed representations capture the most

the song structure using a dynamic programming algorithm. This work explores
both low-rank approximation models such as Principal Component Analysis or
Nonnegative Matrix Factorization and "piece-specific" Auto-Encoding Neural
Networks, with the objective to learn latent representations specific to a
given song. Such approaches do not rely on supervision nor annotations, which
are well-known to be tedious to collect and possibly ambiguous in MSA

Recent work shows that differentiable quality diversity (DQD) algorithms

agent policies typically assume that the environment is not differentiable. To
apply DQD algorithms to training agent policies, we must approximate gradients
for performance and behavior. We propose two variants of the current

framework simplifies the approximation problem of diffeomorphisms, which
enables us to show the universal approximation properties of INNs. We apply the
framework to two representative classes of INNs, namely Coupling-Flow-based
INNs (CF-INNs) and Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs), and
elucidate their high representation power despite the restrictions on their

Network (GNN) framework, celebrate much success in the analysis of
graph-structured data. Concurrently, the sparsification of Neural Network
models attracts a great amount of academic and industrial interest. In this
paper we conduct a structured, empirical study of the effect of sparsification
on the trainable part of MPNNs known as the Update step. To this end, we design
a series of models to successively sparsify the linear transform in the Update
step. Specifically, we propose the ExpanderGNN model with a tuneable
sparsification rate and the Activation-Only GNN, which has no linear transform
in the Update step. In agreement with a growing trend in the literature the
sparsification paradigm is changed by initialising sparse neural network
architectures rather than expensively sparsifying already trained
architectures. Our novel benchmark models enable a better understanding of the
influence of the Update step on model performance and outperform existing
simplified benchmark models such as the Simple Graph Convolution. The
ExpanderGNNs, and in some cases the Activation-Only models, achieve performance
on par with their vanilla counterparts on several downstream tasks, while
containing significantly fewer trainable parameters. Our code is publicly
available at: https://github.com/ChangminWu/ExpanderGNN.]]></summary>

growing range of path-based smart-city applications, e.g., travel-time
estimation and travel path ranking. A temporal path(TP) that includes temporal
information, e.g., departure time, into the path is fundamental to enable such
applications. In this setting, it is essential to learn generic temporal path
representations(TPRs) that consider spatial and temporal correlations
simultaneously and that can be used in different applications, i.e., downstream
tasks. Existing methods fail to achieve the goal since (i) supervised methods
require large amounts of task-specific labels when training and thus fail to
generalize the obtained TPRs to other tasks; (ii) through unsupervised methods
can learn generic representations, they disregard the temporal aspect, leading
to sub-optimal results. To contend with the limitations of existing solutions,
we propose a Weakly-Supervised Contrastive (WSC) learning model. We first
propose a temporal path encoder that encodes both the spatial and temporal
information of a temporal path into a TPR. To train the encoder, we introduce
weak labels that are easy and inexpensive to obtain and are relevant to
different tasks, e.g., temporal labels indicating peak vs. off-peak hours from
departure times. Based on the weak labels, we construct meaningful positive and
negative temporal path samples by considering both spatial and temporal
information, which facilities training the encoder using contrastive learning
by pulling closer to the positive samples' representations while pushing away
the negative samples' representations. To better guide contrastive learning, we
propose a learning strategy based on Curriculum Learning such that the learning
performs from easy to hard training instances. Experiments studies verify the
effectiveness of the proposed method.]]></summary>

prevails to deliver high-performance task-specific models and can even learn
general task-agnostic representations for efficient finetuning to downstream
tasks. However, deep learning in resource-limited domains still faces the
following challenges including (i) limited data, (ii) constrained model
development cost, and (iii) lack of adequate pre-trained models for effective
finetuning. This paper introduces a new technique called model reprogramming to
bridge this gap. Model reprogramming enables resource-efficient cross-domain
machine learning by repurposing and reusing a well-developed pre-trained model
from a source domain to solve tasks in a target domain without model
finetuning, where the source and target domains can be vastly different. In
many applications, model reprogramming outperforms transfer learning and
training from scratch. This paper elucidates the methodology of model
reprogramming, summarizes existing use cases, provides a theoretical
explanation on the success of model reprogramming, and concludes with a
discussion on open-ended research questions and opportunities. A list of model
reprogramming studies is actively maintained and updated at

Montanari and Richard to study the computational difficulty of estimating an
unknown parameter from higher-order moment tensors. Unlike its matrix
counterpart, Tensor PCA exhibits a statistical-computational gap, i.e., a
sample size regime where the problem is information-theoretically solvable but
conjectured to be computationally hard. This paper derives computational lower
bounds on the run-time of memory bounded algorithms for Tensor PCA using
communication complexity. These lower bounds specify a trade-off among the
number of passes through the data sample, the sample size, and the memory
required by any algorithm that successfully solves Tensor PCA. While the lower
bounds do not rule out polynomial-time algorithms, they do imply that many
commonly-used algorithms, such as gradient descent and power method, must have
a higher iteration count when the sample size is not large enough. Similar
lower bounds are obtained for Non-Gaussian Component Analysis, a family of
statistical estimation problems in which low-order moment tensors carry no
information about the unknown parameter. Finally, stronger lower bounds are
obtained for an asymmetric variant of Tensor PCA and related statistical
estimation problems. These results explain why many estimators for these
problems use a memory state that is significantly larger than the effective
dimensionality of the parameter of interest.]]></summary>

approximation. While deep learning is an extremely powerful way to find
relationships in data, its use in science has been hindered by the difficulty
of understanding the learned relationships. The Information Bottleneck (IB) is
an information theoretic framework for understanding a relationship between an
input and an output in terms of a trade-off between the fidelity and complexity
of approximations to the relationship. Here we show that a crucial modification
-- distributing bottlenecks across multiple components of the input -- opens
fundamentally new avenues for interpretable deep learning in science. The
Distributed Information Bottleneck throttles the downstream complexity of
interactions between the components of the input, deconstructing a relationship
into meaningful approximations found through deep learning without requiring
custom-made datasets or neural network architectures. Applied to a complex
system, the approximations illuminate aspects of the system's nature by
restricting -- and monitoring -- the information about different components
incorporated into the approximation. We demonstrate the Distributed IB's
explanatory utility in systems drawn from applied mathematics and condensed
matter physics. In the former, we deconstruct a Boolean circuit into
approximations that isolate the most informative subsets of input components
without requiring exhaustive search. In the latter, we localize information
about future plastic rearrangement in the static structure of a sheared glass,
and find the information to be more or less diffuse depending on the system's
preparation. By way of a principled scheme of approximations, the Distributed
IB brings much-needed interpretability to deep learning and enables
unprecedented analysis of information flow through a system.]]></summary>

convolutions and pointwise nonlinearities. Due to their invariance and
stability properties, GNNs are provably successful at learning representations
from data supported on moderate-scale graphs. However, they are difficult to
learn on large-scale graphs. In this paper, we study the problem of training
GNNs on graphs of moderate size and transferring them to large-scale graphs. We
use graph limits called graphons to define limit objects for graph filters and
GNNs -- graphon filters and graphon neural networks (WNNs) -- which we
interpret as generative models for graph filters and GNNs. We then show that
graphon filters and WNNs can be approximated by graph filters and GNNs sampled
from them on weighted and stochastic graphs. Because the error of these
approximations can be upper bounded, by a triangle inequality argument we can
further bound the error of transferring a graph filter or a GNN across graphs.
Our results show that (i) the transference error decreases with the graph size,
and (ii) that graph filters have a transferability-discriminability tradeoff
that in GNNs is alleviated by the scattering behavior of the nonlinearity.
These findings are demonstrated empirically in a movie recommendation problem
and in a decentralized control task.]]></summary>

construct flexible high-dimensional densities. This formulation directly
contradicts the manifold hypothesis, which states that observed data lies on a

paper we investigate the pathologies of maximum-likelihood training in the
presence of this dimensionality mismatch. We formally prove that degenerate
optima are achieved wherein the manifold itself is learned but not the
distribution on it, a phenomenon we call manifold overfitting. We propose a
class of two-step procedures consisting of a dimensionality reduction step
followed by maximum-likelihood density estimation, and prove that they recover
the data-generating distribution in the nonparametric regime, thus avoiding
manifold overfitting. We also show that these procedures enable density
estimation on the manifolds learned by implicit models, such as generative
adversarial networks, hence addressing a major shortcoming of these models.

we want to deploy large, powerful models in production and/or edge devices. One
common technique used to achieve this goal is knowledge distillation.
Typically, the output of a static pre-defined teacher (a large base network) is
used as soft labels to train and transfer information to a student (or smaller)
network. In this paper, we introduce Adjoined Networks, or AN, a learning
paradigm that trains both the original base network and the smaller compressed
network together. In our training approach, the parameters of the smaller
network are shared across both the base and the compressed networks. Using our
training paradigm, we can simultaneously compress (the student network) and
regularize (the teacher network) any architecture. In this paper, we focus on
popular CNN-based architectures used for computer vision tasks. We conduct an
extensive experimental evaluation of our training paradigm on various
large-scale datasets. Using ResNet-50 as the base network, AN achieves 71.8%
top-1 accuracy with only 1.8M parameters and 1.6 GFLOPs on the ImageNet
data-set. We further propose Differentiable Adjoined Networks (DAN), a training
paradigm that augments AN by using neural architecture search to jointly learn
both the width and the weights for each layer of the smaller network. DAN
achieves ResNet-50 level accuracy on ImageNet with $3.8\times$ fewer parameters

low-dimensional encoding of the environment learned with a combination of
model-based and model-free objectives. Our approach uses intrinsic rewards that
are based on the distance of nearest neighbors in the low dimensional

rewards for sample-efficient exploration with planning routines in
representational space for hard exploration tasks with sparse rewards. One key
element of our approach is the use of information theoretic principles to shape
our representations in a way so that our novelty reward goes beyond pixel

inter/intra-subject variability of electroencephalography (EEG). The BCI
system, in general, necessitates a calibration technique to obtain
subject/session-specific data in order to tune the model each time the system
is utilized. This issue is acknowledged as a key hindrance to BCI, and a new
strategy based on domain generalization has recently evolved to address it. In
light of this, we've concentrated on developing an EEG classification framework
that can be applied directly to data from unknown domains (i.e. subjects),
using only data acquired from separate subjects previously. For this purpose,
in this paper, we proposed a framework that employs the open-set recognition
technique as an auxiliary task to learn subject-specific style features from
the source dataset while helping the shared feature extractor with mapping the
features of the unseen target dataset as a new unseen domain. Our aim is to
impose cross-instance style in-variance in the same domain and reduce the open
space risk on the potential unseen subject in order to improve the
generalization ability of the shared feature extractor. Our experiments showed
that using the domain information as an auxiliary network increases the
generalization performance.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this paper, we present a novel sensitivity-based filter pruning algorithm
(SbF-Pruner) to learn the importance scores of filters of each layer
end-to-end. Our method learns the scores from the filter weights, enabling it
to account for the correlations between the filters of each layer. Moreover, by
training the pruning scores of all layers simultaneously our method can account
for layer interdependencies, which is essential to find a performant sparse
sub-network. Our proposed method can train and generate a pruned network from
scratch in a straightforward, one-stage training process without requiring a
pretrained network. Ultimately, we do not need layer-specific hyperparameters
and pre-defined layer budgets, since SbF-Pruner can implicitly determine the
appropriate number of channels in each layer. Our experimental results on
different network architectures suggest that SbF-Pruner outperforms advanced
pruning methods. Notably, on CIFAR-10, without requiring a pretrained baseline
network, we obtain 1.02% and 1.19% accuracy gain on ResNet56 and ResNet110,
compared to the baseline reported for state-of-the-art pruning algorithms. This
is while SbF-Pruner reduces parameter-count by 52.3% (for ResNet56) and 54%

item representations. In practice, these representations are highly entangled
as they consist of information about multiple factors, including user's
interests, item attributes along with confounding factors such as user
conformity, and item popularity. Considering these entangled representations
for inferring user preference may lead to biased recommendations (e.g., when
the recommender model recommends popular items even if they do not align with
the user's interests).

Recent research proposes to debias by modeling a recommender system from a
causal perspective. The exposure and the ratings are analogous to the treatment
and the outcome in the causal inference framework, respectively. The critical
challenge in this setting is accounting for the hidden confounders. These
confounders are unobserved, making it hard to measure them. On the other hand,
since these confounders affect both the exposure and the ratings, it is
essential to account for them in generating debiased recommendations. To better
approximate hidden confounders, we propose to leverage network information
(i.e., user-social and user-item networks), which are shown to influence how
users discover and interact with an item. Aside from the user conformity,
aspects of confounding such as item popularity present in the network
information is also captured in our method with the aid of \textit{causal
disentanglement} which unravels the learned representations into independent
factors that are responsible for (a) modeling the exposure of an item to the
user, (b) predicting the ratings, and (c) controlling the hidden confounders.
Experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed
model for debiasing recommender systems.]]></summary>

Montanari and Richard to study the computational difficulty of estimating an
unknown parameter from higher-order moment tensors. Unlike its matrix
counterpart, Tensor PCA exhibits a statistical-computational gap, i.e., a
sample size regime where the problem is information-theoretically solvable but
conjectured to be computationally hard. This paper derives computational lower
bounds on the run-time of memory bounded algorithms for Tensor PCA using
communication complexity. These lower bounds specify a trade-off among the
number of passes through the data sample, the sample size, and the memory
required by any algorithm that successfully solves Tensor PCA. While the lower
bounds do not rule out polynomial-time algorithms, they do imply that many
commonly-used algorithms, such as gradient descent and power method, must have
a higher iteration count when the sample size is not large enough. Similar
lower bounds are obtained for Non-Gaussian Component Analysis, a family of
statistical estimation problems in which low-order moment tensors carry no
information about the unknown parameter. Finally, stronger lower bounds are
obtained for an asymmetric variant of Tensor PCA and related statistical
estimation problems. These results explain why many estimators for these
problems use a memory state that is significantly larger than the effective
dimensionality of the parameter of interest.]]></summary>

Solving this auxiliary task enables the model to learn the difference between

task.Deep learning is used to learn the mapping between image content and crowd
density distribution. Although great success has been achieved, some
pedestrians far away from the camera are difficult to be detected. And the
number of hard examples is often larger. Existing methods with simple Euclidean
distance algorithm indiscriminately optimize the hard and easy examples so that
the densities of hard examples are usually incorrectly predicted to be lower or
even zero, which results in large counting errors. To address this problem, we
are the first to propose the Hard Example Focusing(HEF) algorithm for the
regression task of crowd counting. The HEF algorithm makes our model rapidly
focus on hard examples by attenuating the contribution of easy examples.Then
higher importance will be given to the hard examples with wrong estimations.
Moreover, the scale variations in crowd scenes are large, and the scale
annotations are labor-intensive and expensive. By proposing a multi-Scale
Semantic Refining (SSR) strategy, lower layers of our model can break through
the limitation of deep learning to capture semantic features of different
scales to sufficiently deal with the scale variation. We perform extensive
experiments on six benchmark datasets to verify the proposed method. Results
indicate the superiority of our proposed method over the state-of-the-art
methods. Moreover, our designed model is smaller and faster.]]></summary>

known as branch-and-cut, forms the backbone of modern integer programming
solvers. These solvers are the foremost method for solving discrete

effectively is a major research topic in the theory and practice of integer
programming. We conduct a novel structural analysis of branch-and-cut that pins
down how every step of the algorithm is affected by changes in the parameters
defining the cutting planes added to the input integer program. Our main
application of this analysis is to derive sample complexity guarantees for
using machine learning to determine which cutting planes to apply during
branch-and-cut. These guarantees apply to infinite families of cutting planes,
such as the family of Gomory mixed integer cuts, which are responsible for the
main breakthrough speedups of integer programming solvers. We exploit geometric
and combinatorial structure of branch-and-cut in our analysis, which provides a
key missing piece for the recent generalization theory of branch-and-cut.]]></summary>

relations into dense continuous vector spaces such that knowledge contained in
a dataset could be consistently represented. Dense embeddings trained from KG
datasets benefit a variety of downstream tasks such as KG completion and link
prediction. However, existing KG embedding methods fell short to provide a
systematic solution for the global consistency of knowledge representation. We
developed a mathematical language for KG based on an observation of their
inherent algebraic structure, which we termed as Knowledgebra. By analyzing
five distinct algebraic properties, we proved that the semigroup is the most
reasonable algebraic structure for the relation embedding of a general
knowledge graph. We implemented an instantiation model, SemE, using simple
matrix semigroups, which exhibits state-of-the-art performance on standard
datasets. Moreover, we proposed a regularization-based method to integrate
chain-like logic rules derived from human knowledge into embedding training,
which further demonstrates the power of the developed language. As far as we
know, by applying abstract algebra in statistical learning, this work develops
the first formal language for general knowledge graphs, and also sheds light on
the problem of neural-symbolic integration from an algebraic perspective.]]></summary>

controlling the wearable robots while walking in complex environments. However,
human-robot interface signals are usually user-dependent, which causes that the
classifier trained on source subjects performs poorly on new subjects. To
address this issue, this paper designs the ensemble diverse hypotheses and
knowledge distillation (EDHKD) method to realize unsupervised cross-subject
adaptation. EDH mitigates the divergence between labeled data of source
subjects and unlabeled data of target subjects to accurately classify the
locomotion modes of target subjects without labeling data. Compared to previous
domain adaptation methods based on the single learner, which may only learn a
subset of features from input signals, EDH can learn diverse features by
incorporating multiple diverse feature generators and thus increases the
accuracy and decreases the variance of classifying target data, but it
sacrifices the efficiency. To solve this problem, EDHKD (student) distills the
knowledge from the EDH (teacher) to a single network to remain efficient and
accurate. The performance of the EDHKD is theoretically proved and
experimentally validated on a 2D moon dataset and two public human locomotion
datasets. Experimental results show that the EDHKD outperforms all other
methods. The EDHKD can classify target data with 96.9%, 94.4%, and 97.4%
average accuracy on the above three datasets with a short computing time (1
ms). Compared to a benchmark (BM) method, the EDHKD increases 1.3% and 7.1%
average accuracy for classifying the locomotion modes of target subjects. The
EDHKD also stabilizes the learning curves. Therefore, the EDHKD is significant
for increasing the generalization ability and efficiency of the human intent
prediction and human activity recognition system, which will improve
human-robot interactions.]]></summary>

challenging tasks via use of deep neural networks. Although using deep learning
for RL brings immense representational power, it also causes a well-known
sample-inefficiency problem. This means that the algorithms are data-hungry and
require millions of training samples to converge to an adequate policy. One way
to combat this issue is to use action advising in a teacher-student framework,
where a knowledgeable teacher provides action advice to help the student. This
work considers how to better leverage uncertainties about when a student should
ask for advice and if the student can model the teacher to ask for less advice.
The student could decide to ask for advice when it is uncertain or when both it
and its model of the teacher are uncertain. In addition to this investigation,
this paper introduces a new method to compute uncertainty for a deep RL agent
using a secondary neural network. Our empirical results show that using dual
uncertainties to drive advice collection and reuse may improve learning
performance across several Atari games.]]></summary>

among heterogeneous clients in multi-centric studies. Our method is expressed
through a hierarchical Bayesian latent variable model, where client-specific

variability across clients. We show that our framework can be effectively
optimized through expectation maximization (EM) over latent master's
distribution and clients' parameters. We also introduce formal differential
privacy (DP) guarantees compatibly with our EM optimization scheme. We tested
our method on the analysis of multi-modal medical imaging data and clinical
scores from distributed clinical datasets of patients affected by Alzheimer's
disease. We demonstrate that our method is robust when data is distributed
either in iid and non-iid manners, even when local parameters perturbation is
included to provide DP guarantees. Moreover, the variability of data, views and
centers can be quantified in an interpretable manner, while guaranteeing
high-quality data reconstruction as compared to state-of-the-art autoencoding

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crowd counting is a challenging problem due to the scene complexity and scale
variation. Although deep learning has achieved great improvement in crowd
counting, scene complexity affects the judgement of these methods and they
usually regard some objects as people mistakenly; causing potentially enormous
errors in the crowd counting result. To address the problem, we propose a novel
end-to-end model called Crowd Attention Convolutional Neural Network (CAT-CNN).
Our CAT-CNN can adaptively assess the importance of a human head at each pixel
location by automatically encoding a confidence map. With the guidance of the
confidence map, the position of human head in estimated density map gets more
attention to encode the final density map, which can avoid enormous
misjudgements effectively. The crowd count can be obtained by integrating the
final density map. To encode a highly refined density map, the total crowd
count of each image is classified in a designed classification task and we
first explicitly map the prior of the population-level category to feature
maps. To verify the efficiency of our proposed method, extensive experiments
are conducted on three highly challenging datasets. Results establish the
superiority of our method over many state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

is a well-studied method for making neural networks robust to potential
adversarial attacks during inference. However, the improved robustness does not
come for free but rather is accompanied by a decrease in overall model accuracy
and performance. Recent work has shown that, in practical robot learning
applications, the effects of adversarial training do not pose a fair trade-off
but inflict a net loss when measured in holistic robot performance. This work
revisits the robustness-accuracy trade-off in robot learning by systematically
analyzing if recent advances in robust training methods and theory in
conjunction with adversarial robot learning can make adversarial training
suitable for real-world robot applications. We evaluate a wide variety of robot
learning tasks ranging from autonomous driving in a high-fidelity environment
amenable to sim-to-real deployment, to mobile robot gesture recognition. Our
results demonstrate that, while these techniques make incremental improvements
on the trade-off on a relative scale, the negative side-effects caused by
adversarial training still outweigh the improvements by an order of magnitude.
We conclude that more substantial advances in robust learning methods are
necessary before they can benefit robot learning tasks in practice.]]></summary>

vision that has motivated extensive research into numerous methods spanning
from sophisticated meta-learning methods to simple transfer learning baselines.
We seek to push the limits of a simple-but-effective pipeline for more
realistic and practical settings of few-shot image classification. To this end,
we explore few-shot learning from the perspective of neural network
architecture, as well as a three stage pipeline of network updates under
different data supplies, where unsupervised external data is considered for
pre-training, base categories are used to simulate few-shot tasks for
meta-training, and the scarcely labelled data of an novel task is taken for
fine-tuning. We investigate questions such as: (1) How pre-training on external
data benefits FSL? (2) How state-of-the-art transformer architectures can be
exploited? and (3) How fine-tuning mitigates domain shift? Ultimately, we show
that a simple transformer-based pipeline yields surprisingly good performance
on standard benchmarks such as Mini-ImageNet, CIFAR-FS, CDFSL and Meta-Dataset.

image generation tasks. However, empirical results on previous research in
diffusion models imply that there is an inverse correlation on performances for
density estimation and sample generation. This paper analyzes that the inverse
correlation arises because density estimation is mostly contributed from small
diffusion time, whereas sample generation mainly depends on large diffusion
time. However, training score network on both small and large diffusion time is
demanding because of the loss imbalance issue. To successfully train the score
network on both small and large diffusion time, this paper introduces a
training technique, Soft Truncation, that softens the truncation time for every
mini-batch update, which is universally applicable to any types of diffusion
models. It turns out that Soft Truncation is equivalent to a diffusion model
with a general weight, and we prove the variational bound of the general
weighted diffusion model. In view of this variational bound, Soft Truncation
becomes a natural way to train the score network. In experiments, Soft
Truncation achieves the state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CelebA,
CelebA-HQ $256\times 256$, and STL-10 datasets.]]></summary>

and machine learning. Tree-boosting shows excellent prediction accuracy on many
data sets, but potential drawbacks are that it assumes conditional independence
of samples, produces discontinuous predictions for, e.g., spatial data, and it
can have difficulty with high-cardinality categorical variables. Latent
Gaussian models, such as Gaussian process and grouped random effects models,
are flexible prior models which explicitly model dependence among samples and
which allow for efficient learning of predictor functions and for making
probabilistic predictions. However, existing latent Gaussian models usually
assume either a zero or a linear prior mean function which can be an
unrealistic assumption. This article introduces a novel approach that combines
boosting and latent Gaussian models to remedy the above-mentioned drawbacks and
to leverage the advantages of both techniques. We obtain increased prediction
accuracy compared to existing approaches in both simulated and real-world data
experiments.]]></summary>

predict these aspects adaptively using meta-learning. Meta-learning here
considers two separate random forest regression models, built on 390
time-series features, to rank 22 univariate forecasting methods and recommend
ensemble size. The forecasting ensemble is consequently formed from methods
ranked as the best, and forecasts are pooled using either simple or weighted
average (with a weight corresponding to reciprocal rank). The proposed approach
was tested on 12561 micro-economic time-series (expanded to 38633 for various
forecasting horizons) of M4 competition where meta-learning outperformed Theta

Latent Dirichlet allocation describes a patient as a mixture of topics
corresponding to genetic variants. This can be generalized as a Bayesian tensor
decomposition to account for multiple feature variables. Our most significant
contributions are with hierarchical topic modeling. We design distinct methods
of incorporating hierarchical topic modeling, based on nested Chinese
restaurant processes and Pachinko Allocation Machine, into Bayesian tensor
decomposition. We apply these models to examine patients with one of four
common types of cancer (breast, lung, prostate, and colorectal) and siblings
with and without autism spectrum disorder. We linked the genes with their
biological pathways and combine this information into a tensor of patients,
counts of their genetic variants, and the genes' membership in pathways. We
find that our trained models outperform baseline models, with respect to

provides a strategy to train machine learning models while respecting users'
privacy. However, differential privacy can disproportionately degrade the
performance of the models on under-represented groups, as these parts of the
distribution are difficult to learn in the presence of noise. Existing
approaches for enforcing fairness in machine learning models have considered
the centralized setting, in which the algorithm has access to the users' data.
This paper introduces an algorithm to enforce group fairness in private
federated learning, where users' data does not leave their devices. First, the
paper extends the modified method of differential multipliers to empirical risk
minimization with fairness constraints, thus providing an algorithm to enforce
fairness in the central setting. Then, this algorithm is extended to the
private federated learning setting. The proposed algorithm, \texttt{FPFL}, is
tested on a federated version of the Adult dataset and an "unfair" version of
the FEMNIST dataset. The experiments on these datasets show how private
federated learning accentuates unfairness in the trained models, and how FPFL
is able to mitigate such unfairness.]]></summary>

custom, end-to-end training procedure for our Causal Transformer. Specifically,
we propose a novel counterfactual domain confusion loss to address confounding
bias: it aims to learn adversarial balanced representations, so that they are
predictive of the next outcome but non-predictive of the current treatment
assignment. We evaluate our Causal Transformer based on synthetic and
real-world datasets, where it achieves superior performance over current
baselines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work proposing

due to their versatile structure, simple recursive updating, ability to handle

time series are limited: Gaussian DLMs require continuous data, while
Poisson-based alternatives often lack sufficient modeling flexibility. We
introduce a novel semiparametric methodology for count time series by warping a
Gaussian DLM. The warping function has two components: a (nonparametric)
transformation operator that provides distributional flexibility and a rounding
operator that ensures the correct support for the discrete data-generating
process. We develop conjugate inference for the warped DLM, which enables
analytic and recursive updates for the state space filtering and smoothing
distributions. We leverage these results to produce customized and efficient
algorithms for inference and forecasting, including Monte Carlo simulation for
offline analysis and an optimal particle filter for online inference. This
framework unifies and extends a variety of discrete time series models and is
valid for natural counts, rounded values, and multivariate observations.
Simulation studies illustrate the excellent forecasting capabilities of the
warped DLM. The proposed approach is applied to a multivariate time series of
daily overdose counts and demonstrates both modeling and computational

holds a hidden state bit, either $0$ or $1$. A querying procedure returns for a
query set the sum of the states of the queried agents. The goal is to
reconstruct the states using as few queries as possible. In this paper we
consider two noise models for the pooled data problem. In the noisy channel
model, the result for each agent flips with a certain probability. In the noisy
query model, each query result is subject to random Gaussian noise. Our results
are twofold. First, we present and analyze for both error models a simple and
efficient distributed algorithm that reconstructs the initial states in a
greedy fashion. Our novel analysis pins down the range of error probabilities
and distributions for which our algorithm reconstructs the exact initial states
with high probability. Secondly, we present simulation results of our algorithm
and compare its performance with approximate message passing (AMP) algorithms
that are conjectured to be optimal in a number of related problems.]]></summary>

relevant for many applications (e.g., personalized medicine). Yet,
state-of-the-art methods build upon simple long short-term memory (LSTM)
networks, thus rendering inferences for complex, long-range dependencies
challenging. In this paper, we develop a novel Causal Transformer for
estimating counterfactual outcomes over time. Our model is specifically
designed to capture complex, long-range dependencies among time-varying
confounders. For this, we combine three transformer subnetworks with separate
inputs for time-varying covariates, previous treatments, and previous outcomes
into a joint network with in-between cross-attentions. We further develop a
custom, end-to-end training procedure for our Causal Transformer. Specifically,
we propose a novel counterfactual domain confusion loss to address confounding
bias: it aims to learn adversarial balanced representations, so that they are
predictive of the next outcome but non-predictive of the current treatment
assignment. We evaluate our Causal Transformer based on synthetic and
real-world datasets, where it achieves superior performance over current
baselines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work proposing
transformer-based architecture for estimating counterfactual outcomes from

comprising of long texts, there has been a rise in NLP benchmarks that measure
the accuracy of models that can handle longer input sequences. However, these
benchmarks do not consider the trade-offs between accuracy, speed, and power
consumption as input sizes or model sizes are varied. In this work, we perform
a systematic study of this accuracy vs. efficiency trade-off on two widely used
long-sequence models - Longformer-Encoder-Decoder (LED) and Big Bird - during
fine-tuning and inference on four datasets from the SCROLLS benchmark. To study
how this trade-off differs across hyperparameter settings, we compare the
models across four sequence lengths (1024, 2048, 3072, 4096) and two model
sizes (base and large) under a fixed resource budget. We find that LED
consistently achieves better accuracy at lower energy costs than Big Bird. For
summarization, we find that increasing model size is more energy efficient than
increasing sequence length for higher accuracy. However, this comes at the cost
of a large drop in inference speed. For question answering, we find that
smaller models are both more efficient and more accurate due to the larger
training batch sizes possible under a fixed resource budget.]]></summary>

research subject in many different fields. Brain signal processing and
especially electroencephalogram (EEG) has recently known a growing interest
both in academia and industry. One of the main examples is the increasing
number of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) aiming to link brains and computers.
In this paper, we present a novel framework allowing us to retrieve the
attention state, i.e degree of attention given to a specific task, from EEG
signals. While previous methods often consider the spatial relationship in EEG
through electrodes and process them in recurrent or convolutional based
architecture, we propose here to also exploit the spatial and temporal
information with a transformer-based network that has already shown its
supremacy in many machine-learning (ML) related studies, e.g. machine
translation. In addition to this novel architecture, an extensive study on the
feature extraction methods, frequential bands and temporal windows length has
also been carried out. The proposed network has been trained and validated on
two public datasets and achieves higher results compared to state-of-the-art
models. As well as proposing better results, the framework could be used in
real applications, e.g. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
symptoms or vigilance during a driving assessment.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are many important high dimensional function classes that have fast
agnostic learning algorithms when strong assumptions on the distribution of
examples can be made, such as Gaussianity or uniformity over the domain. But
how can one be sufficiently confident that the data indeed satisfies the
distributional assumption, so that one can trust in the output quality of the
agnostic learning algorithm? We propose a model by which to systematically
study the design of tester-learner pairs $(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{T})$, such that
if the distribution on examples in the data passes the tester $\mathcal{T}$
then one can safely trust the output of the agnostic learner $\mathcal{A}$ on
the data.

To demonstrate the power of the model, we apply it to the classical problem
of agnostically learning halfspaces under the standard Gaussian distribution
and present a tester-learner pair with a combined run-time of
$n^{\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^4)}$. This qualitatively matches that of the best
known ordinary agnostic learning algorithms for this task. In contrast, finite
sample Gaussian distribution testers do not exist for the $L_1$ and EMD
distance measures. A key step in the analysis is a novel characterization of
concentration and anti-concentration properties of a distribution whose
low-degree moments approximately match those of a Gaussian. We also use tools
from polynomial approximation theory.

In contrast, we show strong lower bounds on the combined run-times of
tester-learner pairs for the problems of agnostically learning convex sets
under the Gaussian distribution and for monotone Boolean functions under the
uniform distribution over $\{0,1\}^n$. Through these lower bounds we exhibit
natural problems where there is a dramatic gap between standard agnostic
learning run-time and the run-time of the best tester-learner pair.]]></summary>

item representations. In practice, these representations are highly entangled
as they consist of information about multiple factors, including user's
interests, item attributes along with confounding factors such as user
conformity, and item popularity. Considering these entangled representations
for inferring user preference may lead to biased recommendations (e.g., when
the recommender model recommends popular items even if they do not align with
the user's interests).

Recent research proposes to debias by modeling a recommender system from a
causal perspective. The exposure and the ratings are analogous to the treatment
and the outcome in the causal inference framework, respectively. The critical
challenge in this setting is accounting for the hidden confounders. These
confounders are unobserved, making it hard to measure them. On the other hand,
since these confounders affect both the exposure and the ratings, it is
essential to account for them in generating debiased recommendations. To better
approximate hidden confounders, we propose to leverage network information
(i.e., user-social and user-item networks), which are shown to influence how
users discover and interact with an item. Aside from the user conformity,
aspects of confounding such as item popularity present in the network
information is also captured in our method with the aid of \textit{causal
disentanglement} which unravels the learned representations into independent
factors that are responsible for (a) modeling the exposure of an item to the
user, (b) predicting the ratings, and (c) controlling the hidden confounders.
Experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed
model for debiasing recommender systems.]]></summary>

with around 30% forged signatures misclassified as genuine. Following fine-tune
transfer learning of robotic and generative data, adversarial attacks are
reduced below the model threshold by both robots and the GAN. It is observed
that tuning the model reduces the risk of attack by robots to 8% and 12%, and

evolution dynamics of materials, e.g., in spinodal decomposition of a two-phase
mixture. However, the accuracy of high-fidelity phase field models comes at a
substantial computational cost. Hence, fast and generalizable surrogate models
are needed to alleviate the cost in computationally taxing processes such as in
optimization and design of materials. The intrinsic discontinuous nature of the
physical phenomena incurred by the presence of sharp phase boundaries makes the
training of the surrogate model cumbersome. We develop a new framework that
integrates a convolutional autoencoder architecture with a deep neural operator
(DeepONet) to learn the dynamic evolution of a two-phase mixture. We utilize
the convolutional autoencoder to provide a compact representation of the
microstructure data in a low-dimensional latent space. DeepONet, which consists
of two sub-networks, one for encoding the input function at a fixed number of
sensors locations (branch net) and another for encoding the locations for the
output functions (trunk net), learns the mesoscale dynamics of the
microstructure evolution in the latent space. The decoder part of the
convolutional autoencoder can then reconstruct the time-evolved microstructure
from the DeepONet predictions. The result is an efficient and accurate
accelerated phase-field framework that outperforms other neural-network-based

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The success of deep learning attracted interest in whether the brain learns
hierarchical representations using gradient-based learning. However, current
biologically plausible methods for gradient-based credit assignment in deep
neural networks need infinitesimally small feedback signals, which is
problematic in biologically realistic noisy environments and at odds with
experimental evidence in neuroscience showing that top-down feedback can
significantly influence neural activity. Building upon deep feedback control
(DFC), a recently proposed credit assignment method, we combine strong feedback
influences on neural activity with gradient-based learning and show that this
naturally leads to a novel view on neural network optimization. Instead of
gradually changing the network weights towards configurations with low output
loss, weight updates gradually minimize the amount of feedback required from a
controller that drives the network to the supervised output label. Moreover, we
show that the use of strong feedback in DFC allows learning forward and
feedback connections simultaneously, using a learning rule fully local in space
and time. We complement our theoretical results with experiments on standard
computer-vision benchmarks, showing competitive performance to backpropagation
as well as robustness to noise. Overall, our work presents a fundamentally
novel view of learning as control minimization, while sidestepping biologically
unrealistic assumptions.]]></summary>

with the translation equivariance of convolutional neural networks being a
canonical example. Equivariances can be embedded in architectures through
weight-sharing and place symmetry constraints on the functions a neural network
can represent. The type of symmetry is typically fixed and has to be chosen in
advance. Although some tasks are inherently equivariant, many tasks do not
strictly follow such symmetries. In such cases, equivariance constraints can be
overly restrictive. In this work, we propose a parameter-efficient relaxation
of equivariance that can effectively interpolate between a (i) non-equivariant
linear product, (ii) a strict-equivariant convolution, and (iii) a
strictly-invariant mapping. The proposed parameterization can be thought of as
a building block to allow adjustable symmetry structure in neural networks.
Compared to non-equivariant or strict-equivariant baselines, we experimentally
verify that soft equivariance leads to improved performance in terms of test
accuracy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 image classification tasks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CP decomposition (CPD) is prevalent in chemometrics, signal processing, data
mining and many more fields. While many algorithms have been proposed to
compute the CPD, alternating least squares (ALS) remains one of the most widely
used algorithm for computing the decomposition. Recent works have introduced
the notion of eigenvalues and singular values of a tensor and explored
applications of eigenvectors and singular vectors in areas like signal
processing, data analytics and in various other fields. We introduce a new
formulation for deriving singular values and vectors of a tensor by considering
the critical points of a function different from what is used in the previous
work. Computing these critical points in an alternating manner motivates an
alternating optimization algorithm which corresponds to alternating least
squares algorithm in the matrix case. However, for tensors with order greater
than equal to $3$, it minimizes an objective function which is different from
the commonly used least squares loss. Alternating optimization of this new
objective leads to simple updates to the factor matrices with the same
asymptotic computational cost as ALS. We show that a subsweep of this algorithm
can achieve a superlinear convergence rate for exact CPD with known rank and
verify it experimentally. We then view the algorithm as optimizing a
Mahalanobis distance with respect to each factor with ground metric dependent
on the other factors. This perspective allows us to generalize our approach to
interpolate between updates corresponding to the ALS and the new algorithm to
manage the tradeoff between stability and fitness of the decomposition. Our
experimental results show that for approximating synthetic and real-world
tensors, this algorithm and its variants converge to a better conditioned
decomposition with comparable and sometimes better fitness as compared to the
ALS algorithm.]]></summary>

function of their microscopic structures, i.e., morphological configurations of
crystals and pores. This microstructural dependency has motivated vigorous
research in the EM community, seeking to engineer material microstructures with
targeted properties and performance under the materials-by-design paradigm.
However, establishing the complex structure-property-performance (SPP)
relationships of EMs demands extensive experimental and simulation efforts, and
assimilating and encapsulating these relationships in usable models is a
challenge. Here, we present a novel deep learning method, Physics-Aware
Recurrent Convolutional (PARC) Neural Network, that can "learn" the mesoscale
thermo-mechanics of EM microstructures during the shock-to-detonation
transition (SDT). We show that this new approach can produce accurate
high-fidelity predictions of time-evolving temperature and pressure fields of
the same quality as the state-of-the-art direct numerical simulations (DNS),
despite the dramatic reduction of computing time, from hours and days on a
high-performance computing cluster (HPC) to a little more than a second on a
commodity laptop. We also demonstrate that PARC can provide physical insights,
i.e., the artificial neurons can illuminate the underlying physics by
identifying which microstructural features led to critical hotspots and what
are the characteristics of "critical" versus "non-critical" microstructures.
This new knowledge generated alongside the capacity to conduct high-throughput
experiments will broaden our theoretical understanding of the initiation
mechanisms of EM detonation, as a step towards engineering EMs with specific
properties.]]></summary>

construct flexible high-dimensional densities. This formulation directly
contradicts the manifold hypothesis, which states that observed data lies on a
low-dimensional manifold embedded in high-dimensional ambient space. In this
paper we investigate the pathologies of maximum-likelihood training in the
presence of this dimensionality mismatch. We formally prove that degenerate
optima are achieved wherein the manifold itself is learned but not the
distribution on it, a phenomenon we call manifold overfitting. We propose a
class of two-step procedures consisting of a dimensionality reduction step
followed by maximum-likelihood density estimation, and prove that they recover
the data-generating distribution in the nonparametric regime, thus avoiding
manifold overfitting. We also show that these procedures enable density
estimation on the manifolds learned by implicit models, such as generative
adversarial networks, hence addressing a major shortcoming of these models.
Several recently proposed methods are instances of our two-step procedures; we
thus unify, extend, and theoretically justify a large class of models.]]></summary>

 Spoonfy is essentially the so-called Telenovela method (learning languages through subtitled video) on steroids: This demo uses a finetuned Facebook's M2M100 model to translate Spanish to English (finetuned to do literal translation instead of ordinary translation) and a wav2vec2 model to get Spanish word timings to present the literal (aka word-by-word) translations as karaoke-style lyrics.
 What sets Spoonfy apart from other solutions is the way it leverages the massive body of existing subtitled content out there to create learning material. Also because it's FOSS. More details in the code's README.
 I've been working on this project by myself for a few months now, I hope you see potential behind it like I do! If so (but also if not), I'd love to hear what you think. And I'd love to get your help improving on what I already built. I have plenty of ideas for how to make the translations even more accurate, the system more robust & able to handle more sources of content (YouTube, TikTok, Blu-Rays), etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, I decided to explore NeRF and found a very interesting dataset in the NeRS paper of 3D models, which was published in NeurIPS 2021 four months ago. Authors promised to release their dataset:
  
The filtered dataset with anonymized personally identifiable information (e.g. license plates and phone numbers), masks, initial camera poses, and optimized NeRS cameras will be made available on the project page.
  
However, if you check their project page or github repo — there is nothing there. I do not have much experience in machine learning, but wonder whether it's ok to do this? My thinking was that it is something to look down upon, but in this case it is done by Carnegie Mellon University (which is a top-tier one in ML?) on a top-tier conference (NeurIPS 2021). So I assume it's fine?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, everyone. I'm a relative novice in RL, so bear with me as I try to formulate my question.
 I'm working on a chess bot that can play moves like a player (imitate their style of play) that is chosen from a set of players (that the bot is trained on) , if I give the bot the previous x moves. Using more technical terms, I'm trying to create an agent that is given a sequence of states-actions of another agent (player) and some representation of who that agent (player) is, and predict the next action (continue playing in the style of that player).
 I'm fairly certain this is an RL problem, as I don't know how to frame it as a supervised learning problem (I might be wrong).
 I've seen some papers that abstract offline RL as a sequence modeling problem (Decision Transformer, Trajectory Transformer), so I'm fairly certain I should continue in a similar manner.
 But I'm having a hard time trying to understand how to treat the difference in players. My instinct was to use some representation of the player as the reward, but then how would I even optimize for it or even give it as an input? Do I just add the player as a feature in the game state, but then what should be the reward?
 Has this been done before, or something similar? I couldn't really find any paper or code that worked on differentiating the training data by who made it (I might not be wording it correctly).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I heard there are different ways to calculate Wasserstein distance in Neural network context. First, We can convert 1-d Wasserstein loss to dual representation and constraint it's size(to makes lipschitz function). We need to do weight clip to make our model a lipschitz function. Second, we can make neural network output as Gaussian distribution and calculate easy form using neural network output as mean and covariance matrix.
 So, what are the advantages and disadvantages of comparing them? It may sound ambiguous, but I have not seen a study that compares the two about representation quality, computation, etc...
 Thank you for reading.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All!
 I've been working on a linear method that extracts signals from images by learning a set of composable image filters. It can recompose an image using these filters as seen on this biological histology tissue (real on the right, recomposed on the left)
 ​
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/czgdk6edx0u81.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=8768f93a749fff7dc41e576a74403096e113942e
 ​
 Because it is a linear method that learns image filters - I had an idea: what if some components of a neural network could be replaced with a learnable set of filters?
 For those not in the know, image filters are similar to masks that upweight some parts of the image, and downweights other parts - similar to a highlighter to select text and a pen to cross out words. I show how in the figure below:
 ​
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/2azco14ex0u81.jpg?width=499&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3795fec06daa13da61ec155159a0ad865524530
 ​
 Learning a set of image filters with a neural network is a good idea, as neural networks are much more flexible and are considered to be "universal function approximations". So I wrote up a Pytorch package to pass the neural network feature weights from Convolutions and Max Pooling into the linear method to learn a relevant set of filters - results are comparable even on CIFAR10.
 The caveat is that there is no ReLU, no other activation functions, and no Dropout - only 1 main single linear layer that learns filters... an interpretable neural network!
 ​
 Results are all here (including ipynb comparing with base CNN and VGG16)
 https://github.com/AskExplain/Interpretable-Neural-Net
 ​
 I'll update the GitHub with some figures of why the single layer is interpretable soon ...
 ​
 In the meantime - discuss!

 - If you request to reassign a reviewer, can the new reviewer see the previous reviews/scores before submitting his own review? Or he would access to the previous revision after submitting his own review.
 I already know (have heard) that in many cases reviewers are not available, and it becomes inevitable to get an entirely new set of reviews. I already know this. But my questions are about the case that the reviewer availability is not an issue. Juts trying to find out how things are managed

 My understanding is really rudimentaly, feel free to correct me pls:
  
Data scientist, this should be the most fitting and easy-to-get-interview position. Difficulty level 1/5.
 Data analyist, same as 1. Difficulty level 1/5.
 Data engineer, same as 1. Difficulty level 1/5.
 Machine learning engineer, has a higher bar than 1, 2, and 3, and it's very difficult to get interviews without proper background and work experience. So it's very difficult to become one for a masters graduate in DS, but it's quite possible for DS/DE (but much less so for DA) to make into MLE positions. Difficulty level 3/5.
 Software engineer, it's totally another realm, and has very few skill overlap with 1, 2, and 3. So it's very hard to make the transition or land a SWE job for DS students. Difficulty level 5/5.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking for a book/monograph that goes through all the basics of reinforcement learning for continuous spaces with mathematical rigor. The classic RL book from Sutton/Barto and the new RL theory book from Agarwal/Jiang/Kakade/Sun both stick to finite MDPs except for special cases like linear MDPs and the LQR.
 I assume that a general statement of the fundamentals for continuous spaces will require grinding through a lot of details on existence, measurability, suprema vs. maxima, etc., that are not issues in the finite case. Is this why these authors avoid it?
 clarifying edit: I don't need to go all the way to continuous time - just state and action spaces.
 Maybe one of Bertsekas's books?

 Yesterday I posted a legitimate question about databases choices in r/MachineLearning. This was about what technical choices ML members are currently using for large scale data ingestion in a continual learning environment. The post was removed. That post was neither a (1) beginner nor (2) offensive and (3) aimed to be a constructive discussion suitable as mid-range ML query and (4) marked with appropriate flair I finally posted it elsewhere.
 Yet today I see questions about transitions between DS -> MLE and quirky labgroup names which can be used from ML terms. These aren't even research questions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Any reinforcement learning problem can be modeled as a sequential decision problem (SDP), which can always be modeled as a Markov decision process. An example of an SDP is a multiarmed bandit problem, where the state is the vector of beliefs about the performance of each arm (or beliefs about a continuous parametric model). Decisions are made by a policy, and there are four classes of policies. For some reason, the RL community tends to focus on just one of the four classes (UCB policies, which fall in the class of cost function approximations), but there are entire communities using each of the other three classes. See chapter 7 of my new book for a complete summary of the four classes for pure learning problems (aka bandit problems). See https://tinyurl.com/RLandSO/ Curious why Sutton and Barto (2nd edition) cover bandit problems in chapter 2, and then introduce MDPs in chapter 3. A bandit problem *is* an MDP!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I watched this old video by Microsoft Research: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psA4U6nhZ70 
 To summarize, it uses the fairness criteria that sensitive attribute A will give the same prediction regardless of the value, when using counterfactuals. That is, if you're male or female, it shouldn't influence the models predictions. 
 The idea seems decent at first glance. But what if the "bias" or "unfairness" that the model creates based on sensitive attribute A isn't caused by a dataset bias but rather detects a real signal in the data?
 The model proposed by Microsoft Research doesn't take into consideration that the prediction on the sensitive attribute A does not necessarily consist of ONLY unfairness. They simply define it as such. 
 Is such an algorithmic design choice not exactly one of the flaws that we seek to eliminate? Assuming, that not all of the imbalance in predictions by the model on the sensitive attribute A is caused by "unfairness" but that some of it is caused by an inherent difference, then are they not introducing direct human bias and unfairness into their model by explicitedly designing the system to fit their own human (and political) bias? 
 Don't get me wrong; the opposite is just as bad. Assuming that ALL of the imbalance in the prediction on the sensitive attribute A is caused by "inherent differences" is just as bad. 
 Do you know of anyone that has tackled this in a good manner? How would you even begin to estimate how much is due to an "inherent difference" and how much is due to "bias, unfairness, noise" (or otherwise)?

 Search engines work by building an index and then looking up things in it. Usually, that index is a separate data structure. In keyword search, we build and store reverse indices. In neural search, we build nearest-neighbor indices. This paper does something different: It directly trains a Transformer to return the ID of the most relevant document. No similarity search over embeddings or anything like this is performed, and no external data structure is needed, as the entire index is essentially captured by the model's weights. The paper experiments with various ways of representing documents and training the system, which works surprisingly well!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm currently learning about MDPs and machine learning. I have a few questions that might be trivial or obvious but I can't find many concrete answers online:
 -Are policy gradient and policy iteration similar/the same? From what I can gather, policy iteration is a type or subset of policy gradient algorithm, is this correct?
 -Are all policy learning methods less effective for large state spaces? From my understanding you need to use some kind of value function iteration and heursitic function for larger state spaces because you can't encounter all states enough times to converge on an optimal policy
 -Does convergence on a policy/value function find a local or global optimum? With neural nets, simple backpropagation may only find a local minimum for the cost function, is this true of MDP/RL iteration algorithms? 
 Thanks!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[LinkedIn research team has recently open-sourced feature store, Feathr, created to simplify machine learning (ML) feature management and increase developer productivity. Feathr is used by dozens of LinkedIn applications to define features, compute them for training, deploy them in production, and share them across consumers. Compared to previous application-specific feature pipeline solutions, Feathr users reported significantly reduced time required to add new features to model training and improved runtime performance.
 Hundreds of ML models run on LinkedIn in Search, Feed, and Ads applications. Thousands of features about entities in the Economic Graph, such as companies, job postings, and LinkedIn members, power the models. The most time-consuming aspects of handling the ML applications at scale have been preparing and managing features.

high-speed Internet. However, optical fibers, serving as the data transmission
medium providing connectivity to billons of users worldwide, are prone to a
variety of anomalies resulting from hard failures (e.g., fiber cuts) and
malicious physical attacks (e.g., optical eavesdropping (fiber tapping)) etc.
Such anomalies may cause network disruption and thereby inducing huge financial
and data losses, or compromise the confidentiality of optical networks by
gaining unauthorized access to the carried data, or gradually degrade the
network operations. Therefore, it is highly required to implement efficient
anomaly detection, diagnosis, and localization schemes for enhancing the
availability and reliability of optical networks. In this paper, we propose a
data driven approach to accurately and quickly detect, diagnose, and localize
fiber anomalies including fiber cuts, and optical eavesdropping attacks. The
proposed method combines an autoencoder-based anomaly detection and an
attention-based bidirectional gated recurrent unit algorithm, whereby the
former is used for fault detection and the latter is adopted for fault
diagnosis and localization once an anomaly is detected by the autoencoder. We
verify the efficiency of our proposed approach by experiments under various
anomaly scenarios using real operational data. The experimental results
demonstrate that: (i) the autoencoder detects any fiber fault or anomaly with
an F1 score of 96.86%; and (ii) the attention-based bidirectional gated
recurrent unit algorithm identifies the the detected anomalies with an average
accuracy of 98.2%, and localizes the faults with an average root mean square
error of 0.19 m.]]></summary>

two-player min-max (i.e, zero-sum) games. In this paper, we investigate the
behavior of no-regret learning in min-max games with dependent strategy sets,
where the strategy of the first player constrains the behavior of the second.
Such games are best understood as sequential, i.e., min-max Stackelberg, games.
We consider two settings, one in which only the first player chooses their
actions using a no-regret algorithm while the second player best responds, and
one in which both players use no-regret algorithms. For the former case, we
show that no-regret dynamics converge to a Stackelberg equilibrium. For the
latter case, we introduce a new type of regret, which we call Lagrangian
regret, and show that if both players minimize their Lagrangian regrets, then
play converges to a Stackelberg equilibrium. We then observe that online mirror
descent (OMD) dynamics in these two settings correspond respectively to a known
nested (i.e., sequential) gradient descent-ascent (GDA) algorithm and a new
simultaneous GDA-like algorithm, thereby establishing convergence of these
algorithms to Stackelberg equilibrium. Finally, we analyze the robustness of
OMD dynamics to perturbations by investigating online min-max Stackelberg
games. We prove that OMD dynamics are robust for a large class of online
min-max games with independent strategy sets. In the dependent case, we
demonstrate the robustness of OMD dynamics experimentally by simulating them in
online Fisher markets, a canonical example of a min-max Stackelberg game with
dependent strategy sets.]]></summary>

semantic classes in a classifier's training set is critical to practical
deployment of the model. This task is termed open-set recognition (OSR) and has
received significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we first
demonstrate that the ability of a classifier to make the 'none-of-above'
decision is highly correlated with its accuracy on the closed-set classes. We
find that this relationship holds across loss objectives and architectures, and
further demonstrate the trend both on the standard OSR benchmarks as well as on
a large-scale ImageNet evaluation. Second, we use this correlation to boost the
performance of a maximum logit score OSR 'baseline' by improving its closed-set
accuracy, and with this strong baseline achieve state-of-the-art on a number of
OSR benchmarks. Similarly, we boost the performance of the existing
state-of-the-art method by improving its closed-set accuracy, but the resulting
discrepancy with the strong baseline is marginal. Our third contribution is to
present the 'Semantic Shift Benchmark' (SSB), which better respects the task of
detecting semantic novelty, in contrast to other forms of distribution shift
also considered in related sub-fields, such as out-of-distribution detection.
On this new evaluation, we again demonstrate that there is negligible
difference between the strong baseline and the existing state-of-the-art.

forecasting and decision-based optimization. Traditionally, predictive models
are optimized independently from the final decision-based optimization problem.
In contrast, a `smart, predict then optimize' (SPO) framework optimizes
prediction models to explicitly minimize the final downstream decision loss. In
this paper we present dboost, a gradient boosting algorithm for training
prediction model ensembles to minimize decision regret. The dboost framework
supports any convex optimization program that can be cast as convex quadratic
cone program and gradient boosting is performed by implicit differentiation of
a custom fixed-point mapping. To our knowledge, the dboost framework is the
first general purpose implementation of gradient boosting to predict and
optimize problems. Experimental results comparing with state-of-the-art SPO
methods show that dboost can further reduce out-of-sample decision regret.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We introduce YOLO-pose, a novel heatmap-free approach for joint detection,
and 2D multi-person pose estimation in an image based on the popular YOLO
object detection framework. Existing heatmap based two-stage approaches are
sub-optimal as they are not end-to-end trainable and training relies on a
surrogate L1 loss that is not equivalent to maximizing the evaluation metric,
i.e. Object Keypoint Similarity (OKS). Our framework allows us to train the
model end-to-end and optimize the OKS metric itself. The proposed model learns
to jointly detect bounding boxes for multiple persons and their corresponding
2D poses in a single forward pass and thus bringing in the best of both
top-down and bottom-up approaches. Proposed approach doesn't require the
postprocessing of bottom-up approaches to group detected keypoints into a
skeleton as each bounding box has an associated pose, resulting in an inherent
grouping of the keypoints. Unlike top-down approaches, multiple forward passes
are done away with since all persons are localized along with their pose in a
single inference. YOLO-pose achieves new state-of-the-art results on COCO
validation (90.2% AP50) and test-dev set (90.3% AP50), surpassing all existing
bottom-up approaches in a single forward pass without flip test, multi-scale
testing, or any other test time augmentation. All experiments and results
reported in this paper are without any test time augmentation, unlike
traditional approaches that use flip-test and multi-scale testing to boost
performance. Our training codes will be made publicly available at

detection is usually the first step. Thus, it carries great weight in
determining the performance of people detection and people tracking. However,
many leg detectors ignore the inevitable noise and the multiscale
characteristics of the laser scan, which makes them sensitive to the unreliable
features of point cloud and further degrades the performance of the leg
detector. In this paper, we propose a multiscale adaptive-switch Random Forest
(MARF) to overcome these two challenges. Firstly, the adaptive-switch decision
tree is designed to use noisesensitive features to conduct weighted
classification and noiseinvariant features to conduct binary classification,
which makes our detector perform more robust to noise. Secondly, considering
the multiscale property that the sparsity of the 2D point cloud is proportional
to the length of laser beams, we design a multiscale random forest structure to
detect legs at different distances. Moreover, the proposed approach allows us
to discover a sparser human leg from point clouds than others. Consequently,
our method shows an improved performance compared to other state-of-the-art leg
detectors on the challenging Moving Legs dataset and retains the whole pipeline
at a speed of 60+ FPS on lowcomputational laptops. Moreover, we further apply
the proposed MARF to the people detection and tracking system, achieving a
considerable gain in all metrics.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vision Transformers (ViTs) take all the image patches as tokens and construct
multi-head self-attention (MHSA) among them. Complete leverage of these image
tokens brings redundant computations since not all the tokens are attentive in
MHSA. Examples include that tokens containing semantically meaningless or
distractive image backgrounds do not positively contribute to the ViT
predictions. In this work, we propose to reorganize image tokens during the
feed-forward process of ViT models, which is integrated into ViT during
training. For each forward inference, we identify the attentive image tokens
between MHSA and FFN (i.e., feed-forward network) modules, which is guided by
the corresponding class token attention. Then, we reorganize image tokens by
preserving attentive image tokens and fusing inattentive ones to expedite
subsequent MHSA and FFN computations. To this end, our method EViT improves
ViTs from two perspectives. First, under the same amount of input image tokens,
our method reduces MHSA and FFN computation for efficient inference. For
instance, the inference speed of DeiT-S is increased by 50% while its
recognition accuracy is decreased by only 0.3% for ImageNet classification.
Second, by maintaining the same computational cost, our method empowers ViTs to
take more image tokens as input for recognition accuracy improvement, where the
image tokens are from higher resolution images. An example is that we improve
the recognition accuracy of DeiT-S by 1% for ImageNet classification at the
same computational cost of a vanilla DeiT-S. Meanwhile, our method does not
introduce more parameters to ViTs. Experiments on the standard benchmarks show
the effectiveness of our method. The code is available at

features on the prediction fosters model explainability and delivers relevant
information about the dataset. While typical setups for feature importance
ranking assess input features individually, in this study, we go one step
further and rank the importance of groups of features, denoted as
feature-blocks. A feature-block can contain features of a specific type or
features derived from a particular source, which are presented to the neural
network in separate input branches (multiblock ANNs). This work presents three
methods pursuing distinct strategies to rank features in multiblock ANNs by
their importance: (1) a composite strategy building on individual feature
importance rankings, (2) a knock-in, and (3) a knock-out strategy. While the
composite strategy builds on state-of-the-art feature importance rankings,
knock-in and knock-out strategies evaluate the block as a whole via a mutual
information criterion. Our experiments consist of a simulation study validating
all three approaches, followed by a case study on two distinct real-world
datasets to compare the strategies. We conclude that each strategy has its

exclusively focusing on either (de-)anonymizing the graphs or understanding the
security and privacy issues of graph neural networks. Little attention has been
paid to understand the privacy risks of integrating the output from graph
embedding models (e.g., node embeddings) with complex downstream machine
learning pipelines. In this paper, we fill this gap and propose a novel
model-agnostic graph recovery attack that exploits the implicit graph
structural information preserved in the embeddings of graph nodes. We show that
an adversary can recover edges with decent accuracy by only gaining access to
the node embedding matrix of the original graph without interactions with the
node embedding models. We demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of
our graph recovery attack through extensive experiments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multiscale topology optimization (M-TO) entails generating an optimal global
topology, and an optimal set of microstructures at a smaller scale, for a
physics-constrained problem. With the advent of additive manufacturing, M-TO
has gained significant prominence. However, generating optimal microstructures
at various locations can be computationally very expensive. As an alternate,
graded multiscale topology optimization (GM-TO) has been proposed where one or
more pre-selected and graded (parameterized) microstructural topologies are
used to fill the domain optimally. This leads to a significant reduction in
computation while retaining many of the benefits of M-TO.

A successful GM-TO framework must: (1) be capable of efficiently handling
numerous pre-selected microstructures, (2) be able to continuously switch
between these microstructures during optimization, (3) ensure that the
partition of unity is satisfied, and (4) discourage microstructure mixing at
termination.

In this paper, we propose to meet these requirements by exploiting the unique
classification capacity of neural networks. Specifically, we propose a graded
multiscale topology optimization using neural-network (GM-TOuNN) framework with
the following features: (1) the number of design variables is only weakly
dependent on the number of pre-selected microstructures, (2) it guarantees
partition of unity while discouraging microstructure mixing, and (3) it
supports automatic differentiation, thereby eliminating manual sensitivity
analysis. The proposed framework is illustrated through several examples.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Purpose: (1) To assess the performance of geometric deep learning (PointNet)
in diagnosing glaucoma from a single optical coherence tomography (OCT) 3D scan
of the optic nerve head (ONH); (2) To compare its performance to that obtained
with a standard 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), and with a gold-standard
glaucoma parameter, i.e. retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness.

Methods: 3D raster scans of the ONH were acquired with Spectralis OCT for 477
glaucoma and 2,296 non-glaucoma subjects at the Singapore National Eye Centre.
All volumes were automatically segmented using deep learning to identify 7
major neural and connective tissues including the RNFL, the prelamina, and the
lamina cribrosa (LC). Each ONH was then represented as a 3D point cloud with
1,000 points chosen randomly from all tissue boundaries. To simplify the
problem, all ONH point clouds were aligned with respect to the plane and center
of Bruch's membrane opening. Geometric deep learning (PointNet) was then used
to provide a glaucoma diagnosis from a single OCT point cloud. The performance
of our approach was compared to that obtained with a 3D CNN, and with RNFL
thickness.

Results: PointNet was able to provide a robust glaucoma diagnosis solely from
the ONH represented as a 3D point cloud (AUC=95%). The performance of PointNet
was superior to that obtained with a standard 3D CNN (AUC=87%) and with that
obtained from RNFL thickness alone (AUC=80%).

Discussion: We provide a proof-of-principle for the application of geometric
deep learning in the field of glaucoma. Our technique requires significantly
less information as input to perform better than a 3D CNN, and with an AUC
superior to that obtained from RNFL thickness alone. Geometric deep learning
may have wide applicability in the field of Ophthalmology.]]></summary>

connectivity has become one of the most pervasive paradigms for neuroimaging
analysis. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) motivated from geometric deep
learning have attracted broad interest due to their established power for
modeling complex networked data. Despite their established performance in other
fields, there has not yet been a systematic study of how to design effective
GNNs for brain network analysis. To bridge this gap, we present BrainGB, a
benchmark for brain network analysis with GNNs. BrainGB standardizes the
process by 1) summarizing brain network construction pipelines for both
functional and structural neuroimaging modalities and 2) modularizing the
implementation of GNN designs. We conduct extensive experiments on datasets
across cohorts and modalities and recommend a set of general recipes for
effective GNN designs on brain networks. To support open and reproducible
research on GNN-based brain network analysis, we also host the BrainGB website
at https:// brainnet.us/ with models, tutorials, examples, as well as an
out-of-box Python package. We hope that this work will provide useful empirical

requires large amounts of training data to work effectively. Recent work has
attempted to address this issue by leveraging differentiable simulators.
However, inherent problems such as local minima and exploding/vanishing
numerical gradients prevent these methods from being generally applied to
control tasks with complex contact-rich dynamics, such as humanoid locomotion
in classical RL benchmarks. In this work we present a high-performance
differentiable simulator and a new policy learning algorithm (SHAC) that can
effectively leverage simulation gradients, even in the presence of
non-smoothness. Our learning algorithm alleviates problems with local minima
through a smooth critic function, avoids vanishing/exploding gradients through
a truncated learning window, and allows many physical environments to be run in
parallel. We evaluate our method on classical RL control tasks, and show
substantial improvements in sample efficiency and wall-clock time over
state-of-the-art RL and differentiable simulation-based algorithms. In
addition, we demonstrate the scalability of our method by applying it to the
challenging high-dimensional problem of muscle-actuated locomotion with a large
action space, achieving a greater than 17x reduction in training time over the
best-performing established RL algorithm.]]></summary>

domains, ranging from product reviews in retailing to nursing notes in
healthcare. To leverage this information, words are typically translated into
word embeddings -- vectors that encode the semantic relationships between words
-- through unsupervised learning algorithms such as matrix factorization.
However, learning word embeddings from new domains with limited training data
can be challenging, because the meaning/usage may be different in the new
domain, e.g., the word "positive" typically has positive sentiment, but often
has negative sentiment in medical notes since it may imply that a patient is
tested positive for a disease. Intuitively, we expect that only a small number
of domain-specific words may have new meanings/usages. We propose an intuitive
two-stage estimator that exploits this structure via a group-sparse penalty to
efficiently transfer learn domain-specific word embeddings by combining
large-scale text corpora (such as Wikipedia) with limited domain-specific text
data. We bound the generalization error of our estimator, proving that it can
achieve the same accuracy (compared to not transfer learning) with
substantially less domain-specific data when only a small number of embeddings
are altered between domains. Our results provide the first bounds on
group-sparse matrix factorization, which may be of independent interest. We
empirically evaluate the effectiveness of our approach compared to
state-of-the-art fine-tuning heuristics from natural language processing.]]></summary>

detection helps product owners and service providers to identify shortcomings

aspect by training supervised learning methods that fall short when aspects are

(1) deciding on an aspect amongst the set of aspects available for the product

chosen aspect from the set of all words available in a language. We employ
latent Dirichlet allocation to learn the latent aspects distributions for

network survivability, optical network operators need to detect and diagnose
faults in a timely manner and with high accuracy. With the rapid advancement of
telemetry technology and data analysis techniques, data-driven approaches
leveraging telemetry data to tackle the fault diagnosis problem have been
gaining popularity due to their quick implementation and deployment. In this
paper, we propose a novel multi-task learning model based on long short-term
memory (LSTM) to detect, locate, and estimate the reflectance of fiber
reflective faults (events) including the connectors and the mechanical splices
by extracting insights from monitored data obtained by the optical time domain
reflectometry (OTDR) principle commonly used for troubleshooting of fiber optic
cables or links. The experimental results prove that the proposed method: (i)
achieves a good detection capability and high localization accuracy within
short measurement time even for low SNR values; and (ii) outperforms
conventionally employed techniques.]]></summary>

show how linear, i.e., linearly activated recurrent neural networks (LRNNs) can
approximate any time-dependent function f(t) given by a number of function
values. The approximation can effectively be learned by simply solving a linear
equation system; no backpropagation or similar methods are needed. Furthermore,
the size of an LRNN can be reduced significantly in one step, after inspecting
the eigenvalues of the network transition matrix, by taking only the most
relevant components. Therefore, in contrast to others, we do not only learn
network weights but also the network architecture. LRNNs have interesting
properties: They end up in ellipse trajectories in the long run and allow the
prediction of further values and compact representations of functions. We
demonstrate this by several experiments, among them multiple superimposed
oscillators (MSO), robotic soccer, and predicting stock prices. LRNNs
outperform the previous state-of-the-art for the MSO task with a minimal number
of units.]]></summary>

have been applied very successfully to the prediction of the properties of
molecules and materials. First-order GNNs are well known to be incomplete,
i.e., there exist graphs that are distinct but appear identical when seen
through the lens of the GNN. More complicated schemes have thus been designed
to increase their resolving power. Applications to molecules (and more
generally, point clouds), however, add a geometric dimension to the problem.
The most straightforward and prevalent approach to construct graph
representation for molecules regards atoms as vertices in a graph and draws a
bond between each pair of atoms within a chosen cutoff. Bonds can be decorated
with the distance between atoms, and the resulting "distance graph NNs" (dGNN)
have empirically demonstrated excellent resolving power and are widely used in
chemical ML, with all known indistinguishable graphs being resolved in the
fully-connected limit. Here we show that even for the restricted case of
fully-connected graphs induced by 3D atom clouds dGNNs are not complete. We
construct pairs of distinct point clouds that generate graphs that, for any
cutoff radius, are equivalent based on a first-order Weisfeiler-Lehman test.
This class of degenerate structures includes chemically-plausible
configurations, setting an ultimate limit to the expressive power of some of
the well-established GNN architectures for atomistic machine learning. Models
that explicitly use angular or directional information in the description of
atomic environments can resolve these degeneracies.]]></summary>

models may obtain high performance even when using irrelevant features, by
exploiting biases in the training set. Such undesirable situations can
potentially be detected by using interpretability methods. Recently, many
methods have been proposed to interpret neural networks. However, this domain
is not mature yet. Machine learning users face two major issues when aiming to

detailed monitoring logs from the MIT Supercloud cluster. This dataset includes
CPU and GPU usage by jobs, memory usage, and file system logs. In this paper,
we present a workload classification challenge based on this dataset. We
introduce a labelled dataset that can be used to develop new approaches to
workload classification and present initial results based on existing

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Understanding and controlling latent representations in deep generative
models is a challenging yet important problem for analyzing, transforming and
generating various types of data. In speech processing, inspiring from the
anatomical mechanisms of phonation, the source-filter model considers that
speech signals are produced from a few independent and physically meaningful
continuous latent factors, among which the fundamental frequency $f_0$ and the
formants are of primary importance. In this work, we show that the
source-filter model of speech production naturally arises in the latent space
of a variational autoencoder (VAE) trained in an unsupervised manner on a
dataset of natural speech signals. Using only a few seconds of labeled speech
signals generated with an artificial speech synthesizer, we experimentally
illustrate that $f_0$ and the formant frequencies are encoded in orthogonal
subspaces of the VAE latent space and we develop a weakly-supervised method to
accurately and independently control these speech factors of variation within
the learned latent subspaces. Without requiring additional information such as
text or human-labeled data, this results in a deep generative model of speech
spectrograms that is conditioned on $f_0$ and the formant frequencies, and
which is applied to the transformation of speech signals.]]></summary>

Protein language models trained on multiple sequence alignments, such as MSA
Transformer, are highly attractive candidates to this end. We propose and test
an iterative method that directly uses the masked language modeling objective
to generate sequences using MSA Transformer. We demonstrate that the resulting
sequences generally score better than those generated by Potts models, and even
than natural sequences, for homology, coevolution and structure-based measures.
Moreover, MSA Transformer better reproduces the higher-order statistics and the
distribution of sequences in sequence space of natural data than Potts models,
although Potts models better reproduce first- and second-order statistics. MSA

cost across the columns. However, in many real-life scenarios, we could expect

low computing resources at IoT devices and high communication costs for

very limited. In this work, we develop a novel compression scheme for FL,

networks. HCFL can reduce the data load for FL processes without changing their
structure and hyperparameters. In this way, we not only can significantly
reduce communication costs, but also make intensive learning processes more
adaptable on low-computing resource IoT devices. Furthermore, we investigate a
relationship between the number of IoT devices and the convergence level of the
FL model and thereby better assess the quality of the FL process. We
demonstrate our HCFL scheme in both simulations and mathematical analyses. Our
proposed theoretical research can be used as a minimum level of satisfaction,
proving that the FL process can achieve good performance when a determined
configuration is met. Therefore, we show that HCFL is applicable in any
FL-integrated networks with numerous IoT devices.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this paper we analyze the effect of a policy recommendation on the
performances of an artificial interbank market. Financial institutions
stipulate lending agreements following a public recommendation and their
individual information. The former, modeled by a reinforcement learning optimal
policy trying to maximize the long term fitness of the system, gathers
information on the economic environment and directs economic actors to create
credit relationships based on the optimal choice between a low interest rate or
high liquidity supply. The latter, based on the agents' balance sheet, allows
to determine the liquidity supply and interest rate that the banks optimally
offer on the market. Based on the combination between the public and the
private signal, financial institutions create or cut their credit connections
over time via a preferential attachment evolving procedure able to generate a
dynamic network. Our results show that the emergence of a core-periphery
interbank network, combined with a certain level of homogeneity on the size of
lenders and borrowers, are essential features to ensure the resilience of the
system. Moreover, the reinforcement learning optimal policy recommendation
plays a crucial role in mitigating systemic risk with respect to alternative
policy instruments.]]></summary>

classification has attracted increasing attention to address the data imbalance
problem by distinguishing the samples of the minority class from the majority
class. Previous methods generally aim to either learn a new feature space to
map training samples together or to fit training samples by autoencoder-like
models. These methods mainly focus on capturing either compact or descriptive
features, where the information of the samples of a given one class is not
sufficiently utilized. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based
method to learn compact features by adding constraints on the bottleneck
features, and to preserve descriptive features by training an autoencoder at
the same time. Through jointly optimizing the constraining loss and the
autoencoder's reconstruction loss, our method can learn more relevant features
associated with the given class, making the majority and minority samples more
distinguishable. Experimental results on three clinical datasets (including the
MRI breast images, FFDM breast images and chest X-ray images) obtains
state-of-art performance compared to previous methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To improve predictive models for STEM applications, supplemental
physics-based features computed from input parameters are introduced into
single and multiple layers of a deep neural network (DNN). While many studies
focus on informing DNNs with physics through differential equations or
numerical simulation, much may be gained through integration of simplified
relationships. To evaluate this hypothesis, a number of thin rectangular plates
simply-supported on all edges are simulated for five materials. With plate
dimensions and material properties as input features and fundamental natural
frequency as the sole output, predictive performance of a purely data-driven
DNN-based model is compared with models using additional inputs computed from
simplified physical relationships among baseline parameters, namely plate
weight, modulus of rigidity, and shear modulus. To better understand the
benefit to model accuracy, these additional features are injected into various
single and multiple DNN layers, and trained with four different dataset sizes.
When these physics-enhanced models are evaluated against independent data of
the same materials and similar dimensions to the training sets, supplementation
with simplified physics-based parameters provides little reduction in
prediction error over the baseline for models trained with dataset sizes of 60
and greater, although small improvement from 19.3% to 16.1% occurs when trained
with a sparse size of 30. Conversely, notable accuracy gains occur when the
independent test data is of material and dimensions not conforming to the
training set. Specifically, when physics-enhanced data is injected into
multiple DNN layers, reductions in error from 33.2% to 19.6%, 34.9% to 19.9%,
35.8% to 22.4%, and 43.0% to 28.4% are achieved for training dataset sizes of
261, 117, 60, and 30, respectively, demonstrating attainment of a degree of

self-supervised method that learns to Canonicalize the 3D orientation and

translation-invariant 3D networks. During inference, our method takes an unseen
full or partial 3D point cloud at an arbitrary pose and outputs an equivariant
canonical pose. During training, this network uses self-supervision losses to
learn the canonical pose from an un-canonicalized collection of full and
partial 3D point clouds. ConDor can also learn to consistently co-segment
object parts without any supervision. Extensive quantitative results on four
new metrics show that our approach outperforms existing methods while enabling

conditioning of the linear system used in random feature regression problems
and are thus connected to the consistency and generalization of random feature
models. Random feature matrices are asymmetric rectangular nonlinear matrices
depending on two input variables, the data and the weights, which can make
their characterization challenging. We consider two settings for the two input
variables, either both are random variables or one is a random variable and the
other is well-separated, i.e. there is a minimum distance between points. With
conditions on the dimension, the complexity ratio, and the sampling variance,
we show that the singular values of these matrices concentrate near their full
expectation and near one with high-probability. In particular, since the
dimension depends only on the logarithm of the number of random weights or the
number of data points, our complexity bounds can be achieved even in moderate
dimensions for many practical setting. The theoretical results are verified
with numerical experiments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The research paper addresses linear decomposition of time series of
non-additive metrics that allows for the identification and interpretation of
contributing factors (input features) of variance. Non-additive metrics, such
as ratios, are widely used in a variety of domains. It commonly requires
preceding aggregations of underlying variables that are used to calculate the
metric of interest. The latest poses a dimensionality challenge when the input
features and underlying variables are formed as two-dimensional arrays along
elements, such as account or customer identifications, and time points. It
rules out direct modeling of the time series of a non-additive metric as a
function of input features. The article discusses a five-step approach: (1)
segmentations of input features and the underlying variables of the metric that
are supported by unsupervised autoencoders, (2) univariate or joint fittings of
the metric by the aggregated input features on the segmented domains, (3)
transformations of pre-screened input features according to the fitted models,
(4) aggregation of the transformed features as time series, and (5) modelling
of the metric time series as a sum of constrained linear effects of the
aggregated features. Alternatively, approximation by numerical differentiation
has been considered to linearize the metric. It allows for element level
univariate or joint modeling of step (2). The process of these analytical steps
allows for a backward-looking explanatory decomposition of the metric as a sum
of time series of the survived input features. The paper includes a synthetic
example that studies loss-to-balance monthly rates of a hypothetical retail
credit portfolio. To validate that no latent factors other than the survived
input features have significant impacts on the metric, Statistical Process
Control has been introduced for the residual time series.]]></summary>

algorithmic fairness, and domain adaptation, desire explicit control over
semantic information being discarded. This goal is formulated as satisfying two
objectives: maximizing utility for predicting a target attribute while
simultaneously being independent or invariant with respect to a known semantic
attribute. Solutions to such problems lead to trade-offs between the two
objectives when they are competing with each other. While existing works study
bounds on these trade-offs, three questions still remain outstanding:
\emph{What are the exact fundamental trade-offs between utility and
invariance?}, 2) \emph{What is the optimal dimensionality of the
representation?}, and 3) \emph{What are the encoders (mapping data to a
representation) that achieve the exact fundamental trade-offs and how can we
estimate them from data?} This paper addresses these questions. We adopt a
functional analysis perspective and derive closed-form solutions for the global
optima of the underlying optimization problems under mild assumptions, which in
turn yields closed formulae for the exact trade-offs, optimal representation
dimensionality, and the corresponding encoders. We also numerically quantify
the trade-offs on representative problems and compare them to those achieved by
baseline invariant representation learning algorithms.]]></summary>

frameworks treat them discretely in time. In this work, we think of videos of
what they should be $-$ time-continuous signals, and extend the paradigm of
neural representations to build a continuous-time video generator. For this, we
first design continuous motion representations through the lens of positional
embeddings. Then, we explore the question of training on very sparse videos and
demonstrate that a good generator can be learned by using as few as 2 frames
per clip. After that, we rethink the traditional image + video discriminators
pair and design a holistic discriminator that aggregates temporal information
by simply concatenating frames' features. This decreases the training cost and
provides richer learning signal to the generator, making it possible to train
directly on 1024$^2$ videos for the first time. We build our model on top of
StyleGAN2 and it is just ${\approx}5\%$ more expensive to train at the same
resolution while achieving almost the same image quality. Moreover, our latent
space features similar properties, enabling spatial manipulations that our
method can propagate in time. We can generate arbitrarily long videos at
arbitrary high frame rate, while prior work struggles to generate even 64
frames at a fixed rate. Our model is tested on four modern 256$^2$ and one
1024$^2$-resolution video synthesis benchmarks. In terms of sheer metrics, it
performs on average ${\approx}30\%$ better than the closest runner-up. Project

$\mathbb{P}$ more effectively than i.i.d. sampling or standard thinning. Given
a suitable reproducing kernel $\mathbf{k}$ and $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ time, kernel
thinning compresses an $n$-point approximation to $\mathbb{P}$ into a
$\sqrt{n}$-point approximation with comparable worst-case integration error
across the associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space. With high probability,
the maximum discrepancy in integration error is
$\mathcal{O}_d(n^{-1/2}\sqrt{\log n})$ for compactly supported $\mathbb{P}$ and
$\mathcal{O}_d(n^{-\frac{1}{2}} (\log n)^{(d+1)/2}\sqrt{\log\log n})$ for
sub-exponential $\mathbb{P}$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$. In contrast, an equal-sized
i.i.d. sample from $\mathbb{P}$ suffers $\Omega(n^{-1/4})$ integration error.
Our sub-exponential guarantees resemble the classical quasi-Monte Carlo error
rates for uniform $\mathbb{P}$ on $[0,1]^d$ but apply to general distributions
on $\mathbb{R}^d$ and a wide range of common kernels. We use our results to
derive explicit non-asymptotic maximum mean discrepancy bounds for Gaussian,
Mat\'ern, and B-spline kernels and present two vignettes illustrating the
practical benefits of kernel thinning over i.i.d. sampling and standard Markov

prediction would substantially improve their lives. In this work, based on
scalp EEG and its transformation into images, the likelihood of an epileptic
seizure occurring at any moment is computed using an average of the softmax
layer output (the likelihood) of a CNN, instead of the output of the
classification layer. Results show that by analyzing the likelihood and
thresholding it, prediction has higher sensitivity or a lower FPR/h. The best
threshold for the likelihood was higher than 50% for 5 patients, and was lower
for the remaining 36. However, more testing is needed, especially in new

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spectral geometric methods have brought revolutionary changes to the field of
geometry processing. Of particular interest is the study of the Laplacian
spectrum as a compact, isometry and permutation-invariant representation of a
shape. Some recent works show how the intrinsic geometry of a full shape can be
recovered from its spectrum, but there are approaches that consider the more
challenging problem of recovering the geometry from the spectral information of
partial shapes. In this paper, we propose a possible way to fill this gap. We
introduce a learning-based method to estimate the Laplacian spectrum of the
union of partial non-rigid 3D shapes, without actually computing the 3D
geometry of the union or any correspondence between those partial shapes. We do
so by operating purely in the spectral domain and by defining the union
operation between short sequences of eigenvalues. We show that the approximated
union spectrum can be used as-is to reconstruct the complete geometry [MRC*19],
perform region localization on a template [RTO*19] and retrieve shapes from a
database, generalizing ShapeDNA [RWP06] to work with partialities. Working with
eigenvalues allows us to deal with unknown correspondence, different sampling,
and different discretizations (point clouds and meshes alike), making this
operation especially robust and general. Our approach is data-driven and can
generalize to isometric and non-isometric deformations of the surface, as long
as these stay within the same semantic class (e.g., human bodies or horses), as
well as to partiality artifacts not seen at training time.]]></summary>

significance in the context of medical imaging. For instance, in laparoscopic
surgery, the acquired video data suffers from different kinds of distortion
that not only hinder surgery performance but also affect the execution of
subsequent tasks in surgical navigation and robotic surgeries. For this reason,
we propose in this paper neural network-based approaches for distortion
classification as well as quality prediction. More precisely, a Residual
Network (ResNet) based approach is firstly developed for simultaneous ranking
and classification task. Then, this architecture is extended to make it
appropriate for the quality prediction task by using an additional Fully
Connected Neural Network (FCNN). To train the overall architecture (ResNet and
FCNN models), transfer learning and end-to-end learning approaches are
investigated. Experimental results, carried out on a new laparoscopic video

learn task-specific features from data. Due to this data-driven nature, they
have achieved remarkable success in various areas. However, manual design and
selection of suitable network architectures are time-consuming and require
substantial effort of human experts. To address this problem, researchers have
proposed neural architecture search (NAS) algorithms which can automatically
generate network architectures but suffer from heavy computational cost and
instability if searching from scratch. In this paper, we propose a hybrid NAS
framework for ultrasound (US) image classification and segmentation. The hybrid
framework consists of a pre-trained backbone and several searched cells (i.e.,
network building blocks), which takes advantage of the strengths of both NAS
and the expert knowledge from existing convolutional neural networks.
Specifically, two effective and lightweight operations, a mixed depth-wise
convolution operator and a squeeze-and-excitation block, are introduced into
the candidate operations to enhance the variety and capacity of the searched
cells. These two operations not only decrease model parameters but also boost
network performance. Moreover, we propose a re-aggregation strategy for the
searched cells, aiming to further improve the performance for different vision
tasks. We tested our method on two large US image datasets, including a 9-class
echinococcosis dataset containing 9566 images for classification and an ovary
dataset containing 3204 images for segmentation. Ablation experiments and
comparison with other handcrafted or automatically searched architectures
demonstrate that our method can generate more powerful and lightweight models
for the above US image classification and segmentation tasks.]]></summary>

However, this strongly limits the use of these models inside audio generation
setups, as most creative workflows are based on real-time digital signal
processing. Although approaches based on recurrent networks can be naturally
adapted to this buffer-based computation, the use of convolutions still poses
some serious challenges. To tackle this issue, the use of causal streaming
convolutions have been proposed. However, this requires specific complexified
training and can impact the resulting audio quality.

In this paper, we introduce a new method allowing to produce non-causal
streaming models. This allows to make any convolutional model compatible with
real-time buffer-based processing. As our method is based on a post-training
reconfiguration of the model, we show that it is able to transform models
trained without causal constraints into a streaming model. We show how our
method can be adapted to fit complex architectures with parallel branches. To
evaluate our method, we apply it on the recent RAVE model, which provides
high-quality real-time audio synthesis. We test our approach on multiple music
and speech datasets and show that it is faster than overlap-add methods, while
having no impact on the generation quality. Finally, we introduce two
open-source implementation of our work as Max/MSP and PureData externals, and
as a VST audio plugin. This allows to endow traditional digital audio

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Purpose: The optic nerve head (ONH) undergoes complex and deep 3D
morphological changes during the development and progression of glaucoma.
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is the current gold standard to visualize
and quantify these changes, however the resulting 3D deep-tissue information
has not yet been fully exploited for the diagnosis and prognosis of glaucoma.
To this end, we aimed: (1) To compare the performance of two relatively recent
geometric deep learning techniques in diagnosing glaucoma from a single OCT
scan of the ONH; and (2) To identify the 3D structural features of the ONH that
are critical for the diagnosis of glaucoma.

Methods: In this study, we included a total of 2,247 non-glaucoma and 2,259
glaucoma scans from 1,725 subjects. All subjects had their ONHs imaged in 3D
with Spectralis OCT. All OCT scans were automatically segmented using deep
learning to identify major neural and connective tissues. Each ONH was then
represented as a 3D point cloud. We used PointNet and dynamic graph
convolutional neural network (DGCNN) to diagnose glaucoma from such 3D ONH
point clouds and to identify the critical 3D structural features of the ONH for
glaucoma diagnosis.

Results: Both the DGCNN (AUC: 0.97$\pm$0.01) and PointNet (AUC:
0.95$\pm$0.02) were able to accurately detect glaucoma from 3D ONH point
clouds. The critical points formed an hourglass pattern with most of them
located in the inferior and superior quadrant of the ONH.

Discussion: The diagnostic accuracy of both geometric deep learning
approaches was excellent. Moreover, we were able to identify the critical 3D
structural features of the ONH for glaucoma diagnosis that tremendously
improved the transparency and interpretability of our method. Consequently, our
approach may have strong potential to be used in clinical applications for the
diagnosis and prognosis of a wide range of ophthalmic disorders.]]></summary>

data-driven approach. Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is utilized
as a data-driven technique to forecast this parameter at Tabriz in East
Azerbaijan. Various input patterns, namely T min, T max, and T mean, are
utilized for training the architecture whilst DPT is the model's output. The
findings indicate that, in general, ANFIS method is capable of identifying data
patterns with a high degree of accuracy. However, the approach demonstrates
that processing time and computer resources may substantially increase by
adding additional functions. Based on the results, the number of iterations and
computing resources might change dramatically if new functionalities are
included. As a result, tuning parameters have to be optimized inside the method
framework. The findings demonstrate a high agreement between results by the
data-driven technique (machine learning method) and the observed data. Using
this prediction toolkit, DPT can be adequately forecasted solely based on the
temperature distribution of Tabriz. This kind of modeling is extremely
promising for predicting DPT at various sites. Besides, this study thoroughly
compares the Bilayered Neural Network (BNN) and ANFIS models on various scales.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Semantic parsing (SP) is a core component of modern virtual assistants like
Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. While sequence-to-sequence-based
auto-regressive (AR) approaches are common for conversational semantic parsing,
recent studies employ non-autoregressive (NAR) decoders and reduce inference
latency while maintaining competitive parsing quality. However, a major
drawback of NAR decoders is the difficulty of generating top-k (i.e., k-best)
outputs with approaches such as beam search. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel NAR semantic parser that introduces intent conditioning on the
decoder. Inspired by the traditional intent and slot tagging parsers, we
decouple the top-level intent prediction from the rest of a parse. As the
top-level intent largely governs the syntax and semantics of a parse, the
intent conditioning allows the model to better control beam search and improves
the quality and diversity of top-k outputs. We introduce a hybrid
teacher-forcing approach to avoid training and inference mismatch. We evaluate
the proposed NAR on conversational SP datasets, TOP & TOPv2. Like the existing
NAR models, we maintain the O(1) decoding time complexity while generating more
diverse outputs and improving the top-3 exact match (EM) by 2.4 points. In
comparison with AR models, our model speeds up beam search inference by 6.7
times on CPU with competitive top-k EM.]]></summary>

characterizing landscapes of single-objective continuous optimization problems.
Landscape insights are crucial both for problem understanding as well as for
assessing benchmark set diversity and composition. Despite the irrefutable
usefulness of these features, they suffer from their own ailments and
downsides. Hence, in this work we provide a collection of different approaches
to characterize optimization landscapes. Similar to conventional landscape
features, we require a small initial sample. However, instead of computing
features based on that sample, we develop alternative representations of the
original sample. These range from point clouds to 2D images and, therefore, are
entirely feature-free. We demonstrate and validate our devised methods on the
BBOB testbed and predict, with the help of Deep Learning, the high-level,
expert-based landscape properties such as the degree of multimodality and the
existence of funnel structures. The quality of our approaches is on par with
methods relying on the traditional landscape features. Thereby, we provide an
exciting new perspective on every research area which utilizes problem
information such as problem understanding and algorithm design as well as
automated algorithm configuration and selection.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is a rigorous framework that borrows
techniques from geometric and algebraic topology, category theory, and
combinatorics in order to study the "shape" of such complex high-dimensional
data. Research in this area has grown significantly over the last several years
bringing a deeply rooted theory to bear on practical applications in areas such
as genomics, natural language processing, medicine, cybersecurity, energy, and
climate change. Within some of these areas, TDA has also been used to augment
AI and ML techniques.

We believe there is further utility to be gained in this space that can be
facilitated by a workshop bringing together experts (both theorists and
practitioners) and non-experts. Currently there is an active community of pure
mathematicians with research interests in developing and exploring the
theoretical and computational aspects of TDA. Applied mathematicians and other
practitioners are also present in community but do not represent a majority.
This speaks to the primary aim of this workshop which is to grow a wider
community of interest in TDA. By fostering meaningful exchanges between these
groups, from across the government, academia, and industry, we hope to create
new synergies that can only come through building a mutual comprehensive
awareness of the problem and solution spaces.]]></summary>

supervision - automatic annotation of data samples via a predefined set of
labeling functions (LFs), rule-based mechanisms that generate potentially

weak supervision based on the principle of k-fold cross-validation. In
particular, we extend two frameworks for detecting the erroneous samples in
manually annotated data to the weakly supervised setting. Our methods profit
from leveraging the information about matching LFs and detect noisy samples
more accurately. We also introduce a new algorithm for denoising the weakly
annotated data called ULF, that refines the allocation of LFs to classes by
estimating the reliable LFs-to-classes joint matrix. Evaluation on several
datasets shows that ULF successfully improves weakly supervised learning
without using any manually labeled data.]]></summary>

leveraging advances in text-to-speech models based on deep neural networks. One
of the main issues in training singing voice synthesis models is that they
require melody and lyric labels to be temporally aligned with audio data. The
temporal alignment is a time-exhausting manual work in preparing for the
training data. To address the issue, we propose a melody-unsupervision model
that requires only audio-and-lyrics pairs without temporal alignment in
training time but generates singing voice audio given a melody and lyrics input
in inference time. The proposed model is composed of a phoneme classifier and a
singing voice generator jointly trained in an end-to-end manner. The model can
be fine-tuned by adjusting the amount of supervision with temporally aligned
melody labels. Through experiments in melody-unsupervision and semi-supervision
settings, we compare the audio quality of synthesized singing voice. We also
show that the proposed model is capable of being trained with speech audio and

show that applying CSS only to the time-variant features and encouraging a
gradual transition on them between nearby and away frames while also
reconstructing the input, extract rich temporal features into the time-variant
component, well-suited for human pose estimation. Our approach reduces error by
about 50\% compared to the standard CSS strategies, outperforms other

using data with missing values. Even though there are a number of fairness
intervention methods in the literature, most of them require a complete

missing patterns can depend on group attributes (e.g. gender or race). Simply
applying off-the-shelf fair learning algorithms to an imputed dataset may lead
to an unfair model. In this paper, we first theoretically analyze different
sources of discrimination risks when training with an imputed dataset. Then, we
propose an integrated approach based on decision trees that does not require a
separate process of imputation and learning. Instead, we train a tree with
missing incorporated as attribute (MIA), which does not require explicit
imputation, and we optimize a fairness-regularized objective function. We
demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing fairness intervention
methods applied to an imputed dataset, through several experiments on
real-world datasets.]]></summary>

informs algorithmic design to obtain an $\epsilon$-close reachable set

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In black-box optimization problems, we aim to maximize an unknown objective
function, where the function is only accessible through feedbacks of an
evaluation or simulation oracle. In real-life, the feedbacks of such oracles
are often noisy and available after some unknown delay that may depend on the
computation time of the oracle. Additionally, if the exact evaluations are
expensive but coarse approximations are available at a lower cost, the
feedbacks can have multi-fidelity. In order to address this problem, we propose
a generic extension of hierarchical optimistic tree search (HOO), called
ProCrastinated Tree Search (PCTS), that flexibly accommodates a delay and
noise-tolerant bandit algorithm. We provide a generic proof technique to
quantify regret of PCTS under delayed, noisy, and multi-fidelity feedbacks.
Specifically, we derive regret bounds of PCTS enabled with delayed-UCB1 (DUCB1)
and delayed-UCB-V (DUCBV) algorithms. Given a horizon $T$, PCTS retains the
regret bound of non-delayed HOO for expected delay of $O(\log T)$ and worsens
by $O(T^{\frac{1-\alpha}{d+2}})$ for expected delays of $O(T^{1-\alpha})$ for
$\alpha \in (0,1]$. We experimentally validate on multiple synthetic functions
and hyperparameter tuning problems that PCTS outperforms the state-of-the-art
black-box optimization methods for feedbacks with different noise levels,
delays, and fidelity.]]></summary>

recognition" (PETRAW) challenge whose objective was to develop surgical
workflow recognition methods based on one or several modalities, among video,
kinematic, and segmentation data, in order to study their added value. The
PETRAW challenge provided a data set of 150 peg transfer sequences performed on
a virtual simulator. This data set was composed of videos, kinematics, semantic
segmentation, and workflow annotations which described the sequences at three
different granularity levels: phase, step, and activity. Five tasks were
proposed to the participants: three of them were related to the recognition of
all granularities with one of the available modalities, while the others
addressed the recognition with a combination of modalities. Average
application-dependent balanced accuracy (AD-Accuracy) was used as evaluation
metric to take unbalanced classes into account and because it is more
clinically relevant than a frame-by-frame score. Seven teams participated in at
least one task and four of them in all tasks. Best results are obtained with
the use of the video and the kinematics data with an AD-Accuracy between 93%
and 90% for the four teams who participated in all tasks. The improvement
between video/kinematic-based methods and the uni-modality ones was significant
for all of the teams. However, the difference in testing execution time between
the video/kinematic-based and the kinematic-based methods has to be taken into
consideration. Is it relevant to spend 20 to 200 times more computing time for
less than 3% of improvement? The PETRAW data set is publicly available at
www.synapse.org/PETRAW to encourage further research in surgical workflow
recognition.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Gaussian Process Convolution Model (GPCM; Tobar et al., 2015a) is a model
for signals with complex spectral structure. A significant limitation of the
GPCM is that it assumes a rapidly decaying spectrum: it can only model smooth
signals. Moreover, inference in the GPCM currently requires (1) a mean-field
assumption, resulting in poorly calibrated uncertainties, and (2) a tedious
variational optimisation of large covariance matrices. We redesign the GPCM
model to induce a richer distribution over the spectrum with relaxed
assumptions about smoothness: the Causal Gaussian Process Convolution Model
(CGPCM) introduces a causality assumption into the GPCM, and the Rough Gaussian
Process Convolution Model (RGPCM) can be interpreted as a Bayesian
nonparametric generalisation of the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We
also propose a more effective variational inference scheme, going beyond the
mean-field assumption: we design a Gibbs sampler which directly samples from
the optimal variational solution, circumventing any variational optimisation
entirely. The proposed variations of the GPCM are validated in experiments on
synthetic and real-world data, showing promising results.]]></summary>

separate signal and noise through a series of transformations which remove
frequencies where noise is present. However, this technique relies on a priori
knowledge of what frequencies contain signal and noise and that these
frequencies do not overlap, which is difficult to achieve in practice. To
address these issues, we introduce a PO-neural network hybrid model, the Pseudo
Projection Operator (PPO), which leverages a neural network to perform
frequency selection. We compare the filtering capabilities of a PPO, PO, and
denoising autoencoder (DAE) on the University of Rochester Multi-Modal Music

experiments, the PPO outperforms both the PO and DAE. Based upon these results,
we suggest future application of the PPO to filtering problems in the physical

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given the computational cost and technical expertise required to train
machine learning models, users may delegate the task of learning to a service
provider. We show how a malicious learner can plant an undetectable backdoor
into a classifier. On the surface, such a backdoored classifier behaves
normally, but in reality, the learner maintains a mechanism for changing the
classification of any input, with only a slight perturbation. Importantly,
without the appropriate "backdoor key", the mechanism is hidden and cannot be
detected by any computationally-bounded observer. We demonstrate two frameworks
for planting undetectable backdoors, with incomparable guarantees.

First, we show how to plant a backdoor in any model, using digital signature
schemes. The construction guarantees that given black-box access to the
original model and the backdoored version, it is computationally infeasible to
find even a single input where they differ. This property implies that the
backdoored model has generalization error comparable with the original model.
Second, we demonstrate how to insert undetectable backdoors in models trained
using the Random Fourier Features (RFF) learning paradigm or in Random ReLU
networks. In this construction, undetectability holds against powerful
white-box distinguishers: given a complete description of the network and the
training data, no efficient distinguisher can guess whether the model is
"clean" or contains a backdoor.

Our construction of undetectable backdoors also sheds light on the related
issue of robustness to adversarial examples. In particular, our construction
can produce a classifier that is indistinguishable from an "adversarially
robust" classifier, but where every input has an adversarial example! In
summary, the existence of undetectable backdoors represent a significant
theoretical roadblock to certifying adversarial robustness.]]></summary>

systems calls for a careful evaluation of such models in down-stream tasks,

for attention to be paid to fairness measures as well. Through the analysis of
more than a dozen pretrained language models of varying sizes on two toxic text
classification tasks (English), we demonstrate that focusing on accuracy
measures alone can lead to models with wide variation in fairness
characteristics. Specifically, we observe that fairness can vary even more than
accuracy with increasing training data size and different random
initializations. At the same time, we find that little of the fairness
variation is explained by model size, despite claims in the literature. To
improve model fairness without retraining, we show that two post-processing

can greatly reduce catastrophic forgetting of previous devices, accelerate
convergence, and reach a better global model, especially when dealing with

well-generalized model. However, it induces large memory and inference costs,
which are often not affordable for real-world deployment. Existing work has
resorted to sharing weights among models. However, when increasing the
proportion of the shared weights, the resulting models tend to be similar, and
the benefits of using model ensemble diminish. To retain ensemble benefits
while maintaining a low memory cost, we propose a consistency-regularized
ensemble learning approach based on perturbed models, named CAMERO.
Specifically, we share the weights of bottom layers across all models and apply
different perturbations to the hidden representations for different models,
which can effectively promote the model diversity. Meanwhile, we apply a
prediction consistency regularizer across the perturbed models to control the
variance due to the model diversity. Our experiments using large language
models demonstrate that CAMERO significantly improves the generalization
performance of the ensemble model. Specifically, CAMERO outperforms the
standard ensemble of 8 BERT-base models on the GLUE benchmark by 0.7 with a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is known that when the statistical models are singular, i.e., the Fisher
information matrix at the true parameter is degenerate, the fixed step-size
gradient descent algorithm takes polynomial number of steps in terms of the
sample size $n$ to converge to a final statistical radius around the true
parameter, which can be unsatisfactory for the application. To further improve
that computational complexity, we consider the utilization of the second-order
information in the design of optimization algorithms. Specifically, we study
the normalized gradient descent (NormGD) algorithm for solving parameter
estimation in parametric statistical models, which is a variant of gradient
descent algorithm whose step size is scaled by the maximum eigenvalue of the
Hessian matrix of the empirical loss function of statistical models. When the
population loss function, i.e., the limit of the empirical loss function when
$n$ goes to infinity, is homogeneous in all directions, we demonstrate that the
NormGD iterates reach a final statistical radius around the true parameter
after a logarithmic number of iterations in terms of $n$. Therefore, for fixed
dimension $d$, the NormGD algorithm achieves the optimal overall computational
complexity $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to reach the final statistical radius. This
computational complexity is cheaper than that of the fixed step-size gradient
descent algorithm, which is of the order $\mathcal{O}(n^{\tau})$ for some $\tau
> 1$, to reach the same statistical radius. We illustrate our general theory
under two statistical models: generalized linear models and mixture models, and
experimental results support our prediction with general theory.]]></summary>

approximate solutions for the ridge regression problem $\min_x \|{Ax-b}\|_2^2
+\lambda\|{x}\|_2^2$ where $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ with $d \ge n$. Our
algorithm, for a constant number of iterations (requiring a constant number of
passes over the input), improves upon earlier work of Chowdhury et al., by
requiring that the sketching matrix only has a weaker Approximate Matrix
Multiplication (AMM) guarantee that depends on $\epsilon$, along with a
constant subspace embedding guarantee. The earlier work instead requires that
the sketching matrix have a subspace embedding guarantee that depends on
$\epsilon$. For example, to produce a $1+\varepsilon$ approximate solution in
$1$ iteration, which requires $2$ passes over the input, our algorithm requires
the OSNAP embedding to have $m= O(n\sigma^2/\lambda\varepsilon)$ rows with a
sparsity parameter $s = O(\log(n))$, whereas the earlier algorithm of Chowdhury
et al., with the same number of rows of OSNAP requires a sparsity $s =
O(\sqrt{\sigma^2/\lambda\varepsilon} \cdot \log(n))$, where $\sigma =
\|{A}\|_2$ is the spectral norm of the matrix $A$. We also show that this
algorithm can be used to give faster algorithms for kernel ridge regression.
Finally, we show that the sketch size required for our algorithm is essentially
optimal for a natural framework of algorithms for ridge regression by proving
lower bounds on oblivious sketching matrices for AMM. The sketch size lower
bounds for AMM may be of independent interest.]]></summary>

come in a variety of sizes. As high-resolution details are downsampled away,
and low-resolution images are discarded altogether, precious supervision is
lost. We argue that every pixel matters and create datasets with variable-size
images, collected at their native resolutions. Taking advantage of this data is
challenging; high-resolution processing is costly, and current architectures
can only process fixed-resolution data. We introduce continuous-scale training,
a process that samples patches at random scales to train a new generator with
variable output resolutions. First, conditioning the generator on a target
scale allows us to generate higher resolutions images than previously possible,
without adding layers to the model. Second, by conditioning on continuous
coordinates, we can sample patches that still obey a consistent global layout,
which also allows for scalable training at higher resolutions. Controlled FFHQ
experiments show our method takes advantage of the multi-resolution training
data better than discrete multi-scale approaches, achieving better FID scores
and cleaner high-frequency details. We also train on other natural image
domains including churches, mountains, and birds, and demonstrate arbitrary
scale synthesis with both coherent global layouts and realistic local details,

bowel conditions, which is essential in neonatal care. It helps early detection
of neonatal bowel dysfunctions and allows timely intervention. This paper
presents a neonatal bowel sound detection method to assist the auscultation.
Specifically, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is proposed to classify
peristalsis and non-peristalsis sounds. The classification is then optimized
using a Laplace Hidden Semi-Markov Model (HSMM). The proposed method is
validated on abdominal sounds from 49 newborn infants admitted to our tertiary
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). The results show that the method can
effectively detect bowel sounds with accuracy and area under curve (AUC) score
being 89.81% and 83.96% respectively, outperforming 13 baseline methods.
Furthermore, the proposed Laplace HSMM refinement strategy is proven capable to
enhance other bowel sound detection models. The outcomes of this work have the
potential to facilitate future telehealth applications for neonatal care. The

We also exploit methods from empirical likelihood theory in statistics to

Transformers since only the unmasked patches are processed by the network. As a

difference in the performance or outcome of a model, across different
sub-populations (groups) of datapoints. Thus, the inputs to disparity
quantification consist of a model's predictions $\hat{y}$, the ground-truth
labels for the predictions $y$, and group labels $g$ for the data points.
Performance of the model for each group is calculated by comparing $\hat{y}$
and $y$ for the datapoints within a specific group, and as a result, disparity
of performance across the different groups can be calculated. In many real
world scenarios however, group labels ($g$) may not be available at scale
during training and validation time, or collecting them might not be feasible
or desirable as they could often be sensitive information. As a result,
evaluating disparity metrics across categorical groups would not be feasible.
On the other hand, in many scenarios noisy groupings may be obtainable using
some form of a proxy, which would allow measuring disparity metrics across
sub-populations. Here we explore performing such analysis on computer vision
models trained on human faces, and on tasks such as face attribute prediction
and affect estimation. Our experiments indicate that embeddings resulting from
an off-the-shelf face recognition model, could meaningfully serve as a proxy
for such estimation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learning robot policies via preference-based reward learning is an
increasingly popular method for customizing robot behavior. However, in recent
years, there has been a growing body of anecdotal evidence that learning reward
functions from preferences is prone to spurious correlations and reward gaming
or hacking behaviors. While there is much anecdotal, empirical, and theoretical
analysis of causal confusion and reward gaming behaviors both in reinforcement
learning and imitation learning approaches that directly map from states to
actions, we provide the first systematic study of causal confusion in the
context of learning reward functions from preferences. To facilitate this
study, we identify a set of three preference learning benchmark domains where
we observe causal confusion when learning from offline datasets of pairwise
trajectory preferences: a simple reacher domain, an assistive feeding domain,
and an itch-scratching domain. To gain insight into this observed causal
confusion, we present a sensitivity analysis that explores the effect of
different factors--including the type of training data, reward model capacity,
and feature dimensionality--on the robustness of rewards learned from
preferences. We find evidence that learning rewards from pairwise trajectory
preferences is highly sensitive and non-robust to spurious features and
increasing model capacity, but not as sensitive to the type of training data.

decisions for individuals based on a sensitive attribute (e.g., age, sex). In
domains where prediction accuracy is paramount, it could potentially be
acceptable to fit a model which exhibits disparate treatment. To evaluate the
effect of disparate treatment, we compare the performance of split classifiers
(i.e., classifiers trained and deployed separately on each group) with
group-blind classifiers (i.e., classifiers which do not use a sensitive
attribute). We introduce the benefit-of-splitting for quantifying the
performance improvement by splitting classifiers. Computing the
benefit-of-splitting directly from its definition could be intractable since it
involves solving optimization problems over an infinite-dimensional functional
space. Under different performance measures, we (i) prove an equivalent
expression for the benefit-of-splitting which can be efficiently computed by
solving small-scale convex programs; (ii) provide sharp upper and lower bounds
for the benefit-of-splitting which reveal precise conditions where a
group-blind classifier will always suffer from a non-trivial performance gap
from the split classifiers. In the finite sample regime, splitting is not
necessarily beneficial and we provide data-dependent bounds to understand this
effect. Finally, we validate our theoretical results through numerical
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We consider the problem of quantum state certification, where we are given
the description of a mixed state $\sigma \in \mathbb{C}^{d \times d}$, $n$
copies of a mixed state $\rho \in \mathbb{C}^{d \times d}$, and $\varepsilon >
0$, and we are asked to determine whether $\rho = \sigma$ or whether $\| \rho -
\sigma \|_1 > \varepsilon$. When $\sigma$ is the maximally mixed state
$\frac{1}{d} I_d$, this is known as mixedness testing. We focus on algorithms
which use incoherent measurements, i.e. which only measure one copy of $\rho$
at a time. Unlike those that use entangled, multi-copy measurements, these can
be implemented without persistent quantum memory and thus represent a large
class of protocols that can be run on current or near-term devices.

For mixedness testing, there is a folklore algorithm which uses incoherent
measurements and only needs $O(d^{3/2} / \varepsilon^2)$ copies. The algorithm
is non-adaptive, that is, its measurements are fixed ahead of time, and is
known to be optimal for non-adaptive algorithms. However, when the algorithm
can make arbitrary incoherent measurements, the best known lower bound is only
$\Omega (d^{4/3} / \varepsilon^2)$ [Bubeck-Chen-Li '20], and it has been an
outstanding open problem to close this polynomial gap. In this work, 1) we
settle the copy complexity of mixedness testing with incoherent measurements
and show that $\Omega (d^{3/2} / \varepsilon^2)$ copies are necessary, and 2)
we show the instance-optimal bounds for state certification to general $\sigma$
first derived by [Chen-Li-O'Donnell '21] for non-adaptive measurements also
hold for arbitrary incoherent measurements.

Qualitatively, our results say that adaptivity does not help at all for these
problems. Our results are based on new techniques that allow us to reduce the
problem to understanding certain matrix martingales, which we believe may be of
independent interest.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assessing the systemic effects of uncertainty that arises from agents'
partial observation of the true states of the world is critical for
understanding a wide range of scenarios. Yet, previous modeling work on agent
learning and decision-making either lacks a systematic way to describe this
source of uncertainty or puts the focus on obtaining optimal policies using
complex models of the world that would impose an unrealistically high cognitive
demand on real agents. In this work we aim to efficiently describe the emergent
behavior of biologically plausible and parsimonious learning agents faced with
partially observable worlds. Therefore we derive and present deterministic
reinforcement learning dynamics where the agents observe the true state of the
environment only partially. We showcase the broad applicability of our dynamics
across different classes of partially observable agent-environment systems. We
find that partial observability creates unintuitive benefits in a number of
specific contexts, pointing the way to further research on a general
understanding of such effects. For instance, partially observant agents can
learn better outcomes faster, in a more stable way and even overcome social
dilemmas. Furthermore, our method allows the application of dynamical systems
theory to partially observable multiagent leaning. In this regard we find the
emergence of catastrophic limit cycles, a critical slowing down of the learning
processes between reward regimes and the separation of the learning dynamics
into fast and slow directions, all caused by partial observability. Therefore,
the presented dynamics have the potential to become a formal, yet practical,
lightweight and robust tool for researchers in biology, social science and
machine learning to systematically investigate the effects of interacting
partially observant agents.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Measures to predict 30-day readmission are considered an important quality
factor for hospitals as accurate predictions can reduce the overall cost of
care by identifying high risk patients before they are discharged. While recent
deep learning-based studies have shown promising empirical results on
readmission prediction, several limitations exist that may hinder widespread
clinical utility, such as (a) only patients with certain conditions are
considered, (b) existing approaches do not leverage data temporality, (c)
individual admissions are assumed independent of each other, which is
unrealistic, (d) prior studies are usually limited to single source of data and
single center data. To address these limitations, we propose a multimodal,
modality-agnostic spatiotemporal graph neural network (MM-STGNN) for prediction
of 30-day all-cause hospital readmission that fuses multimodal in-patient
longitudinal data. By training and evaluating our methods using longitudinal
chest radiographs and electronic health records from two independent centers,
we demonstrate that MM-STGNN achieves AUROC of 0.79 on both primary and
external datasets. Furthermore, MM-STGNN significantly outperforms the current
clinical reference standard, LACE+ score (AUROC=0.61), on the primary dataset.
For subset populations of patients with heart and vascular disease, our model
also outperforms baselines on predicting 30-day readmission (e.g., 3.7 point
improvement in AUROC in patients with heart disease). Lastly, qualitative model
interpretability analysis indicates that while patients' primary diagnoses were
not explicitly used to train the model, node features crucial for model
prediction directly reflect patients' primary diagnoses. Importantly, our
MM-STGNN is agnostic to node feature modalities and could be utilized to
integrate multimodal data for triaging patients in various downstream resource
allocation tasks.]]></summary>

the understanding of text, image, and speech. Recent developments in genomics
has also adopted these pre-training methods for genome understanding. However,
they focus only on understanding haploid sequences, which hinders their
applicability towards understanding genetic variations, also known as single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which is crucial for genome-wide association
study. In this paper, we introduce SNP2Vec, a scalable self-supervised
pre-training approach for understanding SNP. We apply SNP2Vec to perform
long-sequence genomics modeling, and we evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach on predicting Alzheimer's disease risk in a Chinese cohort. Our
approach significantly outperforms existing polygenic risk score methods and
all other baselines, including the model that is trained entirely with haploid
sequences. We release our code and dataset on

functional approximation and prediction. While the representation properties of
DL have been well studied, uncertainty quantification remains challenging and
largely unexplored. Data augmentation techniques are a natural approach to
provide uncertainty quantification and to incorporate stochastic Monte Carlo
search into stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods. The purpose of our paper
is to show that training DL architectures with data augmentation leads to
efficiency gains. We use the theory of scale mixtures of normals to derive data
augmentation strategies for deep learning. This allows variants of the
expectation-maximization and MCMC algorithms to be brought to bear on these
high dimensional nonlinear deep learning models. To demonstrate our
methodology, we develop data augmentation algorithms for a variety of commonly
used activation functions: logit, ReLU, leaky ReLU and SVM. Our methodology is
compared to traditional stochastic gradient descent with back-propagation. Our
optimization procedure leads to a version of iteratively re-weighted least
squares and can be implemented at scale with accelerated linear algebra methods
providing substantial improvement in speed. We illustrate our methodology on a
number of standard datasets. Finally, we conclude with directions for future

multiple online activities on various contents and create fast widespread

propose a weakly supervised graph embedding based framework for understanding

well-being related tweets from Twitter, focusing on 'Yoga', 'Keto diet'.
Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework
outperforms the baselines for detecting user types. Finally, we illustrate data

4th Industrial Revolution. ICS devices like Programmable Logic Controllers
(PLCs), automate, monitor, and control critical processes in industrial,
energy, and commercial environments. The convergence of traditional Operational
Technology (OT) with Information Technology (IT) has opened a new and unique
threat landscape. This has inspired defense research that focuses heavily on
Machine Learning (ML) based anomaly detection methods that run on external IT
hardware, which means an increase in costs and the further expansion of the
threat landscape. To remove this requirement, we introduce the ICS machine
learning inference framework (ICSML) which enables the execution of ML model
inference natively on the PLC. ICSML is implemented in IEC 61131-3 code and
provides several optimizations to bypass the limitations imposed by the
domain-specific languages. Therefore, it works \emph{on every PLC without the
need for vendor support}. ICSML provides a complete set of components for the
creation of full ML models similarly to established ML frameworks. We run a
series of benchmarks studying memory and performance and compare our solution
to the TFLite inference framework. At the same time, we develop domain-specific
model optimizations to improve the efficiency of ICSML. To demonstrate the
abilities of ICSML, we evaluate a case study of a real defense for
process-aware attacks targeting a desalination plant.]]></summary>

control of data flows, based on measurements of network resources. In this
paper, we investigate the design of measurement-based admission control
schemes, deciding whether a new data flow can be admitted and in this case, on
which slice. The objective is to devise a joint measurement and decision
strategy that returns a correct decision (e.g., the least loaded slice) with a
certain level of confidence while minimizing the measurement cost (the number
of measurements made before committing to the decision). We study the design of
such strategies for several natural admission criteria specifying what a
correct decision is. For each of these criteria, using tools from best arm
identification in bandits, we first derive an explicit information-theoretical
lower bound on the cost of any algorithm returning the correct decision with
fixed confidence. We then devise a joint measurement and decision strategy
achieving this theoretical limit. We compare empirically the measurement costs
of these strategies, and compare them both to the lower bounds as well as a
naive measurement scheme. We find that our algorithm significantly outperforms
the naive scheme (by a factor $2-8$).]]></summary>

functional to be minimized in the training phase. Sequential data are
ubiquitous across many fields of research, and are often treated with Euclidean
distance-based loss functions that were designed for tabular data. For smooth
oscillatory data, those conventional approaches lack the ability to penalize
amplitude, frequency and phase prediction errors at the same time, and tend to
be biased towards amplitude errors. We introduce the surface similarity
parameter (SSP) as a novel loss function that is especially useful for training
machine learning models on smooth oscillatory sequences. Our extensive
experiments on chaotic spatio-temporal dynamical systems indicate that the SSP
is beneficial for shaping gradients, thereby accelerating the training process,
reducing the final prediction error, and implementing a stronger regularization
effect compared to using classical loss functions. The results indicate the
potential of the novel loss metric particularly for highly complex and chaotic
data, such as data stemming from the nonlinear two-dimensional
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and the linear propagation of dispersive surface
gravity waves in fluids.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm in which
the server periodically aggregates local model parameters from clients without
assembling their private data. User-constrained communication bandwidth and the
requirement for personalized models pose severe challenges to FL. Federated
distillation (FD) is proposed to simultaneously address the two problems, which
exchanges knowledge between the server and clients, supporting heterogeneous
local models while significantly reducing communication overhead. However, most
existing FD methods require a proxy dataset, which is often unavailable.
Proxy-data-free FD approaches eliminate the need for additional public data
beyond clients' private data, but suffer from remarkable discrepancy among
local knowledge due to model heterogeneity, leading to ambiguous representation
on the server and inevitable accuracy degradation. To tackle this issue, we
propose a proxy-data-free FD algorithm based on distributed knowledge
congruence (FedDKC). FedDKC leverages well-designed refinement strategies to
narrow local knowledge differences into an acceptable upper bound to mitigate
the negative effects of knowledge incongruence. Specifically, from perspectives
of peak probability and Shannon entropy of local knowledge, we design
kernel-based knowledge refinement (KKR) and searching-based knowledge
refinement (SKR) respectively, and theoretically guarantee the refined-local
knowledge can satisfy an approximately-similar distribution and be regarded as
congruent. Extensive experiments conducted on three common datasets demonstrate
that our proposed FedDKC method outperforms the state-of-the-art in 93.33% of
comparisons, and achieves faster convergence without increasing communication
overhead.]]></summary>

prediction problems that a fast-fashion company has to manage routinely.
Furthermore, we demonstrate how the use of computer vision is substantial in
this scenario. Visuelle 2.0 contains data for 6 seasons / 5355 clothing
products of Nuna Lie, a famous Italian company with hundreds of shops located
in different areas within the country. In particular, we focus on a specific
prediction problem, namely short-observation new product sale forecasting
(SO-fore). SO-fore assumes that the season has started and a set of new
products is on the shelves of the different stores. The goal is to forecast the
sales for a particular horizon, given a short, available past (few weeks),
since no earlier statistics are available. To be successful, SO-fore approaches
should capture this short past and exploit other modalities or exogenous data.
To these aims, Visuelle 2.0 is equipped with disaggregated data at the
item-shop level and multi-modal information for each clothing item, allowing
computer vision approaches to come into play. The main message that we deliver
is that the use of image data with deep networks boosts performances obtained

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite being studied extensively for a few decades, handwritten character
recognition (HCR) is considered a challenging learning problem in pattern
recognition and there is very limited research on script independent models.
This is mainly because of diversity of scripts, focus of the conventional
research on handcrafted feature extraction techniques, and unavailability of
public datasets and codes to reproduce the results. On the other hand, deep
learning has witnessed huge success in different areas of pattern recognition,
including HCR, and provides end-to-end learning but it has been studied for
specific scripts only. In this paper, we have proposed a novel deep learning
architecture which exploits transfer learning and image-augmentation for
end-to-end learning for script independent handwritten character recognition,
called HCR-Net. HCR-Net is based on a novel transfer learning approach for HCR,
where some of lower layers of a pre-trained network are utilized. Due to
transfer learning and image-augmentation, HCR-Net provides faster training,
better performance and better generalizations, and can achieve up to 99\%
results of its final accuracy in just first epoch. The experimental results on
publicly available datasets of Bangla, Punjabi, Hindi, English, Swedish, Urdu,
Farsi, Tibetan, Kannada, Malayalam, Telugu, Marathi, Nepali and Arabic
languages prove the efficacy of HCR-Net and establishes several new benchmarks.
For reproducibility of the results and for the advancements of the HCR
research, complete code is publicly released at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this study, we propose a novel adversarial reprogramming (AR) approach for
low-resource spoken command recognition (SCR), and build an AR-SCR system. The
AR procedure aims to modify the acoustic signals (from the target domain) to
repurpose a pretrained SCR model (from the source domain). To solve the label
mismatches between source and target domains, and further improve the stability
of AR, we propose a novel similarity-based label mapping technique to align
classes. In addition, the transfer learning (TL) technique is combined with the
original AR process to improve the model adaptation capability. We evaluate the
proposed AR-SCR system on three low-resource SCR datasets, including Arabic,
Lithuanian, and dysarthric Mandarin speech. Experimental results show that with
a pretrained AM trained on a large-scale English dataset, the proposed AR-SCR
system outperforms the current state-of-the-art results on Arabic and
Lithuanian speech commands datasets, with only a limited amount of training
data.]]></summary>

that models this setting as a two-sided matching market with bandit learners. A
recent result in this area states that it is impossible to simultaneously
guarantee two natural desiderata: stability and low optimal regret for all

justification for assigning good long-term outcomes to some agents and poor
ones to others. We show that this impossibility need not hold true. In

vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Adversaries can mislead policies of
DRL agents by perturbing the state of the environment observed by the agents.
Existing attacks are feasible in principle but face challenges in practice,
either by being too slow to fool DRL policies in real time or by modifying past
observations stored in the agent's memory. We show that using the Universal
Adversarial Perturbation (UAP) method to compute perturbations, independent of
the individual inputs to which they are applied to, can fool DRL policies
effectively and in real time. We describe three such attack variants. Via an
extensive evaluation using three Atari 2600 games, we show that our attacks are
effective, as they fully degrade the performance of three different DRL agents
(up to 100%, even when the $l_\infty$ bound on the perturbation is as small as
0.01). It is faster compared to the response time (0.6ms on average) of
different DRL policies, and considerably faster than prior attacks using
adversarial perturbations (1.8ms on average). We also show that our attack
technique is efficient, incurring an online computational cost of 0.027ms on
average. Using two further tasks involving robotic movement, we confirm that
our results generalize to more complex DRL tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that the effectiveness of known defenses diminishes against universal
perturbations. We propose an effective technique that detects all known
adversarial perturbations against DRL policies, including all the universal
perturbations presented in this paper.]]></summary>

effectiveness of our method on the Tomita languages benchmark, where we find
that it is able to extract faithful automata from RNNs trained on all languages

RNN model is trained for additional epochs after perfectly learning its target

beyond convergence is useful because it leads to compression of the internal

that it is sparsely activated guided by predefined skills. Different from
traditional dense models that always activate all the model parameters,
SkillNet only activates parts of the model parameters whose skills are relevant
to the target task. When learning for a new task, our approach precisely
activates required skills and also provides an option to add new skills. We
evaluate on natural language understandings tasks and have the following
findings. First, with only one model checkpoint, SkillNet performs better than
task-specific fine-tuning and two multi-task learning baselines (i.e., dense

pre-training further improves the overall performance. Third, SkillNet

(GNNs). To mine as finer-grained patterns as possible for prediction, a spatial
weighted aggregation module is introduced to aggregate the embeddings of CBGs

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graph neural networks (GNN) are very popular methods in machine learning and
have been applied very successfully to the prediction of the properties of
molecules and materials. First-order GNNs are well known to be incomplete,
i.e., there exist graphs that are distinct but appear identical when seen
through the lens of the GNN. More complicated schemes have thus been designed
to increase their resolving power. Applications to molecules (and more
generally, point clouds), however, add a geometric dimension to the problem.
The most straightforward and prevalent approach to construct graph
representation for molecules regards atoms as vertices in a graph and draws a
bond between each pair of atoms within a chosen cutoff. Bonds can be decorated
with the distance between atoms, and the resulting "distance graph NNs" (dGNN)
have empirically demonstrated excellent resolving power and are widely used in
chemical ML, with all known indistinguishable graphs being resolved in the
fully-connected limit. Here we show that even for the restricted case of
fully-connected graphs induced by 3D atom clouds dGNNs are not complete. We
construct pairs of distinct point clouds that generate graphs that, for any
cutoff radius, are equivalent based on a first-order Weisfeiler-Lehman test.
This class of degenerate structures includes chemically-plausible
configurations, setting an ultimate limit to the expressive power of some of
the well-established GNN architectures for atomistic machine learning. Models
that explicitly use angular or directional information in the description of
atomic environments can resolve these degeneracies.]]></summary>

polymeric flows is the availability of reliable and interpretable hydrodynamic
models that faithfully encode the underlying micro-scale polymer dynamics. The

molecular structure and heterogeneous interaction. DeePN$^2$, a deep
learning-based non-Newtonian hydrodynamic model, has been proposed and has
shown some success in systematically passing the micro-scale structural
mechanics information to the macro-scale hydrodynamics for suspensions with
simple polymer conformation and bond potential. The model retains a
multi-scaled nature by mapping the polymer configurations into a set of
symmetry-preserving macro-scale features. The extended constitutive laws for
these macro-scale features can be directly learned from the kinetics of their
micro-scale counterparts. In this paper, we develop DeePN$^2$ using more

information matrix at the true parameter is degenerate, the fixed step-size
gradient descent algorithm takes polynomial number of steps in terms of the
sample size $n$ to converge to a final statistical radius around the true
parameter, which can be unsatisfactory for the application. To further improve
that computational complexity, we consider the utilization of the second-order
information in the design of optimization algorithms. Specifically, we study
the normalized gradient descent (NormGD) algorithm for solving parameter
estimation in parametric statistical models, which is a variant of gradient
descent algorithm whose step size is scaled by the maximum eigenvalue of the
Hessian matrix of the empirical loss function of statistical models. When the
population loss function, i.e., the limit of the empirical loss function when
$n$ goes to infinity, is homogeneous in all directions, we demonstrate that the
NormGD iterates reach a final statistical radius around the true parameter
after a logarithmic number of iterations in terms of $n$. Therefore, for fixed
dimension $d$, the NormGD algorithm achieves the optimal overall computational
complexity $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to reach the final statistical radius. This
computational complexity is cheaper than that of the fixed step-size gradient
descent algorithm, which is of the order $\mathcal{O}(n^{\tau})$ for some $\tau
> 1$, to reach the same statistical radius. We illustrate our general theory
under two statistical models: generalized linear models and mixture models, and
experimental results support our prediction with general theory.]]></summary>

adapt to new data statistics. Stream-based Active Learning (AL) approaches
address this problem by interactively querying a human expert to provide new
data labels for the most recent samples, within a limited budget. Existing AL
strategies assume that labels are immediately available, while in a real-world
scenario the expert requires time to provide a queried label (verification
latency), and by the time the requested labels arrive they may not be relevant
anymore. In this article, we investigate the influence of finite,
time-variable, and unknown verification delay, in the presence of concept drift
on AL approaches. We propose PRopagate (PR), a latency independent utility
estimator which also predicts the requested, but not yet known, labels.
Furthermore, we propose a drift-dependent dynamic budget strategy, which uses a
variable distribution of the labelling budget over time, after a detected
drift. Thorough experimental evaluation, with both synthetic and real-world
non-stationary datasets, and different settings of verification latency and
budget are conducted and analyzed. We empirically show that the proposed method
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art. Additionally, we demonstrate
that with variable budget allocation in time, it is possible to boost the
performance of AL strategies, without increasing the overall labeling budget.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Accurate segmentation of medical images is essential for diagnosis and
treatment of diseases. These problems are solved by highly complex models, such
as deep networks (DN), requiring a large amount of labeled data for training.
Thereby, many DNs possess task- or imaging modality specific architectures with
a decision-making process that is often hard to explain and interpret. Here, we
propose a framework that embeds existing DNs into a low-dimensional subspace
induced by the learnable explicit feature map (LEFM) layer. Compared to the
existing DN, the framework adds one hyperparameter and only modestly increase
the number of learnable parameters. The method is aimed at, but not limited to,
segmentation of low-dimensional medical images, such as color histopathological
images of stained frozen sections. Since features in the LEFM layer are
polynomial functions of the original features, proposed LEFM-Nets contribute to
the interpretability of network decisions. In this work, we combined LEFM with
the known networks: DeepLabv3+, UNet, UNet++ and MA-net. New LEFM-Nets are
applied to the segmentation of adenocarcinoma of a colon in a liver from images
of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained frozen sections. LEFM-Nets are also
tested on nuclei segmentation from images of H&E stained frozen sections of ten
human organs. On the first problem, LEFM-Nets achieved statistically
significant performance improvement in terms of micro balanced accuracy and
$F_1$ score than original networks. LEFM-Nets achieved only better performance
in comparison with the original networks on the second problem. The source code

viewed as energy-minimization problems that induce an instantaneous flow field

derive a consolidated view for existing methods on differentiable surface

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Probabilistic programming is a growing area that strives to make statistical
analysis more accessible, by separating probabilistic modelling from
probabilistic inference. In practice this decoupling is difficult. No single
inference algorithm can be used as a probabilistic programming back-end that is
simultaneously reliable, efficient, black-box, and general. Probabilistic
programming languages often choose a single algorithm to apply to a given
problem, thus inheriting its limitations. While substantial work has been done
both to formalise probabilistic programming and to improve efficiency of
inference, there has been little work that makes use of the available program
structure, by formally analysing it, to better utilise the underlying inference
algorithm.

This dissertation presents three novel techniques (both static and dynamic),
which aim to improve probabilistic programming using program analysis. The
techniques analyse a probabilistic program and adapt it to make inference more
efficient, sometimes in a way that would have been tedious or impossible to do
by hand.]]></summary>

features on the prediction fosters model explainability and delivers relevant
information about the dataset. While typical setups for feature importance
ranking assess input features individually, in this study, we go one step
further and rank the importance of groups of features, denoted as
feature-blocks. A feature-block can contain features of a specific type or
features derived from a particular source, which are presented to the neural
network in separate input branches (multiblock ANNs). This work presents three
methods pursuing distinct strategies to rank features in multiblock ANNs by
their importance: (1) a composite strategy building on individual feature
importance rankings, (2) a knock-in, and (3) a knock-out strategy. While the
composite strategy builds on state-of-the-art feature importance rankings,
knock-in and knock-out strategies evaluate the block as a whole via a mutual
information criterion. Our experiments consist of a simulation study validating
all three approaches, followed by a case study on two distinct real-world
datasets to compare the strategies. We conclude that each strategy has its
merits for specific application scenarios.]]></summary>

Additionally, we show that a discrete version of the algorithm retrieves

area of research as the quality of air is closely related to human health and

involving the observation of correlations across several data points (i.e.,
often referred to as long-term dependences). We propose a hybrid deep learning
model that combines LSTM with Autoencoder for anomaly detection tasks in IAQ to
address this issue. In our approach, the LSTM network is comprised of multiple
LSTM cells that work with each other to learn the long-term dependences of the
data in a time-series sequence. Autoencoder identifies the optimal threshold
based on the reconstruction loss rates evaluated on every data across all
time-series sequences. Our experimental results, based on the Dunedin CO2

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although mission-critical applications require the use of deep neural
networks (DNNs), their continuous execution at mobile devices results in a
significant increase in energy consumption. While edge offloading can decrease
energy consumption, erratic patterns in channel quality, network and edge
server load can lead to severe disruption of the system's key operations. An
alternative approach, called split computing, generates compressed
representations within the model (called "bottlenecks"), to reduce bandwidth
usage and energy consumption. Prior work has proposed approaches that introduce
additional layers, to the detriment of energy consumption and latency. For this
reason, we propose a new framework called BottleFit, which, in addition to
targeted DNN architecture modifications, includes a novel training strategy to
achieve high accuracy even with strong compression rates. We apply BottleFit on
cutting-edge DNN models in image classification, and show that BottleFit
achieves 77.1% data compression with up to 0.6% accuracy loss on ImageNet
dataset, while state of the art such as SPINN loses up to 6% in accuracy. We
experimentally measure the power consumption and latency of an image
classification application running on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano board (GPU-based)
and a Raspberry PI board (GPU-less). We show that BottleFit decreases power
consumption and latency respectively by up to 49% and 89% with respect to
(w.r.t.) local computing and by 37% and 55% w.r.t. edge offloading. We also
compare BottleFit with state-of-the-art autoencoders-based approaches, and show
that (i) BottleFit reduces power consumption and execution time respectively by
up to 54% and 44% on the Jetson and 40% and 62% on Raspberry PI; (ii) the size
of the head model executed on the mobile device is 83 times smaller. We publish
the code repository for reproducibility of the results in this study.]]></summary>

applications such as program vulnerability assessment and malware detection.
This involves interpreting instructions executed by software and often
necessitates converting the software's binary file data to assembly language.
The conversion process requires information about the binary file's target
instruction set architecture (ISA). However, ISA information might not be
included in binary files due to compilation errors, partial downloads, or
adversarial corruption of file metadata. Machine learning (ML) is a promising
methodology that can be used to identify the target ISA using binary data in
the object code section of binary files. In this paper we propose a binary code
feature extraction model to improve the accuracy and scalability of ML-based
ISA identification methods. Our feature extraction model can be used in the
absence of domain knowledge about the ISAs. Specifically, we adapt models from
natural language processing (NLP) to i) identify successive byte patterns
commonly observed in binary codes, ii) estimate the significance of each byte
pattern to a binary file, and iii) estimate the relevance of each byte pattern
in distinguishing between ISAs. We introduce character-level features of
encoded binaries to identify fine-grained bit patterns inherent to each ISA. We
use a dataset with binaries from 12 different ISAs to evaluate our approach.
Empirical evaluations show that using our byte-level features in ML-based ISA
identification results in an 8% higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art
features based on byte-histograms and byte pattern signatures. We observe that
character-level features allow reducing the size of the feature set by up to
16x while maintaining accuracy above 97%.]]></summary>

cascading compression via an elaborate bit-wise operation for unbiased sign

computers to execute complicated quantum algorithms. Due to its fundamental
importance, a plethora of quantum compilers has been designed in past years.
However, there are several caveats to current protocols, which are low
optimality, high inference time, limited scalability, and lack of universality.
To compensate for these defects, here we devise an efficient and practical
quantum compiler assisted by advanced deep reinforcement learning (RL)
techniques, i.e., data generation, deep Q-learning, and AQ* search. In this
way, our protocol is compatible with various quantum machines and can be used
to compile multi-qubit operators. We systematically evaluate the performance of
our proposal in compiling quantum operators with both inverse-closed and
inverse-free universal basis sets. In the task of single-qubit operator
compiling, our proposal outperforms other RL-based quantum compilers in the
measure of compiling sequence length and inference time. Meanwhile, the output
solution is near-optimal, guaranteed by the Solovay-Kitaev theorem. Notably,
for the inverse-free universal basis set, the achieved sequence length
complexity is comparable with the inverse-based setting and dramatically
advances previous methods. These empirical results contribute to improving the
inverse-free Solovay-Kitaev theorem. In addition, for the first time, we
demonstrate how to leverage RL-based quantum compilers to accomplish two-qubit
operator compiling. The achieved results open an avenue for integrating RL with
quantum compiling to unify efficiency and practicality and thus facilitate the
exploration of quantum advantages.]]></summary>

Our results in simulated clustered delay line channels show competitive

algorithms on the balance of average budgets allocated by the adversary and the
attack cost. Moreover, our experimental results have shown that while the
ResNet-18 model trained on DWT spectrograms achieves a high recognition
accuracy, attacking this model is relatively more costly for the adversary than

ReLU and Dropout in frequency domain to design their counterparts for CEMNet.
Also, to deal with complex inputs brought by DFT, we design two branch network

To our knowledge, CEMNet is the first model trained in Fourier Domain that

treatment decisions to patients by considering patient heterogeneity. Common
methods for learning optimal DTRs, however, have shortcomings: they are
typically based on outcome prediction and not treatment effect estimation, or
they use linear models that are restrictive for patient data from modern
electronic health records. To address these shortcomings, we develop two novel
methods for learning optimal DTRs that effectively handle complex patient data.
We call our methods DTR-CT and DTR-CF. Our methods are based on a data-driven
estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects using causal tree methods,
specifically causal trees and causal forests, that learn non-linear
relationships, control for time-varying confounding, are doubly robust, and
explainable. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first that adapts
causal tree methods for learning optimal DTRs. We evaluate our proposed methods
using synthetic data and then apply them to real-world data from intensive care
units. Our methods outperform state-of-the-art baselines in terms of cumulative
regret and percentage of optimal decisions by a considerable margin. Our work
improves treatment recommendations from electronic health record and is thus of

complex, dynamic environments. Adaptive control laws can endow even nonlinear
systems with good trajectory tracking performance, provided that any uncertain
dynamics terms are linearly parameterizable with known nonlinear features.
However, it is often difficult to specify such features a priori, such as for
aerodynamic disturbances on rotorcraft or interaction forces between a
manipulator arm and various objects. In this paper, we turn to data-driven
modeling with neural networks to learn, offline from past data, an adaptive
controller with an internal parametric model of these nonlinear features. Our
key insight is that we can better prepare the controller for deployment with
control-oriented meta-learning of features in closed-loop simulation, rather
than regression-oriented meta-learning of features to fit input-output data.
Specifically, we meta-learn the adaptive controller with closed-loop tracking
simulation as the base-learner and the average tracking error as the
meta-objective. With both fully-actuated and underactuated nonlinear planar
rotorcraft subject to wind, we demonstrate that our adaptive controller
outperforms other controllers trained with regression-oriented meta-learning

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi-Task Learning is a learning paradigm that uses correlated tasks to
improve performance generalization. A common way to learn multiple tasks is
through the hard parameter sharing approach, in which a single architecture is
used to share the same subset of parameters, creating an inductive bias between
them during the training process. Due to its simplicity, potential to improve
generalization, and reduce computational cost, it has gained the attention of
the scientific and industrial communities. However, tasks often conflict with
each other, which makes it challenging to define how the gradients of multiple
tasks should be combined to allow simultaneous learning. To address this
problem, we use the idea of multi-objective optimization to propose a method
that takes into account temporal behaviour of the gradients to create a dynamic
bias that adjust the importance of each task during the backpropagation. The
result of this method is to give more attention to the tasks that are diverging
or that are not being benefited during the last iterations, allowing to ensure
that the simultaneous learning is heading to the performance maximization of
all tasks. As a result, we empirically show that the proposed method
outperforms the state-of-art approaches on learning conflicting tasks. Unlike
the adopted baselines, our method ensures that all tasks reach good
generalization performances.]]></summary>

significantly reduces the required amount of high-fidelity data and achieves
one order of magnitude smaller error when using the same amount of

for our society. A key aspect of this sustainability is the ability of
computing systems to cope with the continuous change they face, ranging from
dynamic operating conditions, to changing goals, and technological progress.
While we are able to engineer smart computing systems that autonomously deal
with various types of changes, handling unanticipated changes requires system
evolution, which remains in essence a human-centered process. This will
eventually become unmanageable. To break through the status quo, we put forward
an arguable opinion for the vision of self-evolving computing systems that are
equipped with an evolutionary engine enabling them to evolve autonomously.
Specifically, when a self-evolving computing system detects conditions outside
its operational domain, such as an anomaly or a new goal, it activates an
evolutionary engine that runs online experiments to determine how the system
needs to evolve to deal with the changes, thereby evolving its architecture.
During this process the engine can integrate new computing elements that are
provided by computing warehouses. These computing elements provide
specifications and procedures enabling their automatic integration. We motivate
the need for self-evolving computing systems in light of the state of the art,
outline a conceptual architecture of self-evolving computing systems, and
illustrate the architecture for a future smart city mobility system that needs
to evolve continuously with changing conditions. To conclude, we highlight key
research challenges to realize the vision of self-evolving computing systems.]]></summary>

sim-to-real 6D object pose estimation to facilitate cost-effective robotic
grasping. Given a bin-picking scenario, we establish a photo-realistic
simulator to synthesize abundant virtual data, and use this to train an initial
pose estimation network. This network then takes the role of a teacher model,
which generates pose predictions for unlabeled real data. With these
predictions, we further design a comprehensive adaptive selection scheme to
distinguish reliable results, and leverage them as pseudo labels to update a
student model for pose estimation on real data. To continuously improve the
quality of pseudo labels, we iterate the above steps by taking the trained
student model as a new teacher and re-label real data using the refined teacher
model. We evaluate our method on a public benchmark and our newly-released
dataset, achieving an ADD(-S) improvement of 11.49% and 22.62% respectively.
Our method is also able to improve robotic bin-picking success by 19.54%,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) is a noninvasive tool to reveal
metabolic information. One challenge of 1H-MRS is the low Signal-Noise Ratio
(SNR). To improve the SNR, a typical approach is to perform Signal Averaging
(SA) with M repeated samples. The data acquisition time, however, is increased
by M times accordingly, and a complete clinical MRS scan takes approximately 10
minutes at a common setting M=128. Recently, deep learning has been introduced
to improve the SNR but most of them use the simulated data as the training set.
This may hinder the MRS applications since some potential differences, such as
acquisition system imperfections, and physiological and psychologic conditions
may exist between the simulated and in vivo data. Here, we proposed a new
scheme that purely used the repeated samples of realistic data. A deep learning
model, Refusion Long Short-Term Memory (ReLSTM), was designed to learn the
mapping from the low SNR time-domain data (24 SA) to the high SNR one (128 SA).
Experiments on the in vivo brain spectra of 7 healthy subjects, 2 brain tumor
patients and 1 cerebral infarction patient showed that only using 20% repeated
samples, the denoised spectra by ReLSTM could provide comparable estimated
concentrations of metabolites to 128 SA. Compared with the state-of-the-art
low-rank denoising method, the ReLSTM achieved the lower relative error and the
Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds in quantifying some important biomarkers. In summary,
ReLSTM can perform high-fidelity denoising of the spectra under fast
acquisition (24 SA), which would be valuable to MRS clinical studies.]]></summary>

possible to efficiently predict the measurement probabilities associated with a
quantum circuit? Recent work of Caro and Datta (2020) studied the problem of
PAC learning quantum circuits in an information theoretic sense, leaving open
questions of computational efficiency. In particular, one candidate class of
circuits for which an efficient learner might have been possible was that of
Clifford circuits, since the corresponding set of states generated by such
circuits, called stabilizer states, are known to be efficiently PAC learnable
(Rocchetto 2018). Here we provide a negative result, showing that proper
learning of CNOT circuits is hard for classical learners unless $\textsf{RP} =
\textsf{NP}$. As the classical analogue and subset of Clifford circuits, this
naturally leads to a hardness result for Clifford circuits as well.
Additionally, we show that if $\textsf{RP} = \textsf{NP}$ then there would
exist efficient proper learning algorithms for CNOT and Clifford circuits. By
similar arguments, we also find that an efficient proper quantum learner for
such circuits exists if and only if $\textsf{NP} \subseteq \textsf{RQP}$.]]></summary>

function, where the function is only accessible through feedbacks of an
evaluation or simulation oracle. In real-life, the feedbacks of such oracles
are often noisy and available after some unknown delay that may depend on the
computation time of the oracle. Additionally, if the exact evaluations are
expensive but coarse approximations are available at a lower cost, the
feedbacks can have multi-fidelity. In order to address this problem, we propose
a generic extension of hierarchical optimistic tree search (HOO), called
ProCrastinated Tree Search (PCTS), that flexibly accommodates a delay and
noise-tolerant bandit algorithm. We provide a generic proof technique to
quantify regret of PCTS under delayed, noisy, and multi-fidelity feedbacks.
Specifically, we derive regret bounds of PCTS enabled with delayed-UCB1 (DUCB1)
and delayed-UCB-V (DUCBV) algorithms. Given a horizon $T$, PCTS retains the
regret bound of non-delayed HOO for expected delay of $O(\log T)$ and worsens
by $O(T^{\frac{1-\alpha}{d+2}})$ for expected delays of $O(T^{1-\alpha})$ for
$\alpha \in (0,1]$. We experimentally validate on multiple synthetic functions
and hyperparameter tuning problems that PCTS outperforms the state-of-the-art
black-box optimization methods for feedbacks with different noise levels,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent years, neural networks and especially deep architectures have
received substantial attention for EEG signal analysis in the field of
brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). In this ongoing research area, the end-to-end
models are more favoured than traditional approaches requiring signal
transformation pre-classification. They can eliminate the need for prior
information from experts and the extraction of handcrafted features. However,
although several deep learning algorithms have been already proposed in the
literature, achieving high accuracies for classifying motor movements or mental
tasks, they often face a lack of interpretability and therefore are not quite
favoured by the neuroscience community. The reasons behind this issue can be
the high number of parameters and the sensitivity of deep neural networks to
capture tiny yet unrelated discriminative features. We propose an end-to-end
deep learning architecture called EEG-ITNet and a more comprehensible method to
visualise the network learned patterns. Using inception modules and causal
convolutions with dilation, our model can extract rich spectral, spatial, and
temporal information from multi-channel EEG signals with less complexity (in
terms of the number of trainable parameters) than other existing end-to-end
architectures, such as EEG-Inception and EEG-TCNet. By an exhaustive evaluation
on dataset 2a from BCI competition IV and OpenBMI motor imagery dataset,
EEG-ITNet shows up to 5.9\% improvement in the classification accuracy in
different scenarios with statistical significance compared to its competitors.
We also comprehensively explain and support the validity of network
illustration from a neuroscientific perspective. We have also made our code

clinical diagnosis. The training of new sonographers and deep learning based
algorithms for US image analysis usually requires a large amount of data.
However, obtaining and labeling large-scale US imaging data are not easy tasks,
especially for diseases with low incidence. Realistic US image synthesis can
alleviate this problem to a great extent. In this paper, we propose a
generative adversarial network (GAN) based image synthesis framework. Our main
contributions include: 1) we present the first work that can synthesize
realistic B-mode US images with high-resolution and customized texture editing
features; 2) to enhance structural details of generated images, we propose to
introduce auxiliary sketch guidance into a conditional GAN. We superpose the
edge sketch onto the object mask and use the composite mask as the network
input; 3) to generate high-resolution US images, we adopt a progressive
training strategy to gradually generate high-resolution images from
low-resolution images. In addition, a feature loss is proposed to minimize the
difference of high-level features between the generated and real images, which
further improves the quality of generated images; 4) the proposed US image
synthesis method is quite universal and can also be generalized to the US
images of other anatomical structures besides the three ones tested in our
study (lung, hip joint, and ovary); 5) extensive experiments on three large US
image datasets are conducted to validate our method. Ablation studies,
customized texture editing, user studies, and segmentation tests demonstrate
promising results of our method in synthesizing realistic US images.]]></summary>

using data with missing values. Even though there are a number of fairness
intervention methods in the literature, most of them require a complete
training set as input. In practice, data can have missing values, and data
missing patterns can depend on group attributes (e.g. gender or race). Simply
applying off-the-shelf fair learning algorithms to an imputed dataset may lead
to an unfair model. In this paper, we first theoretically analyze different
sources of discrimination risks when training with an imputed dataset. Then, we
propose an integrated approach based on decision trees that does not require a
separate process of imputation and learning. Instead, we train a tree with
missing incorporated as attribute (MIA), which does not require explicit
imputation, and we optimize a fairness-regularized objective function. We
demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing fairness intervention
methods applied to an imputed dataset, through several experiments on
real-world datasets.]]></summary>

Standard reinforcement learning algorithms maximize a scalar reward, which
requires combining different objective-specific rewards into a single number.
Alternatively, different objectives could also be combined at the level of
action value, such that specialist modules responsible for different objectives
submit different action suggestions to a decision process, each based on
rewards that are independent of one another. In this work, we explore the
potential benefits of this alternative strategy. We investigate a biologically
relevant multi-objective problem, the continual homeostasis of a set of
variables, and compare a monolithic deep Q-network to a modular network with a
dedicated Q-learner for each variable. We find that the modular agent: a)
requires minimal exogenously determined exploration; b) has improved sample

goal is to characterise subspaces of the input domain, which are invariant
under such mappings. Thus, we want to characterise manifolds implicitly defined
by level sets. Specifically, this characterisation should be of a global
parametric form, which is especially useful for different informed data
exploration tasks, such as building grid-based approximations, sampling points
along the level curves, or finding trajectories on the manifold. However,
global parameterisations can only exist if the level sets are connected. For
this purpose, we introduce a novel and flexible class of neural networks that
generalise input-convex networks. These networks represent functions that are
guaranteed to have connected level sets forming smooth manifolds on the input
space. We further show that global parameterisations of these level sets can be
always found efficiently. Lastly, we demonstrate that our novel technique for
characterising invariances is a powerful generative data exploration tool in
real-world applications, such as computational chemistry.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skill routing is an important component in large-scale conversational
systems. In contrast to traditional rule-based skill routing, state-of-the-art
systems use a model-based approach to enable natural conversations. To provide
supervision signal required to train such models, ideas such as human
annotation, replication of a rule-based system, relabeling based on user
paraphrases, and bandit-based learning were suggested. However, these
approaches: (a) do not scale in terms of the number of skills and skill
on-boarding, (b) require a very costly expert annotation/rule-design, (c)
introduce risks in the user experience with each model update. In this paper,
we present a scalable self-learning approach to explore routing alternatives
without causing abrupt policy changes that break the user experience, learn
from the user interaction, and incrementally improve the routing via frequent
model refreshes. To enable such robust frequent model updates, we suggest a
simple and effective approach that ensures controlled policy updates for
individual domains, followed by an off-policy evaluation for making deployment
decisions without any need for lengthy A/B experimentation. We conduct various
offline and online A/B experiments on a commercial large-scale conversational
system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in real-world
production settings.]]></summary>

SVAM-Net architecture is configured in a unique way to jointly accommodate
bottom-up and top-down learning within two separate branches of the network
while sharing the same encoding layers. We design dedicated spatial attention
modules (SAMs) along these learning pathways to exploit the coarse-level and
fine-level semantic features for SOD at four stages of abstractions. The
bottom-up branch performs a rough yet reasonably accurate saliency estimation
at a fast rate, whereas the deeper top-down branch incorporates a residual
refinement module (RRM) that provides fine-grained localization of the salient
objects. Extensive performance evaluation of SVAM-Net on benchmark datasets
clearly demonstrates its effectiveness for underwater SOD. We also validate its
generalization performance by several ocean trials' data that include test
images of diverse underwater scenes and waterbodies, and also images with

(NAS) is its demand for large computational resources, which hinders
scientifically sound empirical evaluations of NAS methods. Tabular NAS
benchmarks have alleviated this problem substantially, making it possible to
properly evaluate NAS methods in seconds on commodity machines. However, an
unintended consequence of tabular NAS benchmarks has been a focus on extremely
small architectural search spaces since their construction relies on exhaustive
evaluations of the space. This leads to unrealistic results that do not
transfer to larger spaces. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we propose
a methodology to create cheap NAS surrogate benchmarks for arbitrary search
spaces. We exemplify this approach by creating surrogate NAS benchmarks on the
existing tabular NAS-Bench-101 and on two widely used NAS search spaces with up
to $10^{21}$ architectures ($10^{13}$ times larger than any previous tabular
NAS benchmark). We show that surrogate NAS benchmarks can model the true
performance of architectures better than tabular benchmarks (at a small
fraction of the cost), that they lead to faithful estimates of how well
different NAS methods work on the original non-surrogate benchmark, and that
they can generate new scientific insight. We open-source all our code and
believe that surrogate NAS benchmarks are an indispensable tool to extend

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disparate treatment occurs when a machine learning model yields different
decisions for individuals based on a sensitive attribute (e.g., age, sex). In
domains where prediction accuracy is paramount, it could potentially be
acceptable to fit a model which exhibits disparate treatment. To evaluate the
effect of disparate treatment, we compare the performance of split classifiers
(i.e., classifiers trained and deployed separately on each group) with
group-blind classifiers (i.e., classifiers which do not use a sensitive
attribute). We introduce the benefit-of-splitting for quantifying the
performance improvement by splitting classifiers. Computing the
benefit-of-splitting directly from its definition could be intractable since it
involves solving optimization problems over an infinite-dimensional functional
space. Under different performance measures, we (i) prove an equivalent
expression for the benefit-of-splitting which can be efficiently computed by
solving small-scale convex programs; (ii) provide sharp upper and lower bounds
for the benefit-of-splitting which reveal precise conditions where a
group-blind classifier will always suffer from a non-trivial performance gap
from the split classifiers. In the finite sample regime, splitting is not
necessarily beneficial and we provide data-dependent bounds to understand this
effect. Finally, we validate our theoretical results through numerical
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.]]></summary>

functional approximation and prediction. While the representation properties of
DL have been well studied, uncertainty quantification remains challenging and
largely unexplored. Data augmentation techniques are a natural approach to
provide uncertainty quantification and to incorporate stochastic Monte Carlo
search into stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods. The purpose of our paper
is to show that training DL architectures with data augmentation leads to
efficiency gains. We use the theory of scale mixtures of normals to derive data
augmentation strategies for deep learning. This allows variants of the
expectation-maximization and MCMC algorithms to be brought to bear on these
high dimensional nonlinear deep learning models. To demonstrate our
methodology, we develop data augmentation algorithms for a variety of commonly
used activation functions: logit, ReLU, leaky ReLU and SVM. Our methodology is
compared to traditional stochastic gradient descent with back-propagation. Our
optimization procedure leads to a version of iteratively re-weighted least
squares and can be implemented at scale with accelerated linear algebra methods
providing substantial improvement in speed. We illustrate our methodology on a
number of standard datasets. Finally, we conclude with directions for future
research.]]></summary>

function, Gaussian covariates and a regularized M-estimator $\hat\beta$
constructed from convex loss function and regularizer. In the regime where
sample size $n$ and dimension $p$ are both increasing such that $p/n$ has a
finite limit, the behavior of the empirical distribution of $\hat\beta$ and the
predicted values $X\hat\beta$ has been previously characterized in a number of
models: The empirical distributions are known to converge to proximal operators
of the loss and penalty in a related Gaussian sequence model, which captures
the interplay between ratio $p/n$, loss, regularization and the data generating
process. This connection between$(\hat\beta,X\hat\beta)$ and the corresponding
proximal operators require solving fixed-point equations that typically involve
unobservable quantities such as the prior distribution on the index or the link
function.

This paper develops a different theory to describe the empirical distribution
of $\hat\beta$ and $X\hat\beta$: Approximations of $(\hat\beta,X\hat\beta)$ in
terms of proximal operators are provided that only involve observable
adjustments. These proposed observable adjustments are data-driven, e.g., do
not require prior knowledge of the index or the link function. These new
adjustments yield confidence intervals for individual components of the index,
as well as estimators of the correlation of $\hat\beta$ with the index. The
interplay between loss, regularization and the model is thus captured in a
data-driven manner, without solving the fixed-point equations studied in
previous works. The results apply to both strongly convex regularizers and
unregularized M-estimation. Simulations are provided for the square and
logistic loss in single index models including logistic regression and 1-bit
compressed sensing with 20\% corrupted bits.]]></summary>

conditioning of the linear system used in random feature regression problems
and are thus connected to the consistency and generalization of random feature
models. Random feature matrices are asymmetric rectangular nonlinear matrices
depending on two input variables, the data and the weights, which can make
their characterization challenging. We consider two settings for the two input
variables, either both are random variables or one is a random variable and the
other is well-separated, i.e. there is a minimum distance between points. With
conditions on the dimension, the complexity ratio, and the sampling variance,
we show that the singular values of these matrices concentrate near their full
expectation and near one with high-probability. In particular, since the
dimension depends only on the logarithm of the number of random weights or the
number of data points, our complexity bounds can be achieved even in moderate
dimensions for many practical setting. The theoretical results are verified
with numerical experiments.]]></summary>

for signals with complex spectral structure. A significant limitation of the
GPCM is that it assumes a rapidly decaying spectrum: it can only model smooth
signals. Moreover, inference in the GPCM currently requires (1) a mean-field
assumption, resulting in poorly calibrated uncertainties, and (2) a tedious
variational optimisation of large covariance matrices. We redesign the GPCM
model to induce a richer distribution over the spectrum with relaxed
assumptions about smoothness: the Causal Gaussian Process Convolution Model
(CGPCM) introduces a causality assumption into the GPCM, and the Rough Gaussian
Process Convolution Model (RGPCM) can be interpreted as a Bayesian
nonparametric generalisation of the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We
also propose a more effective variational inference scheme, going beyond the
mean-field assumption: we design a Gibbs sampler which directly samples from
the optimal variational solution, circumventing any variational optimisation
entirely. The proposed variations of the GPCM are validated in experiments on
synthetic and real-world data, showing promising results.]]></summary>

Wasserstein distances between the associated measures to produce a

is able to exactly recover parameters of some image manifolds including those
generated by translations or dilations of a fixed generating measure.
Additionally, we show that a discrete version of the algorithm retrieves

domains, ranging from product reviews in retailing to nursing notes in
healthcare. To leverage this information, words are typically translated into
word embeddings -- vectors that encode the semantic relationships between words
-- through unsupervised learning algorithms such as matrix factorization.
However, learning word embeddings from new domains with limited training data
can be challenging, because the meaning/usage may be different in the new
domain, e.g., the word "positive" typically has positive sentiment, but often
has negative sentiment in medical notes since it may imply that a patient is
tested positive for a disease. Intuitively, we expect that only a small number
of domain-specific words may have new meanings/usages. We propose an intuitive
two-stage estimator that exploits this structure via a group-sparse penalty to
efficiently transfer learn domain-specific word embeddings by combining
large-scale text corpora (such as Wikipedia) with limited domain-specific text
data. We bound the generalization error of our estimator, proving that it can
achieve the same accuracy (compared to not transfer learning) with
substantially less domain-specific data when only a small number of embeddings
are altered between domains. Our results provide the first bounds on
group-sparse matrix factorization, which may be of independent interest. We
empirically evaluate the effectiveness of our approach compared to
state-of-the-art fine-tuning heuristics from natural language processing.]]></summary>

However, this strongly limits the use of these models inside audio generation
setups, as most creative workflows are based on real-time digital signal
processing. Although approaches based on recurrent networks can be naturally
adapted to this buffer-based computation, the use of convolutions still poses
some serious challenges. To tackle this issue, the use of causal streaming
convolutions have been proposed. However, this requires specific complexified
training and can impact the resulting audio quality.

In this paper, we introduce a new method allowing to produce non-causal
streaming models. This allows to make any convolutional model compatible with
real-time buffer-based processing. As our method is based on a post-training
reconfiguration of the model, we show that it is able to transform models
trained without causal constraints into a streaming model. We show how our
method can be adapted to fit complex architectures with parallel branches. To
evaluate our method, we apply it on the recent RAVE model, which provides
high-quality real-time audio synthesis. We test our approach on multiple music
and speech datasets and show that it is faster than overlap-add methods, while
having no impact on the generation quality. Finally, we introduce two
open-source implementation of our work as Max/MSP and PureData externals, and
as a VST audio plugin. This allows to endow traditional digital audio

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We introduce kernel thinning, a new procedure for compressing a distribution
$\mathbb{P}$ more effectively than i.i.d. sampling or standard thinning. Given
a suitable reproducing kernel $\mathbf{k}$ and $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ time, kernel
thinning compresses an $n$-point approximation to $\mathbb{P}$ into a
$\sqrt{n}$-point approximation with comparable worst-case integration error
across the associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space. With high probability,
the maximum discrepancy in integration error is
$\mathcal{O}_d(n^{-1/2}\sqrt{\log n})$ for compactly supported $\mathbb{P}$ and
$\mathcal{O}_d(n^{-\frac{1}{2}} (\log n)^{(d+1)/2}\sqrt{\log\log n})$ for
sub-exponential $\mathbb{P}$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$. In contrast, an equal-sized
i.i.d. sample from $\mathbb{P}$ suffers $\Omega(n^{-1/4})$ integration error.
Our sub-exponential guarantees resemble the classical quasi-Monte Carlo error
rates for uniform $\mathbb{P}$ on $[0,1]^d$ but apply to general distributions
on $\mathbb{R}^d$ and a wide range of common kernels. We use our results to
derive explicit non-asymptotic maximum mean discrepancy bounds for Gaussian,
Mat\'ern, and B-spline kernels and present two vignettes illustrating the
practical benefits of kernel thinning over i.i.d. sampling and standard Markov
chain Monte Carlo thinning, in dimensions $d=2$ through $100$.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Probabilistic programming is a growing area that strives to make statistical
analysis more accessible, by separating probabilistic modelling from
probabilistic inference. In practice this decoupling is difficult. No single
inference algorithm can be used as a probabilistic programming back-end that is
simultaneously reliable, efficient, black-box, and general. Probabilistic
programming languages often choose a single algorithm to apply to a given
problem, thus inheriting its limitations. While substantial work has been done
both to formalise probabilistic programming and to improve efficiency of
inference, there has been little work that makes use of the available program
structure, by formally analysing it, to better utilise the underlying inference
algorithm.

This dissertation presents three novel techniques (both static and dynamic),
which aim to improve probabilistic programming using program analysis. The
techniques analyse a probabilistic program and adapt it to make inference more
efficient, sometimes in a way that would have been tedious or impossible to do
by hand.]]></summary>

where the existing approaches become increasingly impractical. In addition,
since our approaches can be optimized using simple linear regression, they are
easy to implement and theoretical guarantees are provided. Our randomized
reinforcement learning approach and randomized recurrent neural network
approach outperform the state-of-the-art and other relevant machine learning

effectiveness for alleviating catastrophic forgetting. In recent studies,
gradient-based approaches have been developed to make more efficient use of
compact episodic memory. Such approaches refine the gradients resulting from
new samples by those from memorized samples, aiming to reduce the diversity of
gradients from different tasks. In this paper, we clarify the relation between
diversity of gradients and discriminativeness of representations, showing
shared as well as conflicting interests between Deep Metric Learning and
continual learning, thus demonstrating pros and cons of learning discriminative
representations in continual learning. Based on these findings, we propose a
simple method -- Semi-Discriminative Representation Loss (SDRL) -- for
continual learning. In comparison with state-of-the-art methods, SDRL shows
better performance with low computational cost on multiple benchmark tasks in
the setting of online continual learning.]]></summary>

to satisfy fairness constraints. These constraints are typically complex
nonlinear functionals of the observed data distribution. Focusing on the

training easier and more accurate. Specifically, we show how to reparameterize
the observed data likelihood such that fairness constraints correspond directly
to parameters that appear in the likelihood, transforming a complex constrained
optimization objective into a simple optimization problem with box constraints.
We also exploit methods from empirical likelihood theory in statistics to
improve predictive performance by constraining baseline covariates, without
requiring parametric models. We combine the merits of both proposals to
optimize a hybrid reparameterized likelihood. The techniques presented here
should be applicable more broadly to fair prediction proposals that impose

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) are used in medicine to tailor sequential
treatment decisions to patients by considering patient heterogeneity. Common
methods for learning optimal DTRs, however, have shortcomings: they are
typically based on outcome prediction and not treatment effect estimation, or
they use linear models that are restrictive for patient data from modern
electronic health records. To address these shortcomings, we develop two novel
methods for learning optimal DTRs that effectively handle complex patient data.
We call our methods DTR-CT and DTR-CF. Our methods are based on a data-driven
estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects using causal tree methods,
specifically causal trees and causal forests, that learn non-linear
relationships, control for time-varying confounding, are doubly robust, and
explainable. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first that adapts
causal tree methods for learning optimal DTRs. We evaluate our proposed methods
using synthetic data and then apply them to real-world data from intensive care
units. Our methods outperform state-of-the-art baselines in terms of cumulative
regret and percentage of optimal decisions by a considerable margin. Our work
improves treatment recommendations from electronic health record and is thus of
direct relevance for personalized medicine.]]></summary>

forecasting and decision-based optimization. Traditionally, predictive models
are optimized independently from the final decision-based optimization problem.
In contrast, a `smart, predict then optimize' (SPO) framework optimizes
prediction models to explicitly minimize the final downstream decision loss. In
this paper we present dboost, a gradient boosting algorithm for training
prediction model ensembles to minimize decision regret. The dboost framework
supports any convex optimization program that can be cast as convex quadratic
cone program and gradient boosting is performed by implicit differentiation of
a custom fixed-point mapping. To our knowledge, the dboost framework is the
first general purpose implementation of gradient boosting to predict and
optimize problems. Experimental results comparing with state-of-the-art SPO

linear mixed models with crossed random effects. In the most general situation,
where the dimensions of the crossed groups are arbitrarily large, streamlining
is hindered by lack of sparseness in the underlying least squares system.
Because of this fact we also consider a hierarchy of relaxations of the mean
field product restriction. The least stringent product restriction delivers a
high degree of inferential accuracy. However, this accuracy must be mitigated
against its higher storage and computing demands. Faster sparse storage and
computing alternatives are also provided, but come with the price of diminished
inferential accuracy. This article provides full algorithmic details of three
variational inference strategies, presents detailed empirical results on their
pros and cons and, thus, guides the users on their choice of variational
inference approach depending on the problem size and computing resources.]]></summary>

experiment at the LHC. It is a crucial ingredient for detailed studies of the
strongly interacting matter formed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions.
ALICE provides PID information via various experimental techniques, allowing
for the identification of particles over a broad momentum range (from around
100 MeV/$c$ to around 50 GeV/$c$). The main challenge is how to combine the
information from various detectors effectively. Therefore, PID represents a
model classification problem, which can be addressed using Machine Learning
(ML) solutions. Moreover, the complexity of the detector and richness of the
detection techniques make PID an interesting area of research also for the
computer science community. In this work, we show the current status of the ML
approach to PID in ALICE. We discuss the preliminary work with the Random
Forest approach for the LHC Run 2 and a more advanced solution based on Domain
Adaptation Neural Networks, including a proposal for its future implementation

 What is the difference between passing these 32 feature maps into a Hybrid Transformer Encoder with patch of dimension 6x6? (So 1 patch for each channel)
 As I understand it, channel attention says "which channel is important for the final prediction". While transformer (with self attention) tells us "where to focus our attention in a given context".
 Isn't that the same if the patches are the channels? Basically it tells us on which patch to focus, and if patch=channel then squeeze excitation = self attention ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m really new to RL so please bear with me if I’m making mistakes here, but I’m trying to make an environment that emulates a network of roads. The algorithm will need to generate a quick route between n destinations when n equals some number with an insane amount of permutations, like 30 for example. This is like emulating the destinations required by a mailman’s route on a map, and trying to find the fastest way to get to each one.
 The algorithms sequence of decisions will be choosing a node to travel to, while each node represents an street intersection or point where the street ends. By the time it’s traveled to every destination using the nodes, it’ll review the network of nodes it used and sum the distance between each one to get total distance of route. 
 The goal is to get the total distance as small as possible. Is this realistic for a RL problem, or do I need to try to engineer some way to determine if every decision was either good or bad? Could I build a mathematical way to approximate the quickest route and then reward the RL algorithm by generating a better route than the mathematically approximated one?
 I could try rewarding the algorithm at each decision by whether it reduced the total distance required to any target it has yet to visit. I could try to mathematically make this more viable… what do y’all think,should I do something like that? Am I headed in the right direction? 
 Thanks for any and all help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Large language models can encode a wealth of semantic knowledge about the world. Such knowledge could in principle be extremely useful to robots aiming to act upon high-level, temporally extended instructions expressed in natural language. However, a significant weakness of language models is that they lack contextual grounding, which makes it difficult to leverage them for decision making within a given real-world context. For example, asking a language model to describe how to clean a spill might result in a reasonable narrative, but it may not be applicable to a particular agent, such as a robot, that needs to perform this task in a particular environment. We propose to provide this grounding by means of pretrained behaviors, which are used to condition the model to propose natural language actions that are both feasible and contextually appropriate. The robot can act as the language model’s “hands and eyes,” while the language model supplies high-level semantic knowledge about the task. We show how low-level tasks can be combined with large language models so that the language model provides high-level knowledge about the procedures for performing complex and temporally extended instructions, while value functions associated with these tasks provide the grounding necessary to connect this knowledge to a particular physical environment. We evaluate our method on a number of real-world robotic tasks, where we show that this approach is capable of completing long-horizon, abstract, natural language instructions on a mobile manipulator.

My problem is that I get the max or min action after a few training steps and it saturates with a non-optimized solution. How can I address this problem? I tried redesigning my reward to include positive and negative values but it didn’t work. I read that some people are using reward scaling. What is it and how would I scale it? I mean is there a specific method? I couldn’t find enough resources on that. Any help is much appreciated!

 Yet when I look at jobs, I see very seldom postings about it.
 I am wondering why is it the case ? From my current understanding I could think of dozens of applications with huge potential gains. It feel like an untapped potential.
 Or am I missing something ? What do you think is the big obstacle to wider adoption to RL ? Do you think it overlaps with classical control at the moment and is not justified ?

 I'm currently working on a project that focuses on GANs and generative art, particularly images that concern visual indeterminacy. I trying to find papers/articles that discuss the development/application of (any kind of) GAN in which along the way or as a final result, images were generated that would be considered visually indeterminate. Specifically, research in which the objective was to generate images with clear, recognizable objects/scenes.
 In my mind I'm looking for articles in which the GAN architecture is discussed and in which ways what parts of it could've influenced the particular aspects of the incorrectly generated image. This probably wouldn't be the focus of any research but I was wondering if anyone has ever come across a discussion section in a GAN paper or could point me towards some areas or projects where I might find something that I could connect to my project.

 They describe one part of their model as "3-layer feed-forward networks with hidden dimensions of 1024 and 256, GeLU as the activation function and a dropout with probability 0.1 applied at their input."
 For me that's not enough information to uniquely characterize the network, but maybe for someone with more experience the intended structure is obvious. The output should be a scalar, so i assume that it's something like:
 Dropout(0.1) -> Linear(<input dim>, 1024) -> Linear(1024, 256) -> GELU -> Linear(256, 1) ?
 Or is the nonlinearity (GELU) normally applied after each step?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I would be curious about the theoretical foundations how to make sense of higher-level abstract reasoning like reasoning about infinities, incomputability, truth (which we know cannot be defined due to Tarski) in the field of artificial intelligence. It seems due to Gödel-like constructions you are forced into inconsistent systems of reasoning when operating within a computable system. But those prove everything and "nothing", so as far as I understand it, it kind of upends the whole system of reason that the notion of artificial intelligence (and correct functioning of it) is based in.
 Personally due to this I don't see that the notion in the title it is a particularly coherent notion, which means there is somewhat strong limits on what (computable) AI will be able to do. But I would be curious how people that think otherwise (which seem most in the AI community?) approach this. Would you say somehow inconsistency can be avoided, or that despite inconsistency you can get reliably correct results?

 This implementation has MANY missing details, such as Unet Models etc. I think it is worth taking a look, especially if you are interested in recent boom of diffusion models (such as Dalle 2)

The ability to classify images into categories has been transformed by deep learning. It has also been significantly accelerated by transfer learning, whereby models are first pre-trained on large datasets, like ImageNet, to learn visual representations that are then transferred via fine-tuning to a new task with less data (e.g., classifying animals). Previous works such as BiT and ViT employed these methods to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of classification tasks, such as the VTAB benchmark. 
However, fine-tuning has some downsides: though pre-training is done only once, fine-tuning is necessary on every new dataset for which task-specific data is needed. Multimo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence models have gained promising results in recent years. The major factor behind their success is the availability and development of vast datasets. However, regardless of how many terabytes of data you have or how skilled you are at data science, machine learning models will be useless and even dangerous if you can’t make sense of data records.
 A slice is a collection of data samples with a common feature. For example, in a picture dataset, photographs of antique vehicles make up a slice. When a model’s performance on the data samples in a slice is significantly lower than its overall performance, the slice is considered underperforming.
 Deploying models underperforming on crucial data slices could seriously harm safety and fairness. For instance, models trained to detect collapsed lungs in chest X-rays generally make predictions based on the presence of chest drains, a common therapeutic device. As a result, computer models typically fail to detect collapsed lungs in images without chest drains, a critical data slice in which inaccurate negative predictions could be catastrophic.
 Not many studies have considered underperforming slices during model evaluation. Researchers believe that knowing which slices their models underperform would help practitioners not just make better decisions regarding model deployment but also improve model robustness by upgrading the training dataset or utilizing robust optimization strategies.
 Detecting slices is challenging because the “hidden” data slices are linked by a notion that isn’t easily derived from unstructured inputs or labeled in metadata (e.g., images, video, time-series data).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How do you evaluate and improve your models in production (particularly for complex modalities like text/vision/audio)? 
 Good models are hard
 In my experience from managing our CNN-based text classification & NER model at a small media analytics startup, evaluating and improving models is a mess. Our domain is fairly niche and diverse, so getting enough training data has been challenging and I mix in custom synthetics & augmentations (which can cause weird model artifacts if you're not careful). It takes a lot of time to discover tricky failure cases by either 1) observing production traffic or 2) probing manually, and then it takes even more time to get the right data to improve model behavior. 
 Are good models hard?
 What's your approach to model evaluation & targeted improvement? Are there any known best practices? I'm a bit at a loss here. As mentioned, I'm specifically interested in others who have deep models as an important part of their product or pipeline across any task or modality. More particularly:
  
How wrong is your model? How do you test it? How would you know about errors before and after it's deployed?
 How much of your time do you spend on iterating on your models? For what kind of issue? 
 Which aspects are most useful to you for improving model performance and reducing critical errors?
  
Maybe I'll take some of the more general ideas from my work and build them out into an evaluation & iteration framework. It's currently a hybrid web of synthetic, interactive/probing and classical approaches. Or maybe there is some approach/library that makes iteration easier without me having to do anything :)

 I am slightly confused in scenarios where probability of moving up, down, left and right are not provided or stated. In this scenario, I assume we assume the optimal policy and therefore, you would apply the Bellman equation as:
 V(s)=maxa(R(s,a)+γV(s′))
 Cost for any movement is 0 and an agent can choose to terminate at a numbered grid to collect a reward amount of the grid number. This is why my square closest to the reward takes in the value 8 since it will terminate with the action to the next state to collect the reward.
 Would this be the correct way to determine the value for the surrounding grid squares?

I've also heard from some of my friends that they had to learn Rust as a first thing in an ML company (it's their first job so they couldn't explain to me exactly why).
 My questions are:
  
What are pros and cons over Python?
 Are there any good frameworks in Rust for ML?
 Are there a decent community & documentation for Rust?
 Is learning it a fun experience?
 Is it used only for deployment?
  
 The reason I'm asking this is that I really love to learn by doing. And so, if I engaged in learning a bit of Rust for ML purposes, would I be able to create something ML-like right of the bat? It can be something as simple as MNIST classifier
  
Take note that I don't know anything about Rust, so these questions might seem noob-like. But I believe that the answers can be of help to others as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have started to look into using an ensemble of relatively shallow MLPs to predict using a small dataset (~100 training samples). I was looking specifically at bagging (bootstrap aggregation) as a possibility of improving prediction accuracy.
 I was curious if there were any heuristics for how many models to include in a bagging ensemble? 
 Also, more generally, am I on the correct path, or is there a better direction given my situation? A different ensemble technique, or a different path all together?
 Any advice would be appreciated.

learning (RL) tasks with sparse rewards. The key insight of Go-Explore was that
successful exploration requires an agent to first return to an interesting
state ('Go'), and only then explore into unknown terrain ('Explore'). We refer
to such exploration after a goal is reached as 'post-exploration'. In this
paper we present a systematic study of post-exploration, answering open
questions that the Go-Explore paper did not answer yet. First, we study the
isolated potential of post-exploration, by turning it on and off within the
same algorithm. Subsequently, we introduce new methodology to adaptively decide
when to post-explore and for how long to post-explore. Experiments on a range
of MiniGrid environments show that post-exploration indeed boosts performance
(with a bigger impact than tuning regular exploration parameters), and this
effect is further enhanced by adaptively deciding when and for how long to
post-explore. In short, our work identifies adaptive post-exploration as a
promising direction for RL exploration research.]]></summary>

estimators use importance sampling with proposal distribution families that
include amortized variational inference and sequential Monte Carlo, which can
be tailored to the target model and used to squeeze true information values
with high accuracy. We present several theoretical properties of EEVI and
demonstrate scalability and efficacy on two problems from the medical domain:
(i) in an expert system for diagnosing liver disorders, we rank medical tests
according to how informative they are about latent diseases, given a pattern of
observed symptoms and patient attributes; and (ii) in a differential equation
model of carbohydrate metabolism, we find optimal times to take blood glucose

increasing interest in their ability to perform a fast approximation of
effective hydrodynamic parameters in porous media research and applications.
This paper presents a novel methodology for permeability prediction from
micro-CT scans of geological rock samples. The training data set for CNNs
dedicated to permeability prediction consists of permeability labels that are
typically generated by classical lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM) that simulate
the flow through the pore space of the segmented image data. We instead perform
direct numerical simulation (DNS) by solving the stationary Stokes equation in
an efficient and distributed-parallel manner. As such, we circumvent the
convergence issues of LBM that frequently are observed on complex pore
geometries, and therefore, improve the generality and accuracy of our training
data set. Using the DNS-computed permeabilities, a physics-informed CNN PhyCNN)
is trained by additionally providing a tailored characteristic quantity of the
pore space. More precisely, by exploiting the connection to flow problems on a
graph representation of the pore space, additional information about confined
structures is provided to the network in terms of the maximum flow value, which
is the key innovative component of our workflow. The robustness of this
approach is reflected by very high prediction accuracy, which is observed for a
variety of sandstone samples from archetypal rock formations.]]></summary>

increase the efficiency of stochastic reliability analyses in geotechnical
engineering. This paper presents a highly efficient ML aided reliability
technique that is able to accurately predict the results of a Monte Carlo (MC)
reliability study, and yet performs 500 times faster. A complete MC reliability
analysis on anisotropic heterogeneous slopes consisting of 120,000 simulated
samples is conducted in parallel to the proposed ML aided stochastic technique.
Comparing the results of the complete MC study and the proposed ML aided
technique, the expected errors of the proposed method are realistically
examined. Circumventing the time-consuming computation of factors of safety for
the training datasets, the proposed technique is more efficient than previous
methods. Different ML models, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector
Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are presented, optimised and
compared. The effects of the size and type of training and testing datasets are
discussed. The expected errors of the ML predicted probability of failure are
characterised by different levels of soil heterogeneity and anisotropy. Using
only 1% of MC samples to train ML surrogate models, the proposed technique can
accurately predict the probability of failure with mean errors limited to 0.7%.
The proposed technique reduces the computational time required for our study
from 306 days to only 14 hours, providing 500 times higher efficiency.]]></summary>

learning the proteins representations. With the increasing computational power,
current protein language models pre-trained with millions of diverse sequences
can advance the parameter scale from million-level to billion-level and achieve
remarkable improvement. However, those prevailing approaches rarely consider
incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs), which can provide rich structured
knowledge facts for better protein representations. We argue that informative
biology knowledge in KGs can enhance protein representation with external
knowledge. In this work, we propose OntoProtein, the first general framework
that makes use of structure in GO (Gene Ontology) into protein pre-training
models. We construct a novel large-scale knowledge graph that consists of GO
and its related proteins, and gene annotation texts or protein sequences
describe all nodes in the graph. We propose novel contrastive learning with
knowledge-aware negative sampling to jointly optimize the knowledge graph and
protein embedding during pre-training. Experimental results show that
OntoProtein can surpass state-of-the-art methods with pre-trained protein
language models in TAPE benchmark and yield better performance compared with
baselines in protein-protein interaction and protein function prediction. Code

approach for scaling up reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. However, it
often suffers from training inefficiency as the action space of the high-level,
i.e., the goal space, is large. Searching in a large goal space poses
difficulty for both high-level subgoal generation and low-level policy
learning. In this paper, we show that this problem can be effectively
alleviated by restricting the high-level action space from the whole goal space
to a $k$-step adjacent region of the current state using an adjacency
constraint. We theoretically prove that in a deterministic Markov Decision
Process (MDP), the proposed adjacency constraint preserves the optimal
hierarchical policy, while in a stochastic MDP the adjacency constraint induces
a bounded state-value suboptimality determined by the MDP's transition
structure. We further show that this constraint can be practically implemented
by training an adjacency network that can discriminate between adjacent and
non-adjacent subgoals. Experimental results on discrete and continuous control
tasks including challenging simulated robot locomotion and manipulation tasks
show that incorporating the adjacency constraint significantly boosts the
performance of state-of-the-art goal-conditioned HRL approaches.]]></summary>

predict whether the sample was in the model's training set. A common
countermeasure against MI attacks is to utilize differential privacy (DP)
during model training to mask the presence of individual examples. While this
use of DP is a principled approach to limit the efficacy of MI attacks, there
is a gap between the bounds provided by DP and the empirical performance of MI
attacks. In this paper, we derive bounds for the \textit{advantage} of an
adversary mounting a MI attack, and demonstrate tightness for the widely-used
Gaussian mechanism. We further show bounds on the \textit{confidence} of MI
attacks. Our bounds are much stronger than those obtained by DP analysis. For
example, analyzing a setting of DP-SGD with $\epsilon=4$ would obtain an upper
bound on the advantage of $\approx0.36$ based on our analyses, while getting
bound of $\approx 0.97$ using the analysis of previous work that convert
$\epsilon$ to membership inference bounds.

Finally, using our analysis, we provide MI metrics for models trained on
CIFAR10 dataset. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis provides the
state-of-the-art membership inference bounds for the privacy.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The goal of this work is to propose a robust, fast, and fully automatic
method for personalized cranial defect reconstruction and implant modeling.

We propose a two-step deep learning-based method using a modified U-Net
architecture to perform the defect reconstruction, and a dedicated iterative
procedure to improve the implant geometry, followed by automatic generation of
models ready for 3-D printing. We propose a cross-case augmentation based on
imperfect image registration combining cases from different datasets. We
perform ablation studies regarding different augmentation strategies and
compare them to other state-of-the-art methods.

We evaluate the method on three datasets introduced during the AutoImplant
2021 challenge, organized jointly with the MICCAI conference. We perform the
quantitative evaluation using the Dice and boundary Dice coefficients, and the
Hausdorff distance. The average Dice coefficient, boundary Dice coefficient,
and the 95th percentile of Hausdorff distance are 0.91, 0.94, and 1.53 mm
respectively. We perform an additional qualitative evaluation by 3-D printing
and visualization in mixed reality to confirm the implant's usefulness.

We propose a complete pipeline that enables one to create the cranial implant
model ready for 3-D printing. The described method is a greatly extended
version of the method that scored 1st place in all AutoImplant 2021 challenge
tasks. We freely release the source code, that together with the open datasets,
makes the results fully reproducible. The automatic reconstruction of cranial
defects may enable manufacturing personalized implants in a significantly
shorter time, possibly allowing one to perform the 3-D printing process
directly during a given intervention. Moreover, we show the usability of the
defect reconstruction in mixed reality that may further reduce the surgery
time.]]></summary>

increasingly important that they are not only able to perform well on their
training distribution, but also yield accurate predictions when confronted with
distribution shift. The Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) framework
proposes to address this issue by training models to minimize their expected
risk under a collection of distributions, to imitate test-time shifts. This is
most commonly achieved by instance-level re-weighting of the training objective
to emulate the likelihood ratio with possible test distributions, which allows
for estimating their empirical risk via importance sampling (assuming that they
are subpopulations of the training distribution). However, re-weighting schemes
in the literature are usually limited due to the difficulty of keeping the
optimization problem tractable and the complexity of enforcing normalization
constraints. In this paper, we show that three simple ideas -- mini-batch level
normalization, a KL penalty and simultaneous gradient updates -- allow us to
train models with DRO using a broader class of parametric likelihood ratios. In
a series of experiments on both image and text classification benchmarks, we
find that models trained with the resulting parametric adversaries are
consistently more robust to subpopulation shifts when compared to other DRO
approaches, and that the method performs reliably well with little
hyper-parameter tuning. Code to reproduce our experiments can be found at

terrain, and ground vehicle simulation, to predict traversability.
Traversability is expressed as three independent measures: the ability to
traverse the terrain at a target speed, energy consumption, and acceleration.
The measures are continuous and reflect different objectives for planning that
go beyond binary classification. A deep neural network is trained to predict
the traversability measures from the local heightmap and target speed. To
produce training data, we use an articulated vehicle with wheeled bogie
suspensions and procedurally generated terrains. We evaluate the model on
laser-scanned forest terrains, previously unseen by the model. The model
predicts traversability with an accuracy of 90%. Predictions rely on features
from the high-dimensional terrain data that surpass local roughness and slope
relative to the heading. Correlations show that the three traversability
measures are complementary to each other. With an inference speed 3000 times
faster than the ground truth simulation and trivially parallelizable, the model
is well suited for traversability analysis and optimal path planning over large

in various dynamic system scenarios, for example, system identification and
prognostic and health management of machines. To this end, we combine the
advances in both deep generative models and state space model (SSM) to come up
with a novel, data-driven deep probabilistic sequence model. Specifically, we
follow the popular encoder-decoder generative structure to build the recurrent
neural networks (RNN) assisted variational sequence model on an augmented
recurrent input space, which could induce rich stochastic sequence dependency.
Besides, in order to alleviate the inconsistency issue of the posterior between
training and predicting as well as improving the mining of dynamic patterns, we
(i) propose using a lagged hybrid output as input for the posterior at next
time step, which brings training and predicting into alignment; and (ii)
further devise a generalized auto-regressive strategy that encodes all the
historical dependencies for the posterior. Thereafter, we first investigate the
methodological characteristics of the proposed deep probabilistic sequence
model on toy cases, and then comprehensively demonstrate the superiority of our
model against existing deep probabilistic SSM models through extensive
numerical experiments on eight system identification benchmarks from various
dynamic systems. Finally, we apply our sequence model to a real-world
centrifugal compressor forecasting problem, and again verify its outstanding
performance by quantifying the time series predictive distribution.]]></summary>

spaces have properties not conducive to search, e.g., multimodality,
discontinuities, or deception. To address such difficulties, considerable
research has been performed on creating novel evolutionary algorithms or
specialized genetic operators. However, if the representation that defined the
search space could be altered such that it only permitted valid solutions that
satisfied the constraints, the task of finding the optimal would be made more
feasible without any need for specialized optimization algorithms. We propose
Constrained Optimization in Latent Space (COIL), which uses a VAE to generate a
learned latent representation from a dataset comprising samples from the valid
region of the search space according to a constraint, thus enabling the
optimizer to find the objective in the new space defined by the learned
representation. Preliminary experiments show promise: compared to an identical

solutions, COIL with its learned latent representation can perfectly satisfy
different types of constraints while finding high-fitness solutions.]]></summary>

participation and open access via the web, are becoming a modish way for online
and distance education. To help users have a better study experience, many MOOC
platforms have provided the services of recommending courses to users. However,
we argue that directly recommending a course to users will ignore the expertise
levels of different users. To fill this gap, this paper studies the problem of
concept recommendation in a more fine-grained view. We propose a novel
Heterogeneous Information Networks based Concept Recommender with Reinforcement
Learning (HinCRec-RL) incorporated for concept recommendation in MOOCs.
Specifically, we first formulate the concept recommendation in MOOCs as a
reinforcement learning problem to better model the dynamic interaction among
users and knowledge concepts. In addition, to mitigate the data sparsity issue
which also exists in many other recommendation tasks, we consider a
heterogeneous information network (HIN) among users, courses, videos and
concepts, to better learn the semantic representation of users. In particular,
we use the meta-paths on HIN to guide the propagation of users' preferences and
propose a heterogeneous graph attention network to represent the meta-paths. To
validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conduct comprehensive
experiments on a real-world dataset from XuetangX, a popular MOOC platform from

consumption without loss of quality. Namely, with the dynamic cascaded encoder
model, we explore three techniques to maximally boost the performance of each
model size: 1) Use separate decoders for each sub-model while sharing the
encoders; 2) Use funnel-pooling to improve the encoder efficiency; 3) Balance
the size of causal and non-causal encoders to improve quality and fit
deployment constraints. Overall, the proposed large-medium model has 30%
smaller size and reduces power consumption by 33%, compared to the baseline
cascaded encoder model. The triple-size model that unifies the large, medium,
and small models achieves 37% total size reduction with minimal quality loss,
while substantially reducing the engineering efforts of having separate models.]]></summary>

challenging; their performance highly depends on the nature of the surrounding
environment, such as density and heights of the ground BSs. On the other hand,
tall buildings might block undesired interference signals from ground BSs,
thereby improving the connectivity between the UAVs and their serving BSs. To
address the connectivity of UAVs in such environments, this paper proposes a RL
algorithm to dynamically optimise the height of a UAV as it moves through the
environment, with the goal of increasing the throughput or spectrum efficiency
that it experiences. The proposed solution is evaluated in two settings: using
a series of generated environments where we vary the number of BS and building
densities, and in a scenario using real-world data obtained from an experiment
in Dublin, Ireland. Results show that our proposed RL-based solution improves
UAVs QoS by 6% to 41%, depending on the scenario. We also conclude that, when
flying at heights higher than the buildings, building density variation has no
impact on UAV QoS. On the other hand, BS density can negatively impact UAV QoS,
with higher numbers of BSs generating more interference and deteriorating UAV
performance.]]></summary>

to fully train a U-net-based segmentation model. The proposed QU-net++ model
detects this lack of quality training based on the disagreement in
segmentations produced from the final two output layers. The proposed model
isolates around 10% of the slices per 3D image stack and can scale across
imaging modalities to segment cysts in OCT images and ground glass opacity

the paradigm of knowledge discovery, which greatly promotes domain
intelligence. However, the current activation function of DNER fails to treat
gradient vanishing, no negative output or non-differentiable existence, which
may impede knowledge exploration caused by the omission and incomplete
representation of latent semantics. To break through the dilemma, we present a
novel activation function termed KDAC. Detailly, KDAC is an aggregation
function with multiple conversion modes. The backbone of the activation region
is the interaction between exponent and linearity, and the both ends extend
through adaptive linear divergence, which surmounts the obstacle of gradient
vanishing and no negative output. Crucially, the non-differentiable points are
alerted and eliminated by an approximate smoothing algorithm. KDAC has a series
of brilliant properties, including nonlinear, stable near-linear transformation
and derivative, as well as dynamic style, etc. We perform experiments based on
BERT-BiLSTM-CNN-CRF model on six benchmark datasets containing different domain
knowledge, such as Weibo, Clinical, E-commerce, Resume, HAZOP and People's
daily. The evaluation results show that KDAC is advanced and effective, and can
provide more generalized activation to stimulate the performance of DNER. We
hope that KDAC can be exploited as a promising activation function to devote
itself to the construction of knowledge.]]></summary>

numerous applications. Meanwhile, the documentation practice for machine
learning models often falls short of established practices for traditional
software components, which impedes model accountability, inadvertently abets
inappropriate or misuse of models, and may trigger negative social impact.
Recently, model cards, a template for documenting machine learning models, have
attracted notable attention, but their impact on the practice of model
documentation is unclear. In this work, we examine publicly available model
cards and other similar documentation. Our analysis reveals a substantial gap
between the suggestions made in the original model card work and the content in
actual documentation. Motivated by this observation and literature on fields
such as software documentation, interaction design, and traceability, we
further propose a set of design guidelines that aim to support the
documentation practice for machine learning models including (1) the
collocation of documentation environment with the coding environment, (2)
nudging the consideration of model card sections during model development, and
(3) documentation derived from and traced to the source. We designed a
prototype tool named DocML following those guidelines to support model
development in computational notebooks. A lab study reveals the benefit of our
tool to shift the behavior of data scientists towards documentation quality and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given a sequence of sets, where each set is associated with a timestamp and
contains an arbitrary number of elements, the task of temporal sets prediction
aims to predict the elements in the subsequent set. Previous studies for
temporal sets prediction mainly capture each user's evolutionary preference by
learning from his/her own sequence. Although insightful, we argue that: 1) the
collaborative signals latent in different users' sequences are essential but
have not been exploited; 2) users also tend to show stationary preferences
while existing methods fail to consider. To this end, we propose an integrated
learning framework to model both the evolutionary and the stationary
preferences of users for temporal sets prediction, which first constructs a
universal sequence by chronologically arranging all the user-set interactions,
and then learns on each user-set interaction. In particular, for each user-set
interaction, we first design an evolutionary user preference modelling
component to track the user's time-evolving preference and exploit the latent
collaborative signals among different users. This component maintains a memory
bank to store memories of the related user and elements, and continuously
updates their memories based on the currently encoded messages and the past
memories. Then, we devise a stationary user preference modelling module to
discover each user's personalized characteristics according to the historical
sequence, which adaptively aggregates the previously interacted elements from
dual perspectives with the guidance of the user's and elements' embeddings.
Finally, we develop a set-batch algorithm to improve the model efficiency,
which can create time-consistent batches in advance and achieve 3.5x training
speedups on average. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and good interpretability of our approach.]]></summary>

(e.g., researchers co-authoring a paper and ingredients used together in a
recipe), each of which corresponds to a hyperedge (i.e., a subset of nodes).
Predicting future or missing hyperedges bears significant implication for many
applications (e.g., collaboration and recipe recommendation). What makes
hyperedge prediction particularly challenging is the vast number of
non-hyperedge subsets, which grows exponentially with the number of nodes.
Since it is prohibitive to use all of them as negative examples for model
training, it is inevitable to sample a very small portion of them, and to this
end, heuristic sampling schemes have been employed. However, trained models
suffer from poor generalization capability for examples of different natures.
In this paper, we propose AHP, an adversarial training-based
hyperedge-prediction method. It learns to sample negative examples without
relying on any heuristic schemes. Using six real hypergraphs, we show that AHP
generalizes better to negative examples of various natures. It yields up to
28.2% higher AUROC than best existing methods and often even outperforms its
variants with sampling schemes tailored to test sets.]]></summary>

learning to address the need for ground truth. Data programming is a practical
WS approach that allows programmatic labeling data samples using labeling
functions (LFs) instead of hand-labeling each data point. However, the existing
approach fails to fully exploit the domain knowledge encoded into LFs,
especially when the LFs' coverage is low. This is due to the common data
programming pipeline that neglects to utilize data features during the
generative process. This paper proposes a new approach called reinforced
labeling (RL). Given an unlabeled dataset and a set of LFs, RL augments the
LFs' outputs to cases not covered by LFs based on similarities among samples.
Thus, RL can lead to higher labeling coverage for training an end classifier.
The experiments on several domains (classification of YouTube comments, wine
quality, and weather prediction) result in considerable gains. The new approach
produces significant performance improvement, leading up to +21 points in
accuracy and +61 points in F1 scores compared to the state-of-the-art data
programming approach.]]></summary>

clinical trials in healthcare. Trial sites, where the trials are conducted, are
chosen mainly based on feasibility in terms of medical expertise and access to
a large group of patients. More recently, the issue of diversity and inclusion
in clinical trials is gaining importance. Different patient groups may
experience the effects of a medical drug/ treatment differently and hence need
to be included in the clinical trials. These groups could be based on
ethnicity, co-morbidities, age, or economic factors. Thus, designing a method
for trial site selection that accounts for both feasibility and diversity is a
crucial and urgent goal. In this paper, we formulate this problem as a ranking
problem with fairness constraints. Using principles of fairness in machine
learning, we learn a model that maps a clinical trial description to a ranked
list of potential trial sites. Unlike existing fairness frameworks, the group
membership of each trial site is non-binary: each trial site may have access to
patients from multiple groups. We propose fairness criteria based on
demographic parity to address such a multi-group membership scenario. We test
our method on 480 real-world clinical trials and show that our model results in
a list of potential trial sites that provides access to a diverse set of
patients while also ensuing a high number of enrolled patients.]]></summary>

constrained environments remains a challenging problem yet to be addressed,
while transfer learning from these models has become prevalent in Natural
Language Processing tasks. Several solutions, including knowledge distillation,
network quantization, or network pruning have been previously proposed;
however, these approaches focus mostly on the English language, thus widening
the gap when considering low-resource languages. In this work, we introduce
three light and fast versions of distilled BERT models for the Romanian
language: Distil-BERT-base-ro, Distil-RoBERT-base, and
DistilMulti-BERT-base-ro. The first two models resulted from the individual
distillation of knowledge from two base versions of Romanian BERTs available in
literature, while the last one was obtained by distilling their ensemble. To
our knowledge, this is the first attempt to create publicly available Romanian
distilled BERT models, which were thoroughly evaluated on five tasks:
part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, semantic
textual similarity, and dialect identification. Our experimental results argue
that the three distilled models offer performance comparable to their teachers,
while being twice as fast on a GPU and ~35% smaller. In addition, we further
test the similarity between the predictions of our students versus their
teachers by measuring their label and probability loyalty, together with
regression loyalty - a new metric introduced in this work.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The accuracy of the estimated stellar atmospheric parameter decreases
evidently with the decreasing of spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and there
are a huge amount of this kind observations, especially in case of SNR$<$30.
Therefore, it is helpful to improve the parameter estimation performance for
these spectra and this work studied the ($T_\texttt{eff}, \log~g$, [Fe/H])
estimation problem for LAMOST DR8 low-resolution spectra with 20$\leq$SNR$<$30.
We proposed a data-driven method based on machine learning techniques. Firstly,
this scheme detected stellar atmospheric parameter-sensitive features from
spectra by the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO),
rejected ineffective data components and irrelevant data. Secondly, a
Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) method was used to estimate stellar atmospheric
parameters from the LASSO features. Finally, the performance of the LASSO-MLP
was evaluated by computing and analyzing the consistency between its estimation
and the reference from the APOGEE (Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution
Experiment) high-resolution spectra. Experiments show that the Mean Absolute
Errors (MAE) of $T_\texttt{eff}, \log~g$, [Fe/H] are reduced from the LASP
(137.6 K, 0.195 dex, 0.091 dex) to LASSO-MLP (84.32 K, 0.137 dex, 0.063 dex),
which indicate evident improvements on stellar atmospheric parameter
estimation. In addition, this work estimated the stellar atmospheric parameters
for 1,162,760 low-resolution spectra with 20$\leq$SNR$<$30 from LAMOST DR8
using LASSO-MLP, and released the estimation catalog, learned model,
experimental code, trained model, training data and test data for scientific
exploration and algorithm study.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the Big Data era, with the ubiquity of geolocation sensors in particular,
massive datasets exhibiting a possibly complex spatial dependence structure are
becoming increasingly available. In this context, the standard probabilistic
theory of statistical learning does not apply directly and guarantees of the
generalization capacity of predictive rules learned from such data are left to
establish. We analyze here the simple Kriging task, the flagship problem in
Geostatistics: the values of a square integrable random field $X=\{X_s\}_{s\in
S}$, $S\subset \mathbb{R}^2$, with unknown covariance structure are to be
predicted with minimum quadratic risk, based upon observing a single
realization of the spatial process at a finite number of locations $s_1,\;
\ldots,\; s_n$ in $S$. Despite the connection of this minimization problem with
kernel ridge regression, establishing the generalization capacity of empirical
risk minimizers is far from straightforward, due to the non i.i.d. nature of
the spatial data $X_{s_1},\; \ldots,\; X_{s_n}$ involved. In this article,
nonasymptotic bounds of order $O_{\mathbb{P}}(1/n)$ are proved for the excess
risk of a plug-in predictive rule mimicking the true minimizer in the case of
isotropic stationary Gaussian processes observed at locations forming a regular
grid. These theoretical results, as well as the role played by the technical
conditions required to establish them, are illustrated by various numerical
experiments and hopefully pave the way for further developments in statistical
learning based on spatial data.]]></summary>

The experimental results show that the proposed model can have better

tasks. However, these graph mining algorithms and RL models are dispersed in
different research areas, which makes it hard to compare different algorithms

models and graph mining and generalize these algorithms to Graph Reinforcement
Learning (GRL) as a unified formulation. We further discuss the applications of
GRL methods across various domains and summarize the method description,
open-source codes, and benchmark datasets of GRL methods. Finally, we propose
possible important directions and challenges to be solved in the future. This
is the latest work on a comprehensive survey of GRL literature, and this work
provides a global view for researchers as well as a learning resource for
researchers outside the domain. In addition, we create an online open-source

particularly suitable for wireless learning scenarios since it can accomplish a

over wireless networks that suffers from communication outage due to channel

over a cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network, which
characterizes communication outage from UAV (clients) to their server and data
heterogeneity among the datasets at UAVs. We propose an analytically tractable
framework to derive the uplink outage probability and use it to devise a
simulation-based approach so as to evaluate the performance of the proposed
intermittent FL model. Our findings reveal how the intermittent FL model is
impacted by uplink communication outage and UAV deployment. Extensive numerical

tasks in the domains of computer vision and natural language processing, and
the existing frameworks such as TFF and FATE has made the deployment easy in
real-world applications. However, federated graph learning (FGL), even though
graph data are prevalent, has not been well supported due to its unique
characteristics and requirements. The lack of FGL-related framework increases
the efforts for accomplishing reproducible research and deploying in real-world
applications. Motivated by such strong demand, in this paper, we first discuss
the challenges in creating an easy-to-use FGL package and accordingly present
our implemented package FederatedScope-GNN (FS-G), which provides (1) a unified
view for modularizing and expressing FGL algorithms; (2) comprehensive DataZoo
and ModelZoo for out-of-the-box FGL capability; (3) an efficient model
auto-tuning component; and (4) off-the-shelf privacy attack and defense
abilities. We validate the effectiveness of FS-G by conducting extensive
experiments, which simultaneously gains many valuable insights about FGL for
the community. Moreover, we employ FS-G to serve the FGL application in
real-world E-commerce scenarios, where the attained improvements indicate great
potential business benefits. We publicly release FS-G, as submodules of
FederatedScope, at https://github.com/alibaba/FederatedScope to promote FGL's
research and enable broad applications that would otherwise be infeasible due

but via multiple data views. For example, in genomic medicine, a patient can be
described by data from different molecular layers. This raises the need for
multi-view models that are able to disentangle variation within and across data
views in an interpretable manner. Latent variable models with structured
sparsity are a commonly used tool to address this modeling task but
interpretability is cumbersome since it requires a direct inspection and
interpretation of each factor via a specialized domain expert. Here, we propose
MuVI, a novel approach for domain-informed multi-view latent variable models,
facilitating the analysis of multi-view data in an inherently explainable
manner. We demonstrate that our model (i) is able to integrate noisy domain
expertise in form of feature sets, (ii) is robust to noise in the encoded
domain knowledge, (iii) results in identifiable factors and (iv) is able to
infer interpretable and biologically meaningful axes of variation in a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Synthetic data generation has proven to be a promising solution for
addressing data availability issues in various domains. Even more challenging
is the generation of synthetic time series data, where one has to preserve
temporal dynamics, i.e., the generated time series must respect the original
relationships between variables across time. Recently proposed techniques such
as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and quantum-GANs lack the ability to
attend to the time series specific temporal correlations adequately. We propose
using the inherent nature of quantum computers to simulate quantum dynamics as
a technique to encode such features. We start by assuming that a given time
series can be generated by a quantum process, after which we proceed to learn
that quantum process using quantum machine learning. We then use the learned
model to generate out-of-sample time series and show that it captures unique
and complex features of the learned time series. We also study the class of
time series that can be modeled using this technique. Finally, we
experimentally demonstrate the proposed algorithm on an 11-qubit trapped-ion
quantum machine.]]></summary>

neural networks, called variational autoencoder/generative adversarial network
(VAE/GAN), which can map input images to latent vectors and generate temporal
sequences internally. The results show that the distance of the predicted image
is reflected in the distance of the corresponding latent vector after training.
This indicates that the latent space is self-organized to reflect the proximity
structure of the dataset and may provide a mechanism through which many aspects
of cognition are spatially represented. The present study allows the network to
internally generate temporal sequences that are analogous to the hippocampal

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite recent improvements in abstractive summarization, most current
approaches generate summaries that are not factually consistent with the source
document, severely restricting their trust and usage in real-world
applications. Recent works have shown promising improvements in factuality
error identification using text or dependency arc entailments; however, they do
not consider the entire semantic graph simultaneously. To this end, we propose
FactGraph, a method that decomposes the document and the summary into
structured meaning representations (MR), which are more suitable for factuality
evaluation. MRs describe core semantic concepts and their relations,
aggregating the main content in both document and summary in a canonical form,
and reducing data sparsity. FactGraph encodes such graphs using a graph encoder
augmented with structure-aware adapters to capture interactions among the
concepts based on the graph connectivity, along with text representations using
an adapter-based text encoder. Experiments on different benchmarks for
evaluating factuality show that FactGraph outperforms previous approaches by up
to 15%. Furthermore, FactGraph improves performance on identifying content
verifiability errors and better captures subsentence-level factual
inconsistencies.]]></summary>

models in each of its well-defined stages to manage credit risk. Application
scoring is used to decide whether to grant a credit or not, while behavioral
scoring is used mainly for portfolio management and to take preventive actions
in case of default signals. In both cases, network data has recently been shown
to be valuable to increase the predictive power of these models, especially
when the borrower's historical data is scarce or not available. This study aims
to understand the creditworthiness assessment performance dynamics and how it
is influenced by the credit history, repayment behavior, and social network
features. To accomplish this, we introduced a machine learning classification
framework to analyze 97.000 individuals and companies from the moment they
obtained their first loan to 12 months afterward. Our novel and massive dataset
allow us to characterize each borrower according to their credit behavior, and
social and economic relationships. Our research shows that borrowers' history
increases performance at a decreasing rate during the first six months and then
stabilizes. The most notable effect on perfomance of social networks features
occurs at loan application; in personal scoring, this effect prevails a few
months, while in business scoring adds value throughout the study period. These
findings are of great value to improve credit risk management and optimize the
use of traditional information and alternative data sources.]]></summary>

processing tasks. Supervised deep learning (DL) models give state-of-the-art
performance for single-channel speech dereverberation. Temporal convolutional
networks (TCNs) are commonly used for sequence modelling in speech enhancement
tasks. A feature of TCNs is that they have a receptive field (RF) dependant on
the specific model configuration which determines the number of input frames
that can be observed to produce an individual output frame. It has been shown
that TCNs are capable of performing dereverberation of simulated speech data,
however a thorough analysis, especially with focus on the RF is yet lacking in
the literature. This paper analyses dereverberation performance depending on
the model size and the RF of TCNs. Experiments using the WHAMR corpus which is
extended to include room impulse responses (RIRs) with larger T60 values
demonstrate that a larger RF can have significant improvement in performance
when training smaller TCN models. It is also demonstrated that TCNs benefit
from a wider RF when dereverberating RIRs with larger RT60 values.]]></summary>

solution for a specified task, even though diverse solutions often exist.
Recent studies showed that learning a set of diverse solutions is beneficial
because diversity enables robust few-shot adaptation. Although existing methods
learn diverse solutions by using the mutual information as unsupervised
rewards, such an approach often suffers from the bias of the gradient estimator
induced by value function approximation. In this study, we propose a novel
method that can learn diverse solutions without suffering the bias problem. In
our method, a policy conditioned on a continuous or discrete latent variable is
trained by directly maximizing the variational lower bound of the mutual
information, instead of using the mutual information as unsupervised rewards as
in previous studies. Through extensive experiments on robot locomotion tasks,
we demonstrate that the proposed method successfully learns an infinite set of
diverse solutions by learning continuous latent variables, which is more
challenging than learning a finite number of solutions. Subsequently, we show
that our method enables more effective few-shot adaptation compared with
existing methods.]]></summary>

especially in business environments. As a result, it is often abused by sending
malicious messages, e.g., spam emails, to deceive users into relaying personal
information, including online accounts credentials or banking details. For this
reason, many machine learning methods for text classification have been
proposed and incorporated into the services of most email providers. However,
optimising text classification algorithms and finding the right tradeoff on
their aggressiveness is still a major research problem.

We present an updated survey of 12 machine learning text classifiers applied
to a public spam corpus. A new pipeline is proposed to optimise hyperparameter
selection and improve the models' performance by applying specific methods
(based on natural language processing) in the preprocessing stage.

Our study aims to provide a new methodology to investigate and optimise the
effect of different feature sizes and hyperparameters in machine learning
classifiers that are widely used in text classification problems. The
classifiers are tested and evaluated on different metrics including F-score
(accuracy), precision, recall, and run time. By analysing all these aspects, we
show how the proposed pipeline can be used to achieve a good accuracy towards
spam filtering on the Enron dataset, a widely used public email corpus.
Statistical tests and explainability techniques are applied to provide a robust
analysis of the proposed pipeline and interpret the classification outcomes of
the 12 machine learning models, also identifying words that drive the
classification results. Our analysis shows that it is possible to identify an
effective machine learning model to classify the Enron dataset with an F-score
of 94%.]]></summary>

present a practical framework from a model learning perspective. Based on
black-box model learning with scenario optimisation, we abstract the local
behaviour of a DNN via an affine model with the probably approximately correct

PAC-model robustness property. The innovation of our work is the integration of
model learning into PAC robustness analysis: that is, we construct a PAC
guarantee on the model level instead of sample distribution, which induces a
more faithful and accurate robustness evaluation. This is in contrast to
existing statistical methods without model learning. We implement our method in
a prototypical tool named DeepPAC. As a black-box method, DeepPAC is scalable
and efficient, especially when DNNs have complex structures or high-dimensional
inputs. We extensively evaluate DeepPAC, with 4 baselines (using formal
verification, statistical methods, testing and adversarial attack) and 20 DNN
models across 3 datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet. It is shown
that DeepPAC outperforms the state-of-the-art statistical method PROVERO, and

We empirically compare different techniques in image classification datasets

successful residual network architecture and provide an in-depth study on the
possible implementations of spiking residual connections. Our results provide a
state of the art guide to SNN design, which allows to make informed choices
when trying to build the optimal visual feature extractor. Finally, our network

predict protein-ligand binding. These models are of great value to medicinal
chemists, in particular if they provide case-specific insight into the physical
interactions that drive the binding process. In this study we derive ML models
from over 50 fragment-screening campaigns to introduce two important elements
that we believe are absent in most -- if not all -- ML studies of this type
reported to date: First, alongside the observed hits we use to train our
models, we incorporate true misses and show that these experimentally validated
negative data are of significant importance to the quality of the derived
models. Second, we provide a physically interpretable and verifiable
representation of what the ML model considers important for successful binding.
This representation is derived from a straightforward attribution procedure
that explains the prediction in terms of the (inter-)action of chemical
environments. Critically, we validate the attribution outcome on a large scale
against prior annotations made independently by expert molecular modellers. We
find good agreement between the key molecular substructures proposed by the ML
model and those assigned manually, even when the model's performance in
discriminating hits from misses is far from perfect. By projecting the
attribution onto predefined interaction prototypes (pharmacophores), we show
that ML allows us to formulate simple rules for what drives fragment binding

great deal of attention because of their applicability to a wide range of
machine learning problems. Although significant progress has been made
recently, the literature to date has focused on games with independent strategy
sets; little is known about solving games with dependent strategy sets, which
can be characterized as min-max Stackelberg games. We introduce two first-order
methods that solve a large class of convex-concave min-max Stackelberg games,
and show that our methods converge in polynomial time. Min-max Stackelberg
games were first studied by Wald, under the posthumous name of Wald's maximin
model, a variant of which is the main paradigm used in robust optimization,
which means that our methods can likewise solve many convex robust optimization
problems. We observe that the computation of competitive equilibria in Fisher
markets also comprises a min-max Stackelberg game. Further, we demonstrate the
efficacy and efficiency of our algorithms in practice by computing competitive
equilibria in Fisher markets with varying utility structures. Our experiments
suggest potential ways to extend our theoretical results, by demonstrating how
different smoothness properties can affect the convergence rate of our
algorithms.]]></summary>

vulnerabilities and brittleness become a pressing concern. Adversarial attacks
are a popular framework for studying these vulnerabilities. In this work, we
study the error of linear regression in the face of adversarial attacks. We
provide bounds of the error in terms of the traditional risk and the parameter
norm and show how these bounds can be leveraged and make it possible to use
analysis from non-adversarial setups to study the adversarial risk. The
usefulness of these results is illustrated by shedding light on whether or not
overparameterized linear models can be adversarially robust. We show that
adding features to linear models might be either a source of additional
robustness or brittleness. We show that these differences appear due to scaling
and how the $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ norms of random projections concentrate. We
also show how the reformulation we propose allows for solving adversarial
training as a convex optimization problem. This is then used as a tool to study
how adversarial training and other regularization methods might affect the

intelligent agent should be prepared to anticipate a change in its belief of
the environment state, and be capable of adapting its actions on-the-fly to
changing conditions. As humans, we are able to form contingency plans when
learning a task with the explicit aim of being able to correct errors in the
initial control, and hence prove useful if ever there is a sudden change in our
perception of the environment which requires immediate corrective action. This
is especially the case for autonomous vehicles (AVs) navigating real-world
situations where safety is paramount, and a strong ability to react to a
changing belief about the environment is truly needed.

In this paper we explore an end-to-end approach, from training to execution,
for learning robust contingency plans and combining them with a hierarchical
planner to obtain a robust agent policy in an autonomous navigation task where
other vehicles' behaviours are unknown, and the agent's belief about these
behaviours is subject to sudden, last-second change. We show that our approach
results in robust, safe behaviour in a partially observable, stochastic
environment, generalizing well over environment dynamics not seen during
training.]]></summary>

mixing weights of the graph and the data heterogeneity across nodes. We propose
a metric that quantifies the ability of a graph to mix the current gradients.
We further prove that the metric controls the convergence rate, particularly in
settings where the heterogeneity across nodes dominates the stochasticity
between updates for a given node. Motivated by our analysis, we propose an
approach that periodically and efficiently optimizes the metric using standard
convex constrained optimization and sketching techniques. Through comprehensive

of great importance for modern industrial applications. However, building a
system that is able to quickly and accurately pinpoint anomalous observations
is a challenging problem. This is due to the lack of anomaly labels, high data
volatility and the demands of ultra-low inference times in modern applications.
Despite the recent developments of deep learning approaches for anomaly
detection, only a few of them can address all of these challenges. In this
paper, we propose TranAD, a deep transformer network based anomaly detection
and diagnosis model which uses attention-based sequence encoders to swiftly
perform inference with the knowledge of the broader temporal trends in the
data. TranAD uses focus score-based self-conditioning to enable robust
multi-modal feature extraction and adversarial training to gain stability.
Additionally, model-agnostic meta learning (MAML) allows us to train the model
using limited data. Extensive empirical studies on six publicly available
datasets demonstrate that TranAD can outperform state-of-the-art baseline
methods in detection and diagnosis performance with data and time-efficient
training. Specifically, TranAD increases F1 scores by up to 17%, reducing
training times by up to 99% compared to the baselines.]]></summary>

two key insights: (1) the similarity between the Bellman equation and the
stationary state-action distribution equation allows us to derive a novel
temporal difference (TD) learning approach; and (2) the use of a deterministic
policy simplifies the TD learning. Combined, these insights yield a practical
algorithm, Deterministic and Discriminative Imitation (D2-Imitation), which
operates by first partitioning samples into two replay buffers and then
learning a deterministic policy via off-policy reinforcement learning. Our
empirical results show that D2-Imitation is effective in achieving good sample
efficiency, outperforming several off-policy extension approaches of
adversarial imitation on many control tasks.]]></summary>

theoretical and practical challenges for learning accurate preferences from
rich behavior data. Among existing user behavior modeling solutions, attention
networks are widely adopted for its effectiveness and relative simplicity.
Despite being extensively studied, existing attentions still suffer from two
limitations: i) conventional attentions mainly take into account the spatial
correlation between user behaviors, regardless the distance between those
behaviors in the continuous time space; and ii) these attentions mostly provide
a dense and undistinguished distribution over all past behaviors then
attentively encode them into the output latent representations. This is however
not suitable in practical scenarios where a user's future actions are relevant
to a small subset of her/his historical behaviors. In this paper, we propose a
novel attention network, named self-modulating attention, that models the
complex and non-linearly evolving dynamic user preferences. We empirically
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on top-N sequential recommendation
tasks, and the results on three large-scale real-world datasets show that our
model can achieve state-of-the-art performance.]]></summary>

having encountered many applications in Structural Dynamics and Vibroacoustic
(SD\&V). The increasing capabilities of ML to unveil insights from data, driven
by unprecedented data availability, algorithms advances and computational
power, enhance decision making, uncertainty handling, patterns recognition and
real-time assessments. Three main applications in SD\&V have taken advantage of
these benefits. In Structural Health Monitoring, ML detection and prognosis
lead to safe operation and optimized maintenance schedules. System
identification and control design are leveraged by ML techniques in Active
Noise Control and Active Vibration Control. Finally, the so-called ML-based
surrogate models provide fast alternatives to costly simulations, enabling
robust and optimized product design. Despite the many works in the area, they
have not been reviewed and analyzed. Therefore, to keep track and understand
this ongoing integration of fields, this paper presents a survey of ML
applications in SD\&V analyses, shedding light on the current state of
implementation and emerging opportunities. The main methodologies, advantages,
limitations, and recommendations based on scientific knowledge were identified
for each of the three applications. Moreover, the paper considers the role of
Digital Twins and Physics Guided ML to overcome current challenges and power
future research progress. As a result, the survey provides a broad overview of
the present landscape of ML applied in SD\&V and guides the reader to an
advanced understanding of progress and prospects in the field.]]></summary>

However, most existing approaches toward decentralized learning disregard the
interaction between data heterogeneity and graph topology. In this paper, we
characterize the dependence of convergence on the relationship between the
mixing weights of the graph and the data heterogeneity across nodes. We propose
a metric that quantifies the ability of a graph to mix the current gradients.
We further prove that the metric controls the convergence rate, particularly in
settings where the heterogeneity across nodes dominates the stochasticity
between updates for a given node. Motivated by our analysis, we propose an
approach that periodically and efficiently optimizes the metric using standard
convex constrained optimization and sketching techniques. Through comprehensive
experiments on standard computer vision and NLP benchmarks, we show that our
approach leads to improvement in test performance for a wide range of tasks.]]></summary>

and time series types can progress our understanding and modelling ability of
the Earth's hydroclimate and its dynamics. As a step towards these important
directions, we here propose and extensively apply a multifaceted and
engineering-friendly methodological framework for the thorough characterization
of seasonal hydroclimatic dependence, variability and change at the global
scale. We apply this framework using over 13 000 quarterly temperature,
precipitation and river flow time series. In these time series, the seasonal
hydroclimatic behaviour is represented by 3-month means of earth-observed
variables. In our analyses, we also adopt the well-established Koppen-Geiger
climate classification system and define continental-scale regions with large
or medium density of observational stations. In this context, we provide in
parallel seasonal hydroclimatic feature summaries and comparisons in terms of
autocorrelation, seasonality, temporal variation, entropy, long-range
dependence and trends. We find notable differences to characterize the
magnitudes of most of these features across the various Koppen-Geiger climate
classes, as well as between several continental-scale geographical regions. We,
therefore, deem that the consideration of the comparative summaries could be
more beneficial in water resources engineering contexts than the also provided
global summaries. Lastly, we apply explainable machine learning to compare the
investigated features with respect to how informative they are in explaining
and predicting either the main Koppen-Geiger climate or the continental-scale
region, with the entropy, long-range dependence and trend features being
(roughly) found to be less informative than the remaining ones at the seasonal
time scale.]]></summary>

massive datasets exhibiting a possibly complex spatial dependence structure are
becoming increasingly available. In this context, the standard probabilistic
theory of statistical learning does not apply directly and guarantees of the
generalization capacity of predictive rules learned from such data are left to
establish. We analyze here the simple Kriging task, the flagship problem in
Geostatistics: the values of a square integrable random field $X=\{X_s\}_{s\in
S}$, $S\subset \mathbb{R}^2$, with unknown covariance structure are to be
predicted with minimum quadratic risk, based upon observing a single
realization of the spatial process at a finite number of locations $s_1,\;
\ldots,\; s_n$ in $S$. Despite the connection of this minimization problem with
kernel ridge regression, establishing the generalization capacity of empirical
risk minimizers is far from straightforward, due to the non i.i.d. nature of
the spatial data $X_{s_1},\; \ldots,\; X_{s_n}$ involved. In this article,
nonasymptotic bounds of order $O_{\mathbb{P}}(1/n)$ are proved for the excess
risk of a plug-in predictive rule mimicking the true minimizer in the case of
isotropic stationary Gaussian processes observed at locations forming a regular
grid. These theoretical results, as well as the role played by the technical
conditions required to establish them, are illustrated by various numerical
experiments and hopefully pave the way for further developments in statistical
learning based on spatial data.]]></summary>

anisotropic models -- in which messages sent between nodes are a function of
both the source and target node -- are required to achieve state-of-the-art
performance. Benchmarks to date have demonstrated that these models perform
better than comparable isotropic models -- where messages are a function of the
source node only. In this work we provide empirical evidence challenging this
narrative: we propose an isotropic GNN, which we call Efficient Graph
Convolution (EGC), that consistently outperforms comparable anisotropic models,
including the popular GAT or PNA architectures by using spatially-varying
adaptive filters. In addition to raising important questions for the GNN
community, our work has significant real-world implications for efficiency. EGC
achieves higher model accuracy, with lower memory consumption and latency,
along with characteristics suited to accelerator implementation, while being a
drop-in replacement for existing architectures. As an isotropic model, it
requires memory proportional to the number of vertices in the graph
($\mathcal{O}(V)$); in contrast, anisotropic models require memory proportional
to the number of edges ($\mathcal{O}(E)$). We demonstrate that EGC outperforms
existing approaches across 6 large and diverse benchmark datasets, and conclude
by discussing questions that our work raise for the community going forward.

present a practical framework from a model learning perspective. Based on
black-box model learning with scenario optimisation, we abstract the local
behaviour of a DNN via an affine model with the probably approximately correct
(PAC) guarantee. From the learned model, we can infer the corresponding
PAC-model robustness property. The innovation of our work is the integration of
model learning into PAC robustness analysis: that is, we construct a PAC
guarantee on the model level instead of sample distribution, which induces a
more faithful and accurate robustness evaluation. This is in contrast to
existing statistical methods without model learning. We implement our method in
a prototypical tool named DeepPAC. As a black-box method, DeepPAC is scalable
and efficient, especially when DNNs have complex structures or high-dimensional
inputs. We extensively evaluate DeepPAC, with 4 baselines (using formal
verification, statistical methods, testing and adversarial attack) and 20 DNN
models across 3 datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet. It is shown
that DeepPAC outperforms the state-of-the-art statistical method PROVERO, and
it achieves more practical robustness analysis than the formal verification

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Random field Monte Carlo (MC) reliability analysis is a robust stochastic
method to determine the probability of failure. This method, however, requires
a large number of numerical simulations demanding high computational costs.
This paper explores the efficiency of different machine learning (ML)
algorithms used as surrogate models trained on a limited number of random field
slope stability simulations in predicting the results of large datasets. The MC
data in this paper require only the examination of failure or non-failure,
circumventing the time-consuming calculation of factors of safety. An extensive
dataset is generated, consisting of 120,000 finite difference MC slope
stability simulations incorporating different levels of soil heterogeneity and
anisotropy. The Bagging Ensemble, Random Forest and Support Vector classifiers
are found to be the superior models for this problem amongst 9 different models
and ensemble classifiers. Trained only on 0.47% of data (500 samples), the ML
model can classify the entire 120,000 samples with an accuracy of %85 and AUC
score of %91. The performance of ML methods in classifying the random field
slope stability results generally reduces with higher anisotropy and
heterogeneity of soil. The ML assisted MC reliability analysis proves a robust
stochastic method where errors in the predicted probability of failure using %5
of MC data is only %0.46 in average. The approach reduced the computational
time from 306 days to less than 6 hours.]]></summary>

Conditional Gradients Approximately Vanishing Ideal algorithm (CGAVI) for the
construction of the set of generators of the approximately vanishing ideal. The
constructed set of generators captures polynomial structures in data and gives
rise to a feature map that can, for example, be used in combination with a
linear classifier for supervised learning. In CGAVI, we construct the set of
generators by solving specific instances of (constrained) convex optimization
problems with the Pairwise Frank-Wolfe algorithm (PFW). Among other things, the
constructed generators inherit the LASSO generalization bound and not only
vanish on the training but also on out-sample data. Moreover, CGAVI admits a
compact representation of the approximately vanishing ideal by constructing few

vulnerabilities and brittleness become a pressing concern. Adversarial attacks
are a popular framework for studying these vulnerabilities. In this work, we
study the error of linear regression in the face of adversarial attacks. We
provide bounds of the error in terms of the traditional risk and the parameter
norm and show how these bounds can be leveraged and make it possible to use
analysis from non-adversarial setups to study the adversarial risk. The
usefulness of these results is illustrated by shedding light on whether or not
overparameterized linear models can be adversarially robust. We show that
adding features to linear models might be either a source of additional
robustness or brittleness. We show that these differences appear due to scaling
and how the $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ norms of random projections concentrate. We
also show how the reformulation we propose allows for solving adversarial
training as a convex optimization problem. This is then used as a tool to study
how adversarial training and other regularization methods might affect the

Neural Operators, generations of neural networks with capability of learning
maps between infinite-dimensional spaces, are strong tools for solving
parametric PDEs. However, they lack the ability to modeling SPDEs which usually
have poor regularity due to the driving noise. As the theory of regularity
structure has achieved great successes in analyzing SPDEs and provides the
concept model feature vectors that well-approximate SPDEs' solutions, we
propose the Neural Operator with Regularity Structure (NORS) which incorporates
the feature vectors for modeling dynamics driven by SPDEs. We conduct
experiments on various of SPDEs including the dynamic Phi41 model and the 2d
stochastic Navier-Stokes equation, and the results demonstrate that the NORS is

data-driven speech processing methods, a major challenge for speech data
scientists in the healthcare domain is the anonymization of pathological

compare their speaker verifiability with that of healthy individuals. We
utilize a large pathological speech corpus of more than 2,000 test subjects
with various speech and voice disorders from different ages and apply DL-based
automatic speaker verification (ASV) techniques. As a result, we obtained a
mean equal error rate (EER) of 0.86% with a standard deviation of 0.16%, which
is a factor of three lower than comparable healthy speech databases. We further
perform detailed analyses of external influencing factors on ASV such as age,
pathology, recording environment, and utterance length, to explore their
respective effect. Our findings indicate that speech pathology is a potential
biomarker in ASV. This is potentially of high interest for the anonymization of

know what it knows and, also, what it does not know. This capability relies on
the quality of \textit{joint} predictions of labels assigned to multiple
inputs. Conventional neural networks lack this capability and, since most
research has focused on marginal predictions, this shortcoming has been largely
overlooked. By assessing the quality of joint predictions it is possible to
determine whether a neural network effectively distinguishes between epistemic
uncertainty (that due to lack of knowledge) and aleatoric uncertainty (that due
to chance). We introduce the \textit{epistemic neural network} (ENN) as a
general interface for uncertainty modeling in deep learning. While prior
approaches to uncertainty modeling can be viewed as ENNs, the new interface
facilitates comparison of joint predictions, and the design of novel
architectures and algorithms. In particular, we introduce the \textit{epinet}:
an architecture that can supplement any existing neural network, including
pretrained models, and trained with modest incremental computation to represent
uncertainty. With an epinet, conventional neural networks outperform very large
ensembles, consisting of hundreds or more particles, with orders of magnitude
less computation. We demonstrate this efficacy across synthetic data, ImageNet,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The click-through rate (CTR) prediction task is to predict whether a user
will click on the recommended item. As mind-boggling amounts of data are
produced online daily, accelerating CTR prediction model training is critical
to ensuring an up-to-date model and reducing the training cost. One approach to
increase the training speed is to apply large batch training. However, as shown
in computer vision and natural language processing tasks, training with a large
batch easily suffers from the loss of accuracy. Our experiments show that
previous scaling rules fail in the training of CTR prediction neural networks.
To tackle this problem, we first theoretically show that different frequencies
of ids make it challenging to scale hyperparameters when scaling the batch
size. To stabilize the training process in a large batch size setting, we
develop the adaptive Column-wise Clipping (CowClip). It enables an easy and
effective scaling rule for the embeddings, which keeps the learning rate
unchanged and scales the L2 loss. We conduct extensive experiments with four
CTR prediction networks on two real-world datasets and successfully scaled 128
times the original batch size without accuracy loss. In particular, for CTR
prediction model DeepFM training on the Criteo dataset, our optimization
framework enlarges the batch size from 1K to 128K with over 0.1% AUC
improvement and reduces training time from 12 hours to 10 minutes on a single
V100 GPU. Our code locates at https://github.com/zhengzangw/LargeBatchCTR.]]></summary>

problem with several possible applications in various kinds of network-based
problems. While several methods have been proposed for tackling the influence
maximisation (IM) problem, their runtime typically scales poorly when the
network size increases. Here, we propose an original method, based on network
downscaling, that allows a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) to
solve the IM problem on a reduced scale network, while preserving the relevant
properties of the original network. The downscaled solution is then upscaled to
the original network, using a mechanism based on centrality metrics such as
PageRank. Our results on eight large networks (including two with $\sim$50k
nodes) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with a more than
10-fold runtime gain compared to the time needed on the original network, and
an up to $82\%$ time reduction compared to CELF.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is a versatile tool widely used in
uncertainty quantification and machine learning, but its successful application
depends strongly on the accuracy and reliability of the resulting PCE-based
response surface. High accuracy typically requires high polynomial degrees,
demanding many training points especially in high-dimensional problems through
the curse of dimensionality. So-called sparse PCE concepts work with a much
smaller selection of basis polynomials compared to conventional PCE approaches
and can overcome the curse of dimensionality very efficiently, but have to pay
specific attention to their strategies of choosing training points.
Furthermore, the approximation error resembles an uncertainty that most
existing PCE-based methods do not estimate. In this study, we develop and
evaluate a fully Bayesian approach to establish the PCE representation via
joint shrinkage priors and Markov chain Monte Carlo. The suggested Bayesian PCE
model directly aims to solve the two challenges named above: achieving a sparse
PCE representation and estimating uncertainty of the PCE itself. The embedded
Bayesian regularizing via the joint shrinkage prior allows using higher
polynomial degrees for given training points due to its ability to handle
underdetermined situations, where the number of considered PCE coefficients
could be much larger than the number of available training points. We also
explore multiple variable selection methods to construct sparse PCE expansions
based on the established Bayesian representations, while globally selecting the
most meaningful orthonormal polynomials given the available training data. We
demonstrate the advantages of our Bayesian PCE and the corresponding
sparsity-inducing methods on several benchmarks.]]></summary>

addressing data availability issues in various domains. Even more challenging
is the generation of synthetic time series data, where one has to preserve
temporal dynamics, i.e., the generated time series must respect the original
relationships between variables across time. Recently proposed techniques such
as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and quantum-GANs lack the ability to
attend to the time series specific temporal correlations adequately. We propose
using the inherent nature of quantum computers to simulate quantum dynamics as
a technique to encode such features. We start by assuming that a given time
series can be generated by a quantum process, after which we proceed to learn
that quantum process using quantum machine learning. We then use the learned
model to generate out-of-sample time series and show that it captures unique
and complex features of the learned time series. We also study the class of
time series that can be modeled using this technique. Finally, we
experimentally demonstrate the proposed algorithm on an 11-qubit trapped-ion

including device defects, manufacturing variability, and input encoding noise.
We test our framework on various DT datasets including \textit{Give Me Some

between vertices and hyperedges in an end-to-end manner and thus the task-aware
hypergraph is learned. Furthermore, HERALD employs the self-attention mechanism
to capture the non-local paired-nodes relation. Extensive experiments on

know what it knows and, also, what it does not know. This capability relies on
the quality of \textit{joint} predictions of labels assigned to multiple
inputs. Conventional neural networks lack this capability and, since most
research has focused on marginal predictions, this shortcoming has been largely
overlooked. By assessing the quality of joint predictions it is possible to
determine whether a neural network effectively distinguishes between epistemic
uncertainty (that due to lack of knowledge) and aleatoric uncertainty (that due
to chance). We introduce the \textit{epistemic neural network} (ENN) as a
general interface for uncertainty modeling in deep learning. While prior
approaches to uncertainty modeling can be viewed as ENNs, the new interface
facilitates comparison of joint predictions, and the design of novel
architectures and algorithms. In particular, we introduce the \textit{epinet}:
an architecture that can supplement any existing neural network, including
pretrained models, and trained with modest incremental computation to represent
uncertainty. With an epinet, conventional neural networks outperform very large
ensembles, consisting of hundreds or more particles, with orders of magnitude
less computation. We demonstrate this efficacy across synthetic data, ImageNet,

blend flexible machine learning classifiers within ABC to automate fake/real

an exponential weighting scheme which does not require the ABC acceptance

posterior distributions concentrate around the true parameter depends on the

solution for a specified task, even though diverse solutions often exist.
Recent studies showed that learning a set of diverse solutions is beneficial
because diversity enables robust few-shot adaptation. Although existing methods
learn diverse solutions by using the mutual information as unsupervised
rewards, such an approach often suffers from the bias of the gradient estimator
induced by value function approximation. In this study, we propose a novel
method that can learn diverse solutions without suffering the bias problem. In
our method, a policy conditioned on a continuous or discrete latent variable is
trained by directly maximizing the variational lower bound of the mutual
information, instead of using the mutual information as unsupervised rewards as
in previous studies. Through extensive experiments on robot locomotion tasks,
we demonstrate that the proposed method successfully learns an infinite set of
diverse solutions by learning continuous latent variables, which is more
challenging than learning a finite number of solutions. Subsequently, we show
that our method enables more effective few-shot adaptation compared with
existing methods.]]></summary>

the central limit theorem (CLT). Our methods take the form of confidence
sequences (CS) -- sequences of confidence intervals that are uniformly valid
over time. CSs provide valid inference at arbitrary stopping times, incurring
no penalties for "peeking" at the data, unlike classical confidence intervals
which require the sample size to be fixed in advance. Existing CSs in the
literature are nonasymptotic, requiring strong assumptions on the data, while
the classical (fixed-time) CLT is ubiquitous due to the weak assumptions it
imposes. Our work bridges the gap by introducing time-uniform CSs that only
require CLT-like assumptions. While the CLT approximates the distribution of a
sample average by that of a Gaussian at a fixed sample size, we use strong
invariance principles like the seminal work of Koml\'os, Major, and Tusn\'ady
to uniformly approximate the entire sample average process by an implicit
Brownian motion. Applying Robbins' normal mixture martingale method to this
Brownian motion then yields closed-form time-uniform boundaries. We combine
these boundaries with doubly robust estimators to derive nonparametric CSs for
the average treatment effect (and other causal estimands). These allow
randomized experiments and observational studies to be continuously monitored
and adaptively stopped, all while controlling the type-I error.]]></summary>

utilizing ensemble learning strategies. The idea of ensemble learning is to
assemble diverse models or multiple predictions and, thus, boost prediction
performance. However, it is still an open question to what extent as well as
which ensemble learning strategies are beneficial in deep learning based
medical image classification pipelines. In this work, we proposed a
reproducible medical image classification pipeline for analyzing the
performance impact of the following ensemble learning techniques: Augmenting,
Stacking, and Bagging. The pipeline consists of state-of-the-art preprocessing
and image augmentation methods as well as 9 deep convolution neural network
architectures. It was applied on four popular medical imaging datasets with
varying complexity. Furthermore, 12 pooling functions for combining multiple
predictions were analyzed, ranging from simple statistical functions like
unweighted averaging up to more complex learning-based functions like support
vector machines. Our results revealed that Stacking achieved the largest
performance gain of up to 13% F1-score increase. Augmenting showed consistent
improvement capabilities by up to 4% and is also applicable to single model
based pipelines. Cross-validation based Bagging demonstrated significant
performance gain close to Stacking, which resulted in an F1-score increase up
to +11%. Furthermore, we demonstrated that simple statistical pooling functions
are equal or often even better than more complex pooling functions. We
concluded that the integration of ensemble learning techniques is a powerful
method for any medical image classification pipeline to improve robustness and
boost performance.]]></summary>

in various dynamic system scenarios, for example, system identification and
prognostic and health management of machines. To this end, we combine the
advances in both deep generative models and state space model (SSM) to come up
with a novel, data-driven deep probabilistic sequence model. Specifically, we
follow the popular encoder-decoder generative structure to build the recurrent
neural networks (RNN) assisted variational sequence model on an augmented
recurrent input space, which could induce rich stochastic sequence dependency.
Besides, in order to alleviate the inconsistency issue of the posterior between
training and predicting as well as improving the mining of dynamic patterns, we
(i) propose using a lagged hybrid output as input for the posterior at next
time step, which brings training and predicting into alignment; and (ii)
further devise a generalized auto-regressive strategy that encodes all the
historical dependencies for the posterior. Thereafter, we first investigate the
methodological characteristics of the proposed deep probabilistic sequence
model on toy cases, and then comprehensively demonstrate the superiority of our
model against existing deep probabilistic SSM models through extensive
numerical experiments on eight system identification benchmarks from various
dynamic systems. Finally, we apply our sequence model to a real-world
centrifugal compressor forecasting problem, and again verify its outstanding
performance by quantifying the time series predictive distribution.]]></summary>

functionality in Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs) due to its
effectiveness in helping people decide the next POI to visit. However, accurate
recommendation requires a vast amount of historical check-in data, thus
threatening user privacy as the location-sensitive data needs to be handled by
cloud servers. Although there have been several on-device frameworks for
privacy-preserving POI recommendations, they are still resource-intensive when
it comes to storage and computation, and show limited robustness to the high
sparsity of user-POI interactions. On this basis, we propose a novel
decentralized collaborative learning framework for POI recommendation (DCLR),
which allows users to train their personalized models locally in a
collaborative manner. DCLR significantly reduces the local models' dependence
on the cloud for training, and can be used to expand arbitrary centralized
recommendation models. To counteract the sparsity of on-device user data when
learning each local model, we design two self-supervision signals to pretrain
the POI representations on the server with geographical and categorical
correlations of POIs. To facilitate collaborative learning, we innovatively
propose to incorporate knowledge from either geographically or semantically
similar users into each local model with attentive aggregation and mutual
information maximization. The collaborative learning process makes use of
communications between devices while requiring only minor engagement from the
central server for identifying user groups, and is compatible with common
privacy preservation mechanisms like differential privacy.]]></summary>

well training a recommendation model. We argue that a high-quality negative
should be both \textit{informativeness} and \textit{unbiasedness}. Although
previous studies have proposed some approaches to address the informativeness
in negative sampling, few has been done to discriminating false negative from
true negative for unbiased negative sampling, not to mention taking both into
consideration. This paper first adopts a parameter learning perspective to
analyze negative informativeness and unbiasedness in loss gradient-based model
training. We argue that both negative sampling and collaborative filtering
include an implicit task of negative classification, from which we report an
insightful yet beneficial finding about the order relation in predicted
negatives' scores. Based on our finding and by regarding negatives as random
variables, we next derive the class condition density of true negatives and
that of false negatives. We also design a Bayesian classifier for negative
classification, from which we define a quantitative unbiasedness measure for
negatives. Finally, we propose to use a harmonic mean of informativeness and
unbiasedness to sample high-quality negatives. Experimental studies validate
the superiority of our negative sampling algorithm over the peers in terms of
better sampling quality and better recommendation performance.]]></summary>

closed information extraction, the problem of extracting an exhaustive set of

pipelines prone to error accumulation, and all approaches are only applicable
to unrealistically small numbers of entities and relations. We introduce GenIE

language knowledge from the pre-trained transformer by autoregressively
generating relations and entities in textual form. Thanks to a new bi-level

knowledge base schema are produced. Our experiments show that GenIE is
state-of-the-art on closed information extraction, generalizes from fewer

becomes practical in realistic scenarios, providing new opportunities for

discrimination by machine learning algorithms. This article introduces the
Active Diffusion and VCA-Assisted Image Segmentation (ADVIS) for active
material discrimination. ADVIS selects high-purity, high-density pixels that
are far in diffusion distance (a data-dependent metric) from other high-purity,
high-density pixels in the hyperspectral image. The ground truth labels of
these pixels are queried and propagated to the rest of the image. The ADVIS
active learning algorithm is shown to strongly outperform its fully

removing unimportant neurons. While this can be elegantly achieved by applying
sparsity-inducing regularisation on BatchNorm parameters, an L1 penalty would
shrink all scaling factors rather than just those of superfluous neurons. To
tackle this issue, we introduce a simple BatchNorm variation with bounded
scaling parameters, based on which we design a novel regularisation term that
suppresses only neurons with low importance. Under our method, the weights of
unnecessary neurons effectively recede, producing a polarised bimodal
distribution of importances. We show that neural networks trained this way can
be pruned to a larger extent and with less deterioration. We one-shot prune VGG
and ResNet architectures at different ratios on CIFAR and ImagenNet datasets.
In the case of VGG-style networks, our method significantly outperforms
existing approaches particularly under a severe pruning regime.]]></summary>

but via multiple data views. For example, in genomic medicine, a patient can be
described by data from different molecular layers. This raises the need for
multi-view models that are able to disentangle variation within and across data
views in an interpretable manner. Latent variable models with structured
sparsity are a commonly used tool to address this modeling task but
interpretability is cumbersome since it requires a direct inspection and
interpretation of each factor via a specialized domain expert. Here, we propose
MuVI, a novel approach for domain-informed multi-view latent variable models,
facilitating the analysis of multi-view data in an inherently explainable
manner. We demonstrate that our model (i) is able to integrate noisy domain
expertise in form of feature sets, (ii) is robust to noise in the encoded
domain knowledge, (iii) results in identifiable factors and (iv) is able to
infer interpretable and biologically meaningful axes of variation in a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many software systems today face uncertain operating conditions, such as
sudden changes in the availability of resources or unexpected user behavior.
Without proper mitigation these uncertainties can jeopardize the system goals.
Self-adaptation is a common approach to tackle such uncertainties. When the
system goals may be compromised, the self-adaptive system has to select the
best adaptation option to reconfigure by analyzing the possible adaptation
options, i.e., the adaptation space. Yet, analyzing large adaptation spaces
using rigorous methods can be resource- and time-consuming, or even be
infeasible. One approach to tackle this problem is by using online machine
learning to reduce adaptation spaces. However, existing approaches require
domain expertise to perform feature engineering to define the learner, and
support online adaptation space reduction only for specific goals. To tackle
these limitations, we present 'Deep Learning for Adaptation Space Reduction
Plus' -- DLASeR+ in short. DLASeR+ offers an extendable learning framework for
online adaptation space reduction that does not require feature engineering,
while supporting three common types of adaptation goals: threshold,
optimization, and set-point goals. We evaluate DLASeR+ on two instances of an
Internet-of-Things application with increasing sizes of adaptation spaces for
different combinations of adaptation goals. We compare DLASeR+ with a baseline
that applies exhaustive analysis and two state-of-the-art approaches for
adaptation space reduction that rely on learning. Results show that DLASeR+ is
effective with a negligible effect on the realization of the adaptation goals
compared to an exhaustive analysis approach, and supports three common types of
adaptation goals beyond the state-of-the-art approaches.]]></summary>

lumpiness, stability, nonlinearity, linearity, spikiness, curvature and others.
We estimated these features for daily temperature, precipitation and streamflow
time series from 511 catchments, and then merged them within regionalization
contexts with traditional topographic, land cover, soil and geologic
attributes. Precipitation and temperature features (e.g., the spectral entropy,
seasonality strength and lag-1 autocorrelation of the precipitation time
series, and the stability and trend strength of the temperature time series)
were found to be useful predictors of many streamflow features. The same
applies to traditional attributes, such as the catchment mean elevation.
Relationships between predictor and dependent variables were also revealed,
while the spectral entropy, the seasonality strength and several
autocorrelation features of the streamflow time series were found to be more
regionalizable than others.]]></summary>

for time-frequency analysis. We proposed a random feature method for analyzing
time-series data by constructing a sparse approximation to the spectrogram. The
randomization is both in the time window locations and the frequency sampling,
which lowers the overall sampling and computational cost. The sparsification of
the spectrogram leads to a sharp separation between time-frequency clusters
which makes it easier to identify intrinsic modes, and thus leads to a new
data-driven mode decomposition. The applications include signal representation,
outlier removal, and mode decomposition. On the benchmark tests, we show that

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Structured and grounded representation of text is typically formalized by
closed information extraction, the problem of extracting an exhaustive set of
(subject, relation, object) triplets that are consistent with a predefined set
of entities and relations from a knowledge base schema. Most existing works are
pipelines prone to error accumulation, and all approaches are only applicable
to unrealistically small numbers of entities and relations. We introduce GenIE
(generative information extraction), the first end-to-end autoregressive
formulation of closed information extraction. GenIE naturally exploits the
language knowledge from the pre-trained transformer by autoregressively
generating relations and entities in textual form. Thanks to a new bi-level
constrained generation strategy, only triplets consistent with the predefined
knowledge base schema are produced. Our experiments show that GenIE is
state-of-the-art on closed information extraction, generalizes from fewer
training data points than baselines, and scales to a previously unmanageable
number of entities and relations. With this work, closed information extraction
becomes practical in realistic scenarios, providing new opportunities for
downstream tasks. Finally, this work paves the way towards a unified end-to-end
approach to the core tasks of information extraction. Code, data and models

information is central to many problems in statistics and machine learning, but
challenging in high dimensions. This paper presents estimators of entropy via
inference (EEVI), which deliver upper and lower bounds on many information
quantities for arbitrary variables in a probabilistic generative model. These
estimators use importance sampling with proposal distribution families that
include amortized variational inference and sequential Monte Carlo, which can
be tailored to the target model and used to squeeze true information values
with high accuracy. We present several theoretical properties of EEVI and
demonstrate scalability and efficacy on two problems from the medical domain:
(i) in an expert system for diagnosing liver disorders, we rank medical tests
according to how informative they are about latent diseases, given a pattern of
observed symptoms and patient attributes; and (ii) in a differential equation
model of carbohydrate metabolism, we find optimal times to take blood glucose
measurements that maximize information about a diabetic patient's insulin
sensitivity, given their meal and medication schedule.]]></summary>

 I am looking to find the most appropriate models to use for this task. The first thing that came to my mind was semantic segmentation.

I believe other transformer architectures can also be ported to JS like this. This is the link to the original paper of SwinIR.
 It requires around 1 GB of RAM to run. The size of model folder is 44 MB. It is quantized to float16.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[3D landscape modeling has seen a rise in its popularity and applications in recent years. It has countless applications in the fields of civil engineering, earth sciences, military applications, and many others. Geometric 3D models are typically developed using the city geography markup language (CityGML), and the Level-of-Detail (LoD) building model is the preferred model for building 3D models using CityGML. 
 The use of Satellite imagery for landscape modeling provides the advantage of covering a wide area and is low cost. However, developing LoD2 models using satellite imagery remains a big challenge. Building models in such a way involves complex steps demanding heuristics-based approaches and ML-based detection paradigms.
 In a recent paper, researchers at the Ohio State University propose a SAT2LoD2 to facilitate the development of 3D landscape models. SAT2LoD2 is an open-source, python-based GUI-enabled software that takes the satellite images as inputs and returns LoD2 building models as outputs. The software also has the feature of taking road networks and custom maps as additional inputs for better results.

Modern conversational agents need to integrate with an ever-increasing number of services to perform a wide variety of tasks, from booking flights and finding restaurants, to playing music and telling jokes. Adding this functionality can be difficult — for each new task, one needs to collect new data and retrain the models that power the conversational agent. This is because most task-oriented dialogue (TOD) models are trained on a single task-specific ontology. An ontology is generally represented as a list of possible user intents (e.g., if the user wants to book a flight, if the user wants to play some music, etc.) and possible parameter slots to extract from the conversation (e.g., the date of the flight, the…]]></summary>

 Not speaking specifically about autoencoders here, but about general neural networks. As I understand correctly, "latent space" refers to one of the fully connected layers of the network and the dimensionality of the space is equal to the number of the neurons in this layer. This would mean, that each of the layers has a different "latent space" representation of the learned data distribution. Do I understand it correctly? 
 I got really confused because people seem to sometimes refer to latent space as to all of the possible activations of all of the neurons in the network (each neuron of the network is one dimension of a latent space) OR EVEN to all of the PARAMETERS of the network (each parameter is one dimension of the latent space (??)). Do we have a separate name for these? How do we call the parameter space of a neural network? Is my original intuition even correct?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to train a seq2seq model that generates a sentence with T words using reinforcement learning. The input and all the previously generated words form the state of the environment, and generating a word in the sentence is considered an action. In the previous methods [1, 2], the immediate reward r(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}) for the t-th action a_t is 0 when t < T, and the reward is the CIDEr score (a scalar that measures the quality of the sentence) of the entire sentence when t = T. The policy is updated after the entire sentence is generated.
 I designed a new reward for each action, and the new reward for the t-th action is not zero when t < T. However, the reward of each action can only be calculated when the entire sentence is generated since it relies on the CIDEr score of the entire sentence, i.e. the reward for all the actions relies on the final state s_T. Can I still define the reward in the form of r(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}) ?

 I'm currently developing a library in my free time trying to fill the gap. And I also want the library to get well integrated with most users' deployment environments.

 The dataset contains 91 unique YouTube channels, and 10 categories, these categories are assigned by me manually to these channels. (Comedy, Science, Automobile, VideoGames, Food, Entertainment, Informative, Blog, News, Tech)
 All kinds of feedback and criticism are welcome, and also if you guys want some particular channel to be included in both these datasets, feel free to comment on this post, or raise an issue on the Github repositories for both these datasets, I will surely add them in the next version.

How could I improve my score with the data from Spain with the help of data from France ? 
 Could I use transfer learning, or data mutualization, or data augmentation ? If anyone has faced before a similar problem, or has read some papers about it, I would love to hear about it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I am creating a multiple-goal environment. Which is an 8*8 discrete map with a start and terminal state (only one) change after each episode. The reward is 100 for reaching the terminal state and -1 for the rest. In fact, I am not sure if the reward is reasonable. 
 I used PPO from SB3 and I can easily finish it. But when I go offline, using HER+DQN, the training is very bad. 
 Feel free to run it here or take a look at the env and training result. Thank you so much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this research, the researchers from the paper ‘ LilNetX: Lightweight Networks with EXtreme Model Compression and Structured Sparsification’ talk about the importance of larger parameter-heavy and computationally costly architectures in deep neural networks (DNNs) and how it improves the computer vision tasks. They also mentioned in the paper that it is not as simple as it seems since, as the DNNs become more common in the business, they are frequently required to be trained multiple times, communicated across the network to various devices, and executed under hardware limits with minimum loss of accuracy, all while maintaining accuracy. Then the question arises of how to reduce the models’ size on the devices while still enhancing their run-time. Explorations in this field have tended to take one of two paths: lowering model size via compression approaches or reducing computing demands through model pruning.
 The main achievement of this research from the University of Maryland and Google Research is the introduction of ‘LilNetX’, an end-to-end trainable neural network technique that allows learning models with specified accuracy-rate-computation trade-offs. Prior work has taken a piecemeal approach to these difficulties, which necessitates post-processing or multistage training, which is not efficient and does not scale well for big datasets or architectures. To encourage modest model size, the strategy is to create a joint training goal that penalizes the self-information of network parameters in a reparameterized latent space while simultaneously incorporating priors to increase structured sparsity in the parameter space to decrease computation.

 I am working on a MARL fintech project where I use DDQN and for Q-value, I use LSTM bacause it is time series data. This is a project overview. It has 7 features which is derivatives of ask and bid price and has 12 action spaces for action taking.
 Is it possible to generate a good reliable model using only 7 features for 12 action spaces?
 Number of feature or quality of feature is important for taking good decision in RL.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 Im trying to get up to date with Deep Learning literature, so the last week I was going through CNNs. Here's a general view of what Ive learned so far.
  
Large filters suck, you can get better accuracy with smaller filters and more non linearities
 
Depth is the most important for CNNs over width or filter sizes.
 
ReLU activation is generally better, as Sigmoid/tanh gradients tend to fall off towards the ends
 
Convolution layers are only translation invariant. Stacking multiple features together and passing them through MaxPool helps rotational invariance and scaling although not completely 
 
Residual connection help address vanishing gradient and help improve the overall training procedure
 
Inception models worked well, as they mixed different filter sizes together helping the model learn diverse features
 
Most current work is with Transformers, although Im not sure why. ConvNext shows similar performance can be achieved through large CNNs
 
 Do add to this if I missed anything, or if there's anything you don't know about

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, these day I really interested in self-supervised RL. Especially only based on state novelty. So I wanted to re-implement APT(Behavior From the Void: Unsupervised Active Pre-Training). but my re-implementation showed not meaningful behaviors compared to official implementation. official implementation uses drq-v2 and intrinsic curiosity module. So, I want to re-implement APT as described in paper(using drq-v1 and contrastive learning).
 Is there someone to check my reimplementation?
 https://github.com/seolhokim/apt
 In that repository, DrQ-v1 works well, but only apt doesn't work! I can't understand why agent stop moving when pre-training.

 Really thank you for reading.

LiDAR and visual cameras are two types of complementary sensors used for 3D object detection in autonomous vehicles and robots. LiDAR, which is a remote sensing technique that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges, provides low-resolution shape and depth information, while cameras provide high-resolution shape and texture information. While the features captured by LiDAR and cameras should be merged together to provide optimal 3D object detection, it turns out that most state-of-the-art 3D object detectors use LiDAR as the only input.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent years, the rise of Deep Learning has continuously brought innovations to many fields, and the medical domain is one of them. AI applications in this field are countless: from pre-operative diagnosis to disease classification, from skill assessment to post-operative rehabilitation. Among them, systems to assess surgical skills and provide feedback to improve technique could help in decreasing the number of complications in surgical procedures, which are still the third leading cause of death globally.
 AI can be an additional coach for surgical trainees and an expert colleague for experienced surgeons. But, to train an AI system, reliable data are fundamental. The more utilized type of data in this context is undoubtedly video streams, as a camera is less invasive than other types of sensors, such as ArmBand or EEG, which could weigh on the surgeon’s performance given their physical bulk. This applies particularly to laparoscopic surgery, where an in-body fiber-optic camera is used to visualize the operating area and facilitate rapid data collection. For this reason, the majority of computer-assisted systems focus on laparoscopic surgery.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 I'm really happy to finally publish the work I've been doing on the Cellular Automata called Lenia. It is a JAX library called Leniax and allows one to simulate thousands of simulations in parallel using CPU, GPU, or TPU.
 With it, you can:
  
Simulate Conway's Game of Life
 Simulate multiple Lenia simulations in parallel
 Use gradient descent to search for Continuous CA parameters
 Launch a QD search to discover a ton of diversity in Lenia.
  
Check out the blog post for some visual results
 The main goal of this work was to advance the state of automatic discovery for those systems. 10 months ago, I bet on QD to do so, turns out it indeed works! QD algorithms really rock!
 The code is completely open-source with all the examples, notebooks, and even experiments I ran. (See the doc for more links)
 I would love to have feedback on this and of course, if you find that subject interesting, engage with our community!
 Cheers!

 By examining the data, I think one of the reasons is that some of the defects such as cracks, or faded pavement markings are not so clear and either casted by a shadow or too bright from the sun.
 Image Example #1
 Or from motion blur
 Image Example #2
 Is there any image preprocessing technique aside maybe from CLAHE that could be applied? Moreover, I am currently using YOLOv5 for this.

 Turns out, the model took more epochs to train when using the retail backbone, then the imagenet one. 
 Isn't this counter-intuitive? What else can I do to make by backbone better?

 I have a fairly interesting project that I am working on. I have a model that has some samples which are completely unpredictable, random noise, and some that are reliably predictable.
 How would you go about separating out the samples which can be predicted, identifying them going forward, and retraining on a cleaned dataset with only those samples?
 Interested to see someone else's approach to this.
 Edit: I forgot to mention that my data is from an embedding matrix from ordinal categorical features.

 How do you deal with that ? and How do you find a niche that no one is touching.
 I just started a PhD, so It's really stressing me out. I feel like I'll never be able to advance on my thesis, and that I should just quit, because better work has already been done.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does anyone have experience training agents to play platformer games like mario? I am trying to train an agent for the platformer game Jump King to get past atleast a few levels, using DQN but the agent is performing poorly after 8000 episodes of training, (one episode being the agent spawns at the start and has 15 seconds or so to jump around gaining reward) he is barely able to get past the first level most of the time :c
 I am using a very basic sequential network of 2 Linear layers with inputDim 4, outputDim 4, and hiddenDim 32. and because my state is not using any image data, its just (current_level, x_pos, y_pos, jumpCount) as input to the network . As for the reward, I am using the y position to give reward if the agent is getting to a new level (large reward) or making progress in the current level (curr_y > old_y), otherwise the agent gets a negative reward.
 Should I consider using a CNN and image data to train this agent like in the atari games paper, or is using image data and a conv net going to perform worse rather than using my current state? Should I consider combining image data with the current state, or just keeping the current non-image data state but ?
 Also, roughly how long should I be training the agent for? is 8000 episodes not enough? 1 episode takes roughly 7 seconds in time (it is using pygame engine and I turned off the rendering and I think that made it a little bit faster)
 This is my first time training an agent for a hard game like this using DQN so I would appreciate any tips/advice to improve the agent! repo: https://github.com/senweim/JumpKingAtHome

 This was before transformers blew up, before StyleGAN, before GPT-2, when WaveNet and DeepDream were still among the best we could do, and when predictive text algorithms that were barely better than Markov Chains were still the state of the art. In five short years, the state of artificial intelligence has changed overwhelmingly, to the point it's barely recognizable. Looking back to 2017, I now get this sense of everything feeling so primitive and fake.

 I tried building a PPO model for Wordle.
 My initial test was checking the performance of the model with just 100 words. The agent was able to learn within a few thousand epochs and had an average guess length of about 2.8 before it could correctly identify the words.
 However, when i extend the action space to the entire 2.3k words, the model barely learns. Even after a few 100k iterations, the mean length revolves around 5.9 (given wordle has a max of 6 attempts per game)
 Any suggestions on how to help the agent learn faster in large action spaces?
 ​
 I also tried an embedding based approach, but the performance was very similar.

 Yes, the paper is cautious about comparing the model one-to-one to the brain
  
“Note, we are not saying the brain is closely related to transformers because it learns the same neural representations, instead we are saying the relationship is close because we have shown a mathematical relationship between transformers and carefully formulated neuroscience models of the hippocampal formation.”
  
While objections like "its just correlation/relation, its not exactly the same!!" are true to an extend, its still a very unexpected observation that, they're even remotely similar. Needless to say, Transformers were not inspired from the brain - and as more evidence collates (https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-03036-1 --> Activations are linearly correlatable) it does feel mysterious; perhaps atleast some of the systems used by the brain converge on an efficient pattern discovered by our backpropogated friends...

 My perceived (albeit naive) view is Google > Facebook > MSR are top tier. Don't know much about the others. But I've read that some people consider MSR most prestigious due to their academic environment. But I've seen that Google and FB dominate in terms of major publications, ie: vision transformers are associated with Google.

I have difficulties with the exact import and the assignment of rigidbody here, that is, the neural network is being trained, but for some reason physics does not work. Has anyone seen it, or does anyone have an example of how to train a unity custom fbx model using ml agents?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all!
 As a sort of art experiment, I want to train an AI to write tech news articles based on my own work.
 I worked as a freelance writer for several years and have thousands of articles (each as a Word doc) on tech news.
 I want to use those articles to train the AI, then have it generate new articles to post to a blog. I have a pretty good understanding of machine learning, but have never trained a model myself. I'm hoping you all can provide some direction. Some specific questions:
  
Can you recommend a model?
 For each training article, can I provide a "source" (like another news article) so the AI understands where the content in the training article came from? *
 For each generated article, can I provide a news article source for it to base its content on? **
 Can I use the Word docs as the training set, or do I need to convert them into something else for training?
  
*as an example: If I wrote an article on the release of a new Raspberry Pi board, my source might be the press release on the Raspberry Pi website.
 **as an example: If I want it to generate an article about a new drone delivery service, my input source might be a news article on Reuters or something.

 Today we open-sourced Squirrel, a data infrastructure library that my colleagues and I have been working on over the past 1.5 years: https://github.com/merantix-momentum/squirrel-core
 We’re a team of ~30 ML engineers developing machine learning solutions for industry and research. Across all our projects, we need to load large-scale data in a fast and cost-efficient way, while keeping the flexibility to work with any possible dataset, loaded from local storage, remote data buckets or via APIs such as HuggingFace. Not finding what we were looking for, we decided to build it ourselves. 
 Squirrel has already proven its value in our deep learning projects at Merantix Momentum and shows competitive benchmark results (check them out here). 
 We’re super excited to share it with the OSS community and hope that you can benefit from it as well! 
 Looking forward to hearing your feedback and questions :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to apply an already trained ML model on a huge textual data set. I have funds to rent Cloud GPUs, but have not much experience using them. Preferably, I do the setting up of the environment only once (downloading of the data, model, software packages, etc) only once and then simply send ~100-200 scripts each to their own GPU for processing. Then at the end everything is in the same location and I can easily send back the final result file (~100-200 output files concatenated together) back to my PC.
 Any advice on how to do that? All GPU renting servers only have 1-8 GPUs per server and do not (seem) to allow for sharing of the environment, which seems very inefficient to me. All comments are appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, was wondering if anyone else has looked into "A PAC-Bayesian Analysis of Randomized Learning
 with Application to Stochastic Gradient Descent" and in particular eqn. 2, which is the derivation of Section 3.5 of "Train faster, generalize better: Stability of stochastic gradient descent" adapted for the case where the underlying loss we are interested in guaranteeing generalisation for is upper bounded by M (rather than 1 as assumed by Hardt et al).
 In the case of minibatch SGD, the number of datapoints n becomes the number of minibatches, as ideally one would like to reduce the number of steps T by maximizing the learning rate, which requires maximizing the minibatch size for the loss to actually converge to 0 on the training data. 
 However, what I am unsure about is, specifically for the classification task where we typically minimize the cross-entropy objective, whether the cross-entropy objective is an upper bound on any kind of M-bounded loss function. In the ideal world, I would like to show that it upper bounds the 0-1 loss which means the cross-entropy over the dataset is an upper bound on the classification accuracy and any generalization statement automatically becomes a statement about the very practical metric of accuracy. 
 Such a statement about cross-entropy upper-bounding 0-1 is made in Section 3C of "Theoretical Issues in Deep Networks: Approximation, Optimization and Generalization". However, one can provide a counterexample in the limit of the softmax "temperature" parameter where the predicted class distribution becomes uniform, in the case of 2 classes, for the typical case of log being the natural logarithm (it is no longer a counter-example if log base 2 is used).
 I haven't been able to show or find proof that this statement "xent >= 0-1" is true (for some logarithm base and some number of classes) and was hoping that someone might have.

The most recent version, YOLOX, has attained an optimal balance of speed and accuracy on the NVIDIA Tesla V100 Tensor Core GPU.
 Baidu researchers have improved their earlier PP-YOLOv2 model, resulting in PP-YOLOE, a cutting-edge industrial object detector that beats YOLOv5 and YOLOX in speed and accuracy trade-off. The team’s PP-YOLOE-l variant outperforms PP-YOLOv2 by 1.9 percent AP and YOLOX-l by 1.3 percent AP on COCO datasets.
 The PP-YOLOv2 baseline model architecture comprises a ResNet50-vd backbone with deformable convolution, a PAN neck with an SPP layer and DropBlock, and a lightweight IoU aware head. PP-YOLOv2 assigns only one anchor box to each ground truth object, similar to YOLOv3. It is strongly reliant on hand-crafted design, which may not generalize well enough when trained on other datasets. Conversely, this technique necessitates a lot of additional hyperparameters.
 To overcome this problem, Baidu researchers have added an anchor-free technique to PP-YOLOv2 that tiles one anchor point on each pixel and assigns upper and lower bounds for detecting heads to assign ground facts to a matching feature map. The center of a bounding box can then be determined to choose positive samples from the closest pixels. A 4D vector is also predicted for regression, with minor model speedups and precision losses due to the changes.

 The general process of self-driving tasks includes perceiving, decision-making, planning and controlling. The tasks of perceiving have adopted deep learning and that did a good job. Being different from monitoring learning, decision intelligence AI methods, which are represented by reinforcement learning, model the environment as Markov Decision Process(MDP)to get optimization.

 I've been working on reinforcement learning lately, but wanted to come to the general ML subreddit to seek inspiration from other disciplines.
 I've been working on strategies to decrease the training time for my real-world inverted pendulum experiment. Specifically, I am trying to pre-train the Q network in a simulation before deploying.
 The strategy that I have found most successful right now is this:
 start with randomly generated weights
 REPEAT OF AN EPOCH:
 - Load new_weights to Q Network
 - initialize an environment with randomly generated parameters (i.e. random mass, lengths, etc).
 - Train agent on environment for 100 episodes
 - Save new_weights
 I have tried a variety of strategies to add a little bit more control over this process. I've tried a soft update that never showed improvement.
 W = old_weights * (1 - alpha) + new_weights * alpha 
 I have tried an additive update which was slightly successful. Measured the success of each network as the sum of rewards over the epoch.
 A = (old_R)/(old_R+new_R) ; B = (new_R)/(old_R+new_R) W = old_weights * A + new_weights * B 
 But none of these work as well as just using the most recent weights. I've included some results if anyone's interested. The first graph is three test trials with random initial weights, the second graph is with pre-trained weights.
 This is a pretty hand-wavy way of doing this, does anyone have any suggestions to do this better?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there! I'm looking for advice on datasets to use for a project. We are looking for the following traits:
 ​
 1) Multivariate (at least 3 or 4, and probably no more than 50 or 100 as an upper bound).
 2) High frequency (Ideally at least once every 5-10 minutes)
 3) We need to have some notion of an underlying 'state' of the data for certain windows. E.g. in an energy setting, period X was the 'family at home using appliances' state. Or in the healthcare setting, period X is 'the patient is in a stable state' while period Y is something like 'the patient experiences a cardiac event'
 ​
 ​
 Nice to have:
 4) It'd be great if some features had some level of seasonality while others didn't.
 ​
 ​
 Do folks have any recommendations for datasets that meet some (or hopefully all) of the criteria? I did some light pursuing on UCI, but it seems like much of it is not high frequency enough, and/or doesn't have some notion of underlying states.

 I am currently working on a research paper that I aim to publish at a reputable conference shortly. In our work, we borrow a feature engineering technique from one of the papers that have not been previously applied to the domain (time series AD) before that paper. However, the authors haven't released the source code of their implementation of the model (but the feature engineering technique is publicly available). I feel like that is an important baseline and just failing to include it would get my paper rejected. I have contacted all the authors for the source code, but none of them responded. The architecture they use is a fairly complicated one and would be very difficult to implement on my own. How do I go about this situation? My advisor told me I can just include a few points on the footnote on why we don't include this as a baseline. Those being:
  
No open-source implementation
 Contacted the authors, didn't receive a response
 The paper has not been published, only uploaded to arxiv.
  
Any help is appreciated!

machine learning on graphs. Inspired by the success of neural networks, a line
of research has been conducted to train GNNs to deal with various tasks, such
as node classification, graph classification, and link prediction. In this
work, our task of interest is graph classification. Several GNN models have
been proposed and shown great accuracy in this task. However, the question is
whether usual training methods fully realize the capacity of the GNN models.

In this work, we propose a two-stage training framework based on triplet
loss. In the first stage, GNN is trained to map each graph to a Euclidean-space
vector so that graphs of the same class are close while those of different
classes are mapped far apart. Once graphs are well-separated based on labels, a
classifier is trained to distinguish between different classes. This method is
generic in the sense that it is compatible with any GNN model. By adapting five
GNN models to our method, we demonstrate the consistent improvement in accuracy
and utilization of each GNN's allocated capacity over the original training
method of each model up to 5.4\% points in 12 datasets.]]></summary>

such as graphs, texts, or images. Following spherical and hyperbolic spaces,
more general product spaces have been proposed. However, searching for the best
configuration of product space is a resource-intensive procedure, which reduces
the practical applicability of the idea. We generalize the concept of product
space and introduce an overlapping space that does not have the configuration
search problem. The main idea is to allow subsets of coordinates to be shared
between spaces of different types (Euclidean, hyperbolic, spherical). As a
result, parameter optimization automatically learns the optimal configuration.
Additionally, overlapping spaces allow for more compact representations since
their geometry is more complex. Our experiments confirm that overlapping spaces
outperform the competitors in graph embedding tasks. Here, we consider both
distortion setup, where the aim is to preserve distances, and ranking setup,
where the relative order should be preserved. The proposed method effectively
solves the problem and outperforms the competitors in both settings. We also
perform an empirical analysis in a realistic information retrieval task, where
we compare all spaces by incorporating them into DSSM. In this case, the
proposed overlapping space consistently achieves nearly optimal results without
any configuration tuning. This allows for reducing training time, which can be
significant in large-scale applications.]]></summary>

intuition to leveraging search algorithms guided by evaluation metrics. We
study channel size optimization in convolutional neural networks (CNN) and
identify the role it plays in model accuracy and complexity. Current channel
size selection methods are generally limited by discrete sample spaces while
suffering from manual iteration and simple heuristics. To solve this, we
introduce an efficient dynamic scaling algorithm -- CONet -- that automatically
optimizes channel sizes across network layers for a given CNN. Two metrics --
"\textit{Rank}" and "\textit{Rank Average Slope}" -- are introduced to identify
the information accumulated in training. The algorithm dynamically scales
channel sizes up or down over a fixed searching phase. We conduct experiments
on CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet datasets and show that CONet can find efficient and
accurate architectures searched in ResNet, DARTS, and DARTS+ spaces that
outperform their baseline models.

sparse coding problem while also providing uncertainty quantification. The most
popular inference algorithms for SBL exhibit prohibitively large computational
costs for high-dimensional problems due to the need to maintain a large

accelerating SBL inference -- named covariance-free expectation maximization
(CoFEM) -- that avoids explicit computation of the covariance matrix. CoFEM
solves multiple linear systems to obtain unbiased estimates of the posterior
statistics needed by SBL. This is accomplished by exploiting innovations from
numerical linear algebra such as preconditioned conjugate gradient and a
little-known diagonal estimation rule. For a large class of compressed sensing
matrices, we provide theoretical justifications for why our method scales well
in high-dimensional settings. Through simulations, we show that CoFEM can be up
to thousands of times faster than existing baselines without sacrificing coding
accuracy. Through applications to calcium imaging deconvolution and
multi-contrast MRI reconstruction, we show that CoFEM enables SBL to tractably

transformations of Gaussians. Given samples of the form $p(x)$, where $x\sim
N(0, \mathrm{Id}_r)$ is hidden and $p: \mathbb{R}^r \to \mathbb{R}^d$ is a
function where every output coordinate is a low-degree polynomial, the goal is
to learn the distribution over $p(x)$. This problem is natural in its own
right, but is also an important special case of learning deep generative
models, namely pushforwards of Gaussians under two-layer neural networks with
polynomial activations. Understanding the learnability of such generative
models is crucial to understanding why they perform so well in practice.

Our first main result is a polynomial-time algorithm for learning quadratic
transformations of Gaussians in a smoothed setting. Our second main result is a
polynomial-time algorithm for learning constant-degree polynomial
transformations of Gaussian in a smoothed setting, when the rank of the
associated tensors is small. In fact our results extend to any
rotation-invariant input distribution, not just Gaussian. These are the first
end-to-end guarantees for learning a pushforward under a neural network with
more than one layer.

Along the way, we also give the first polynomial-time algorithms with
provable guarantees for tensor ring decomposition, a popular generalization of
tensor decomposition that is used in practice to implicitly store large

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This work focuses on the use of deep learning for vulnerability analysis of
cyber-physical systems (CPS). Specifically, we consider a control architecture
widely used in CPS (e.g., robotics), where the low-level control is based on
e.g., the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and an anomaly detector. To facilitate
analyzing the impact potential sensing attacks could have, our objective is to
develop learning-enabled attack generators capable of designing stealthy
attacks that maximally degrade system operation. We show how such problem can
be cast within a learning-based grey-box framework where parts of the runtime
information are known to the attacker, and introduce two models based on
feed-forward neural networks (FNN); both models are trained offline, using a
cost function that combines the attack effects on the estimation error and the
residual signal used for anomaly detection, so that the trained models are
capable of recursively generating such effective sensor attacks in real-time.
The effectiveness of the proposed methods is illustrated on several case
studies.]]></summary>

without ground-truth labels by maximizing the similarity between latent
representations of similar signal segments. In this framework various data
augmentation techniques are usually exploited to help enforce desired
invariances within the learned representations, improving performance on
various audio tasks thanks to more robust embeddings. Now, selecting the most
relevant augmentations has proven crucial for better downstream performances.
Thus, this work introduces a conditional independance-based method which allows
for automatically selecting a suitable distribution on the choice of
augmentations and their parametrization from a set of predefined ones, for
contrastive self-supervised pre-training. This is performed with respect to a
downstream task of interest, hence saving a costly hyper-parameter search.
Experiments performed on two different downstream tasks validate the proposed
approach showing better results than experimenting without augmentation or with
baseline augmentations. We furthermore conduct a qualitative analysis of the
automatically selected augmentations and their variation according to the
considered final downstream dataset.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper presents a constrained adaptive dynamic programming (CADP)
algorithm to solve general nonlinear nonaffine optimal control problems with
known dynamics. Unlike previous ADP algorithms, it can directly deal with
problems with state constraints. Firstly, a constrained generalized policy
iteration (CGPI) framework is developed to handle state constraints by
transforming the traditional policy improvement process into a constrained
policy optimization problem. Next, we propose an actor-critic variant of CGPI,
called CADP, in which both policy and value functions are approximated by
multi-layer neural networks to directly map the system states to control inputs
and value function, respectively. CADP linearizes the constrained optimization
problem locally into a quadratically constrained linear programming problem,
and then obtains the optimal update of the policy network by solving its dual
problem. A trust region constraint is added to prevent excessive policy update,
thus ensuring linearization accuracy. We determine the feasibility of the
policy optimization problem by calculating the minimum trust region boundary
and update the policy using two recovery rules when infeasible. The vehicle
control problem in the path-tracking task is used to demonstrate the
effectiveness of this proposed method.]]></summary>

optimization problems in the past two decades, and various optimization methods
incorporating surrogates into optimization have been proposed. Most research
focuses on either exploiting the surrogate by defining a utility optimization
problem or customizing an existing optimization method to use one or multiple
approximation models. However, only a little attention has been paid to generic
concepts applicable to different types of algorithms and optimization problems
simultaneously. Thus this paper proposes a generalized probabilistic
surrogate-assisted framework (GPSAF), applicable to a broad category of
unconstrained and constrained, single- and multi-objective optimization
algorithms. The idea is based on a surrogate assisting an existing optimization
method. The assistance is based on two distinct phases, one facilitating
exploration and another exploiting the surrogates. The exploration and
exploitation of surrogates are automatically balanced by performing a
probabilistic knockout tournament among different clusters of solutions. A
study of multiple well-known population-based optimization algorithms is
conducted with and without the proposed surrogate assistance on single- and
multi-objective optimization problems with a maximum solution evaluation budget
of 300 or less. The results indicate the effectiveness of applying GPSAF to an
optimization algorithm and the competitiveness with other surrogate-assisted
algorithms.]]></summary>

human-designed input-output pairs -- is an alternative evaluation method of
natural language processing systems proposed to address the shortcomings of the
standard approach: computing metrics on held-out data. While behavioural tests
capture human prior knowledge and insights, there has been little exploration
on how to leverage them for model training and development. With this in mind,
we explore behaviour-aware learning by examining several fine-tuning schemes
using HateCheck, a suite of functional tests for hate speech detection systems.
To address potential pitfalls of training on data originally intended for
evaluation, we train and evaluate models on different configurations of
HateCheck by holding out categories of test cases, which enables us to estimate
performance on potentially overlooked system properties. The fine-tuning
procedure led to improvements in the classification accuracy of held-out
functionalities and identity groups, suggesting that models can potentially
generalise to overlooked functionalities. However, performance on held-out
functionality classes and i.i.d. hate speech detection data decreased, which
indicates that generalisation occurs mostly across functionalities from the
same class and that the procedure led to overfitting to the HateCheck data
distribution.]]></summary>

an important capability of modern business process monitoring systems. Existing
process prediction methods are able to also exploit the data perspective of
recorded events, in addition to the control-flow perspective. However, while
well-structured numerical or categorical attributes are considered in many
prediction techniques, almost no technique is able to utilize text documents
written in natural language, which can hold information critical to the
prediction task. In this paper, we illustrate the design, implementation, and
evaluation of a novel text-aware process prediction model based on Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks and natural language models. The
proposed model can take categorical, numerical and textual attributes in event
data into account to predict the activity and timestamp of the next event, the
outcome, and the cycle time of a running process instance. Experiments show
that the text-aware model is able to outperform state-of-the-art process
prediction methods on simulated and real-world event logs containing textual
data.]]></summary>

Most previous works assume that the data lies in the whole ambient space. We
propose to take a new angle and take the manifold assumption into
consideration. Assuming data lies in a manifold, we investigate two new types
of adversarial risk, the normal adversarial risk due to perturbation along
normal direction, and the in-manifold adversarial risk due to perturbation
within the manifold. We prove that the classic adversarial risk can be bounded
from both sides using the normal and in-manifold adversarial risks. We also
show with a surprisingly pessimistic case that the standard adversarial risk
can be nonzero even when both normal and in-manifold risks are zero. We
finalize the paper with empirical studies supporting our theoretical results.
Our results suggest the possibility of improving the robustness of a classifier
by only focusing on the normal adversarial risk.]]></summary>

constructing training mini-batches. This paper studies whether this common
practice improves learning and how. We compare it to an alternative setting
where each mini-batch is uniformly sampled from all the training data, labeled
or not, which greatly reduces direct supervision from true labels in typical
low-label regimes. However, this simpler setting can also be seen as more
general and even necessary in multi-task problems where over-sampling labeled
data would become intractable. Our experiments on semi-supervised CIFAR-10
image classification using FixMatch show a performance drop when using the
uniform sampling approach which diminishes when the amount of labeled data or
the training time increases. Further, we analyse the training dynamics to
understand how over-sampling of labeled data compares to uniform sampling. Our
main finding is that over-sampling is especially beneficial early in training
but gets less important in the later stages when more pseudo-labels become
correct. Nevertheless, we also find that keeping some true labels remains
important to avoid the accumulation of confirmation errors from incorrect
pseudo-labels.]]></summary>

many computer vision applications. Despite the great synthesis quality,
training GANs often confronts several issues, including non-convergence, mode
collapse, and gradient vanishing. There exist several workarounds, for example,
regularizing Lipschitz continuity and adopting Wasserstein distance. Although
these methods can partially solve the problems, we argue that the problems are
result from modeling the discriminator with deep neural networks. In this
paper, we base on newly derived deep neural network theories called Neural
Tangent Kernel (NTK) and propose a new generative algorithm called generative
adversarial NTK (GA-NTK). The GA-NTK models the discriminator as a Gaussian
Process (GP). With the help of the NTK theories, the training dynamics of
GA-NTK can be described with a closed-form formula. To synthesize data with the
closed-form formula, the objectives can be simplified into a single-level
adversarial optimization problem. We conduct extensive experiments on
real-world datasets, and the results show that GA-NTK can generate images
comparable to those by GANs but is much easier to train under various
conditions. We also study the current limitations of GA-NTK and propose some
workarounds to make GA-NTK more practical.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Submodular maximization has been the backbone of many important
machine-learning problems, and has applications to viral marketing,
diversification, sensor placement, and more. However, the study of maximizing
submodular functions has mainly been restricted in the context of selecting a
set of items. On the other hand, many real-world applications require a
solution that is a ranking over a set of items. The problem of ranking in the
context of submodular function maximization has been considered before, but to
a much lesser extent than item-selection formulations. In this paper, we
explore a novel formulation for ranking items with submodular valuations and
budget constraints. We refer to this problem as max-submodular ranking (MSR).
In more detail, given a set of items and a set of non-decreasing submodular
functions, where each function is associated with a budget, we aim to find a
ranking of the set of items that maximizes the sum of values achieved by all
functions under the budget constraints. For the MSR problem with cardinality-
and knapsack-type budget constraints we propose practical algorithms with
approximation guarantees. In addition, we perform an empirical evaluation,
which demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed algorithms against
strong baselines.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We investigate a new threat to neural sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models:
training-time attacks that cause models to "spin" their outputs so as to
support an adversary-chosen sentiment or point of view -- but only when the
input contains adversary-chosen trigger words. For example, a spinned
summarization model outputs positive summaries of any text that mentions the
name of some individual or organization.

Model spinning introduces a "meta-backdoor" into a model. Whereas
conventional backdoors cause models to produce incorrect outputs on inputs with
the trigger, outputs of spinned models preserve context and maintain standard
accuracy metrics, yet also satisfy a meta-task chosen by the adversary.

Model spinning enables propaganda-as-a-service, where propaganda is defined
as biased speech. An adversary can create customized language models that
produce desired spins for chosen triggers, then deploy these models to generate
disinformation (a platform attack), or else inject them into ML training
pipelines (a supply-chain attack), transferring malicious functionality to
downstream models trained by victims.

To demonstrate the feasibility of model spinning, we develop a new
backdooring technique. It stacks an adversarial meta-task onto a seq2seq model,
backpropagates the desired meta-task output to points in the word-embedding
space we call "pseudo-words," and uses pseudo-words to shift the entire output
distribution of the seq2seq model. We evaluate this attack on language
generation, summarization, and translation models with different triggers and
meta-tasks such as sentiment, toxicity, and entailment. Spinned models largely
maintain their accuracy metrics (ROUGE and BLEU) while shifting their outputs
to satisfy the adversary's meta-task. We also show that, in the case of a
supply-chain attack, the spin functionality transfers to downstream models.]]></summary>

speech signal to improve the speech's perceptual quality and intelligibility.
However, the over-suppression phenomenon in the enhanced speech might degrade
the performance of downstream automatic speech recognition (ASR) task due to
the missing latent information. To alleviate such problem, we propose an
interactive feature fusion network (IFF-Net) for noise-robust speech
recognition to learn complementary information from the enhanced feature and
original noisy feature. Experimental results show that the proposed method
achieves absolute word error rate (WER) reduction of 4.1% over the best

only a few entries of a target vector $b\in\mathbb R^n$ and output a near
minimizer to $\min_{x\in\mathbb R^d} \|Ax-b\|$, for a design matrix
$A\in\mathbb R^{n \times d}$ and loss $\|\cdot\|$.

For $p$ norm regression for any $0<p<\infty$, we give an algorithm based on
Lewis weight sampling outputting a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate solution using
just $\tilde O(d/\epsilon^2)$ queries to $b$ for $p\in(0,1)$,
$\tilde{O}(d/\epsilon)$ queries for $1<p<2$, and
$\tilde{O}(d^{p/2}/\epsilon^p)$ queries for $2<p<\infty$. For $0<p<2$, our
bounds are optimal up to log factors, settling the query complexity for this
range. For $2<p<\infty$, our dependence on $d$ is optimal, while our dependence
on $\epsilon$ is off by at most $\epsilon$, up to log factors. Our result
resolves an open question of [CD21], who gave near optimal bounds for the $1$
norm, but required $d^2/\epsilon^2$ samples for $\ell_p$ regression with
$1<p<2$, and gave no bounds for $2<p<\infty$ or $0<p<1$.

We also give the first total sensitivity bound of
$O(d^{\max\{1,p/2\}}\log^2n)$ for loss functions of degree $p$ polynomial
growth, improving a result of [TMF20]. By combining this with our techniques
for $\ell_p$ regression, we obtain an active regression algorithm making
$\tilde O(d^{1+\max\{1,p/2\}}/\mathrm{poly}(\epsilon))$ queries for such loss
functions, including the Tukey and Huber losses, answering another question of
[CD21]. For the Huber loss, we further improve our bound to $\tilde
O(d^{4-2\sqrt2}/\mathrm{poly}(\epsilon))$ samples. Our sensitivity bounds also
have many applications, including Orlicz norm subspace embeddings, robust
subspace approximation, and dimension reduction for smoothed $p$-norms.

Finally, our active sampling results give the first sublinear time algorithms
for Kronecker product regression under every $p$ norm.]]></summary>

carefully crafted imperceptible noises that can fool the network and can cause
severe consequences when deployed. To encounter them, the model requires
training data for adversarial training or explicit regularization-based
techniques. However, privacy has become an important concern, restricting
access to only trained models but not the training data (e.g. biometric data).
Also, data curation is expensive and companies may have proprietary rights over
it. To handle such situations, we propose a completely novel problem of
'test-time adversarial defense in absence of training data and even their
statistics'. We solve it in two stages: a) detection and b) correction of
adversarial samples. Our adversarial sample detection framework is initially
trained on arbitrary data and is subsequently adapted to the unlabelled test
data through unsupervised domain adaptation. We further correct the predictions
on detected adversarial samples by transforming them in Fourier domain and
obtaining their low frequency component at our proposed suitable radius for
model prediction. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed technique via
extensive experiments against several adversarial attacks and for different
model architectures and datasets. For a non-robust Resnet-18 model pre-trained
on CIFAR-10, our detection method correctly identifies 91.42% adversaries.
Also, we significantly improve the adversarial accuracy from 0% to 37.37% with
a minimal drop of 0.02% in clean accuracy on state-of-the-art 'Auto Attack'
without having to retrain the model.]]></summary>

dimension reduction and interpretability, which are essential to modern deep
learning approaches. Although deep learning techniques have been widely applied
to spatio-temporal data mining, there has been little attention to further
disentangle the latent features and understanding their contribution to the
model performance, particularly their mutual information and correlation across
features. In this study, we adopt two state-of-the-art disentangled
representation learning methods and apply them to three large-scale public
spatio-temporal datasets. To evaluate their performance, we propose an internal
evaluation metric focusing on the degree of correlations among latent variables
of the learned representations and the prediction performance of the downstream
tasks. Empirical results show that our modified method can learn disentangled
representations that achieve the same level of performance as existing
state-of-the-art ST deep learning methods in a spatio-temporal sequence
forecasting problem. Additionally, we find that our methods can be used to
discover real-world spatial-temporal semantics to describe the variables in the

from noisy labels. Among many other reasons, a significant number of existing
solutions rely on access to it. Estimating the transition matrix without using
ground truth labels is a critical and challenging task. When label noise
transition depends on each instance, the problem of identifying the
instance-dependent noise transition matrix becomes substantially more
challenging. Despite recent works proposing solutions for learning from
instance-dependent noisy labels, we lack a unified understanding of when such a
problem remains identifiable, and therefore learnable. This paper seeks to
provide answers to a sequence of related questions: What are the primary
factors that contribute to the identifiability of a noise transition matrix?
Can we explain the observed empirical successes? When a problem is not
identifiable, what can we do to make it so? We will relate our theoretical
findings to the literature and hope to provide guidelines for developing
effective solutions for battling instance-dependent label noise.]]></summary>

capture the temporal correlations by temporal attention mechanism and temporal

reduce the computation burden. For the data-set formulation, we develop a novel
approach which considers the transportation feature of periodicity with offset.

neural networks have far exceeded the DRAM capacities of modern hardware
accelerators. This has necessitated the development of efficient algorithms to
train these neural networks in parallel on large-scale GPU-based clusters.
Since computation is relatively inexpensive on modern GPUs, designing and
implementing extremely efficient communication in these parallel training
algorithms is critical for extracting the maximum performance. This paper
presents AxoNN, a parallel deep learning framework that exploits asynchrony and
message-driven execution to schedule neural network operations on each GPU,
thereby reducing GPU idle time and maximizing hardware efficiency. By using the
CPU memory as a scratch space for offloading data periodically during training,
AxoNN is able to reduce GPU memory consumption by four times. This allows us to
increase the number of parameters per GPU by four times, thus reducing the
amount of communication and increasing performance by over 13%. When tested
against large transformer models with 12-100 billion parameters on 48-384
NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs, AxoNN achieves a per-GPU throughput of 49.4-54.78% of

that can generalize to unseen distributions. Domain generalization (DG), i.e.,

recent years. Domain generalization deals with a challenging setting where one

a model that can generalize to an unseen test domain. Great progress has been
made in the area of domain generalization for years. This paper presents the
first review of recent advances in this area. First, we provide a formal
definition of domain generalization and discuss several related fields. We then
thoroughly review the theories related to domain generalization and carefully
analyze the theory behind generalization. We categorize recent algorithms into
three classes: data manipulation, representation learning, and learning
strategy, and present several popular algorithms in detail for each category.
Third, we introduce the commonly used datasets, applications, and our

which has made consistent progress due to the development of computer vision
and natural language generation techniques. Though conventional captioning
models achieve high accuracy based on popular metrics, i.e., BLEU, CIDEr, and
SPICE, the ability of captions to distinguish the target image from other
similar images is under-explored. To generate distinctive captions, a few
pioneers employ contrastive learning or re-weighted the ground-truth captions,
which focuses on one single input image. However, the relationships between
objects in a similar image group (e.g., items or properties within the same
album or fine-grained events) are neglected. In this paper, we improve the
distinctiveness of image captions using a Group-based Distinctive Captioning
Model (GdisCap), which compares each image with other images in one similar
group and highlights the uniqueness of each image. In particular, we propose a
group-based memory attention (GMA) module, which stores object features that
are unique among the image group (i.e., with low similarity to objects in other
images). These unique object features are highlighted when generating captions,
resulting in more distinctive captions. Furthermore, the distinctive words in
the ground-truth captions are selected to supervise the language decoder and
GMA. Finally, we propose a new evaluation metric, distinctive word rate
(DisWordRate) to measure the distinctiveness of captions. Quantitative results
indicate that the proposed method significantly improves the distinctiveness of
several baseline models, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both
accuracy and distinctiveness. Results of a user study agree with the
quantitative evaluation and demonstrate the rationality of the new metric
DisWordRate.]]></summary>

data to extract useful latent representations replacing traditional input
features in the downstream task. In audio/speech signal processing, a wide
range of features where engineered through decades of research efforts. As it
turns out, learning to predict such features (a.k.a pseudo-labels) has proven
to be a particularly relevant pretext task, leading to useful self-supervised
representations which prove to be effective for downstream tasks. However,
methods and common practices for combining such pretext tasks for better
performance on the downstream task have not been explored and understood
properly. In fact, the process relies almost exclusively on a computationally
heavy experimental procedure, which becomes intractable with the increase of
the number of pretext tasks. This paper introduces a method to select a group
of pretext tasks among a set of candidates. The method we propose estimates
calibrated weights for the partial losses corresponding to the considered
pretext tasks during the self-supervised training process. The experiments
conducted on automatic speech recognition, speaker and emotion recognition
validate our approach, as the groups selected and weighted with our method
perform better than classic baselines, thus facilitating the selection and
combination of relevant pseudo-labels for self-supervised representation
learning.]]></summary>

remains a major challenge of machine learning, which has impeded its wide
deployment to many scenarios. Recent advances reveal that a properly
pre-trained model endows an important property: transferability. A higher
transferability of the learned representations indicates a better
generalizability across domains of different distributions (domain
transferability), or across tasks of different semantics (task
transferability). Transferability has become the key to enable data-efficient
deep learning, however, existing pre-training methods focus only on domain
transferability while meta-training methods only on task transferability. This
restricts their data-efficiency in downstream scenarios of diverging domains
and tasks. A finding of this paper is that even a tight combination of
pre-training and meta-training cannot achieve both kinds of transferability.
This motivates the proposed Omni-Training framework towards data-efficient deep
learning. Our first contribution is Omni-Net, a tri-flow architecture. Besides
the joint representation flow, Omni-Net introduces two new parallel flows for
pre-training and meta-training, respectively responsible for learning
representations of domain transferability and task transferability. Omni-Net
coordinates the parallel flows by routing them via the joint-flow, making each
gain the other kind of transferability. Our second contribution is Omni-Loss,
in which a self-distillation regularization is imposed to enable knowledge
transfer across the training process. Omni-Training is a general framework that
accommodates many existing pre-training and meta-training algorithms. A
thorough evaluation on cross-task and cross-domain datasets in classification,
regression and reinforcement learning problems shows that Omni-Training
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

to learn a policy that maximizes long-term reward while satisfying safety
constraints given only offline data, without further interaction with the
environment. This problem is more appealing for real world RL applications, in
which data collection is costly or dangerous. Enforcing constraint satisfaction
is non-trivial, especially in offline settings, as there is a potential large
discrepancy between the policy distribution and the data distribution, causing
errors in estimating the value of safety constraints. We show that na\"ive
approaches that combine techniques from safe RL and offline RL can only learn
sub-optimal solutions. We thus develop a simple yet effective algorithm,
Constraints Penalized Q-Learning (CPQ), to solve the problem. Our method admits
the use of data generated by mixed behavior policies. We present a theoretical
analysis and demonstrate empirically that our approach can learn robustly
across a variety of benchmark control tasks, outperforming several baselines.]]></summary>

quickly learn new ones. They are trained on benchmarks with a fixed number of
data points per task. This number is usually arbitrary and it is unknown how it
affects performance at testing. Since labelling of data is expensive, finding
the optimal allocation of labels across training tasks may reduce costs. Given
a fixed budget of labels, should we use a small number of highly labelled
tasks, or many tasks with few labels each? Should we allocate more labels to
some tasks and less to others? We show that: 1) If tasks are homogeneous, there
is a uniform optimal allocation, whereby all tasks get the same amount of data;
2) At fixed budget, there is a trade-off between number of tasks and number of
data points per task, with a unique solution for the optimum; 3) When trained
separately, harder task should get more data, at the cost of a smaller number
of tasks; 4) When training on a mixture of easy and hard tasks, more data
should be allocated to easy tasks. Interestingly, Neuroscience experiments have
shown that human visual skills also transfer better from easy tasks. We prove
these results mathematically on mixed linear regression, and we show
empirically that the same results hold for few-shot image classification on
CIFAR-FS and mini-ImageNet. Our results provide guidance for allocating labels

Finally, we adopt relational graph neural networks for graph-level

prediction of vessel berth stay has been triggered for requirements of
operation research and scheduling optimization problem in the era of maritime
big data, which takes a significant part in port efficiency and maritime

predicting berth stay for tanker terminals. The approach covers three
innovative aspects: 1) Data source employed is multi-faceted, including cargo
operation data from tanker terminals, time-series data from automatic
identification system (AIS), etc. 2) The process of berth stay is decomposed
into multiple blocks according to data analysis and information extraction
innovatively, and practical operation scenarios are also developed accordingly.
3) The predictive models of berth stay are developed on the basis of prior data
analysis and information extraction under two methods, including regression and
decomposed distribution. The models are evaluated under four dynamic scenarios
with certain designated cargoes among two different terminals. The evaluation
results show that the proposed approach can predict berth stay with the
accuracy up to 98.81% validated by historical baselines, and also demonstrate
the proposed approach has dynamic capability of predicting berth stay among the
scenarios. The model may be potentially applied for short-term pilot-booking or

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the last few years, deep learning has grown in popularity for speaker
verification, identification, and diarization. Inarguably, a significant part
of this success is due to the demonstrated effectiveness of their speaker
representations. These, however, are heavily dependent on large amounts of
annotated data and can be sensitive to new domains. This study proposes an
entirely unsupervised deep-learning model for speaker diarization.
Specifically, the study focuses on generating high-quality neural speaker
representations without any annotated data, as well as on estimating secondary
hyperparameters of the model without annotations.

The speaker embeddings are represented by an encoder trained in a
self-supervised fashion using pairs of adjacent segments assumed to be of the
same speaker. The trained encoder model is then used to self-generate
pseudo-labels to subsequently train a similarity score between different
segments of the same call using probabilistic linear discriminant analysis
(PLDA) and further to learn a clustering stopping threshold. We compared our
model to state-of-the-art unsupervised as well as supervised baselines on the
CallHome benchmarks. According to empirical results, our approach outperforms
unsupervised methods when only two speakers are present in the call, and is
only slightly worse than recent supervised models.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One intriguing property of adversarial attacks is their "transferability" --
an adversarial example crafted with respect to one deep neural network (DNN)
model is often found effective against other DNNs as well. Intensive research
has been conducted on this phenomenon under simplistic controlled conditions.
Yet, thus far, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding about
transferability-based attacks ("transfer attacks") in real-world environments.

To bridge this critical gap, we conduct the first large-scale systematic
empirical study of transfer attacks against major cloud-based MLaaS platforms,
taking the components of a real transfer attack into account. The study leads
to a number of interesting findings which are inconsistent to the existing
ones, including: (1) Simple surrogates do not necessarily improve real transfer
attacks. (2) No dominant surrogate architecture is found in real transfer
attacks. (3) It is the gap between posterior (output of the softmax layer)
rather than the gap between logit (so-called $\kappa$ value) that increases
transferability. Moreover, by comparing with prior works, we demonstrate that
transfer attacks possess many previously unknown properties in real-world
environments, such as (1) Model similarity is not a well-defined concept. (2)
$L_2$ norm of perturbation can generate high transferability without usage of
gradient and is a more powerful source than $L_\infty$ norm. We believe this
work sheds light on the vulnerabilities of popular MLaaS platforms and points
to a few promising research directions.]]></summary>

they have been lucrative targets for cyber attackers. These critical
infrastructures are usually Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) such as power grids,
water, and sewage treatment facilities, oil and gas pipelines, etc. In recent
times, these systems have suffered from cyber attacks numerous times.
Researchers have been developing cyber security solutions for CIs to avoid
lasting damages. According to standard frameworks, cyber security based on
identification, protection, detection, response, and recovery are at the core
of these research. Detection of an ongoing attack that escapes standard
protection such as firewall, anti-virus, and host/network intrusion detection
has gained importance as such attacks eventually affect the physical dynamics
of the system. Therefore, anomaly detection in physical dynamics proves an
effective means to implement defense-in-depth. PASAD is one example of anomaly
detection in the sensor/actuator data, representing such systems' physical
dynamics. We present EPASAD, which improves the detection technique used in
PASAD to detect these micro-stealthy attacks, as our experiments show that
PASAD's spherical boundary-based detection fails to detect. Our method EPASAD
overcomes this by using Ellipsoid boundaries, thereby tightening the boundaries
in various dimensions, whereas a spherical boundary treats all dimensions
equally. We validate EPASAD using the dataset produced by the TE-process
simulator and the C-town datasets. The results show that EPASAD improves
PASAD's average recall by 5.8% and 9.5% for the two datasets, respectively.]]></summary>

tremendous success in multiple domains. Given a specific task, developers can
collect massive DNNs from public sources for efficient reusing and avoid
redundant work from scratch. However, testing the performance (e.g., accuracy
and robustness) of multiple DNNs and giving a reasonable recommendation that
which model should be used is challenging regarding the scarcity of labeled
data and demand of domain expertise. Existing testing approaches are mainly
selection-based where after sampling, a few of the test data are labeled to
discriminate DNNs. Therefore, due to the randomness of sampling, the
performance ranking is not deterministic. In this paper, we propose a
labeling-free comparison testing approach to overcome the limitations of
labeling effort and sampling randomness. The main idea is to learn a Bayesian
model to infer the models' specialty only based on predicted labels. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we undertook exhaustive experiments
on 9 benchmark datasets spanning in the domains of image, text, and source
code, and 165 DNNs. In addition to accuracy, we consider the robustness against
synthetic and natural distribution shifts. The experimental results demonstrate
that the performance of existing approaches degrades under distribution shifts.
Our approach outperforms the baseline methods by up to 0.74 and 0.53 on
Spearman's correlation and Kendall's $\tau$, respectively, regardless of the
dataset and distribution shift. Additionally, we investigated the impact of
model quality (accuracy and robustness) and diversity (standard deviation of
the quality) on the testing effectiveness and observe that there is a higher
chance of a good result when the quality is over 50\% and the diversity is
larger than 18\%.]]></summary>

different subjects and present important advantages compared to other biometric
traits, such as difficulty to counterfeit, liveness detection, and ubiquity.
Also, with the success of Deep Learning technologies, ECG biometric recognition

evaluate the improvements of novel ECG proposed methods, mainly due to the lack
of public data and standard experimental protocols. In this study, we perform
extensive analysis and comparison of different scenarios in ECG biometric
recognition. Both verification and identification tasks are investigated, as
well as single- and multi-session scenarios. Finally, we also perform single-
and multi-lead ECG experiments, considering traditional scenarios using
electrodes in the chest and limbs and current user-friendly wearable devices.

In addition, we present ECGXtractor, a robust Deep Learning technology

across various scenarios and multiple databases. We introduce our proposed
feature extractor, trained with multiple sinus-rhythm heartbeats belonging to
55,967 subjects, and provide a general public benchmark evaluation with

increasingly more concerned about robust accuracy under distributional shifts.
While a variety of methods have been proposed to robustify neural networks,
these techniques often target models trained on ImageNet classification. At the
same time, it is a common practice to use ImageNet pretrained backbones for
downstream tasks such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and image
classification from different domains. This raises a question: Can these robust
image classifiers transfer robustness to downstream tasks? For object detection
and semantic segmentation, we find that a vanilla Swin Transformer, a variant
of Vision Transformer tailored for dense prediction tasks, transfers robustness
better than Convolutional Neural Networks that are trained to be robust to the
corrupted version of ImageNet. For CIFAR10 classification, we find that models
that are robustified for ImageNet do not retain robustness when fully
fine-tuned. These findings suggest that current robustification techniques tend
to emphasize ImageNet evaluations. Moreover, network architecture is a strong

human history and helps tell the worlds story. As a result of the Fourth
Industrial Revolution, the Internet has become an increasingly important source

data, it is nearly impossible for humans to manually catch up with the ongoing
evolution and the continuously variable content in this domain. The proper
management and exploitation of big data can pave the way for the substantial
growth of the global economy as well as citizen satisfaction. Therefore,
computer scientists have found it challenging to handle e-commerce fashion
websites by using big data and machine learning technologies. This paper first
proposes a scalable focused Web Crawler engine based on the distributed
computing platforms to extract and process fashion data on e-commerce websites.
The role of the proposed platform is then described in developing a
disentangled feature extraction method by employing deep convolutional
generative adversarial networks (DCGANs) for content-based image indexing and
retrieval. Finally, the state-of-the-art solutions are compared, and the
results of the proposed approach are analyzed on a standard dataset. For the
real-life implementation of the proposed solution, a Web-based application is
developed on Apache Storm, Kafka, Solr, and Milvus platforms to create a

games where exact CCEs are efficiently computable. A fortiori, our results
imply that there are no efficient algorithms for learning stationary Markov CCE
policies in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), even when the
interaction is two-player and turn-based, and both the discount factor and the
desired approximation of the learned policies is an absolute constant. In turn,
these results stand in sharp contrast to single-agent reinforcement learning
(RL) where near-optimal stationary Markov policies can be efficiently learned.
Complementing our intractability results for stationary Markov CCEs, we provide
a decentralized algorithm (assuming shared randomness among players) for
learning a nonstationary Markov CCE policy with polynomial time and sample
complexity in all problem parameters. Previous work for learning Markov CCE
policies all required exponential time and sample complexity in the number of
players.]]></summary>

single optimal solution, finding a diverse set of near-optimal solutions can
often be more useful. State of the art methods for generating diverse
near-optimal solutions usually take a two-phase approach, first finding a set
of near-optimal solutions and then finding a diverse subset. In contrast, we
present a method of finding a set of diverse solutions by emphasizing diversity
within the search for near-optimal solutions. Specifically, within a
branch-and-bound framework, we investigate parameterized node selection rules
that explicitly consider diversity. Our results indicate that our approach
significantly increases diversity of the final solution set. When compared with
existing methods for finding diverse near-optimal sets, our method runs with
similar run-time as regular node selection methods and gives a diversity
improvement of up to 140%. In contrast, popular node selection rules such as
best-first search gives an improvement of no more than 40%. Further, we find
that our method is most effective when diversity is emphasized more in node
selection when deeper in the tree and when the solution set has grown large
enough.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, it is shown that shuffling can amplify the central differential
privacy guarantees of data randomized with local differential privacy. Within
this setup, a centralized, trusted shuffler is responsible for shuffling by
keeping the identities of data anonymous, which subsequently leads to stronger
privacy guarantees for systems. However, introducing a centralized entity to
the originally local privacy model loses some appeals of not having any
centralized entity as in local differential privacy. Moreover, implementing a
shuffler in a reliable way is not trivial due to known security issues and/or
requirements of advanced hardware or secure computation technology.

Motivated by these practical considerations, we rethink the shuffle model to
relax the assumption of requiring a centralized, trusted shuffler. We introduce
network shuffling, a decentralized mechanism where users exchange data in a
random-walk fashion on a network/graph, as an alternative of achieving privacy
amplification via anonymity. We analyze the threat model under such a setting,
and propose distributed protocols of network shuffling that is straightforward
to implement in practice. Furthermore, we show that the privacy amplification
rate is similar to other privacy amplification techniques such as uniform
shuffling. To our best knowledge, among the recently studied intermediate trust
models that leverage privacy amplification techniques, our work is the first
that is not relying on any centralized entity to achieve privacy amplification.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Literature on machine learning for multiple sclerosis has primarily focused
on the use of neuroimaging data such as magnetic resonance imaging and clinical
laboratory tests for disease identification. However, studies have shown that
these modalities are not consistent with disease activity such as symptoms or
disease progression. Furthermore, the cost of collecting data from these
modalities is high, leading to scarce evaluations. In this work, we used
multi-dimensional, affordable, physical and smartphone-based performance
outcome measures (POM) in conjunction with demographic data to predict multiple
sclerosis disease progression. We performed a rigorous benchmarking exercise on
two datasets and present results across 13 clinically actionable prediction
endpoints and 6 machine learning models. To the best of our knowledge, our
results are the first to show that it is possible to predict disease
progression using POMs and demographic data in the context of both clinical
trials and smartphone-base studies by using two datasets. Moreover, we
investigate our models to understand the impact of different POMs and
demographics on model performance through feature ablation studies. We also
show that model performance is similar across different demographic subgroups
(based on age and sex). To enable this work, we developed an end-to-end
reusable pre-processing and machine learning framework which allows quicker
experimentation over disparate MS datasets.]]></summary>

there exists optimal policy choosing next measurement for the former

imputation. Also, we adapt the imputation method to missingness varying with
measurement policy. However, learning measurement policy and imputation
requires complete data which is impossible to be observed, unfortunately. To
tackle this problem, we propose a data generation method and joint learning
algorithm. The main idea is that 1) the data generation method is inherited by
imputation method, and 2) the adaptation of imputation encourages measurement
policy to learn more than individual learning. We implemented some variations

multiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared global model. Despite the
recent progress, it remains challenging to deal with heterogeneous data
clients, as the discrepant data distributions usually prevent the global model
from delivering good generalization ability on each participating client. In
this paper, we propose CD^2-pFed, a novel Cyclic Distillation-guided Channel
Decoupling framework, to personalize the global model in FL, under various
settings of data heterogeneity. Different from previous works which establish
layer-wise personalization to overcome the non-IID data across different
clients, we make the first attempt at channel-wise assignment for model
personalization, referred to as channel decoupling. To further facilitate the
collaboration between private and shared weights, we propose a novel cyclic
distillation scheme to impose a consistent regularization between the local and
global model representations during the federation. Guided by the cyclical
distillation, our channel decoupling framework can deliver more accurate and
generalized results for different kinds of heterogeneity, such as feature skew,
label distribution skew, and concept shift. Comprehensive experiments on four
benchmarks, including natural image and medical image analysis tasks,
demonstrate the consistent effectiveness of our method on both local and

using a cloud infrastructure resource tuning case study. It reduces the search

work has attempted to look at this combined space, concluding that
non-reproducible work is more highly cited. We show that answering this

a robust conclusion. To make inferences with more robust behavior, we propose a
hierarchical Bayesian model that incorporates the citation rate over time,
rather than the total number of citations after a fixed amount of time. In
doing so we show that, under current evidence the answer is more likely that
certain fields of study such as Medicine and Machine Learning (ML) do correlate
reproducible works with more citations, but other fields appear to have no
relationship. Further, we find that making code available and thoroughly

models is receiving growing attention. State-of-the-art strategies address the
problem as a supervised learning task and optimize algorithms that predict
subgrid fluxes based on information from coarse resolution models. In practice,
training data are generated from higher resolution numerical simulations
transformed in order to mimic coarse resolution simulations. By essence, these
strategies optimize subgrid parametrizations to meet so-called $\textit{a
priori}$ criteria. But the actual purpose of a subgrid parametrization is to
obtain good performance in terms of $\textit{a posteriori}$ metrics which imply
computing entire model trajectories. In this paper, we focus on the
representation of energy backscatter in two dimensional quasi-geostrophic
turbulence and compare parametrizations obtained with different learning
strategies at fixed computational complexity. We show that strategies based on
$\textit{a priori}$ criteria yield parametrizations that tend to be unstable in
direct simulations and describe how subgrid parametrizations can alternatively
be trained end-to-end in order to meet $\textit{a posteriori}$ criteria. We
illustrate that end-to-end learning strategies yield parametrizations that
outperform known empirical and data-driven schemes in terms of performance,
stability and ability to apply to different flow configurations. These results
support the relevance of differentiable programming paradigms for climate
models in the future.]]></summary>

where each training example is associated with a set of candidate labels among
which only one is true. Most existing PLL approaches assume that the incorrect
labels in each training example are randomly picked as the candidate labels and
model the generation process of the candidate labels in a simple way. However,
these approaches usually do not perform as well as expected due to the fact
that the generation process of the candidate labels is always
instance-dependent. Therefore, it deserves to be modeled in a refined way. In
this paper, we consider instance-dependent PLL and assume that the generation
process of the candidate labels could decompose into two sequential parts,
where the correct label emerges first in the mind of the annotator but then the
incorrect labels related to the feature are also selected with the correct
label as candidate labels due to uncertainty of labeling. Motivated by this
consideration, we propose a novel PLL method that performs Maximum A
Posterior(MAP) based on an explicitly modeled generation process of candidate
labels via decomposed probability distribution models. Experiments on benchmark
and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.]]></summary>

method wherein the random forest is grown as learning proceeds (through
expanding forests). We demonstrate improved performance of our methods over
state-of-the-art Deep $Q$-Networks in two OpenAI gyms (`blackjack' and
`inverted pendulum') but not in the `lunar lander' gym. We suspect that the
resilience to overfitting enjoyed by random forests recommends our method for
common tasks that do not require a strong representation of the problem domain.
We show that expanding forests (in which the number of trees increases as data

discuss the advantages and disadvantages of state-of-the-art classifiers in
each of these scenarios and we provide general recommendations to end-users for
selecting the best algorithms for imbalanced data streams. Additionally, we
formulate open challenges and future directions for this domain. Our
experimental testbed is fully reproducible and easy to extend with new methods.
This way we propose the first standardized approach to conducting experiments
in imbalanced data streams that can be used by other researchers to create
trustworthy and fair evaluation of newly proposed methods. Our experimental

learning (FL), in which model training is conducted by the data-collecting
devices. Existing research on FL has mostly focused on a star topology learning
architecture with synchronized (time-triggered) model training rounds, where
the local models of the devices are periodically aggregated by a centralized
coordinating node. However, in many settings, such a coordinating node may not
exist, motivating efforts to fully decentralize FL. In this work, we propose a
novel methodology for distributed model aggregations via asynchronous,
event-triggered consensus iterations over the network graph topology. We
consider heterogeneous communication event thresholds at each device that weigh
the change in local model parameters against the available local resources in
deciding the benefit of aggregations at each iteration. Through theoretical
analysis, we demonstrate that our methodology achieves asymptotic convergence
to the globally optimal learning model under standard assumptions in
distributed learning and graph consensus literature, and without restrictive
connectivity requirements on the underlying topology. Subsequent numerical
results demonstrate that our methodology obtains substantial improvements in
communication requirements compared with FL baselines.]]></summary>

over Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is a challenging task for both humans and
machines. The main reason is the significant variations of both normal and
arrhythmic ECG patterns among patients. Automating this process with utmost
accuracy is, therefore, highly desirable due to the advent of wearable ECG
sensors. However, even with numerous deep learning approaches proposed
recently, there is still a notable gap in the performance of global and
patient-specific ECG classification performances. This study proposes a novel
approach to narrow this gap and propose a real-time solution with shallow and
compact 1D Self-Organized Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs). Methods: In
this study, we propose a novel approach for inter-patient ECG classification
using a compact 1D Self-ONN by exploiting morphological and timing information
in heart cycles. We used 1D Self-ONN layers to automatically learn
morphological representations from ECG data, enabling us to capture the shape
of the ECG waveform around the R peaks. We further inject temporal features
based on RR interval for timing characterization. The classification layers can
thus benefit from both temporal and learned features for the final arrhythmia
classification. Results: Using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia benchmark database, the
proposed method achieves the highest classification performance ever achieved,
i.e., 99.21% precision, 99.10% recall, and 99.15% F1-score for normal (N)
segments; 82.19% precision, 82.50% recall, and 82.34% F1-score for the
supra-ventricular ectopic beat (SVEBs); and finally, 94.41% precision, 96.10%
recall, and 95.2% F1-score for the ventricular-ectopic beats (VEBs).]]></summary>

design is still daunting since an explanation of visual computing algorithms
remains elusive. Salient object detection is one problem that is still open due

research area follows the traditional path of hand-made designs using
neuroscience knowledge. In recent years two different approaches based on

combining previous hand-made methods through genetic programming and fuzzy
logic. The other approach consists of improving the inner computational
structures of basic hand-made models through artificial evolution. This
research work proposes expanding the artificial dorsal stream using a recent
proposal to solve salient object detection problems. This approach uses the
benefits of the two main aspects of this research area: fixation prediction and
detection of salient objects. We decided to apply the fusion of visual saliency

by decomposing it into smaller and more familiar subtasks. While it is
difficult to measure whether neural program synthesis methods have similar
capabilities, what we can measure is whether they compositionally generalize,
that is, whether a model that has been trained on the simpler subtasks is
subsequently able to solve more complex tasks. In this paper, we focus on
measuring the ability of learned program synthesizers to compositionally
generalize. We first characterize several different axes along which program
synthesis methods would be desired to generalize, e.g., length generalization,
or the ability to combine known subroutines in new ways that do not occur in
the training data. Based on this characterization, we introduce a benchmark
suite of tasks to assess these abilities based on two popular existing
datasets, SCAN and RobustFill. Finally, we make first attempts to improve the
compositional generalization ability of Transformer models along these axes
through novel attention mechanisms that draw inspiration from a human-like
decomposition strategy. Empirically, we find our modified Transformer models
generally perform better than natural baselines, but the tasks remain
challenging.]]></summary>

dimensions non-invasively, with applications in biomedical imaging, materials
science, electronic inspection, and other fields. The reconstruction process
can be an ill-conditioned inverse problem, requiring regularization to obtain
satisfactory reconstructions. Recently, deep learning has been adopted for
tomographic reconstruction. Unlike iterative algorithms which require a
distribution that is known a priori, deep reconstruction networks can learn a
prior distribution through sampling the training distributions. In this work,
we develop a Physics-assisted Generative Adversarial Network (PGAN), a two-step
algorithm for tomographic reconstruction. In contrast to previous efforts, our
PGAN utilizes maximum-likelihood estimates derived from the measurements to
regularize the reconstruction with both known physics and the learned prior.
Synthetic objects with spatial correlations are integrated circuits (IC) from a
proposed model CircuitFaker. Compared with maximum-likelihood estimation, PGAN
can reduce the photon requirement with limited projection angles to achieve a
given error rate. We further attribute the improvement to the learned prior by
reconstructing objects created without spatial correlations. The advantages of
using a prior from deep learning in X-ray tomography may further enable
low-photon nanoscale imaging.]]></summary>

(AMR), as an important task in cognitive radio, has gradually transformed from
traditional feature extraction and classification to automatic classification
by deep learning technology. However, deep learning models are data-driven
methods, which often require a large amount of data as the training support.
Data augmentation, as the strategy of expanding dataset, can improve the
generalization of the deep learning models and thus improve the accuracy of the
models to a certain extent. In this paper, for AMR of radio signals, we propose
a data augmentation strategy based on mixing signals and consider four specific
methods (Random Mixing, Maximum-Similarity-Mixing, $\theta-$Similarity Mixing
and n-times Random Mixing) to achieve data augmentation. Experiments show that
our proposed method can improve the classification accuracy of deep learning
based AMR models in the full public dataset RML2016.10a. In particular, for the
case of a single signal-to-noise ratio signal set, the classification accuracy
can be significantly improved, which verifies the effectiveness of the methods.]]></summary>

grid points, each grid point is labeled with a unique fingerprint consisting of
the received signal strength (RSS) values measured from $N$ number of Bluetooth
Low Energy (BLE) beacons. Given the fingerprint observed by the smartphone, the
user's current location can be estimated by finding the top-k similar
fingerprints from the list of fingerprints registered in the database. Besides
the environmental factors, the dynamicity in holding the smartphone is another
source to the variation in fingerprint measurements, yet there are not many
studies addressing the fingerprint variability due to dynamic smartphone
positions held by human hands during online detection. To this end, we propose
a nonlinear location estimation using the kernel method. Specifically, our
proposed method comprises of two steps: 1) a beacon selection strategy to
select a subset of beacons that is insensitive to the subtle change of holding
positions, and 2) a kernel method to compute the similarity between this subset
of observed signals and all the fingerprints registered in the database. The

with unknown items to a target user. Although the primary goal of traditional
recommendation systems is to deliver the most relevant items, such an effort
unintentionally can cause collateral effects including low diversity and
unbalanced genres or categories, benefiting particular groups of categories.
This paper proposes an approach to create recommendation lists with a
calibrated balance of genres, avoiding disproportion between the user's profile
interests and the recommendation list. The calibrated recommendations consider
concomitantly the relevance and the divergence between the genres distributions
extracted from the user's preference and the recommendation list. The main
claim is that calibration can contribute positively to generate fairer
recommendations. In particular, we propose a new trade-off equation, which
considers the users' bias to provide a recommendation list that seeks for the
users' tendencies. Moreover, we propose a conceptual framework and a decision
protocol to generate more than one thousand combinations of calibrated systems
in order to find the best combination. We compare our approach against
state-of-the-art approaches using multiple domain datasets, which are analyzed
by rank and calibration metrics. The results indicate that the trade-off, which
considers the users' bias, produces positive effects on the precision and to
the fairness, thus generating recommendation lists that respect the genre
distribution and, through the decision protocol, we also found the best system
for each dataset.]]></summary>

unsupervised losses in both UV and image spaces. Our experiments show that the
trained models output high-quality UV coordinates and generalize to new poses.

Transformer architecture, namely T4PdM, to identify multiple types of faults in
rotating machinery. Experimental results are developed and presented for the
MaFaulDa and CWRU databases. T4PdM was able to achieve an overall accuracy of
99.98% and 98% for both datasets, respectively. In addition, the performance of
the proposed model is compared to other previously published works. It has
demonstrated the superiority of the model in detecting and classifying faults
in rotating industrial machinery. Therefore, the proposed Transformer-based
model can improve the performance of machinery fault analysis and diagnostic
processes and leverage companies to a new era of the Industry 4.0. In addition,
this methodology can be adapted to any other task of time series
classification.]]></summary>

learning (ML) methods. It is based on large vectors of binary or bipolar
symbols and a few simple mathematical operations. The promise of HDC is a
highly efficient implementation for embedded systems like wearables. While fast
implementations have been presented, other constraints have not been considered
for edge computing. In this work, we aim at answering how thermal-friendly HDC
for edge computing is. Devices like smartwatches, smart glasses, or even mobile
systems have a restrictive cooling budget due to their limited volume. Although
HDC operations are simple, the vectors are large, resulting in a high number of
CPU operations and thus a heavy load on the entire system potentially causing
temperature violations. In this work, the impact of HDC on the chip's
temperature is investigated for the first time. We measure the temperature and
power consumption of a commercial embedded system and compare HDC with
conventional CNN. We reveal that HDC causes up to 6.8{\deg}C higher
temperatures and leads to up to 47% more CPU throttling. Even when both HDC and
CNN aim for the same throughput (i.e., perform a similar number of
classifications per second), HDC still causes higher on-chip temperatures due
to the larger power consumption.]]></summary>

repertoires consisting of both diverse and high-performing skills. However, the
generation of behavioural repertoires has mainly been limited to simulation
environments instead of real-world learning. This is because existing QD
algorithms need large numbers of evaluations as well as episodic resets, which
require manual human supervision and interventions. This paper proposes
Reset-Free Quality-Diversity optimization (RF-QD) as a step towards autonomous
learning for robotics in open-ended environments. We build on Dynamics-Aware
Quality-Diversity (DA-QD) and introduce a behaviour selection policy that
leverages the diversity of the imagined repertoire and environmental
information to intelligently select of behaviours that can act as automatic
resets. We demonstrate this through a task of learning to walk within defined
training zones with obstacles. Our experiments show that we can learn full
repertoires of legged locomotion controllers autonomously without manual resets
with high sample efficiency in spite of harsh safety constraints. Finally,
using an ablation of different target objectives, we show that it is important
for RF-QD to have diverse types solutions available for the behaviour selection
policy over solutions optimised with a specific objective. Videos and code

based on rs-fMRI still needs to be improved. This paper introduces a
classification framework to aid ASD diagnosis based on rs-fMRI. In the
framework, we proposed a novel filter feature selection method based on the
difference between step distribution curves (DSDC) to select remarkable
functional connectivities (FCs) and utilized a multilayer perceptron (MLP)
which was pretrained by a simplified Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for
classification. We also designed a pipeline consisting of a normalization
procedure and a modified hyperbolic tangent (tanh) activation function to
replace the original tanh function, further improving the model accuracy. Our
model was evaluated by 10 times 10-fold cross-validation and achieved an
average accuracy of 78.12%, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods reported
on the same dataset. Given the importance of sensitivity and specificity in
disease diagnosis, two constraints were designed in our model which can improve
the model's sensitivity and specificity by up to 9.32% and 10.21%,

Adaptive-Gravity, for enhancing the robustness of deep neural network
classifiers against adversarial examples. We conceptualize the model
parameters/features associated with each class as a mass characterized by its
centroid location and the spread (standard deviation of the distance) of
features around the centroid. We use the centroid associated with each cluster
to derive an anti-gravity force that pushes the centroids of different classes
away from one another during network training. Then we customized an objective
function that aims to concentrate each class's features toward their
corresponding new centroid, which has been obtained by anti-gravity force. This
methodology results in a larger separation between different masses and reduces
the spread of features around each centroid. As a result, the samples are
pushed away from the space that adversarial examples could be mapped to,
effectively increasing the degree of perturbation needed for making an
adversarial example. We have implemented this training solution as an iterative
method consisting of four steps at each iteration: 1) centroid extraction, 2)
anti-gravity force calculation, 3) centroid relocation, and 4) gravity
training. Gravity's efficiency is evaluated by measuring the corresponding
fooling rates against various attack models, including FGSM, MIM, BIM, and PGD
using LeNet and ResNet110 networks, benchmarked against MNIST and CIFAR10
classification problems. Test results show that Gravity not only functions as a
powerful instrument to robustify a model against state-of-the-art adversarial
attacks but also effectively improves the model training accuracy.]]></summary>

functions aim at the same optimal energy form and therefore can be directly

such as graphs, texts, or images. Following spherical and hyperbolic spaces,
more general product spaces have been proposed. However, searching for the best
configuration of product space is a resource-intensive procedure, which reduces
the practical applicability of the idea. We generalize the concept of product
space and introduce an overlapping space that does not have the configuration
search problem. The main idea is to allow subsets of coordinates to be shared
between spaces of different types (Euclidean, hyperbolic, spherical). As a
result, parameter optimization automatically learns the optimal configuration.
Additionally, overlapping spaces allow for more compact representations since
their geometry is more complex. Our experiments confirm that overlapping spaces
outperform the competitors in graph embedding tasks. Here, we consider both
distortion setup, where the aim is to preserve distances, and ranking setup,
where the relative order should be preserved. The proposed method effectively
solves the problem and outperforms the competitors in both settings. We also
perform an empirical analysis in a realistic information retrieval task, where
we compare all spaces by incorporating them into DSSM. In this case, the
proposed overlapping space consistently achieves nearly optimal results without
any configuration tuning. This allows for reducing training time, which can be
significant in large-scale applications.]]></summary>

from noisy labels. Among many other reasons, a significant number of existing
solutions rely on access to it. Estimating the transition matrix without using
ground truth labels is a critical and challenging task. When label noise
transition depends on each instance, the problem of identifying the
instance-dependent noise transition matrix becomes substantially more
challenging. Despite recent works proposing solutions for learning from
instance-dependent noisy labels, we lack a unified understanding of when such a
problem remains identifiable, and therefore learnable. This paper seeks to
provide answers to a sequence of related questions: What are the primary
factors that contribute to the identifiability of a noise transition matrix?
Can we explain the observed empirical successes? When a problem is not
identifiable, what can we do to make it so? We will relate our theoretical
findings to the literature and hope to provide guidelines for developing
effective solutions for battling instance-dependent label noise.]]></summary>

only a few entries of a target vector $b\in\mathbb R^n$ and output a near
minimizer to $\min_{x\in\mathbb R^d} \|Ax-b\|$, for a design matrix
$A\in\mathbb R^{n \times d}$ and loss $\|\cdot\|$.

For $p$ norm regression for any $0<p<\infty$, we give an algorithm based on
Lewis weight sampling outputting a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate solution using
just $\tilde O(d/\epsilon^2)$ queries to $b$ for $p\in(0,1)$,
$\tilde{O}(d/\epsilon)$ queries for $1<p<2$, and
$\tilde{O}(d^{p/2}/\epsilon^p)$ queries for $2<p<\infty$. For $0<p<2$, our
bounds are optimal up to log factors, settling the query complexity for this
range. For $2<p<\infty$, our dependence on $d$ is optimal, while our dependence
on $\epsilon$ is off by at most $\epsilon$, up to log factors. Our result
resolves an open question of [CD21], who gave near optimal bounds for the $1$
norm, but required $d^2/\epsilon^2$ samples for $\ell_p$ regression with
$1<p<2$, and gave no bounds for $2<p<\infty$ or $0<p<1$.

We also give the first total sensitivity bound of
$O(d^{\max\{1,p/2\}}\log^2n)$ for loss functions of degree $p$ polynomial
growth, improving a result of [TMF20]. By combining this with our techniques
for $\ell_p$ regression, we obtain an active regression algorithm making
$\tilde O(d^{1+\max\{1,p/2\}}/\mathrm{poly}(\epsilon))$ queries for such loss
functions, including the Tukey and Huber losses, answering another question of
[CD21]. For the Huber loss, we further improve our bound to $\tilde
O(d^{4-2\sqrt2}/\mathrm{poly}(\epsilon))$ samples. Our sensitivity bounds also
have many applications, including Orlicz norm subspace embeddings, robust
subspace approximation, and dimension reduction for smoothed $p$-norms.

Finally, our active sampling results give the first sublinear time algorithms

sparse coding problem while also providing uncertainty quantification. The most
popular inference algorithms for SBL exhibit prohibitively large computational
costs for high-dimensional problems due to the need to maintain a large
covariance matrix. To resolve this issue, we introduce a new method for
accelerating SBL inference -- named covariance-free expectation maximization
(CoFEM) -- that avoids explicit computation of the covariance matrix. CoFEM
solves multiple linear systems to obtain unbiased estimates of the posterior
statistics needed by SBL. This is accomplished by exploiting innovations from
numerical linear algebra such as preconditioned conjugate gradient and a
little-known diagonal estimation rule. For a large class of compressed sensing
matrices, we provide theoretical justifications for why our method scales well
in high-dimensional settings. Through simulations, we show that CoFEM can be up
to thousands of times faster than existing baselines without sacrificing coding
accuracy. Through applications to calcium imaging deconvolution and
multi-contrast MRI reconstruction, we show that CoFEM enables SBL to tractably
tackle high-dimensional sparse coding problems of practical interest.]]></summary>

algorithm. Deployment of $Q$-learning requires approximation of the

method wherein the random forest is grown as learning proceeds (through
expanding forests). We demonstrate improved performance of our methods over

resilience to overfitting enjoyed by random forests recommends our method for

We show that expanding forests (in which the number of trees increases as data

data to extract useful latent representations replacing traditional input
features in the downstream task. In audio/speech signal processing, a wide
range of features where engineered through decades of research efforts. As it
turns out, learning to predict such features (a.k.a pseudo-labels) has proven
to be a particularly relevant pretext task, leading to useful self-supervised
representations which prove to be effective for downstream tasks. However,
methods and common practices for combining such pretext tasks for better
performance on the downstream task have not been explored and understood
properly. In fact, the process relies almost exclusively on a computationally
heavy experimental procedure, which becomes intractable with the increase of
the number of pretext tasks. This paper introduces a method to select a group
of pretext tasks among a set of candidates. The method we propose estimates
calibrated weights for the partial losses corresponding to the considered
pretext tasks during the self-supervised training process. The experiments
conducted on automatic speech recognition, speaker and emotion recognition
validate our approach, as the groups selected and weighted with our method
perform better than classic baselines, thus facilitating the selection and
combination of relevant pseudo-labels for self-supervised representation

transformations of Gaussians. Given samples of the form $p(x)$, where $x\sim
N(0, \mathrm{Id}_r)$ is hidden and $p: \mathbb{R}^r \to \mathbb{R}^d$ is a
function where every output coordinate is a low-degree polynomial, the goal is
to learn the distribution over $p(x)$. This problem is natural in its own
right, but is also an important special case of learning deep generative
models, namely pushforwards of Gaussians under two-layer neural networks with
polynomial activations. Understanding the learnability of such generative
models is crucial to understanding why they perform so well in practice.

Our first main result is a polynomial-time algorithm for learning quadratic
transformations of Gaussians in a smoothed setting. Our second main result is a
polynomial-time algorithm for learning constant-degree polynomial
transformations of Gaussian in a smoothed setting, when the rank of the
associated tensors is small. In fact our results extend to any
rotation-invariant input distribution, not just Gaussian. These are the first
end-to-end guarantees for learning a pushforward under a neural network with
more than one layer.

Along the way, we also give the first polynomial-time algorithms with

work, our task of interest is graph classification. Several GNN models have
been proposed and shown great accuracy in this task. However, the question is
whether usual training methods fully realize the capacity of the GNN models.

In this work, we propose a two-stage training framework based on triplet
loss. In the first stage, GNN is trained to map each graph to a Euclidean-space
vector so that graphs of the same class are close while those of different
classes are mapped far apart. Once graphs are well-separated based on labels, a
classifier is trained to distinguish between different classes. This method is
generic in the sense that it is compatible with any GNN model. By adapting five
GNN models to our method, we demonstrate the consistent improvement in accuracy
and utilization of each GNN's allocated capacity over the original training
method of each model up to 5.4\% points in 12 datasets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background: Selecting feature genes to predict phenotypes is one of the
typical tasks in analyzing genomics data. Though many general-purpose
algorithms were developed for prediction, dealing with highly correlated genes
in the prediction model is still not well addressed. High correlation among
genes introduces technical problems, such as multi-collinearity issues, leading
to unreliable prediction models. Furthermore, when a causal gene (whose
variants have an actual biological effect on a phenotype) is highly correlated
with other genes, most algorithms select the feature gene from the correlated
group in a purely data-driven manner. Since the correlation structure among
genes could change substantially when condition changes, the prediction model
based on not correctly selected feature genes is unreliable. Therefore, we aim
to keep the causal biological signal in the prediction process and build a more
robust prediction model.

Method: We propose a grouping algorithm, which treats highly correlated genes
as a group and uses their common pattern to represent the group's biological
signal in feature selection. Our novel grouping algorithm can be integrated
into existing prediction algorithms to enhance their prediction performance.
Our proposed grouping method has two advantages. First, using the gene group's
common patterns makes the prediction more robust and reliable under condition
change. Second, it reports whole correlated gene groups as discovered
biomarkers for prediction tasks, allowing researchers to conduct follow-up
studies to identify causal genes within the identified groups.

Result: Using real benchmark scRNA-seq datasets with simulated cell
phenotypes, we demonstrate our novel method significantly outperforms standard
models in both (1) prediction of cell phenotypes and (2) feature gene
selection.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the graph matching problem we observe two graphs $G,H$ and the goal is to
find an assignment (or matching) between their vertices such that some measure
of edge agreement is maximized. We assume in this work that the observed pair
$G,H$ has been drawn from the correlated Wigner model -- a popular model for
correlated weighted graphs -- where the entries of the adjacency matrices of
$G$ and $H$ are independent Gaussians and each edge of $G$ is correlated with
one edge of $H$ (determined by the unknown matching) with the edge correlation
described by a parameter $\sigma\in [0,1)$. In this paper, we analyse the
performance of the projected power method (PPM) as a seeded graph matching
algorithm where we are given an initial partially correct matching (called the
seed) as side information. We prove that if the seed is close enough to the
ground-truth matching, then with high probability, PPM iteratively improves the
seed and recovers the ground-truth matching (either partially or exactly) in
$\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ iterations. Our results prove that PPM works even in
regimes of constant $\sigma$, thus extending the analysis in (Mao et al.,2021)
for the sparse Erd\"os-Renyi model to the (dense) Wigner model. As a byproduct
of our analysis, we see that the PPM framework generalizes some of the
state-of-art algorithms for seeded graph matching. We support and complement
our theoretical findings with numerical experiments on synthetic data.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the field of artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning is a type of machine-learning strategy that rewards desirable behaviors while penalizing those which aren’t. An agent can perceive its surroundings and act accordingly through trial and error in general with this form or presence – it’s kind of like getting feedback on what works for you. However, learning rules from scratch in contexts with complex exploration problems is a big challenge in RL. Because the agent does not receive any intermediate incentives, it cannot determine how close it is to complete the goal. As a result, exploring the space at random becomes necessary until the door opens. Given the length of the task and the level of precision required, this is highly unlikely.
 Exploring the state space randomly with preliminary information should be avoided while performing this activity. This prior knowledge aids the agent in determining which states of the environment are desirable and should be investigated further. Offline data collected by human demonstrations, programmed policies, or other RL agents could be used to train a policy and then initiate a new RL policy. This would include copying the pre-trained policy’s neural network to the new RL policy in the scenario where we utilize neural networks to describe the procedures. This process transforms the new RL policy into a pre-trained one. However, as seen below, naively initializing a new RL policy like this frequently fails, especially for value-based RL approaches.

 Description:
 "I have been planning to start a machine learning live series on topics that involve some intermediate mathematics, so I can help you to clarify some concepts. In order to fully grasp these concepts, you need to have sound knowledge of linear algebra, calculus, statistics and probability. However, if you just want to come and hear it for fun, please do so as well!
 The first topic is variational autoencoders with normalized flow, which I'll fully explain its beautiful mathematics over a period of a few sessions. You can find my notes on my GitHub site:
 https://github.com/roboticcam/machine-learning-notes/blob/master/files/vb_nf.pdf
 I will post the Zoom link to the registered participants.
 Please join us!"

 We have a model used in cardiac MRi imaging, it is used to select the best image in a series of images. It consists of images -> Resnet -> LSTM -> output.
 The heatmap we generate from the Resnet alone shows output like the image attached, instead of actual anatomy, there is only little squares. We think this is likely due to the residual in the Resnet because it is not present in a VGG, but does anyone else have a better explanation, and an idea of how to visualise a Resnet?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, a bit of background, I am doing an RnD project in the area of improving the layout analysis of scientific documents. The proposed method is to use an active learning loop on standard object detection models and target those classes/layouts which are performing poorly and train the model based on them.
 Now, we have some selection strategies based on submodular selection functions to target the pages we want. I also have set up code to extract embeddings which will help me do the selection. But I don't have prior experience in active learning, especially setting it up with detectron2, because it seems to register a dataset to train, and it is really difficult to change dynamically in the middle of training, which is my use case.
 So I need some advice on the following:-
  
The document analysis datasets are huge, DocBank is 50GB of images alone. How can I effectively store the embeddings in memory when I will call my selection algorithms mentioned above?
 How to set up an active learning loop in detectron2 for object detection. Or are there any alternatives? Some resources/code would be better
 There is some literature evidence suggesting that simple CNN backbone embeddings represent an image better than FasterRCNN or MaskRCNN embeddings. Specifically, this paper seems to be working on spliced image retrieval and it claims the following. Any thoughts/prior experience on this?
 Finally, is there any evidence supporting improvement in accuracy/precision in object detection using active learning? Or are there some better training paradigms?
  
Thank you for your patience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When deep networks or inputs involve extensive data sequences, learning in neural networks can be unstable. Recurrent states in vanilla recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are generated by repeatedly applying a linear transformation followed by a pointwise nonlinearity. This becomes unstable when the linear transformation’s eigenvalues are not of magnitude one. 
 Unitary matrices have been utilized to solve the problem of disappearing and exploding gradients because they have eigenvalues of size one, naturally, and have been. Unitary convolutional layers have recently been developed in a similar way to aid in the development of more stable deep networks with norm-preserving transformations.
 The loss function’s derivative with respect to the weights is called a gradient. During backpropagation in neural networks, it is utilized to update the weights to minimize the loss function. When traveled backward with each layer, the derivative or slope continuously grows lower, resulting in a vanishing gradient. When the weight update is exponentially small, the training time is excessively long. In the worst-case scenario, the neural network training may be stopped entirely. Exploding gradients, on the other hand, occur when the slope increases with each successive layer during backpropagation. The gradient will never converge due to the high weights, causing it to oscillate around the minima without ever reaching a global minima point.

 Q[s,a] = Q[s,a] + lr * (reward + gamma * max(Q[s,a]t+1) — Q[s,a]) 
 Where future state reward is considered since the best current reward doesn't grantee the optimal path. E.g.: 
  
Path A: Q[s,a]t = 1, Q[s,a]t+1 = 10 Total: 11
 Path B: Q[s,a]t = 5, Q[s,a]t+1 = 1 Total: 6
  
Not sure if this is a good analogy but here it gives the result that A is the optimal path even though its immediate reward at (t) is less than B.
 Further Question:
 Is there additional benefits to considering future rewards further than Q[s,a]t+1 ?
 Example: 
 Q[s,a] = Q[s,a] + lr * (reward + gamma* max(Q[s,a]t+2) - gamma * max(Q[s,a]t+1) — Q[s,a])

The input data is a 2D matrix, with the states/features being one dimension and time being the other dimension. But I want to use multiple trajectories of the same dynamical system for training, so the training data would be 3D (i.e., multiple 2D matrices). Are there examples where this has been done?
 Linear regression techniques (like pseudoinverse or LASSO) seem to be used to get the system matrix (in DMD) or the weights for the features (in SINDy). Can these methods be extended to 3D input data?

 Happy to share our CVPR-2022 paper "Local Learning Matters: Rethinking Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning"
 Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14213.pdf
 Code: https://github.com/mmendiet/FedAlign
 Federated learning (FL) is a promising strategy for performing privacy-preserving, distributed learning with a network of clients (i.e., edge devices). However, the data distribution among clients is often non-IID in nature, making efficient optimization difficult. To alleviate this issue, many FL algorithms focus on mitigating the effects of data heterogeneity across clients by introducing a variety of proximal terms, some incurring considerable compute and/or memory overheads, to restrain local updates with respect to the global model. Instead, we consider rethinking solutions to data heterogeneity in FL with a focus on local learning generality rather than proximal restriction. To this end, we first present a systematic study informed by second-order indicators to better understand algorithm effectiveness in FL. Interestingly, we find that standard regularization methods are surprisingly strong performers in mitigating data heterogeneity effects. Based on our findings, we further propose a simple and effective method, FedAlign, to overcome data heterogeneity and the pitfalls of previous methods. FedAlign achieves competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art FL methods across a variety of settings while minimizing computation and memory overhead.

 ​
 Extreme-scale language models have recently exhibited incredible performance on natural language processing challenges. This is due to their ever-increasing size, exceeding 500 billion parameters. However, while these models have grown in popularity in recent years, the amount of data utilized to train them has not increased. The current generation of huge language models is clearly undertrained. Three prediction approaches for optimally choosing both model size and training length have been proposed by a DeepMind research team.
 Three approaches have been mentioned to estimate the optimal parameter:
  
Change the size of the models and the number of training tokens.
 IsoFLOP profiles
 Using a parametric loss function to fit a model
  
The ultimate pretraining loss is calculated as the number of model parameters and training tokens. They minimize the loss function under the restriction of the FLOPs function, which is equal to the computational budget because the computational budget is a probabilistic function of the number of observed training tokens and model parameters.

Dear ICML Authors, 
 As we are seeing this happen, we just wanted to send you a brief explanation -- this only applies to some few papers. A few papers are losing reviews because of newly arising conflicts. If you did not enter your conflicts in CMT during the submission phase (as requested via CMT), then they could not be used in paper assignments. If you enter them now, any reviews by reviewers with conflicting domains will disappear, and you may see fewer reviews as a result. Unfortunately, we have no control over this, as the conflicts should have been entered when the paper was submitted. 
 Best,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I built a small library to help with hyperparameter search for deep learning models created with pytorch, because I got kinda tired of having to rewrite large pieces code over and over again.
 You can check it out here: https://github.com/michi-jeremias/tinydl or you can even install it with pip (pip install tinydl). I have included a readme and an example of how the library can be used.
 About the library, it's pretty flexible about reporting different metrics to the console and to tensorboard (add_scalar, add_hparam) at each stage of the process, like after a batch, epoch of after a whole run over multiple epochs. It can also be easily extended to include other metrics or new types of outputs.
 Since this is basically my first attempt at a software project that's not intended only to be used by myself I'd be happy about any feedback you have for me!
 If the project doesn't qualify to be posted here due to being too simple/too much on a beginner level, apologies for that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to implement stylegan2 and there are so many things here that are not explained either well, or at all in the paper.
 ​
  
How exactly is path length regularization implemented? In this PT code we can see that the $|J^T_w.y|$ is computed as follows:
  
​
 def g_path_regularize(fake_img, latents, mean_path_length, decay=0.01): noise = torch.randn_like(fake_img) / math.sqrt( fake_img.shape[2] * fake_img.shape[3] ) grad, = autograd.grad( outputs=(fake_img * noise).sum(), inputs=latents, create_graph=True ) path_lengths = torch.sqrt(grad.pow(2).sum(2).mean(1)) path_mean = mean_path_length + decay * (path_lengths.mean() - mean_path_length) path_penalty = (path_lengths - path_mean).pow(2).mean() return path_penalty, path_mean.detach(), path_lengths 
 This is based on this official TF implementation.
 The problem I have is that from what I understand, fake_img is 4D, and latents is 2D. The grad output in this case will be 2D and grad.pow(2).sum(2) cannot be computed because the third axis does not exist. Obviously people who are using these repos have not reported any issue regarding mismatch of shapes and axes, so I believe there is something else going on. Since I'm trying to implement this in my own network, I cannot get the desired shape any how. I get a 2D gradient output.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I spent some time reading about and playing around with speech denoising DNNs ~2019. At the time the popular architecture was U-Net (encoder -> bottleneck -> decoder with skip connections) operating on spectrograms. These U-Nets were trained directly on noisy/clean speech pairs and the loss was the difference between the predicted denoised images and actual denoised image. MSE between the predicted/actual images was a baseline loss but people alse added "feature loss" or sometimes a GAN-based loss function as well.
 Anyway a cursory reading of the DALL-E 2 paper has me thinking about that approach. I'm curious to know if a similar approach used for DALL-E has been tried for audio denoising:
  
pre-train an encoder/decoder in a self-supervised fashion on a large dataset of audio
 train a denoiser to operate only in the latent space (ie the most compressed representation that is passed from the encoder to the decoder)
  
step 1 - self-supervised training of encoder/decoder

 step 2 - train denoiser in latent space only

 step 3 - do inference by feeding denoised latent space vector into the decoder

 Is this a common approach already? It seems like once you have a good pretrained encoder/decoder pair then the denoiser training would be much more efficient than training an entire network that does everything at once from scratch (smaller search space, faster training loop)

have opened the door to multi-robot systems consisting of hundreds/thousands of
robots, with promising applications to automated manufacturing, disaster
relief, harvesting, last-mile delivery, port/airport operations, or search and
rescue. The community has leveraged model-free multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) to devise efficient, scalable controllers for multi-robot
systems (MRS). This review aims to provide an analysis of the state-of-the-art
in distributed MARL for multi-robot cooperation.

Recent findings: Decentralized MRS face fundamental challenges, such as
non-stationarity and partial observability. Building upon the "centralized
training, decentralized execution" paradigm, recent MARL approaches include
independent learning, centralized critic, value decomposition, and
communication learning approaches. Cooperative behaviors are demonstrated
through AI benchmarks and fundamental real-world robotic capabilities such as
multi-robot motion/path planning.

Summary: This survey reports the challenges surrounding decentralized
model-free MARL for multi-robot cooperation and existing classes of approaches.
We present benchmarks and robotic applications along with a discussion on
current open avenues for research.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Streamlined qBOLD acquisitions enable experimentally straightforward
observations of brain oxygen metabolism. $R_2^\prime$ maps are easily inferred;
however, the Oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and deoxygenated blood volume
(DBV) are more ambiguously determined from the data. As such, existing
inference methods tend to yield very noisy and underestimated OEF maps, while
overestimating DBV.

This work describes a novel probabilistic machine learning approach that can
infer plausible distributions of OEF and DBV. Initially, we create a model that
produces informative voxelwise prior distribution based on synthetic training
data. Contrary to prior work, we model the joint distribution of OEF and DBV
through a scaled multivariate logit-Normal distribution, which enables the
values to be constrained within a plausible range. The prior distribution model
is used to train an efficient amortized variational Bayesian inference model.
This model learns to infer OEF and DBV by predicting real image data, with few
training data required, using the signal equations as a forward model.

We demonstrate that our approach enables the inference of smooth OEF and DBV
maps, with a physiologically plausible distribution that can be adapted through
specification of an informative prior distribution. Other benefits include
model comparison (via the evidence lower bound) and uncertainty quantification
for identifying image artefacts. Results are demonstrated on a small study
comparing subjects undergoing hyperventilation and at rest. We illustrate that
the proposed approach allows measurement of gray matter differences in OEF and
DBV and enables voxelwise comparison between conditions, where we observe
significant increases in OEF and $R_2^\prime$ during hyperventilation.]]></summary>

contribution is to provide two simple first-order algorithmic frameworks based
on the quadratic penalty method and the augmented Lagrangian method,

provide nonasymptotic theoretical guarantees for these algorithms. More

distill the generative prior to capture a robust coarse-level content

problem in data mining, which has numerous applications. Existing
autoencoder-based approaches deliver state-of-the-art performance on
challenging real-world data but are vulnerable to outliers and exhibit low
explainability. To address these two limitations, we propose robust and
explainable unsupervised autoencoder frameworks that decompose an input time
series into a clean time series and an outlier time series using autoencoders.
Improved explainability is achieved because clean time series are better
explained with easy-to-understand patterns such as trends and periodicities. We
provide insight into this by means of a post-hoc explainability analysis and
empirical studies. In addition, since outliers are separated from clean time
series iteratively, our approach offers improved robustness to outliers, which
in turn improves accuracy. We evaluate our approach on five real-world datasets
and report improvements over the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of
robustness and explainability.

While deep learning models achieve superior performance, often statistically
better than humans, their adoption into safety-critical settings, such as
healthcare or self-driving cars is hindered by their inability to provide
safety guarantees or to expose the inner workings of the model in a human
understandable form. We present Mo\"ET, a novel model based on Mixture of
Experts, consisting of decision tree experts and a generalized linear model
gating function. Thanks to such gating function the model is more expressive
than the standard decision tree. To support non-differentiable decision trees
as experts, we formulate a novel training procedure. In addition, we introduce
a hard thresholding version, Mo\"ETH, in which predictions are made solely by a
single expert chosen via the gating function. Thanks to that property, Mo\"ETH
allows each prediction to be easily decomposed into a set of logical rules in a
form which can be easily verified. While Mo\"ET is a general use model, we
illustrate its power in the reinforcement learning setting. By training Mo\"ET
models using an imitation learning procedure on deep RL agents we outperform
the previous state-of-the-art technique based on decision trees while
preserving the verifiability of the models. Moreover, we show that Mo\"ET can

GNNs encounter significant performance degradation when the amount of
supervision signals, i.e., number of labeled nodes, is limited, which is
expected as GNNs are trained solely based on the supervision obtained from the
labeled nodes. On the other hand,recent self-supervised learning paradigm aims
to train GNNs by solving pretext tasks that do not require any labeled nodes,
and it has shown to even outperform GNNs trained with few labeled nodes.
However, a major drawback of self-supervised methods is that they fall short of
learning class discriminative node representations since no labeled information
is utilized during training. To this end, we propose a novel semi-supervised
method for graphs, GraFN, that leverages few labeled nodes to ensure nodes that
belong to the same class to be grouped together, thereby achieving the best of

randomly samples support nodes from labeled nodes and anchor nodes from the
entire graph. Then, it minimizes the difference between two predicted class
distributions that are non-parametrically assigned by anchor-supports

GraFN surpasses both the semi-supervised and self-supervised methods in terms

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adopting reinforcement learning (RL) for traffic signal control is
increasingly popular. Most RL methods use fixed action interval (denoted as
tduration) and actuate or maintain a phase every tduration, which makes the
phase duration less dynamic and flexible. In addition, the actuated phase can
be arbitrary, affecting the real-world deployment, which requires a fixed
cyclical phase structure. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-level
traffic signal control framework, DynLight, which uses an optimization method
Max-QueueLength (M-QL) to determine the phase and uses a deep Q-network to
determine the corresponding duration. Based on DynLight, we further propose
DynLight-C that adopts a well trained deep Q-network of DynLight and replace
M-QL by a fixed cyclical control policy that actuate a set of phases in fixed
order to realize cyclical phase structure. Comprehensive experiments on
multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that DynLight achives a new
state-of-the-art. Furthermore, the deep Q-network of DynLight can learn well on
determining the phase duration and DynLight-C demonstrates high performance for
deployment.]]></summary>

the population data reacts to competing decision makers' actions. This paper
formulates a new game theoretic framework for this phenomenon, called
"multi-player performative prediction". We focus on two distinct solution
concepts, namely (i) performatively stable equilibria and (ii) Nash equilibria
of the game. The latter equilibria are arguably more informative, but can be
found efficiently only when the game is monotone. We show that under mild
assumptions, the performatively stable equilibria can be found efficiently by a
variety of algorithms, including repeated retraining and the repeated
(stochastic) gradient method. We then establish transparent sufficient
conditions for strong monotonicity of the game and use them to develop
algorithms for finding Nash equilibria. We investigate derivative free methods
and adaptive gradient algorithms wherein each player alternates between
learning a parametric description of their distribution and gradient steps on
the empirical risk. Synthetic and semi-synthetic numerical experiments
illustrate the results.]]></summary>

various applications, this is frequently infeasible because of intractable
multiple summations (or integrations). Spatial Monte Carlo integration (SMCI)
is a sampling-based approximation, and can provide high-accuracy estimations
for such intractable expectations. To evaluate the expectation of a function of
variables in a specific region (called target region), SMCI considers a larger
region containing the target region (called sum region). In SMCI, the multiple
summation for the variables in the sum region is precisely executed, and that
in the outer region is evaluated by the sampling approximation such as the
standard Monte Carlo integration. It is guaranteed that the accuracy of the
SMCI estimator is monotonically improved as the size of the sum region
increases. However, a haphazard expansion of the sum region could cause a
combinatorial explosion. Therefore, we hope to improve the accuracy without
such region expansion. In this study, based on the theory of generalized least
squares, a new effective method is proposed by combining multiple SMCI
estimators. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated theoretically
and numerically. The results indicate that the proposed method can be effective
in the inverse Ising problem (or Boltzmann machine learning).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new data-driven method for operator learning of stochastic differential
equations(SDE) is proposed in this paper. The central goal is to solve forward
and inverse stochastic problems more effectively using limited data. Deep
operator network(DeepONet) has been proposed recently for operator learning.
Compared to other neural networks to learn functions, it aims at the problem of
learning nonlinear operators. However, it can be challenging by using the
original model to learn nonlinear operators for high-dimensional stochastic
problems. We propose a new multi-resolution autoencoder DeepONet model referred
to as MultiAuto-DeepONet to deal with this difficulty with the aid of
convolutional autoencoder. The encoder part of the network is designed to
reduce the dimensionality as well as discover the hidden features of
high-dimensional stochastic inputs. The decoder is designed to have a special
structure, i.e. in the form of DeepONet. The first DeepONet in decoder is
designed to reconstruct the input function involving randomness while the
second one is used to approximate the solution of desired equations. Those two
DeepONets has a common branch net and two independent trunk nets. This
architecture enables us to deal with multi-resolution inputs naturally. By
adding $L_1$ regularization to our network, we found the outputs from the
branch net and two trunk nets all have sparse structures. This reduces the
number of trainable parameters in the neural network thus making the model more
efficient. Finally, we conduct several numerical experiments to illustrate the
effectiveness of our proposed MultiAuto-DeepONet model with uncertainty
quantification.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Principal component analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction method in
data analysis that involves diagonalizing the covariance matrix of the dataset.
Recently, quantum algorithms have been formulated for PCA based on
diagonalizing a density matrix. These algorithms assume that the covariance
matrix can be encoded in a density matrix, but a concrete protocol for this
encoding has been lacking. Our work aims to address this gap. Assuming
amplitude encoding of the data, with the data given by the ensemble $\{p_i,|
\psi_i \rangle\}$, then one can easily prepare the ensemble average density
matrix $\overline{\rho} = \sum_i p_i |\psi_i\rangle \langle \psi_i |$. We first
show that $\overline{\rho}$ is precisely the covariance matrix whenever the
dataset is centered. For quantum datasets, we exploit global phase symmetry to
argue that there always exists a centered dataset consistent with
$\overline{\rho}$, and hence $\overline{\rho}$ can always be interpreted as a
covariance matrix. This provides a simple means for preparing the covariance
matrix for arbitrary quantum datasets or centered classical datasets. For
uncentered classical datasets, our method is so-called "PCA without centering",
which we interpret as PCA on a symmetrized dataset. We argue that this closely
corresponds to standard PCA, and we derive equations and inequalities that
bound the deviation of the spectrum obtained with our method from that of
standard PCA. We numerically illustrate our method for the MNIST handwritten
digit dataset. We also argue that PCA on quantum datasets is natural and
meaningful, and we numerically implement our method for molecular ground-state
datasets.]]></summary>

parsing Excel Files, reading and writing text files line by line, etc.
Developers can greatly benefit from automatic API usage sequence generation
based on natural language queries for building applications in a faster and
cleaner manner. Existing approaches utilize information retrieval models to
search for matching API sequences given a query or use RNN-based
encoder-decoder to generate API sequences. As it stands, the first approach
treats queries and API names as bags of words. It lacks deep comprehension of
the semantics of the queries. The latter approach adapts a neural language
model to encode a user query into a fixed-length context vector and generate
API sequences from the context vector.

We want to understand the effectiveness of recent Pre-trained Transformer
based Models (PTMs) for the API learning task. These PTMs are trained on large
natural language corpora in an unsupervised manner to retain contextual
knowledge about the language and have found success in solving similar Natural
Language Processing (NLP) problems. However, the applicability of PTMs has not
yet been explored for the API sequence generation task. We use a dataset that
contains 7 million annotations collected from GitHub to evaluate the PTMs
empirically. This dataset was also used to assess previous approaches. Based on
our results, PTMs generate more accurate API sequences and outperform other
related methods by around 11%. We have also identified two different
tokenization approaches that can contribute to a significant boost in PTMs'

data and difficulty of acquiring high quality labels. Active learning is a
paradigm for using algorithms to computationally select a useful subset of data
points to label using metrics for model uncertainty and data similarity. We
explore active learning for naturalistic computer vision emotion data, a
particularly heterogeneous and complex data space due to inherently subjective
labels. Using frames collected from gameplay acquired from a therapeutic
smartphone game for children with autism, we run a simulation of active
learning using gameplay prompts as metadata to aid in the active learning
process. We find that active learning using information generated during
gameplay slightly outperforms random selection of the same number of labeled
frames. We next investigate a method to conduct active learning with subjective
data, such as in affective computing, and where multiple crowdsourced labels
can be acquired for each image. Using the Child Affective Facial Expression
(CAFE) dataset, we simulate an active learning process for crowdsourcing many
labels and find that prioritizing frames using the entropy of the crowdsourced
label distribution results in lower categorical cross-entropy loss compared to
random frame selection. Collectively, these results demonstrate pilot
evaluations of two novel active learning approaches for subjective affective
data collected in noisy settings.]]></summary>

the neural-based methods learn the semantic connection between code diffs and

generate high-frequent and repetitive tokens in the corpus. In this paper, we
combine the advantages of the two technical routes and propose a novel

behind a data generating mechanism (i.e., phenomenon) we happen to be
interested in. Uncovering such relationships allows us to identify the true
working of a phenomenon and, most importantly, articulate a model that may
enable us to further explore the phenomenon on hand and/or allow us to predict
it accurately. Fundamentally, such models are likely to be derived via a causal
approach (as opposed to an observational or empirical mean). In this approach,
causal discovery is required to create a causal model, which can then be
applied to infer the influence of interventions, and answer any hypothetical
questions (i.e., in the form of What ifs? Etc.) that we might have. This paper
builds a case for causal discovery and causal inference and contrasts that
against traditional machine learning approaches; all from a civil and
structural engineering perspective. More specifically, this paper outlines the
key principles of causality and the most commonly used algorithms and packages
for causal discovery and causal inference. Finally, this paper also presents a

representation space by the variance and covariance loss. However, VICReg would
be ineffective on non-stationary time series where different parts/crops of

is becoming a growing concern. To address this issue, in recent years, studies
have focused on demonstrating how AI energy efficiency can be improved by
tuning the model training strategy. Nevertheless, how modifications applied to
datasets can impact the energy consumption of AI is still an open question. To
fill this gap, in this exploratory study, we evaluate if data-centric
approaches can be utilized to improve AI energy efficiency. To achieve our
goal, we conduct an empirical experiment, executed by considering 6 different
AI algorithms, a dataset comprising 5,574 data points, and two dataset
modifications (number of data points and number of features). Our results show
evidence that, by exclusively conducting modifications on datasets, energy
consumption can be drastically reduced (up to 92.16%), often at the cost of a
negligible or even absent accuracy decline. As additional introductory results,
we demonstrate how, by exclusively changing the algorithm used, energy savings
up to two orders of magnitude can be achieved. In conclusion, this exploratory

shape, and texture over the duration of a predefined time window spanning
multiple frames. Using differentiable rendering, we are able to estimate all
parameters by minimizing the pixel-wise reprojection error to the input video
via backpropagating through a rendering pipeline that accounts for motion blur
by averaging the graphics output over short time intervals. For that purpose,
we also estimate the camera exposure gap time within the same optimization. To
account for abrupt motion changes like bounces, we model the motion trajectory
as a piece-wise polynomial, and we are able to estimate the specific time of
the bounce at sub-frame accuracy. Experiments on established benchmark datasets

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi-institutional efforts can facilitate training of deep MRI
reconstruction models, albeit privacy risks arise during cross-site sharing of
imaging data. Federated learning (FL) has recently been introduced to address
privacy concerns by enabling distributed training without transfer of imaging
data. Existing FL methods for MRI reconstruction employ conditional models to
map from undersampled to fully-sampled acquisitions via explicit knowledge of
the imaging operator. Since conditional models generalize poorly across
different acceleration rates or sampling densities, imaging operators must be
fixed between training and testing, and they are typically matched across
sites. To improve generalization and flexibility in multi-institutional
collaborations, here we introduce a novel method for MRI reconstruction based
on Federated learning of Generative IMage Priors (FedGIMP). FedGIMP leverages a
two-stage approach: cross-site learning of a generative MRI prior, and
subject-specific injection of the imaging operator. The global MRI prior is
learned via an unconditional adversarial model that synthesizes high-quality MR
images based on latent variables. Specificity in the prior is preserved via a
mapper subnetwork that produces site-specific latents. During inference, the
prior is combined with subject-specific imaging operators to enable
reconstruction, and further adapted to individual test samples by minimizing
data-consistency loss. Comprehensive experiments on multi-institutional
datasets clearly demonstrate enhanced generalization performance of FedGIMP
against site-specific and federated methods based on conditional models, as
well as traditional reconstruction methods.]]></summary>

that a rich class of policies can be found by endowing the controller with a
scalar quantity, so called budget, that tracks how close the agent is to
violating the constraint. We show that the minimal budget required to act
safely can be obtained as the smallest fixed point of a Bellman-like operator,
for which we analyze its convergence properties. We also show how to learn this
quantity when the true kernel of the Markov decision process is not known,
while providing sample-complexity bounds. The utility of knowing this minimal

collaboratively training deep learning models without sharing patient data.
However, the data from different institutions are usually heterogeneous across
institutions, which may reduce the performance of models trained using
federated learning. In this study, we propose a novel heterogeneity-aware
federated learning method, SplitAVG, to overcome the performance drops from
data heterogeneity in federated learning. Unlike previous federated methods
that require complex heuristic training or hyper parameter tuning, our SplitAVG
leverages the simple network split and feature map concatenation strategies to
encourage the federated model training an unbiased estimator of the target data
distribution. We compare SplitAVG with seven state-of-the-art federated
learning methods, using centrally hosted training data as the baseline on a
suite of both synthetic and real-world federated datasets. We find that the
performance of models trained using all the comparison federated learning
methods degraded significantly with the increasing degrees of data
heterogeneity. In contrast, SplitAVG method achieves comparable results to the
baseline method under all heterogeneous settings, that it achieves 96.2% of the
accuracy and 110.4% of the mean absolute error obtained by the baseline in a
diabetic retinopathy binary classification dataset and a bone age prediction
dataset, respectively, on highly heterogeneous data partitions. We conclude
that SplitAVG method can effectively overcome the performance drops from
variability in data distributions across institutions. Experimental results
also show that SplitAVG can be adapted to different base networks and
generalized to various types of medical imaging tasks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The nonuniform quantization strategy for compressing neural networks usually
achieves better performance than its counterpart, i.e., uniform strategy, due
to its superior representational capacity. However, many nonuniform
quantization methods overlook the complicated projection process in
implementing the nonuniformly quantized weights/activations, which incurs
non-negligible time and space overhead in hardware deployment. In this study,
we propose Nonuniform-to-Uniform Quantization (N2UQ), a method that can
maintain the strong representation ability of nonuniform methods while being
hardware-friendly and efficient as the uniform quantization for model
inference. We achieve this through learning the flexible in-equidistant input
thresholds to better fit the underlying distribution while quantizing these
real-valued inputs into equidistant output levels. To train the quantized
network with learnable input thresholds, we introduce a generalized
straight-through estimator (G-STE) for intractable backward derivative
calculation w.r.t. threshold parameters. Additionally, we consider entropy
preserving regularization to further reduce information loss in weight
quantization. Even under this adverse constraint of imposing uniformly
quantized weights and activations, our N2UQ outperforms state-of-the-art
nonuniform quantization methods by 0.5~1.7 on ImageNet, demonstrating the
contribution of N2UQ design. Code and models are available at:

engineering, in this paper, we take a different perspective: the classification
margins. We study the relationship between the margins and logits
(classification scores) and empirically observe the biased margins and the
biased logits are positively correlated. We propose MARC, a simple yet
effective MARgin Calibration function to dynamically calibrate the biased
margins for unbiased logits. We validate MARC through extensive experiments on
common long-tailed benchmarks including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, Places-LT, and
iNaturalist-LT. Experimental results demonstrate that our MARC achieves
favorable results on these benchmarks. In addition, MARC is extremely easy to

challenge in surveillance applications. Such objects are represented by small

a generic slicing aided inference and fine-tuning pipeline for small object

applied on top of any available object detector without any fine-tuning.
Experimental evaluations, using object detection baselines on the Visdrone and
xView aerial object detection datasets show that the proposed inference method
can increase object detection AP by 6.8%, 5.1% and 5.3% for FCOS, VFNet and
TOOD detectors, respectively. Moreover, the detection accuracy can be further
increased with a slicing aided fine-tuning, resulting in a cumulative increase
of 12.7%, 13.4% and 14.5% AP in the same order. Proposed technique has been

agent by manipulating the cost signals. We show that a small falsification of
the cost parameters will only lead to a bounded change in the optimal policy.
The bound is linear on the amount of falsification the attacker can apply to
the cost parameters. We propose an attack model where the attacker aims to
mislead the agent into learning a `nefarious' policy by intentionally
falsifying the cost parameters. We formulate the attack's problem as a convex
optimization problem and develop necessary and sufficient conditions to check
the achievability of the attacker's goal.

We showcase the adversarial manipulation on two types of LQG learners: the
batch RL learner and the other is the adaptive dynamic programming (ADP)
learner. Our results demonstrate that with only 2.296% of falsification on the
cost data, the attacker misleads the batch RL into learning the 'nefarious'
policy that leads the vehicle to a dangerous position. The attacker can also
gradually trick the ADP learner into learning the same `nefarious' policy by
consistently feeding the learner a falsified cost signal that stays close to
the actual cost signal. The paper aims to raise people's awareness of the
security threats faced by RL-enabled control systems.]]></summary>

materials design and automated chemistry, is increasing. A major challenge,
however, lies in fact that measuring the state of the system is often costly
and time consuming in scientific applications, whereas policy learning with RL
requires a measurement after each time step. In this work, we make the
measurement costs explicit in the form of a costed reward and propose a
framework that enables off-the-shelf deep RL algorithms to learn a policy for
both selecting actions and determining whether or not to measure the current
state of the system at each time step. In this way, the agents learn to balance
the need for information with the cost of information. Our results show that
when trained under this regime, the Dueling DQN and PPO agents can learn
optimal action policies whilst making up to 50\% fewer state measurements, and
recurrent neural networks can produce a greater than 50\% reduction in
measurements. We postulate the these reduction can help to lower the barrier to
applying RL to real-world scientific applications.]]></summary>

deep neural network learns nonlinear representations at its hidden layers,
which are subsequently used for classification at its output layer. This
happens implicitly during training through minimizing a supervised or
unsupervised loss. In this paper, we study the dynamics of such implicit
nonlinear representation learning. We identify a pair of a new assumption and a
novel condition, called the common model structure assumption and the
data-architecture alignment condition. Under the common model structure
assumption, the data-architecture alignment condition is shown to be sufficient
for the global convergence and necessary for the global optimality. Moreover,
our theory explains how and when increasing the network size does and does not
improve the training behaviors in the practical regime. Our results provide
practical guidance for designing a model structure: e.g., the common model
structure assumption can be used as a justification for using a particular
model structure instead of others. We also derive a new training framework,
which satisfies the data-architecture alignment condition by automatically
modifying any given training algorithm. Given a standard training algorithm,
the framework running its modified version is empirically shown to maintain
competitive test performances while providing global convergence guarantees for
deep residual neural networks with convolutions, skip connections, and batch
normalization with datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Semeion,
KMNIST and SVHN.]]></summary>

represent the input data samples through a hierarchy of features, where the
size of the hierarchy is determined by the number of layers. In this paper, we
focus on enforcing the discriminative power of the high-level representations,
that are typically learned by the deeper layers (closer to the output). To this
end, we introduce a new loss term inspired by the Gini impurity, which is aimed
at minimizing the entropy (increasing the discriminative power) of individual
high-level features with respect to the class labels. Although our Gini loss
induces highly-discriminative features, it does not ensure that the
distribution of the high-level features matches the distribution of the
classes. As such, we introduce another loss term to minimize the
Kullback-Leibler divergence between the two distributions. We conduct
experiments on two image classification data sets (CIFAR-100 and Caltech 101),
considering multiple neural architectures ranging from convolutional networks
(ResNet-17, ResNet-18, ResNet-50) to transformers (CvT). Our empirical results

tool in solving tasks across various fields of application. The success of DNNs
is strongly connected to their high complexity in terms of the number of
network layers or of neurons in each layer, which severely complicates to
understand how DNNs solve their learned task. To improve the explainability of
DNNs, we adapt methods from neuroscience because this field has a rich
experience in analyzing complex and opaque systems. In this work, we draw
inspiration from how neuroscience uses topographic maps to visualize the
activity of the brain when it performs certain tasks. Transferring this
approach to DNNs can help to visualize and understand their internal processes
more intuitively, too. However, the inner structures of brains and DNNs differ
substantially. Therefore, to be able to visualize activations of neurons in
DNNs as topographic maps, we research techniques to layout the neurons in a
two-dimensional space in which neurons of similar activity are in the vicinity
of each other. In this work, we introduce and compare different methods to
obtain a topographic layout of the neurons in a network layer. Moreover, we
demonstrate how to use the resulting topographic activation maps to identify
errors or encoded biases in DNNs or data sets. Our novel visualization
technique improves the transparency of DNN-based algorithmic decision-making
systems and is accessible to a broad audience because topographic maps are
intuitive to interpret without expert-knowledge in Machine Learning.]]></summary>

prior biases about the environment it is exploring. Thus the robot assigns
equal importance to the goals which leads to insufficient exploration
efficiency. Alternative, often a hand-tuned policy is used to tweak the value
of goals. In this paper, we present a method to learn how "good" some states
are, measured by the state value function, to provide a hint for the robot to
make exploration decisions. We propose to learn state value functions from
previous offline collected datasets and then transfer and improve the value
function during testing in a new environment. Moreover, the environments
usually have very few and even no extrinsic reward or feedback for the robot.
Therefore in this work, we also tackle the problem of sparse extrinsic rewards
from the environments. We design several intrinsic rewards to encourage the
robot to obtain more information during exploration. These reward functions
then become the building blocks of the state value functions. We test our
method on challenging subterranean and urban environments. To the best of our
knowledge, this work for the first time demonstrates value function prediction
with previous collected datasets to help exploration in challenging

presence of covariate information along tensor modes. Our motivation comes from
online advertising where users click-through-rates (CTR) on ads over various
devices form a CTR tensor that has about 96% missing entries and has many zeros
on non-missing entries, which makes the standalone tensor completion method
unsatisfactory. Beside the CTR tensor, additional ad features or user
characteristics are often available. In this paper, we propose
Covariate-assisted Sparse Tensor Completion (COSTCO) to incorporate covariate
information for the recovery of the sparse tensor. The key idea is to jointly
extract latent components from both the tensor and the covariate matrix to
learn a synthetic representation. Theoretically, we derive the error bound for
the recovered tensor components and explicitly quantify the improvements on
both the reveal probability condition and the tensor recovery accuracy due to
covariates. Finally, we apply COSTCO to an advertisement dataset consisting of
a CTR tensor and ad covariate matrix, leading to 23% accuracy improvement over
the baseline. An important by-product is that ad latent components from COSTCO
reveal interesting ad clusters, which are useful for better ad targeting.]]></summary>

machine learning models, hyperparameter tuning is becoming increasingly
expensive. However, after assessing 40 tuning methods systematically, we find
that each faces certain limitations. In particular, methods that speed up
tuning via knowledge transfer typically require the final performance of
hyperparameters and do not focus on low-fidelity information. As we demonstrate
empirically, this common practice is suboptimal and can incur an unnecessary
use of resources. It is more cost-efficient to instead leverage low-fidelity
tuning observations to measure inter-task similarity and transfer knowledge
from existing to new tasks accordingly. However, performing multi-fidelity
tuning comes with its own challenges in the transfer setting: the noise in
additional observations and the need for performance forecasting. Therefore, we
propose and conduct a thorough analysis of a multi-task multi-fidelity Bayesian
optimization framework, which leads to the best instantiation--amortized

computer vision tasks despite large computation overhead against efficient
deployment. Structured (channel) pruning is usually applied to reduce the model
redundancy while preserving the network structure, such that the pruned network
can be easily deployed in practice. However, existing structured pruning
methods require hand-crafted rules which may lead to tremendous pruning space.
In this paper, we introduce Differentiable Annealing Indicator Search (DAIS)
that leverages the strength of neural architecture search in the channel
pruning and automatically searches for the effective pruned model with given
constraints on computation overhead. Specifically, DAIS relaxes the binarized
channel indicators to be continuous and then jointly learns both indicators and
model parameters via bi-level optimization. To bridge the non-negligible
discrepancy between the continuous model and the target binarized model, DAIS
proposes an annealing-based procedure to steer the indicator convergence
towards binarized states. Moreover, DAIS designs various regularizations based
on a priori structural knowledge to control the pruning sparsity and to improve
model performance. Experimental results show that DAIS outperforms
state-of-the-art pruning methods on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet.]]></summary>

in this paper. The approach combines a multi-channel multi-frame linear
filtering approach with a single-channel single-frame post-filter. Both
components rely on power spectral density (PSD) estimates provided by deep
neural networks (DNNs). This contribution extends our prior work, which shows
that directly optimizing for a criterion at the output of the multi-channel
linear filtering stage results in a more efficient dereverberation, as compared
to placing the criterion at the output of the DNN to optimize the PSD
estimation. In the present work, we show that the dereverberation performance
of the proposed first stage particularly improves the early-to-mid
reverberation ratio if trained end-to-end. We thus argue that it can be
combined with a post-filtering stage which benefits from the early-to-mid ratio
improvement and is consequently able to efficiently suppress the residual late
reverberation. This proposed two stage procedure is shown to be both very
effective in terms of dereverberation performance and computational demands.
Furthermore, the proposed system can be adapted to the needs of different types
of hearing-device users by controlling the amount of reduction of early
reflections. The proposed system outperforms the previously proposed end-to-end
DNN-supported linear filtering algorithm, as well as other traditional
approaches, based on an evaluation using the noise-free version of the WHAMR!

the variables are both discrete and continuous. In engineering applications,
the objective function is typically calculated with a numerically costly
black-box simulation.General mixed and costly optimization problems are
therefore of a great practical interest, yet their resolution remains in a
large part an open scientific question. In this article, costly mixed problems
are approached through Gaussian processes where the discrete variables are
relaxed into continuous latent variables. The continuous space is more easily
harvested by classical Bayesian optimization techniques than a mixed space
would. Discrete variables are recovered either subsequently to the continuous
optimization, or simultaneously with an additional continuous-discrete
compatibility constraint that is handled with augmented Lagrangians. Several
possible implementations of such Bayesian mixed optimizers are compared. In
particular, the reformulation of the problem with continuous latent variables
is put in competition with searches working directly in the mixed space. Among
the algorithms involving latent variables and an augmented Lagrangian, a
particular attention is devoted to the Lagrange multipliers for which a local
and a global estimation techniques are studied. The comparisons are based on
the repeated optimization of three analytical functions and a beam design
problem.]]></summary>

concentrate on a subset of these concerning issues by prioritizing them
according to their contributions to motivational indices, e.g., the probability
of winning a game. This idea of concentration offers insights into
reinforcement learning of sophisticated Large-scale Multi-Agent Systems (LMAS)
participated by hundreds of agents. In such an LMAS, each agent receives a long
series of entity observations at each step, which can overwhelm existing
aggregation networks such as graph attention networks and cause inefficiency.
In this paper, we propose a concentration network called ConcNet. First,
ConcNet scores the observed entities considering several motivational indices,
e.g., expected survival time and state value of the agents, and then ranks,
prunes, and aggregates the encodings of observed entities to extract features.
Second, distinct from the well-known attention mechanism, ConcNet has a unique
motivational subnetwork to explicitly consider the motivational indices when
scoring the observed entities. Furthermore, we present a concentration policy
gradient architecture that can learn effective policies in LMAS from scratch.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the presented architecture has excellent
scalability and flexibility, and significantly outperforms existing methods on
LMAS benchmarks.]]></summary>

generative models for weakly-supervised data. Yet, despite their advantage of
weak supervision, they exhibit a gap in generative quality compared to unimodal
VAEs, which are completely unsupervised. In an attempt to explain this gap, we
uncover a fundamental limitation that applies to a large family of
mixture-based multimodal VAEs. We prove that the sub-sampling of modalities
enforces an undesirable upper bound on the multimodal ELBO and thereby limits
the generative quality of the respective models. Empirically, we showcase the
generative quality gap on both synthetic and real data and present the
tradeoffs between different variants of multimodal VAEs. We find that none of
the existing approaches fulfills all desired criteria of an effective
multimodal generative model when applied on more complex datasets than those
used in previous benchmarks. In summary, we identify, formalize, and validate
fundamental limitations of VAE-based approaches for modeling weakly-supervised
data and discuss implications for real-world applications.]]></summary>

of models by calibrating them using prediction confidence and difficulty score

then train a calibrator to predict the likelihood of correctness of the model's
prediction. We instantiate our method with Natural Language Inference (NLI) and
Duplicate Detection (DD) tasks and evaluate it in both In-Domain (IID) and
Out-of-Domain (OOD) settings. In (IID, OOD) settings, we show that the

techniques such as data augmentation methods, which generate training samples
that increase the diversity of data and richness of label information. A
popular recent method, mixup, uses convex combinations of pairs of original
samples to generate new samples. However, as we show in our experiments, mixup
can produce undesirable synthetic samples, where the data is sampled off the
manifold and can contain incorrect labels. We propose $\zeta$-mixup, a
generalization of mixup with provably and demonstrably desirable properties
that allows convex combinations of $N \geq 2$ samples, leading to more
realistic and diverse outputs that incorporate information from $N$ original
samples by using a $p$-series interpolant. We show that, compared to mixup,
$\zeta$-mixup better preserves the intrinsic dimensionality of the original
datasets, which is a desirable property for training generalizable models.
Furthermore, we show that our implementation of $\zeta$-mixup is faster than
mixup, and extensive evaluation on controlled synthetic and 24 real-world
natural and medical image classification datasets shows that $\zeta$-mixup
outperforms mixup and traditional data augmentation techniques.]]></summary>

planet with unprecedented accuracy. Radiative transfer models (RTMs) encode the
energy transfer through the atmosphere, and are used to model and understand

status of the Earth from satellite observations by inverse modeling. However,
performing inference over such simulators is a challenging problem. RTMs are
nonlinear, non-differentiable and computationally costly codes, which adds a
high level of difficulty in inference. In this paper, we introduce two
computational techniques to infer not only point estimates of biophysical
parameters but also their joint distribution. One of them is based on a
variational autoencoder approach and the second one is based on a Monte Carlo
Expectation Maximization (MCEM) scheme. We compare and discuss benefits and
drawbacks of each approach. We also provide numerical comparisons in synthetic
simulations and the real PROSAIL model, a popular RTM that combines land
vegetation leaf and canopy modeling. We analyze the performance of the two

the past decade in Anglo-European research institutions as an attempt to bring
together a critique of the power dynamics that underlie accelerating trends of
datafication with a normative commitment to the principles of social justice-a
commitment to the achievement of a society that is equitable, fair, and capable
of confronting the root causes of injustice.However, despite the seeming
novelty of such a data justice pedigree, this joining up of the critique of the
power imbalances that have shaped the digital and "big data" revolutions with a
commitment to social equity and constructive societal transformation has a
deeper historical, and more geographically diverse, provenance. As the stories
of the data justice initiatives, activism, and advocacy contained in this
volume well evidence, practices of data justice across the globe have, in fact,
largely preceded the elaboration and crystallisation of the idea of data
justice in contemporary academic discourse. In telling these data justice
stories, we hope to provide the reader with two interdependent tools of data
justice thinking: First, we aim to provide the reader with the critical
leverage needed to discern those distortions and malformations of data justice
that manifest in subtle and explicit forms of power, domination, and coercion.
Second, we aim to provide the reader with access to the historically effective
forms of normativity and ethical insight that have been marshalled by data
justice activists and advocates as tools of societal transformation-so that
these forms of normativity and insight can be drawn on, in turn, as
constructive resources to spur future transformative data justice practices.]]></summary>

Grownup learners of a language tweak their speech to match the tutor reference.

The system prompts the user to pronounce a phrase. The speech is recorded,
and the samples associated with the inaccurate phoneme are masked with zeros.
This waveform serves as an input to a speech generator, implemented as a deep
learning inpainting system with a U-net architecture, and trained to output a
reconstructed speech. The training set is composed of unimpaired proper speech
examples, and the generator is trained to reconstruct the original proper

transformer-based Natural Language Processing models. This attention mechanism
calculates a correlation score for each word with respect to the other words in
a sentence. Commonly, only a small subset of words highly correlates with the
word under attention, which is only determined at runtime. As such, a
significant amount of computation is inconsequential due to low attention
scores and can potentially be pruned. The main challenge is finding the
threshold for the scores below which subsequent computation will be
inconsequential. Although such a threshold is discrete, this paper formulates
its search through a soft differentiable regularizer integrated into the loss
function of the training. This formulation piggy backs on the back-propagation
training to analytically co-optimize the threshold and the weights
simultaneously, striking a formally optimal balance between accuracy and
computation pruning. To best utilize this mathematical innovation, we devise a
bit-serial architecture, dubbed LeOPArd, for transformer language models with
bit-level early termination microarchitectural mechanism. We evaluate our
design across 43 back-end tasks for MemN2N, BERT, ALBERT, GPT-2, and Vision

train memory-guided networks and simulate virtual test to 1) learn how to
memorize a domain-agnostic and distinct information of classes and 2) offer an
externally settled memory as a class-guidance to reduce the ambiguity of
representation in the test data of arbitrary unseen domain. To this end, we
also propose memory divergence and feature cohesion losses, which encourage to

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) aim to extend deep learning techniques to graph
data and have achieved significant progress in graph analysis tasks (e.g., node
classification) in recent years. However, similar to other deep neural networks
like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs),
GNNs behave like a black box with their details hidden from model developers
and users. It is therefore difficult to diagnose possible errors of GNNs.
Despite many visual analytics studies being done on CNNs and RNNs, little
research has addressed the challenges for GNNs. This paper fills the research
gap with an interactive visual analysis tool, GNNLens, to assist model
developers and users in understanding and analyzing GNNs. Specifically,
Parallel Sets View and Projection View enable users to quickly identify and
validate error patterns in the set of wrong predictions; Graph View and Feature
Matrix View offer a detailed analysis of individual nodes to assist users in
forming hypotheses about the error patterns. Since GNNs jointly model the graph
structure and the node features, we reveal the relative influences of the two
types of information by comparing the predictions of three models: GNN,
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and GNN Without Using Features (GNNWUF). Two case
studies and interviews with domain experts demonstrate the effectiveness of
GNNLens in facilitating the understanding of GNN models and their errors.]]></summary>

machine learning which can be used to reduce the feature dimension without
deteriorating model's performance. Since obtaining annotated data is laborious
or even infeasible in many cases, unsupervised feature selection is more
practical in reality. Though lots of methods for unsupervised feature selection
have been proposed, these methods select features independently, thus it is no
guarantee that the group of selected features is optimal. What's more, the
number of selected features must be tuned carefully to obtain a satisfactory
result. To tackle these problems, we propose a joint adaptive graph and
structured sparsity regularization unsupervised feature selection (JASFS)
method in this paper, in which a $l_{2,0}$-norm regularization term with
respect to transformation matrix is imposed in the manifold learning for
feature selection, and a graph regularization term is incorporated into the
learning model to learn the local geometric structure of data adaptively. An
efficient and simple iterative algorithm is designed to solve the proposed
optimization problem with the analysis of computational complexity. After
optimized, a subset of optimal features will be selected in group, and the
number of selected features will be determined automatically. Experimental
results on eight benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed method compared with several state-of-the-art approaches.]]></summary>

a given design as input they compute an output representing system behavior.
Blackboxes are intended to be run in the forward direction. This paper presents
a new method of solving the inverse design problem namely, given requirements
or constraints on output, find an input that also optimizes an objective
function. This problem is challenging for several reasons. First, blackboxes
are not designed to be run in reverse. Second, inputs and outputs can be
discrete and continuous. Third, finding designs concurrently satisfying a set
of requirements is hard because designs satisfying individual requirements may
conflict with each other. Fourth, blackbox evaluations can be expensive.
Finally, blackboxes can sometimes fail to produce an output. This paper
presents CNMA, a new method of solving the inverse problem that overcomes these
challenges. CNMA tries to sample only the part of the design space relevant to
solving the problem, leveraging the power of neural networks, Mixed Integer
Linear Programs, and a new learning-from-failure feedback loop. The paper also
presents a parallel version of CNMA that improves the efficiency and quality of
solutions over the sequential version, and tries to steer it away from local
optima. CNMA's performance is evaluated against conventional optimization
methods for seven nonlinear design problems of 8 (two problems), 10, 15, 36 and
60 real-valued dimensions and one with 186 binary dimensions. Conventional
methods evaluated are off-the-shelf implementations of Bayesian Optimization
with Gaussian Processes, Nelder Mead and Random Search. The first two do not
solve problems that are high-dimensional, have discrete and continuous
variables or whose blackboxes can fail to return values. CNMA solves all
problems, and surpasses the performance of conventional methods by up to 87%.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DeepTensor is a computationally efficient framework for low-rank
decomposition of matrices and tensors using deep generative networks. We
decompose a tensor as the product of low-rank tensor factors (e.g., a matrix as
the outer product of two vectors), where each low-rank tensor is generated by a
deep network (DN) that is trained in a self-supervised manner to minimize the
mean-squared approximation error. Our key observation is that the implicit
regularization inherent in DNs enables them to capture nonlinear signal
structures (e.g., manifolds) that are out of the reach of classical linear
methods like the singular value decomposition (SVD) and principal component
analysis (PCA). Furthermore, in contrast to the SVD and PCA, whose performance
deteriorates when the tensor's entries deviate from additive white Gaussian
noise, we demonstrate that the performance of DeepTensor is robust to a wide
range of distributions. We validate that DeepTensor is a robust and
computationally efficient drop-in replacement for the SVD, PCA, nonnegative
matrix factorization (NMF), and similar decompositions by exploring a range of
real-world applications, including hyperspectral image denoising, 3D MRI
tomography, and image classification. In particular, DeepTensor offers a 6dB
signal-to-noise ratio improvement over standard denoising methods for signals
corrupted by Poisson noise and learns to decompose 3D tensors 60 times faster
than a single DN equipped with 3D convolutions.]]></summary>

environments is critical to the development of hearing aid (HA) devices. For
this, it is important to derive a metric that can fairly predict speech
intelligibility for HA users. A straightforward approach is to conduct a
subjective listening test and use the test results as an evaluation metric.
However, conducting large-scale listening tests is time-consuming and
expensive. Therefore, several evaluation metrics were derived as surrogates for
subjective listening test results. In this study, we propose a multi-branched
speech intelligibility prediction model (MBI-Net), for predicting the
subjective intelligibility scores of HA users. MBI-Net consists of two branches
of models, with each branch consisting of a hearing loss model, a cross-domain
feature extraction module, and a speech intelligibility prediction model, to
process speech signals from one channel. The outputs of the two branches are
fused through a linear layer to obtain predicted speech intelligibility scores.
Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of MBI-Net, which produces
higher prediction scores than the baseline system in Track 1 and Track 2 on the
Clarity Prediction Challenge 2022 dataset.]]></summary>

are significant resources for app developers.Analyzing app reviews have proved
to be useful for many areas of software engineering (e.g., requirement
engineering, testing). Automatic classification of app reviews requires
extensive efforts to manually curate a labeled dataset. When the classification
purpose changes (e.g. identifying bugs versus usability issues or sentiment),
new datasets should be labeled, which prevents the extensibility of the
developed models for new desired classes/tasks in practice. Recent pre-trained
neural language models (PTM) are trained on large corpora in an unsupervised
manner and have found success in solving similar Natural Language Processing
problems. However, the applicability of PTMs is not explored for app review
classification Objective: We investigate the benefits of PTMs for app review
classification compared to the existing models, as well as the transferability
of PTMs in multiple settings. Method: We empirically study the accuracy and
time efficiency of PTMs compared to prior approaches using six datasets from
literature. In addition, we investigate the performance of the PTMs trained on
app reviews (i.e. domain-specific PTMs) . We set up different studies to
evaluate PTMs in multiple settings: binary vs. multi-class classification,
zero-shot classification (when new labels are introduced to the model),
multi-task setting, and classification of reviews from different resources. The
datasets are manually labeled app review datasets from Google Play Store, Apple
App Store, and Twitter data. In all cases, Micro and Macro Precision, Recall,
and F1-scores will be used and we will report the time required for training

privacy. In this problem, we are given a universe $U$ of items, possibly of
infinite size, and a database $D$ of users. Each user $i$ contributes a subset
$W_i \subseteq U$ of items. We want an ($\epsilon$,$\delta$)-differentially
private algorithm which outputs a subset $S \subset \cup_i W_i$ such that the
size of $S$ is as large as possible. The problem arises in countless real world
applications; it is particularly ubiquitous in natural language processing
(NLP) applications as vocabulary extraction. For example, discovering words,
sentences, $n$-grams etc., from private text data belonging to users is an
instance of the set union problem.

Known algorithms for this problem proceed by collecting a subset of items
from each user, taking the union of such subsets, and disclosing the items
whose noisy counts fall above a certain threshold. Crucially, in the above
process, the contribution of each individual user is always independent of the
items held by other users, resulting in a wasteful aggregation process, where
some item counts happen to be way above the threshold. We deviate from the
above paradigm by allowing users to contribute their items in a
$\textit{dependent fashion}$, guided by a $\textit{policy}$. In this new
setting ensuring privacy is significantly delicate. We prove that any policy
which has certain $\textit{contractive}$ properties would result in a
differentially private algorithm. We design two new algorithms, one using
Laplace noise and other Gaussian noise, as specific instances of policies
satisfying the contractive properties. Our experiments show that the new
algorithms significantly outperform previously known mechanisms for the

reduce ~80% of operations while maintaining the original 98.4% accuracy.

learning (RL) problems with either strongly convex or general convex
regularizers. By exploring the structural properties of these overall highly
nonconvex problems we show that the PMD methods exhibit fast linear rate of
convergence to the global optimality. We develop stochastic counterparts of
these methods, and establish an ${\cal O}(1/\epsilon)$ (resp., ${\cal
O}(1/\epsilon^2)$) sampling complexity for solving these RL problems with
strongly (resp., general) convex regularizers using different sampling schemes,
where $\epsilon$ denote the target accuracy. We further show that the
complexity for computing the gradients of these regularizers, if necessary, can
be bounded by ${\cal O}\{(\log_\gamma \epsilon) [(1-\gamma)L/\mu]^{1/2}\log
(1/\epsilon)\}$ (resp., ${\cal O} \{(\log_\gamma \epsilon )
(L/\epsilon)^{1/2}\}$)for problems with strongly (resp., general) convex
regularizers. Here $\gamma$ denotes the discounting factor. To the best of our
knowledge, these complexity bounds, along with our algorithmic developments,
appear to be new in both optimization and RL literature. The introduction of
these convex regularizers also greatly expands the flexibility and

means to scale educational tasks to the growing number of students. Recent
progress in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning has largely
influenced the field of ASAG, of which we survey the recent research
advancements. We complement previous surveys by providing a comprehensive
analysis of recently published methods that deploy deep learning approaches. In
particular, we focus our analysis on the transition from hand engineered
features to representation learning approaches, which learn representative
features for the task at hand automatically from large corpora of data. We
structure our analysis of deep learning methods along three categories: word
embeddings, sequential models, and attention-based methods. Deep learning
impacted ASAG differently than other fields of NLP, as we noticed that the
learned representations alone do not contribute to achieve the best results,
but they rather show to work in a complementary way with hand-engineered
features. The best performance are indeed achieved by methods that combine the
carefully hand-engineered features with the power of the semantic descriptions
provided by the latest models, like transformers architectures. We identify
challenges and provide an outlook on research direction that can be addressed

adolescence or early adulthood. It reduces the life expectancy of patients by
15 years. Abnormal behavior, perception of emotions, social relationships, and
reality perception are among its most significant symptoms. Past studies have
revealed the temporal and anterior lobes of hippocampus regions of brain get
affected by SZ. Also, increased volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and
decreased volume of white and gray matter can be observed due to this disease.
The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the popular neuroimaging technique used
to explore structural/functional brain abnormalities in SZ disorder owing to
its high spatial resolution. Various artificial intelligence (AI) techniques
have been employed with advanced image/signal processing methods to obtain
accurate diagnosis of SZ. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of
studies conducted on automated diagnosis of SZ using MRI modalities. Main
findings, various challenges, and future works in developing the automated SZ
detection are described in this paper.]]></summary>

human-annotated image-label data or language-image contrastive learning with
webly-crawled image-text pairs. While supervised learning may result in a more
discriminative representation, language-image pretraining shows unprecedented
zero-shot recognition capability, largely due to the different properties of
data sources and learning objectives. In this work, we introduce a new
formulation by combining the two data sources into a common image-text-label
space. In this space, we propose a new learning paradigm, called Unified
Contrastive Learning (UniCL) with a single learning objective to seamlessly
prompt the synergy of two data types. Extensive experiments show that our UniCL
is an effective way of learning semantically rich yet discriminative
representations, universally for image recognition in zero-shot, linear-probe,
fully finetuning and transfer learning scenarios. Particularly, it attains
gains up to 9.2% and 14.5% in average on zero-shot recognition benchmarks over
the language-image contrastive learning and supervised learning methods,
respectively. In linear probe setting, it also boosts the performance over the
two methods by 7.3% and 3.4%, respectively. Our study also indicates that UniCL
stand-alone is a good learner on pure image-label data, rivaling the supervised
learning methods across three image classification datasets and two types of
vision backbones, ResNet and Swin Transformer. Code is available at

lesions preceding oral cancer, being its presence one of the most important
factors in the progression toward carcinoma. This study proposes a method to
design a low computational cost classification system to support the detection
of dysplastic epithelia, contributing to reduce the variability of pathologist
assessments. We employ a multilayer artificial neural network (MLP-ANN) and
defining the regions of the epithelium to be assessed based on the knowledge of
the pathologist. The performance of the proposed solution was statistically
evaluated. The implemented MLP-ANN presented an average accuracy of 87%, with a
variability much inferior to that obtained from three trained evaluators.
Moreover, the proposed solution led to results which are very close to those
obtained using a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented by transfer
learning, with 100 times less computational complexity. In conclusion, our
results show that a simple neural network structure can lead to a performance
equivalent to that of much more complex structures, which are routinely used in

address this, we study how to discover interpretable equivariances from data.
Specifically, we formulate this discovery process as an optimization problem
over a model's parameter-sharing schemes. We propose to use the partition
distance to empirically quantify the accuracy of the recovered equivariance.
Also, we theoretically analyze the method for Gaussian data and provide a bound
on the mean squared gap between the studied discovery scheme and the oracle
scheme. Empirically, we show that the approach recovers known equivariances,
such as permutations and shifts, on sum of numbers and spatially-invariant

matrices that have shared rows and/or columns. For example, cancer studies that
integrate multiple omics platforms across multiple types of cancer, pan-omics
pan-cancer analysis, have extended our knowledge of molecular heterogenity
beyond what was observed in single tumor and single platform studies. However,
these studies have been limited by available statistical methodology. We
propose a flexible approach to the simultaneous factorization and decomposition
of variation across such bidimensionally linked matrices, BIDIFAC+. This
decomposes variation into a series of low-rank components that may be shared
across any number of row sets (e.g., omics platforms) or column sets (e.g.,
cancer types). This builds on a growing literature for the factorization and
decomposition of linked matrices, which has primarily focused on multiple
matrices that are linked in one dimension (rows or columns) only. Our objective
function extends nuclear norm penalization, is motivated by random matrix
theory, gives an identifiable decomposition under relatively mild conditions,
and can be shown to give the mode of a Bayesian posterior distribution. We
apply BIDIFAC+ to pan-omics pan-cancer data from TCGA, identifying shared and
specific modes of variability across 4 different omics platforms and 29
different cancer types.]]></summary>

diverse set of tasks, from a given task distribution, to generalize to unseen
tasks, from the same distribution, with a limited amount of labeled data. The
underlying requirement for effective few-shot generalization is to learn a good
representation of the task manifold. One way to encourage this is to preserve
local neighborhoods in the feature space learned by the few-shot learner. To
this end, we introduce the notion of interval bounds from the provably robust
training literature to few-shot learning. The interval bounds are used to
characterize neighborhoods around the training tasks. These neighborhoods can
then be preserved by minimizing the distance between a task and its respective
bounds. We further introduce a novel strategy to artificially form new tasks
for training by interpolating between the available tasks and their respective
interval bounds, to aid in cases with a scarcity of tasks. We apply our
framework to both model-agnostic meta-learning as well as prototype-based
metric-learning paradigms. The efficacy of our proposed approach is evident

life. Previously, stress levels were determined by speaking with people and
gaining insight into what they had experienced recently or in the past.
Typically, stress is caused by an incidence that occurred a long time ago, but
sometimes it is triggered by unknown factors. This is a challenging and complex
task, but recent research advances have provided numerous opportunities to
automate it. The fundamental features of most of these techniques are electro
dermal activity (EDA) and heart rate values (HRV). We utilized an accelerometer
to measure body motions to solve this challenge. The proposed novel method
employs a test that measures a subject's electrocardiogram (ECG), galvanic skin
values (GSV), HRV values, and body movements in order to provide a low-cost and
time-saving solution for detecting stress lifestyle disease in modern times
using cyber physical systems. This study provides a new hybrid model for
lifestyle disease classification that decreases execution time while picking
the best collection of characteristics and increases classification accuracy.
The developed approach is capable of dealing with the class imbalance problem
by using WESAD (wearable stress and affect dataset) dataset. The new model uses
the Grid search (GS) method to select an optimized set of hyper parameters, and
it uses a combination of the Correlation coefficient based Recursive feature
elimination (CoC-RFE) method for optimal feature selection and gradient
boosting as an estimator to classify the dataset, which achieves high accuracy
and helps to provide smart, accurate, and high-quality healthcare systems. To
demonstrate the validity and utility of the proposed methodology, its
performance is compared to those of other well-established machine learning
models.]]></summary>

increasingly complex and hence the underlying system dynamics are often unknown

significant importance to achieve desirable network performance (e.g., high

reinforcement learning (RL) to learn the optimal control policy for queueing
networks so that the average job delay (or equivalently the average queue
backlog) is minimized. Traditional approaches in RL, however, cannot handle the
unbounded state spaces of the network control problem. To overcome this
difficulty, we propose a new algorithm, called Reinforcement Learning for
Queueing Networks (RL-QN), which applies model-based RL methods over a finite
subset of the state space, while applying a known stabilizing policy for the
rest of the states. We establish that the average queue backlog under RL-QN
with an appropriately constructed subset can be arbitrarily close to the
optimal result. We evaluate RL-QN in dynamic server allocation, routing and
switching problems. Simulation results show that RL-QN minimizes the average

implied that language models (LMs) can be treated as knowledge bases. To this
end, this phenomena has been effective especially when these LMs are fine-tuned
towards not just data of a specific domain, but also to the style or linguistic
pattern of the prompts themselves. We observe that, satisfying a particular
linguistic pattern in prompts is an unsustainable constraint that unnecessarily
lengthens the probing task, especially because, they are often manually
designed and the range of possible prompt template patterns can vary depending
on the prompting objective and domain. We therefore explore an idea of using a
position-attention mechanism to capture positional information of each word in
a prompt relative to the mask to be filled, hence avoiding the need to
re-construct prompts when the prompts linguistic pattern changes. Using our
approach, we demonstrate the ability of eliciting answers to rare prompt
templates (in a case study on health outcome generation) such as Postfix and
Mixed patterns whose missing information is respectively at the start and in
multiple random places of the prompt. More so, using various biomedical PLMs,
our approach consistently outperforms a baseline in which the default mask

label correlations between adjacent arcs. However, direct modeling leads to
memory explosion because second-order score tensors have sizes of $O(n^3L^2)$
($n$ is the sentence length and $L$ is the number of labels), which is not
affordable. To tackle this computational challenge, we leverage tensor
decomposition techniques, and interestingly, we show that the large
second-order score tensors have no need to be materialized during mean-field
inference, thereby reducing the computational complexity from cubic to
quadratic. We conduct experiments on SemEval 2015 Task 18 English datasets,
showing the effectiveness of modeling label correlations. Our code is publicly

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As an emerging technology, federated learning (FL) involves training machine
learning models over distributed edge devices, which attracts sustained
attention and has been extensively studied. However, the heterogeneity of
client data severely degrades the performance of FL compared with that in
centralized training. It causes the locally trained models of clients to move
in different directions. On the one hand, it slows down or even stalls the
global updates, leading to inefficient communication. On the other hand, it
enlarges the distances between local models, resulting in an aggregated global
model with poor performance. Fortunately, these shortcomings can be mitigated
by reducing the angle between the directions that local models move in. Based
on this fact, we propose FedCos, which reduces the directional inconsistency of
local models by introducing a cosine-similarity penalty. It promotes the local
model iterations towards an auxiliary global direction. Moreover, our approach
is auto-adapt to various non-IID settings without an elaborate selection of
hyperparameters. The experimental results show that FedCos outperforms the
well-known baselines and can enhance them under a variety of FL scenes,
including varying degrees of data heterogeneity, different number of
participants, and cross-silo and cross-device settings. Besides, FedCos
improves communication efficiency by 2 to 5 times. With the help of FedCos,
multiple FL methods require significantly fewer communication rounds than
before to obtain a model with comparable performance.]]></summary>

on evaluation is based on the idea of statistical model criticism, popular in
Bayesian data analysis, whereby a statistical model is evaluated in terms of
its ability to reproduce statistics of an unknown data generating process from
which we can obtain samples. A VAE learns not one, but two joint distributions
over a shared sample space, each exploiting a choice of factorisation that
makes sampling tractable in one of two directions (latent-to-data,
data-to-latent). We evaluate samples from these distributions, assessing their
(marginal) fit to the observed data and our choice of prior, and we also
evaluate samples through a pipeline that connects the two distributions
starting from a data sample, assessing whether together they exploit and reveal
latent factors of variation that are useful to a practitioner. We show that
this methodology offers possibilities for model selection qualitatively beyond
intrinsic evaluation metrics and at a finer granularity than commonly used

low-dimensional subspace. Engineering applications for modeling,
characterization, design, and control of such large-scale systems often rely on
dimensionality reduction to make solutions computationally tractable in
real-time. Common existing paradigms for dimensionality reduction include
linear methods, such as the singular value decomposition (SVD), and nonlinear
methods, such as variants of convolutional autoencoders (CAE). However, these
encoding techniques lack the ability to efficiently represent the complexity
associated with spatio-temporal data, which often requires variable geometry,
non-uniform grid resolution, adaptive meshing, and/or parametric
dependencies.To resolve these practical engineering challenges, we propose a
general framework called Neural Implicit Flow (NIF) that enables a
mesh-agnostic, low-rank representation of large-scale, parametric,
spatial-temporal data. NIF consists of two modified multilayer perceptrons
(MLPs): (i) ShapeNet, which isolates and represents the spatial complexity, and
(ii) ParameterNet, which accounts for any other input complexity, including
parametric dependencies, time, and sensor measurements. We demonstrate the
utility of NIF for parametric surrogate modeling, enabling the interpretable
representation and compression of complex spatio-temporal dynamics, efficient
many-spatial-query tasks, and improved generalization performance for sparse

named USI (Unified Scheme for ImageNet), is based on knowledge distillation and
modern tricks. It requires no adjustments or hyper-parameters tuning between
different models, and is efficient in terms of training times. We test USI on a
wide variety of architectures, including CNNs, Transformers, Mobile-oriented

results. Hence, we are able to transform training on ImageNet from an
expert-oriented task to an automatic seamless routine. Since USI accepts any
backbone and trains it to top results, it also enables to perform methodical
comparisons, and identify the most efficient backbones along the speed-accuracy
Pareto curve. Implementation is available

learn long-term rewards and policies. Zeng et al. original task only needs a
limited amount of foresight. Ewerton et al. attain their best performance using
an agent which only takes the most immediate action under consideration. We are
interested in the ability of their models and training algorithms to accurately
predict long-term Q-Values. To evaluate this ability, we design a new bin
sorting task and reward function. Our task requires agents to accurately
estimate future rewards and therefore use high discount factors in their
Q-Value calculation. We investigate the behaviour of an adaptation of the VPG
training algorithm on our task. We show that this adaptation can not accurately
predict the required long-term action sequences. In addition to the limitations
identified by Ewerton et al., it suffers from the known Deep Q-Learning problem
of overestimated Q-Values. In an effort to solve our task, we turn to the
Hourglass models and combine them with the Double Q-Learning approach. We show
that this approach enables the models to accurately predict long-term action
sequences when trained with large discount factors. Our results show that the
Double Q-Learning technique is essential for training with very high discount
factors, as the models Q-Value predictions diverge otherwise. We also
experiment with different approaches for discount factor scheduling, loss

Roberta or GPT-3 has allowed to address highly complex tasks in a plethora of
scenarios. However, when applied to specific domains, these models encounter
considerable difficulties. This is the case of Social Networks such as Twitter,
an ever-changing stream of information written with informal and complex
language, where each message requires careful evaluation to be understood even
by humans given the important role that context plays. Addressing tasks in this
domain through Natural Language Processing involves severe challenges. When
powerful state-of-the-art multilingual language models are applied to this
scenario, language specific nuances use to get lost in translation. To face
these challenges we present \textbf{BERTuit}, the larger transformer proposed
so far for Spanish language, pre-trained on a massive dataset of 230M Spanish
tweets using RoBERTa optimization. Our motivation is to provide a powerful
resource to better understand Spanish Twitter and to be used on applications
focused on this social network, with special emphasis on solutions devoted to
tackle the spreading of misinformation in this platform. BERTuit is evaluated
on several tasks and compared against M-BERT, XLM-RoBERTa and XLM-T, very
competitive multilingual transformers. The utility of our approach is shown
with applications, in this case: a zero-shot methodology to visualize groups of
hoaxes and profiling authors spreading disinformation.

Misinformation spreads wildly on platforms such as Twitter in languages other

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Various neural network models have been proposed to tackle combinatorial
optimization problems such as the travelling salesman problem (TSP). Existing
learning-based TSP methods adopt a simple setting that the training and testing
data are independent and identically distributed. However, the existing
literature fails to solve TSP instances when training and testing data have
different distributions. Concretely, we find that different training and
testing distribution will result in more difficult TSP instances, i.e., the
solution obtained by the model has a large gap from the optimal solution. To
tackle this problem, in this work, we study learning-based TSP methods when
training and testing data have different distributions using adaptive-hardness,
i.e., how difficult a TSP instance can be for a solver. This problem is
challenging because it is non-trivial to (1) define hardness measurement
quantitatively; (2) efficiently and continuously generate sufficiently hard TSP
instances upon model training; (3) fully utilize instances with different
levels of hardness to learn a more powerful TSP solver. To solve these
challenges, we first propose a principled hardness measurement to quantify the
hardness of TSP instances. Then, we propose a hardness-adaptive generator to
generate instances with different hardness. We further propose a curriculum
learner fully utilizing these instances to train the TSP solver. Experiments
show that our hardness-adaptive generator can generate instances ten times
harder than the existing methods, and our proposed method achieves significant
improvement over state-of-the-art models in terms of the optimality gap.]]></summary>

and the recently proposed notion of Distributional Generalization (DG).
Applying this connection, we introduce new conceptual tools for designing
deep-learning methods that bypass "pathologies" of standard stochastic gradient
descent (SGD). First, we prove that differentially private methods satisfy a
"What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG)" generalization guarantee: whatever a
model does on its train data is almost exactly what it will do at test time.
This guarantee is formally captured by distributional generalization. WYSIWYG
enables principled algorithm design in deep learning by reducing
$\textit{generalization}$ concerns to $\textit{optimization}$ ones: in order to
mitigate unwanted behavior at test time, it is provably sufficient to mitigate
this behavior on the train data. This is notably false for standard (non-DP)
methods, hence this observation has applications even when privacy is not
required. For example, importance sampling is known to fail for standard SGD,
but we show that it has exactly the intended effect for DP-trained models.
Thus, with DP-SGD, unlike with SGD, we can influence test-time behavior by
making principled train-time interventions. We use these insights to construct
simple algorithms which match or outperform SOTA in several distributional
robustness applications, and to significantly improve the privacy vs. disparate
impact trade-off of DP-SGD. Finally, we also improve on known theoretical
bounds relating differential privacy, stability, and distributional
generalization.]]></summary>

machine learning algorithms have been widely applied in high-dimensional
dynamical systems to improve the algorithmic efficiency. In this paper, we
develop a system which combines reduced-order surrogate models with a novel
data assimilation (DA) technique used to incorporate real-time observations
from different physical spaces. We make use of local smooth surrogate functions
which link the space of encoded system variables and the one of current
observations to perform variational DA with a low computational cost. The new
system, named Generalised Latent Assimilation can benefit both the efficiency
provided by the reduced-order modelling and the accuracy of data assimilation.
A theoretical analysis of the difference between surrogate and original
assimilation cost function is also provided in this paper where an upper bound,
depending on the size of the local training set, is given. The new approach is
tested on a high-dimensional CFD application of a two-phase liquid flow with
non-linear observation operators that current Latent Assimilation methods can
not handle. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed assimilation
approach can significantly improve the reconstruction and prediction accuracy
of the deep learning surrogate model which is nearly 1000 times faster than the

However, existing graph neural networks only learn higher-order feature

Furthermore, since EFI-GNN is inherently a linear model, we can interpret the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[High-contrast imaging of exoplanets hinges on powerful post-processing
methods to denoise the data and separate the signal of a companion from its
host star, which is typically orders of magnitude brighter. Existing
post-processing algorithms do not use all prior domain knowledge that is
available about the problem. We propose a new method that builds on our
understanding of the systematic noise and the causal structure of the
data-generating process. Our algorithm is based on a modified version of
half-sibling regression (HSR), a flexible denoising framework that combines
ideas from the fields of machine learning and causality. We adapt the method to
address the specific requirements of high-contrast exoplanet imaging data
obtained in pupil tracking mode. The key idea is to estimate the systematic
noise in a pixel by regressing the time series of this pixel onto a set of
causally independent, signal-free predictor pixels. We use regularized linear
models in this work; however, other (non-linear) models are also possible. In a
second step, we demonstrate how the HSR framework allows us to incorporate
observing conditions such as wind speed or air temperature as additional
predictors. When we apply our method to four data sets from the VLT/NACO
instrument, our algorithm provides a better false-positive fraction than
PCA-based PSF subtraction, a popular baseline method in the field.
Additionally, we find that the HSR-based method provides direct and accurate
estimates for the contrast of the exoplanets without the need to insert
artificial companions for calibration in the data sets. Finally, we present
first evidence that using the observing conditions as additional predictors can
improve the results. Our HSR-based method provides an alternative, flexible and
promising approach to the challenge of modeling and subtracting the stellar PSF
and systematic noise in exoplanet imaging data.]]></summary>

limited range of scenarios, because handling each scenario on hardware takes
significant effort. Realistic simulators with support for various types of

challenging to align the output of a simulator with the behavior of real

view this alignment problem as a joint perception-inference challenge and
demonstrate how to use recent neural network architectures to successfully
perform simulation parameter inference from real point clouds. We analyze the
performance of various architectures, comparing their data and training
requirements. Furthermore, we propose to leverage differentiable point cloud
sampling and differentiable simulation to significantly reduce the time to
achieve the alignment. We employ an efficient way to propagate gradients from
point clouds to simulated meshes and further through to the physical simulation
parameters, such as mass and stiffness. Experiments with highly deformable

multivariate time-series datasets have different channels and ii) forecasting

This paper proposes a novel supervised domain adaptation based on two steps.
First, we search for an optimal class-dependent transformation from the source
to the target domain from a few samples. We consider optimal transport methods

transport and correlation alignment. Second, we use embedding similarity

designed to improve inference speed. Recently proposed PonderNet may be a
promising solution for performing an early exit by treating the exit layers
index as a latent variable. However, the originally proposed exit criterion,
relying on sampling from trained posterior distribution on the probability of
exiting from i-th layer, introduces major variance in model outputs,
significantly reducing the resulting models performance. In this paper, we
propose Ponder ALBERT (PALBERT): an improvement to PonderNet with a novel
deterministic Q-exit criterion and a revisited model architecture. We compared
PALBERT with recent methods for performing an early exit. We observed that the
proposed changes can be considered significant improvements on the original
PonderNet architecture and outperform PABEE on a wide range of GLUE tasks. In
addition, we also performed an in-depth ablation study of the proposed
architecture to further understand Lambda layers and their performance.]]></summary>

their high accuracy results. However, they are considered as "black box", means
that they are not explainable for humans. On the other hand, in some tasks such
as medical, economic, and self-driving cars, users want the model to be
interpretable to decide if they can trust these results or not. In this work,
we present a modified version of an autoencoder-based approach for local
interpretability called ALIME. The ALIME itself is inspired by a famous method
called Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME). LIME generates a
single instance level explanation by generating new data around the instance
and training a local linear interpretable model. ALIME uses an autoencoder to
weigh the new data around the sample. Nevertheless, the ALIME uses a linear
model as the interpretable model to be trained locally, just like the LIME.
This work proposes a new approach, which uses a decision tree instead of the
linear model, as the interpretable model. We evaluate the proposed model in
case of stability, local fidelity, and interpretability on different datasets.
Compared to ALIME, the experiments show significant results on stability and
local fidelity and improved results on interpretability.]]></summary>

of convergence to approximate saddle points. Our rates are near-optimal, and

1 diabetes (T1D). These devices usually utilise simple control algorithms to
select the optimal insulin dose for maintaining blood glucose levels within a
healthy range. Online reinforcement learning (RL) has been utilised as a method
for further enhancing glucose control in these devices. Previous approaches
have been shown to reduce patient risk and improve time spent in the target
range when compared to classical control algorithms, but are prone to
instability in the learning process, often resulting in the selection of unsafe
actions. This work presents an evaluation of offline RL as a means for
developing clinically effective dosing policies without the need for patient
interaction. This paper examines the utility of BCQ, CQL and TD3-BC in managing
the blood glucose of nine virtual patients within the UVA/Padova glucose
dynamics simulator. When trained on less than a tenth of the data required by
online RL approaches, this work shows that offline RL can significantly
increase time in the healthy blood glucose range when compared to the strongest
state-of-art baseline. This is achieved without any associated increase in low
blood glucose events. Offline RL is also shown to be able to correct for common

knowledge from a well-trained source model to a related but unlabeled target
domain. In such a scenario, all conventional adaptation methods that require
source data fail. To combat this challenge, existing USFDAs turn to transfer
knowledge by aligning the target feature to the latent distribution hidden in
the source model. However, such information is naturally limited. Thus, the
alignment in such a scenario is not only difficult but also insufficient, which
degrades the target generalization performance. To relieve this dilemma in
current USFDAs, we are motivated to explore a new perspective to boost their
performance. For this purpose and gaining necessary insight, we look back upon
the origin of the domain adaptation and first theoretically derive a new-brand
target generalization error bound based on the model smoothness. Then,
following the theoretical insight, a general and model-smoothness-guided
Jacobian norm (JN) regularizer is designed and imposed on the target domain to
mitigate this dilemma. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate its
effectiveness. In its implementation, just with a few lines of codes added to

currently hampered by limitations in data availability. Distributed learning
methods such as federated learning (FL) and shared learning (SL) are introduced

FL and SL by enabling the multi-task collaboration between participants through
Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, but they suffer from higher

a CNN based head as in FeSTA, p-FeSTA adopts a randomly permuting simple patch

equivalence between two programs made of sequences of statements. We represent
programs using abstract syntax trees (AST), where a given set of
semantics-preserving rewrite rules can be applied on a specific AST pattern to
generate a transformed and semantically equivalent program. In our system, two
programs are equivalent if there exists a sequence of application of these
rewrite rules that leads to rewriting one program into the other. We propose a
neural network architecture based on a transformer model to generate proofs of
equivalence between program pairs. The system outputs a sequence of rewrites,
and the validity of the sequence is simply checked by verifying it can be
applied. If no valid sequence is produced by the neural network, the system
reports the programs as non-equivalent, ensuring by design no programs may be
incorrectly reported as equivalent. Our system is fully implemented for a given
grammar. To efficiently train the system to generate such sequences, we develop
an original incremental training technique, named self-supervised sample
selection. We extensively study the effectiveness of this novel training
approach on proofs of increasing complexity and length. Our system, S4Eq,
achieves 97% proof success on a curated dataset of 10,000 pairs of equivalent

convolutional transform technique. In addition, we propose a simple 5-layer
convolutional neural network architecture (CONV-5) that can operate with raw RF

referred to as RF1024, to facilitate future RF research. RF1024 consists of 8
different RF modulation classes with each class having 1000/200 training/test

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this paper, we address the problem of texture representation for 3D shapes
for the challenging and underexplored tasks of texture transfer and synthesis.
Previous works either apply spherical texture maps which may lead to large
distortions, or use continuous texture fields that yield smooth outputs lacking
details. We argue that the traditional way of representing textures with images
and linking them to a 3D mesh via UV mapping is more desirable, since
synthesizing 2D images is a well-studied problem. We propose AUV-Net which
learns to embed 3D surfaces into a 2D aligned UV space, by mapping the
corresponding semantic parts of different 3D shapes to the same location in the
UV space. As a result, textures are aligned across objects, and can thus be
easily synthesized by generative models of images. Texture alignment is learned
in an unsupervised manner by a simple yet effective texture alignment module,
taking inspiration from traditional works on linear subspace learning. The
learned UV mapping and aligned texture representations enable a variety of
applications including texture transfer, texture synthesis, and textured single
view 3D reconstruction. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Project page:

of large data volumes by edge devices subject to limited communication
bandwidths, heterogeneity in data distributions and computational resources, as
well as privacy considerations. In this paper, we introduce a new FL protocol
termed FedADMM based on primal-dual optimization. The proposed method leverages
dual variables to tackle statistical heterogeneity, and accommodates system
heterogeneity by tolerating variable amount of work performed by clients.
FedADMM maintains identical communication costs per round as FedAvg/Prox, and
generalizes them via the augmented Lagrangian. A convergence proof is
established for nonconvex objectives, under no restrictions in terms of data
dissimilarity or number of participants per round of the algorithm. We
demonstrate the merits through extensive experiments on real datasets, under
both IID and non-IID data distributions across clients. FedADMM consistently
outperforms all baseline methods in terms of communication efficiency, with the
number of rounds needed to reach a prescribed accuracy reduced by up to 87%.
The algorithm effectively adapts to heterogeneous data distributions through
the use of dual variables, without the need for hyperparameter tuning, and its
advantages are more pronounced in large-scale systems.]]></summary>

have attracted great attention. Many studies report that these DL-based models
yield satisfactory assessment performance and good flexibility, but their
performance in unseen environments remains a challenge. Furthermore, compared
to quality scores, fewer studies elaborate deep learning models to estimate
intelligibility scores. This study proposes a multi-task speech intelligibility
prediction model, called MTI-Net, for simultaneously predicting human and
machine intelligibility measures. Specifically, given a speech utterance,
MTI-Net is designed to predict subjective listening test results and word error
rate (WER) scores. We also investigate several methods that can improve the
prediction performance of MTI-Net. First, we compare different features
(including low-level features and embeddings from self-supervised learning
(SSL) models) and prediction targets of MTI-Net. Second, we explore the effect
of transfer learning and multi-tasking learning on training MTI-Net. Finally,
we examine the potential advantages of fine-tuning SSL embeddings. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of using cross-domain features,
multi-task learning, and fine-tuning SSL embeddings. Furthermore, it is
confirmed that the intelligibility and WER scores predicted by MTI-Net are
highly correlated with the ground-truth scores.]]></summary>

presence of covariate information along tensor modes. Our motivation comes from
online advertising where users click-through-rates (CTR) on ads over various
devices form a CTR tensor that has about 96% missing entries and has many zeros
on non-missing entries, which makes the standalone tensor completion method
unsatisfactory. Beside the CTR tensor, additional ad features or user
characteristics are often available. In this paper, we propose
Covariate-assisted Sparse Tensor Completion (COSTCO) to incorporate covariate
information for the recovery of the sparse tensor. The key idea is to jointly
extract latent components from both the tensor and the covariate matrix to
learn a synthetic representation. Theoretically, we derive the error bound for
the recovered tensor components and explicitly quantify the improvements on
both the reveal probability condition and the tensor recovery accuracy due to
covariates. Finally, we apply COSTCO to an advertisement dataset consisting of
a CTR tensor and ad covariate matrix, leading to 23% accuracy improvement over
the baseline. An important by-product is that ad latent components from COSTCO
reveal interesting ad clusters, which are useful for better ad targeting.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Principal component analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction method in
data analysis that involves diagonalizing the covariance matrix of the dataset.
Recently, quantum algorithms have been formulated for PCA based on
diagonalizing a density matrix. These algorithms assume that the covariance
matrix can be encoded in a density matrix, but a concrete protocol for this
encoding has been lacking. Our work aims to address this gap. Assuming
amplitude encoding of the data, with the data given by the ensemble $\{p_i,|
\psi_i \rangle\}$, then one can easily prepare the ensemble average density
matrix $\overline{\rho} = \sum_i p_i |\psi_i\rangle \langle \psi_i |$. We first
show that $\overline{\rho}$ is precisely the covariance matrix whenever the
dataset is centered. For quantum datasets, we exploit global phase symmetry to
argue that there always exists a centered dataset consistent with
$\overline{\rho}$, and hence $\overline{\rho}$ can always be interpreted as a
covariance matrix. This provides a simple means for preparing the covariance
matrix for arbitrary quantum datasets or centered classical datasets. For
uncentered classical datasets, our method is so-called "PCA without centering",
which we interpret as PCA on a symmetrized dataset. We argue that this closely
corresponds to standard PCA, and we derive equations and inequalities that
bound the deviation of the spectrum obtained with our method from that of
standard PCA. We numerically illustrate our method for the MNIST handwritten
digit dataset. We also argue that PCA on quantum datasets is natural and
meaningful, and we numerically implement our method for molecular ground-state
datasets.]]></summary>

into account the well-known statistical dependence between the point forecast

the variables are both discrete and continuous. In engineering applications,
the objective function is typically calculated with a numerically costly

therefore of a great practical interest, yet their resolution remains in a
large part an open scientific question. In this article, costly mixed problems
are approached through Gaussian processes where the discrete variables are
relaxed into continuous latent variables. The continuous space is more easily
harvested by classical Bayesian optimization techniques than a mixed space
would. Discrete variables are recovered either subsequently to the continuous
optimization, or simultaneously with an additional continuous-discrete
compatibility constraint that is handled with augmented Lagrangians. Several
possible implementations of such Bayesian mixed optimizers are compared. In
particular, the reformulation of the problem with continuous latent variables
is put in competition with searches working directly in the mixed space. Among
the algorithms involving latent variables and an augmented Lagrangian, a
particular attention is devoted to the Lagrange multipliers for which a local

the repeated optimization of three analytical functions and a beam design

consider a hybrid traffic control scheme and use proximal policy optimization
(PPO) method to tackle it. Firstly, IoV devices are divided into various
classes based on delay characteristics. The target of maximizing the successful
transmission of packets with the success rate constraint is established. Then,
the optimization objective is transformed into a markov decision process (MDP)
model. Finally, the access class barring (ACB) factors are obtained based on
the PPO method to maximize the number of successful access devices. The

demonstrated significant performance on non-trivial tasks such as speech
recognition, image processing, and natural language understanding. However,
this is at the cost of substantial data requirements. Considering the
widespread proliferation of edge devices (e.g. Internet of Things devices) over
the last decade, Deep Learning in the edge paradigm, such as device-cloud
integrated platforms, is required to leverage its superior performance.
Moreover, it is suitable from the data requirements perspective in the edge
paradigm because the proliferation of edge devices has resulted in an explosion
in the volume of generated and collected data. However, there are difficulties
due to other requirements such as high computation, high latency, and high
bandwidth caused by Deep Learning applications in real-world scenarios. In this
regard, this survey paper investigates Deep Learning at the edge, its
architecture, enabling technologies, and model adaption techniques, where edge
servers and edge devices participate in deep learning training and inference.
For simplicity, we call this paradigm the All-in EDGE paradigm. Besides, this
paper presents the key performance metrics for Deep Learning at the All-in EDGE
paradigm to evaluate various deep learning techniques and choose a suitable
design. Moreover, various open challenges arising from the deployment of Deep

models such as support vector machines. In this paper, we investigate the
optimization models and the interpretations for three types of adversarial
perturbations against support vector machines, including sample-adversarial
perturbations (sAP), class-universal adversarial perturbations (cuAP) as well
as universal adversarial perturbations (uAP). For linear binary/multi
classification support vector machines (SVMs), we derive the explicit solutions
for sAP, cuAP and uAP (binary case), and approximate solution for uAP of
multi-classification. We also obtain the upper bound of fooling rate for uAP.
Such results not only increase the interpretability of the three adversarial
perturbations, but also provide great convenience in computation since
iterative process can be avoided. Numerical results show that our method is
fast and effective in calculating three types of adversarial perturbations.]]></summary>

To address this problem, a possible solution is to provide the agent with
information about the past. However, providing complete observations of
numerous steps can be excessive. Inspired by human memory, we propose to
represent history with only important changes in the environment and, in our
approach, to obtain automatically this representation using self-supervision.
Our method (TempAl) aligns temporally-close frames, revealing a general, slowly
varying state of the environment. This procedure is based on contrastive loss,
which pulls embeddings of nearby observations to each other while pushing away
other samples from the batch. It can be interpreted as a metric that captures
the temporal relations of observations. We propose to combine both common
instantaneous and our history representation and we evaluate TempAl on all
available Atari games from the Arcade Learning Environment. TempAl surpasses
the instantaneous-only baseline in 35 environments out of 49. The source code

information between multiple correlated tasks, then it produces better
generalization performance. However, it contains matrix inversion operation
when solving the dual problems, so it costs much running time. Moreover, kernel
trick cannot be directly utilized in the nonlinear case. To effectively avoid
above problems, a novel multi-task nonparallel support vector machine (MTNPSVM)
including linear and nonlinear cases is proposed in this paper. By introducing
epsilon-insensitive loss instead of square loss in DMTSVM, MTNPSVM effectively
avoids matrix inversion operation and takes full advantage of the kernel trick.
Theoretical implication of the model is further discussed. To further improve
the computational efficiency, the alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) is employed when solving the dual problem. The computational complexity
and convergence of the algorithm are provided. In addition, the property and
sensitivity of the parameter in model are further explored. The experimental
results on fifteen benchmark datasets and twelve image datasets demonstrate the
validity of MTNPSVM in comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms.
Finally, it is applied to real Chinese Wine dataset, and also verifies its

spectrum with incumbent users and support various spectrum monitoring tasks
such as anomaly detection, fault diagnostics, user equipment identification,
and authentication. A network of wireless sensors is needed to monitor the
spectrum for signal transmissions of interest over a large deployment area.
Each sensor receives signals under a specific channel condition depending on
its location and trains an individual model of a deep neural network (DNN)
accordingly to classify signals. To improve the accuracy, individual sensors
may exchange sensing data or sensor results with each other or with a fusion
center (such as in cooperative spectrum sensing). In this paper, distributed
federated learning over a multi-hop wireless network is considered to
collectively train a DNN for signal identification. In distributed federated
learning, each sensor broadcasts its trained model to its neighbors, collects
the DNN models from its neighbors, and aggregates them to initialize its own
model for the next round of training. Without exchanging any spectrum data,
this process is repeated over time such that a common DNN is built across the
network while preserving the privacy associated with signals collected at
different locations. Signal classification accuracy and convergence time are
evaluated for different network topologies (including line, star, ring, grid,
and random networks) and packet loss events. Then, the reduction of
communication overhead and energy consumption is considered with random
participation of sensors in model updates. The results show the feasibility of
extending cooperative spectrum sensing over a general multi-hop wireless
network through federated learning and indicate its robustness to wireless
network effects, thereby sustaining high accuracy with low communication
overhead and energy consumption.]]></summary>

improve generalization performances by constraining a model's complexity.
Current Deep Networks heavily rely on regularizers such as Data-Augmentation
(DA) or weight-decay, and employ structural risk minimization, i.e.
cross-validation, to select the optimal regularization hyper-parameters. In
this study, we demonstrate that techniques such as DA or weight decay produce a
model with a reduced complexity that is unfair across classes. The optimal
amount of DA or weight decay found from cross-validation leads to disastrous
model performances on some classes e.g. on Imagenet with a resnet50, the "barn
spider" classification test accuracy falls from $68\%$ to $46\%$ only by
introducing random crop DA during training. Even more surprising, such
performance drop also appears when introducing uninformative regularization
techniques such as weight decay. Those results demonstrate that our search for
ever increasing generalization performance -- averaged over all classes and
samples -- has left us with models and regularizers that silently sacrifice
performances on some classes. This scenario can become dangerous when deploying
a model on downstream tasks e.g. an Imagenet pre-trained resnet50 deployed on
INaturalist sees its performances fall from $70\%$ to $30\%$ on class \#8889
when introducing random crop DA during the Imagenet pre-training phase. Those
results demonstrate that designing novel regularizers without class-dependent
bias remains an open research question.]]></summary>

amount of knowledge from the pre-training corpora; however, they are still
limited in recalling factually correct knowledge given a certain context.
Hence, they tend to suffer from counterfactual or hallucinatory generation when
used in knowledge-intensive natural language generation (NLG) tasks. Recent
remedies to this problem focus on modifying either the pre-training or task
fine-tuning objectives to incorporate knowledge, which normally require
additional costly training or architecture modification of LMs for practical
applications. We present Knowledge Infused Decoding (KID) -- a novel decoding
algorithm for generative LMs, which dynamically infuses external knowledge into
each step of the LM decoding. Specifically, we maintain a local knowledge
memory based on the current context, interacting with a dynamically created
external knowledge trie, and continuously update the local memory as a
knowledge-aware constraint to guide decoding via reinforcement learning. On six
diverse knowledge-intensive NLG tasks, task-agnostic LMs (e.g., GPT-2 and BART)
armed with KID outperform many task-optimized state-of-the-art models, and show
particularly strong performance in few-shot scenarios over seven related
knowledge-infusion techniques. Human evaluation confirms KID's ability to
generate more relevant and factual language for the input context when compared
with multiple baselines. Finally, KID also alleviates exposure bias and
provides stable generation quality when generating longer sequences. Code for
KID is available at https://github.com/microsoft/KID.]]></summary>

the defining characteristics of sleep stages, we further design a
context-sensitive flexible pipeline that automatically adapts to the attributes
of data itself. That is, the input EEG spectrogram is partitioned into a
sequence of patches in the time and frequency axes, and then input to a
delicate deep learning network for further representation learning to extract
the stage-dependent features, which are used in the classification step
finally. The proposed pipeline is validated against a large database, i.e., the
Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS), and the results demonstrate that the
competitive performance for the wake, N2, and N3 stages outperforms the
state-of-art works, with the F1 scores being 0.93, 0.88, and 0.87,
respectively, and the proposed method has a high inter-rater reliability of
0.80 kappa. Importantly, we visualize the stage scoring process of the model
decision with the Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) method, which shows
that the proposed pipeline is more sensitive and perceivable in the

together with the LRP method can provide better model interpretability, which

While deep learning models achieve superior performance, often statistically
better than humans, their adoption into safety-critical settings, such as
healthcare or self-driving cars is hindered by their inability to provide
safety guarantees or to expose the inner workings of the model in a human
understandable form. We present Mo\"ET, a novel model based on Mixture of
Experts, consisting of decision tree experts and a generalized linear model
gating function. Thanks to such gating function the model is more expressive
than the standard decision tree. To support non-differentiable decision trees
as experts, we formulate a novel training procedure. In addition, we introduce
a hard thresholding version, Mo\"ETH, in which predictions are made solely by a
single expert chosen via the gating function. Thanks to that property, Mo\"ETH
allows each prediction to be easily decomposed into a set of logical rules in a
form which can be easily verified. While Mo\"ET is a general use model, we
illustrate its power in the reinforcement learning setting. By training Mo\"ET
models using an imitation learning procedure on deep RL agents we outperform
the previous state-of-the-art technique based on decision trees while
preserving the verifiability of the models. Moreover, we show that Mo\"ET can

machine learning models, hyperparameter tuning is becoming increasingly
expensive. However, after assessing 40 tuning methods systematically, we find
that each faces certain limitations. In particular, methods that speed up
tuning via knowledge transfer typically require the final performance of
hyperparameters and do not focus on low-fidelity information. As we demonstrate
empirically, this common practice is suboptimal and can incur an unnecessary
use of resources. It is more cost-efficient to instead leverage low-fidelity
tuning observations to measure inter-task similarity and transfer knowledge
from existing to new tasks accordingly. However, performing multi-fidelity
tuning comes with its own challenges in the transfer setting: the noise in
additional observations and the need for performance forecasting. Therefore, we
propose and conduct a thorough analysis of a multi-task multi-fidelity Bayesian
optimization framework, which leads to the best instantiation--amortized
auto-tuning (AT2). We further present an offline-computed 27-task
hyperparameter recommendation (HyperRec) database to serve the community.

introduction of unsupervised neural topic models, which leverage deep
generative models as opposed to traditional statistics-based topic models. We
extend upon these neural topic models by introducing the Label-Indexed Neural
Topic Model (LI-NTM), which is, to the extent of our knowledge, the first
effective upstream semi-supervised neural topic model. We find that LI-NTM
outperforms existing neural topic models in document reconstruction benchmarks,
with the most notable results in low labeled data regimes and for data-sets
with informative labels; furthermore, our jointly learned classifier
outperforms baseline classifiers in ablation studies.]]></summary>

privacy. In this problem, we are given a universe $U$ of items, possibly of
infinite size, and a database $D$ of users. Each user $i$ contributes a subset
$W_i \subseteq U$ of items. We want an ($\epsilon$,$\delta$)-differentially
private algorithm which outputs a subset $S \subset \cup_i W_i$ such that the
size of $S$ is as large as possible. The problem arises in countless real world
applications; it is particularly ubiquitous in natural language processing
(NLP) applications as vocabulary extraction. For example, discovering words,
sentences, $n$-grams etc., from private text data belonging to users is an
instance of the set union problem.

Known algorithms for this problem proceed by collecting a subset of items
from each user, taking the union of such subsets, and disclosing the items
whose noisy counts fall above a certain threshold. Crucially, in the above
process, the contribution of each individual user is always independent of the
items held by other users, resulting in a wasteful aggregation process, where
some item counts happen to be way above the threshold. We deviate from the
above paradigm by allowing users to contribute their items in a
$\textit{dependent fashion}$, guided by a $\textit{policy}$. In this new
setting ensuring privacy is significantly delicate. We prove that any policy
which has certain $\textit{contractive}$ properties would result in a
differentially private algorithm. We design two new algorithms, one using
Laplace noise and other Gaussian noise, as specific instances of policies
satisfying the contractive properties. Our experiments show that the new
algorithms significantly outperform previously known mechanisms for the
problem.]]></summary>

tool in solving tasks across various fields of application. The success of DNNs
is strongly connected to their high complexity in terms of the number of
network layers or of neurons in each layer, which severely complicates to
understand how DNNs solve their learned task. To improve the explainability of
DNNs, we adapt methods from neuroscience because this field has a rich
experience in analyzing complex and opaque systems. In this work, we draw
inspiration from how neuroscience uses topographic maps to visualize the
activity of the brain when it performs certain tasks. Transferring this
approach to DNNs can help to visualize and understand their internal processes
more intuitively, too. However, the inner structures of brains and DNNs differ
substantially. Therefore, to be able to visualize activations of neurons in
DNNs as topographic maps, we research techniques to layout the neurons in a
two-dimensional space in which neurons of similar activity are in the vicinity
of each other. In this work, we introduce and compare different methods to
obtain a topographic layout of the neurons in a network layer. Moreover, we
demonstrate how to use the resulting topographic activation maps to identify
errors or encoded biases in DNNs or data sets. Our novel visualization
technique improves the transparency of DNN-based algorithmic decision-making
systems and is accessible to a broad audience because topographic maps are
intuitive to interpret without expert-knowledge in Machine Learning.]]></summary>

improve generalization performances by constraining a model's complexity.
Current Deep Networks heavily rely on regularizers such as Data-Augmentation
(DA) or weight-decay, and employ structural risk minimization, i.e.
cross-validation, to select the optimal regularization hyper-parameters. In
this study, we demonstrate that techniques such as DA or weight decay produce a
model with a reduced complexity that is unfair across classes. The optimal
amount of DA or weight decay found from cross-validation leads to disastrous
model performances on some classes e.g. on Imagenet with a resnet50, the "barn
spider" classification test accuracy falls from $68\%$ to $46\%$ only by
introducing random crop DA during training. Even more surprising, such
performance drop also appears when introducing uninformative regularization
techniques such as weight decay. Those results demonstrate that our search for
ever increasing generalization performance -- averaged over all classes and
samples -- has left us with models and regularizers that silently sacrifice
performances on some classes. This scenario can become dangerous when deploying
a model on downstream tasks e.g. an Imagenet pre-trained resnet50 deployed on
INaturalist sees its performances fall from $70\%$ to $30\%$ on class \#8889
when introducing random crop DA during the Imagenet pre-training phase. Those
results demonstrate that designing novel regularizers without class-dependent
bias remains an open research question.]]></summary>

theoretical properties of GFlowNets. They can be used to estimate joint

some variables are unspecified and, of particular interest, can represent
distributions over composite objects like sets and graphs. GFlowNets amortize
the work typically done by computationally expensive MCMC methods in a single

functions and free energies, conditional probabilities of supersets
(supergraphs) given a subset (subgraph), as well as marginal distributions over
all supersets (supergraphs) of a given set (graph). We introduce variations
enabling the estimation of entropy and mutual information, sampling from a
Pareto frontier, connections to reward-maximizing policies, and extensions to
stochastic environments, continuous actions and modular energy functions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Streamlined qBOLD acquisitions enable experimentally straightforward
observations of brain oxygen metabolism. $R_2^\prime$ maps are easily inferred;
however, the Oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and deoxygenated blood volume
(DBV) are more ambiguously determined from the data. As such, existing
inference methods tend to yield very noisy and underestimated OEF maps, while
overestimating DBV.

This work describes a novel probabilistic machine learning approach that can
infer plausible distributions of OEF and DBV. Initially, we create a model that
produces informative voxelwise prior distribution based on synthetic training
data. Contrary to prior work, we model the joint distribution of OEF and DBV
through a scaled multivariate logit-Normal distribution, which enables the
values to be constrained within a plausible range. The prior distribution model
is used to train an efficient amortized variational Bayesian inference model.
This model learns to infer OEF and DBV by predicting real image data, with few
training data required, using the signal equations as a forward model.

We demonstrate that our approach enables the inference of smooth OEF and DBV
maps, with a physiologically plausible distribution that can be adapted through
specification of an informative prior distribution. Other benefits include
model comparison (via the evidence lower bound) and uncertainty quantification
for identifying image artefacts. Results are demonstrated on a small study
comparing subjects undergoing hyperventilation and at rest. We illustrate that
the proposed approach allows measurement of gray matter differences in OEF and
DBV and enables voxelwise comparison between conditions, where we observe
significant increases in OEF and $R_2^\prime$ during hyperventilation.]]></summary>

reducing the dimensionality of multi-view unlabeled data with high dimensions.
The previous methods assume all of the views are complete. However, in real
applications, the multi-view data are often incomplete, i.e., some views of
instances are missing, which will result in the failure of these methods.
Besides, while the data arrive in form of streams, these existing methods will
suffer the issues of high storage cost and expensive computation time. To
address these issues, we propose an Incremental Incomplete Multi-view
Unsupervised Feature Selection method (I$^2$MUFS) on incomplete multi-view
streaming data. By jointly considering the consistent and complementary
information across different views, I$^2$MUFS embeds the unsupervised feature
selection into an extended weighted non-negative matrix factorization model,
which can learn a consensus clustering indicator matrix and fuse different
latent feature matrices with adaptive view weights. Furthermore, we introduce
the incremental leaning mechanisms to develop an alternative iterative
algorithm, where the feature selection matrix is incrementally updated, rather
than recomputing on the entire updated data from scratch. A series of
experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method by
comparing with several state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method in terms of
the clustering metrics and the computational cost.]]></summary>

such as CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT learn generic representations of source code
and have achieved substantial improvement on code search task. However, the
high-quality sequence-level representations of code snippets have not been
sufficiently explored. In this paper, we propose a new approach with multimodal
contrastive learning and soft data augmentation for code search. Multimodal
contrastive learning is used to pull together the representations of code-query
pairs and push apart the unpaired code snippets and queries. Moreover, data
augmentation is critical in contrastive learning for learning high-quality
representations. However, only semantic-preserving augmentations for source
code are considered in existing work. In this work, we propose to do soft data
augmentation by dynamically masking and replacing some tokens in code sequences
to generate code snippets that are similar but not necessarily
semantic-preserving as positive samples for paired queries. We conduct
extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on a
large-scale dataset with six programming languages. The experimental results
show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
We also adapt our techniques to several pre-trained models such as RoBERTa and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gradient-enhanced Kriging (GE-Kriging) is a well-established surrogate
modelling technique for approximating expensive computational models. However,
it tends to get impractical for high-dimensional problems due to the large
inherent correlation matrix and the associated high-dimensional hyper-parameter
tuning problem. To address these issues, we propose a new method in this paper,
called sliced GE-Kriging (SGE-Kriging) for reducing both the size of the
correlation matrix and the number of hyper-parameters. Firstly, we perform a
derivative-based global sensitivity analysis to detect the relative importance
of each input variable with respect to model response. Then, we propose to
split the training sample set into multiple slices, and invoke Bayes' theorem
to approximate the full likelihood function via a sliced likelihood function,
in which multiple small correlation matrices are utilized to describe the
correlation of the sample set. Additionally, we replace the original
high-dimensional hyper-parameter tuning problem with a low-dimensional
counterpart by learning the relationship between the hyper-parameters and the
global sensitivity indices. Finally, we validate SGE-Kriging by means of
numerical experiments with several benchmarks problems. The results show that
the SGE-Kriging model features an accuracy and robustness that is comparable to
the standard one but comes at much less training costs. The benefits are most
evident in high-dimensional problems.]]></summary>

family with unknown parameters. We ask the following question: when is it
possible to split $X$ into two parts $f(X)$ and $g(X)$ such that neither part
is sufficient to reconstruct $X$ by itself, but both together can recover $X$
fully, and the joint distribution of $(f(X),g(X))$ is tractable? As one
example, if $X=(X_1,\dots,X_n)$ and $P$ is a product distribution, then for any
$m<n$, we can split the sample to define $f(X)=(X_1,\dots,X_m)$ and
$g(X)=(X_{m+1},\dots,X_n)$. Rasines and Young (2021) offers an alternative
route of accomplishing this task through randomization of $X$ with additive
Gaussian noise which enables post-selection inference in finite samples for
Gaussian distributed data and asymptotically for non-Gaussian additive models.
In this paper, we offer a more general methodology for achieving such a split
in finite samples by borrowing ideas from Bayesian inference to yield a
(frequentist) solution that can be viewed as a continuous analog of data
splitting. We call our method data blurring, as an alternative to data
splitting, data carving and p-value masking. We exemplify the method on a few
prototypical applications, such as post-selection inference for trend filtering
and other regression problems.]]></summary>

limited to the batch setting. The online bootstrap is a flexible and efficient
approach for statistical inference in linear stochastic approximation

has yet to be explored. In this paper, we study the use of the online bootstrap
method for statistical inference in RL. In particular, we focus on the temporal

intelligence. It is often inefficient to conduct reasoning and inference
directly in the space of raw sensory representations, such as pixel values of
images. Representation learning allows us to automatically discover suitable
representations from raw sensory data. For example, given raw sensory data, a
deep neural network learns nonlinear representations at its hidden layers,
which are subsequently used for classification at its output layer. This
happens implicitly during training through minimizing a supervised or
unsupervised loss. In this paper, we study the dynamics of such implicit
nonlinear representation learning. We identify a pair of a new assumption and a
novel condition, called the common model structure assumption and the
data-architecture alignment condition. Under the common model structure
assumption, the data-architecture alignment condition is shown to be sufficient
for the global convergence and necessary for the global optimality. Moreover,
our theory explains how and when increasing the network size does and does not
improve the training behaviors in the practical regime. Our results provide
practical guidance for designing a model structure: e.g., the common model
structure assumption can be used as a justification for using a particular
model structure instead of others. We also derive a new training framework,
which satisfies the data-architecture alignment condition by automatically
modifying any given training algorithm. Given a standard training algorithm,
the framework running its modified version is empirically shown to maintain
competitive test performances while providing global convergence guarantees for
deep residual neural networks with convolutions, skip connections, and batch
normalization with datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Semeion,
KMNIST and SVHN.]]></summary>

be ineffective on non-stationary time series where different parts/crops of

matrices that have shared rows and/or columns. For example, cancer studies that

pan-cancer analysis, have extended our knowledge of molecular heterogenity
beyond what was observed in single tumor and single platform studies. However,
these studies have been limited by available statistical methodology. We
propose a flexible approach to the simultaneous factorization and decomposition
of variation across such bidimensionally linked matrices, BIDIFAC+. This
decomposes variation into a series of low-rank components that may be shared
across any number of row sets (e.g., omics platforms) or column sets (e.g.,
cancer types). This builds on a growing literature for the factorization and
decomposition of linked matrices, which has primarily focused on multiple
matrices that are linked in one dimension (rows or columns) only. Our objective
function extends nuclear norm penalization, is motivated by random matrix
theory, gives an identifiable decomposition under relatively mild conditions,
and can be shown to give the mode of a Bayesian posterior distribution. We
apply BIDIFAC+ to pan-omics pan-cancer data from TCGA, identifying shared and

decomposition of matrices and tensors using deep generative networks. We
decompose a tensor as the product of low-rank tensor factors (e.g., a matrix as
the outer product of two vectors), where each low-rank tensor is generated by a
deep network (DN) that is trained in a self-supervised manner to minimize the
mean-squared approximation error. Our key observation is that the implicit
regularization inherent in DNs enables them to capture nonlinear signal
structures (e.g., manifolds) that are out of the reach of classical linear
methods like the singular value decomposition (SVD) and principal component
analysis (PCA). Furthermore, in contrast to the SVD and PCA, whose performance
deteriorates when the tensor's entries deviate from additive white Gaussian
noise, we demonstrate that the performance of DeepTensor is robust to a wide
range of distributions. We validate that DeepTensor is a robust and
computationally efficient drop-in replacement for the SVD, PCA, nonnegative
matrix factorization (NMF), and similar decompositions by exploring a range of
real-world applications, including hyperspectral image denoising, 3D MRI
tomography, and image classification. In particular, DeepTensor offers a 6dB
signal-to-noise ratio improvement over standard denoising methods for signals
corrupted by Poisson noise and learns to decompose 3D tensors 60 times faster

equations(SDE) is proposed in this paper. The central goal is to solve forward
and inverse stochastic problems more effectively using limited data. Deep
operator network(DeepONet) has been proposed recently for operator learning.
Compared to other neural networks to learn functions, it aims at the problem of
learning nonlinear operators. However, it can be challenging by using the
original model to learn nonlinear operators for high-dimensional stochastic
problems. We propose a new multi-resolution autoencoder DeepONet model referred
to as MultiAuto-DeepONet to deal with this difficulty with the aid of
convolutional autoencoder. The encoder part of the network is designed to
reduce the dimensionality as well as discover the hidden features of
high-dimensional stochastic inputs. The decoder is designed to have a special
structure, i.e. in the form of DeepONet. The first DeepONet in decoder is
designed to reconstruct the input function involving randomness while the
second one is used to approximate the solution of desired equations. Those two
DeepONets has a common branch net and two independent trunk nets. This
architecture enables us to deal with multi-resolution inputs naturally. By
adding $L_1$ regularization to our network, we found the outputs from the

statistical learning algorithms primarily because they yield unbiased or nearly
unbiased estimators for the parameters in the model. Nonconvex penalties
existing in the literature such as SCAD, MCP, Laplace and arctan have a
singularity at origin which makes them useful also for variable selection.
However, in several high-dimensional frameworks such as deep learning, variable
selection is less of a concern. In this paper, we present a nonconvex penalty
which is smooth at origin. The paper includes asymptotic results for ordinary
least squares estimators regularized with the new penalty function, showing
asymptotic bias that vanishes exponentially fast. We also conducted an
empirical study employing deep neural network architecture on three datasets
and convolutional neural network on four datasets. The empirical study showed
better performance for the new regularization approach in five out of the seven
datasets.]]></summary>

auto-encoders (VAEs) and test two instances of this framework in the context of
modelling images of handwritten digits and a corpus of English text. Our take
on evaluation is based on the idea of statistical model criticism, popular in
Bayesian data analysis, whereby a statistical model is evaluated in terms of
its ability to reproduce statistics of an unknown data generating process from
which we can obtain samples. A VAE learns not one, but two joint distributions
over a shared sample space, each exploiting a choice of factorisation that
makes sampling tractable in one of two directions (latent-to-data,
data-to-latent). We evaluate samples from these distributions, assessing their
(marginal) fit to the observed data and our choice of prior, and we also
evaluate samples through a pipeline that connects the two distributions
starting from a data sample, assessing whether together they exploit and reveal
latent factors of variation that are useful to a practitioner. We show that
this methodology offers possibilities for model selection qualitatively beyond
intrinsic evaluation metrics and at a finer granularity than commonly used
statistics can offer.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We investigate and leverage a connection between Differential Privacy (DP)
and the recently proposed notion of Distributional Generalization (DG).
Applying this connection, we introduce new conceptual tools for designing
deep-learning methods that bypass "pathologies" of standard stochastic gradient
descent (SGD). First, we prove that differentially private methods satisfy a
"What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG)" generalization guarantee: whatever a
model does on its train data is almost exactly what it will do at test time.
This guarantee is formally captured by distributional generalization. WYSIWYG
enables principled algorithm design in deep learning by reducing
$\textit{generalization}$ concerns to $\textit{optimization}$ ones: in order to
mitigate unwanted behavior at test time, it is provably sufficient to mitigate
this behavior on the train data. This is notably false for standard (non-DP)
methods, hence this observation has applications even when privacy is not
required. For example, importance sampling is known to fail for standard SGD,
but we show that it has exactly the intended effect for DP-trained models.
Thus, with DP-SGD, unlike with SGD, we can influence test-time behavior by
making principled train-time interventions. We use these insights to construct
simple algorithms which match or outperform SOTA in several distributional
robustness applications, and to significantly improve the privacy vs. disparate
impact trade-off of DP-SGD. Finally, we also improve on known theoretical
bounds relating differential privacy, stability, and distributional
generalization.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although evaluation of the expectations on the Ising model is essential in
various applications, this is frequently infeasible because of intractable
multiple summations (or integrations). Spatial Monte Carlo integration (SMCI)
is a sampling-based approximation, and can provide high-accuracy estimations
for such intractable expectations. To evaluate the expectation of a function of
variables in a specific region (called target region), SMCI considers a larger
region containing the target region (called sum region). In SMCI, the multiple
summation for the variables in the sum region is precisely executed, and that
in the outer region is evaluated by the sampling approximation such as the
standard Monte Carlo integration. It is guaranteed that the accuracy of the
SMCI estimator is monotonically improved as the size of the sum region
increases. However, a haphazard expansion of the sum region could cause a
combinatorial explosion. Therefore, we hope to improve the accuracy without
such region expansion. In this study, based on the theory of generalized least
squares, a new effective method is proposed by combining multiple SMCI
estimators. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated theoretically
and numerically. The results indicate that the proposed method can be effective
in the inverse Ising problem (or Boltzmann machine learning).]]></summary>

 Abstract: " Large foundation models can exhibit unique capabilities depending on the domain of data they are trained on. While these domains are generic, they may only barely overlap. For example, visual-language models (VLMs) are trained on Internet-scale image captions, but large language models (LMs) are further trained on Internet-scale text with no images (e.g. from spreadsheets, to SAT questions). As a result, these models store different forms of commonsense knowledge across different domains. In this work, we show that this model diversity is symbiotic, and can be leveraged to build AI systems with structured Socratic dialogue -- in whi…]]></summary>

 I am following this website and considered an already published model (5 convolutional and 1 fully connected layer) which is trained on a similar dataset and same task.
 For the sake of sanity check, as per the website, I have trained the model on a subset of trainset (3 months) and tried to overfit it (while evaluating on complete val set), which works fine.
 However, I am not sure what to do next from this point on? Shall I just train on the complete trainset now? Or do I increase the layers or play with other hyper params to find more details about my regression problem/data? I would really appreciate your comments. Thank you.
 PS. The target value is sparse i.e. more than 85% of the time it is zero.

What were your reasons for doing it and did you regret it? I see so many articles about transition from software to ML but none about going the opposite direction.
 Context: I've been working as an ML Engineer for a little over a year, and I'm just... not enjoying it. I want to love my job so badly as I like my boss, my colleagues, and the company (and I'm paid quite well for my level), but I just don't. I feel like the type of work I'm doing is not very smart and yet it's extremely draining: I spend so many hours just looking at loss curves, tweaking features and parameters. I'm somehow bored and stressed at the same time, because I don't enjoy the work and yet I feel the pressure to produce good models, and when they don't work as expected I can't help but take it personally as if if I just tried hard enough they would work. I find that the days were I end up having to take care of more purely engineering tasks I just have a lot more fun and I finish the day more satisfied and less drained. I think I just want to build something instead of spending hours banging my head against shit data. I would love to hear from people who feel or have felt the same way because whenever I speak about this with friends who are in ML they look at me like I'm a lunatic for wanting to leave it for software engineering.
 I'm obviously aware that swe roles are not all fun and games, but I just feel like there's been an excessive push for so many people to move to ML as it's "cool" and "smart" when in reality they're just different things who are going to suit different people.

Matrix factorization is one of the oldest, yet still widely used, techniques for learning how to recommend items such as songs or movies from user ratings. In its basic form, it approximates a large, sparse (i.e., mostly empty) matrix of user-item interactions with a product of two smaller, denser matrices representing learned item and user features. These dense matrices, in turn, can be used to recommend items to a user with which they haven't interacted before. 
Despite its algorithmic simplicity, matrix factorization can still achieve competitive performance in recommender benchmarks. Alternating least squares (ALS), and especially its implicit variation, is a fundamental algorithm to learn the parameters of matrix factorization…]]></summary>

 If the format supports 3D annotation types that is even better. Thanks for your insights in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working on a project in which a robots learns its motion. for example Bipedal robot learns to walk on a straight line by learning to adjust the torque and angular velocity of each joint. However, the robot I am working on has complex architecture. It has 10 joints instead of 2, most importantly all of these joints work simultaneously and coherently to produce a desired motion.
 The Problem I am facing is that, the robot has ten joints and each joint can move between -450 to +450
 for simplicity let me define State and Actions of the system
 State = -450 to +450 -------------> normalization ------------------> -10 to 10
 Actions = choose an angle between -10 to 10 for each joint 
 Total Action space for each State at each time step = 10 (no of joints each can move between -10 to 10 at each time step) * 360 (total time steps for a single motion) = 3600 (Output: No of angles required to generate a motion)
 I am using TD3 to solve this conundrum. The Action space is too large how can I reduce the action space?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently sitting at a difficult machine-learning problem that I have found no literature on how to solve it. 
 I am given n datapoints x_1,...,x_n that are ordered according to a ranking preference rank(x_1)<rank(x_2)<...<rank(x_n). I am assuming there exists a function f, such, that f(x_i)<f(x_i+1). I am now searching a Bayesian non-parametric model that gives the posterior probability of functions f that abide f(x_i)<f(x_i+1), so that i can estimate the relative rank preferences at new points.
 I have tried out a few things. The naive approach is using a GP prior on f. Unfortunately, computing the posterior distribution p(f(x_1), ... f(x_n)| f(x_1)<...<f(x_n)) has no closed form solution (it is a normal distribution with N linear constraints, which is absolutely terrible to sample from). This makes computing conditional distributions for predictions very challenging. 
 I am currently approximating the solution by using a GP regression model with label y_i = rank(x_i)=i. But this is systematically under-estimating the shape-variation, due to the fact that it adds the assumption that function values between ranks are equidistant. 
 Is there any known approach how to do this?

 We present results on video generation using diffusion models. We propose an architecture for video diffusion models which is a natural extension of the standard image architecture. We show that this architecture is effective for jointly training from image and video data. To generate long and higher resolution videos we introduce a new conditioning technique that performs better than previously proposed methods. We present results on text-conditioned video generation and state-of-the-art results on an unconditional video generation benchmark.

 The most common diagnostic imaging test conducted in emergency rooms is chest radiography. Providing automated preliminary read helpers to physicians might speed up surgery, enhance accuracy, and lower healthcare costs.
 An artificial intelligence tool that interprets chest X-rays without the intervention of a radiologist received regulatory approval in the European Union this week, marking a first for a wholly autonomous medical imaging AI, according to ‘Oxipit‘, the developer of this tool. It’s a watershed moment for AI, and it’s more than likely to spark debate, given that radiologists have spent the last few years working to fully automate parts of their jobs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am doing a project and there is a problem with dynamic action space
 A complete action space can be divided into four parts. In each state, the action to be selected is one of them
 For example, the total discrete action space length is 1000, which can be divided into four parts, [0:300], [301:500],[501:900],[901:1000]
 For state 1, action_ space is [0:300], State2, action_ space is [301:500], etc
 For this idea, I have several ideas at present:
  
There is no restriction at all. The legal actions of all States are [1:1000], but it may take longer train time and there is not much innovation
 Soft constraint, for example, if state1 selects an illegal action, such as one action in [251: 500], reward gives a negative value, but it is also not innovative
 Hard constraint, use action space mask in each state, but I don't know how to do it.. Is there any relevant article？
 It is directly divided into four action spaces and uses multi-agent cooperative relationship learning
  
​
 Any suggestions？
 thanks！

 [1912.04321] Learning to Code: Coded Caching via Deep Reinforcement Learning (arxiv.org)
 In short, we are trying to achieve the minimum number of transmission of bits from the server to all users
 Now, after 500 episodes of training the number of transmissions does decrease. But when I implement the same actor critic algorithm this does not happen. In fact, the results seem to be completely random. 
 Here is the plot of the same :

 Although my training parameters are slightly different, I can't understand why this would happen.
 I used the parameters and pseudo code from this paper: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Shared Caching | IEEE Conference Publication | IEEE Xplore - which is an extension of the link at the top.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone,
 We have recently published the code for our AISTATS 2022 paper -
 Sampling in Dirichlet Process Mixture Models for Clustering Streaming Data
 ​
 Video Segmentation Example
 In our work, we have proposed a solution for clustering streaming data. Unlike 'standard' clustering scenarios, in the streaming case the data stream is possibly infinite, you cannot backtrack to previously processed points, and the data statistics are dynamic and change over time.
 Our solution is based on the Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM), can work with different types of observations, and is very fast, outperforming other methods both in the quality of the results and the speed with which it achieves them.
 It can even be distributed across several processes and/or machines!

 The problem is, some itens has different qualities, and I wanna automatize this process, to identify the good stuff to keep, and sell the bad stuff.
 What's the best way to do that? 
 I work with desktop systems, so i'm not familiar with this kind of stuff, but I usually read about python and some frameworks, what do you guys recommend me to start?

 The dataset of interest to me is RadGraph: https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14463
 The issue I am having is that the graphs in RadGraph are disconnected in nature (on average 20 disconnected components), making it difficult for the various graph encoders I am aware of to do a good job classifying the graphs.

I was always fascinated about AI since my childhood, that's why I'm going to pursue this field. Also, I am currently studying Game Development to make a VR Game that hopefully will have humanlike AI in it. I have read a LOT of articles about the future of AI, and Cybersecurity keeps popping up because superintelligent AI needs to be CONTROLLED from hackers (based on the articles) otherwise it is over. What do you guys think would be the tech field that will bring the most changes in the future?

 But what’s hype, and what’s realistic? And how can you get involved?
 The first step is to understand the technology - where it’s well-suited to healthcare (and where it isn’t).
 When it comes to health care, especially for life and death situations AI has made things very easy for us. However, it is still expected to drastically change the way medicine is practised. It will also replace the surgeries done by the doctors with the surgeries done using Artificial intelligence, making diagnosing complex diseases, genetic issues and many other health problems extremely easy in the future. Here are the best Artificial Intelligence courses for healthcare you can learn in 2022.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone! 
 We have released the preprint and google colab demo for our paper FaceSigns. FaceSigns embeds a secret bit-string as a semi-fragile watermark in the image pixels. The message is recoverable if benign image operations such as color/contrast adjustment, JPEG compression, Instagram filters are applied. However, the message cannot be decoded if the image is facially tampered (eg. DeepFake manipulation) . This selective fragility allows reliable detection of DeepFake manipulations applied on images signed using FaceSigns. 
 Try out our google colab demo to see message encoding and decoding using FaceSigns!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys!
 I work in house and I’m part of our Google search team. Our ad spend is pretty large (9 figures per year, in USD). We build/manage stuff at scale using SQL, R, Javascript, and so on. So everything is pretty much “big data” in flavour.
 Lately I’ve been more and more interested in data science, and I’m looking to take things to the next level by incorporating machine learning into our workflow. I’d really love to build some useful machine learning models using popular Python libraries such as Pandas, SciKit Learn, NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and so on.
 Any suggestions on cool, and most importantly useful machine learning models I could build? (By “useful”, I mean something that could help increase the profits.) I think some classification, predictive, or recommender models would be great to start with. Cheers! 😄

Major comments by the reviewers include: more justification on the assumptions, discussion on choices of parameters, and experiments in more complex and different environments. 
 We want to address all the major and minor comments as best as we can but given that the response is limited to one page we cannot explain everything in detail. I am not sure what is the acceptable norm here. Do reviewers expect the authors to conduct some experiments during the rebuttal and provide sample results or just explain what additional experiment we will conduct and how we will do it. Justification and reasoning should be in details or a brief explanation with an assurance to add a detailed discussion in the final version suffices.

 Currently, I am doing some research with the UCI Adult dataset(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult). This first step is to build a high-accuracy classifier model. 
 Does anyone know any high accuracy model on this dataset (more than 90%)? I use many machine learning models like logistic regression and neural network. But no matter how complex the model is, I can only get an accuracy of about 85% on the test set. I tried to google but I found many others also have similar results of about 85%.
 Any posts or papers will be helpful! Thanks in advance for your help!

Suppose I am not using multiple workers then I have to collect episodes N times of fixed length T. But these episode lengths are variable i.e. some episodes end much before T and some much after T. So my question is how do we calculated advantage because according to the PPO paper, for generalized advantage estimate, we have to observe the reward of terminal state.

 So how should I calculate GAE in this ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I just wanted to share a project I've been working on for the past year - using deep RL to learn to play the board game Settlers of Catan.
 I expect everyone is aware of the results that DeepMind/OpenAI have got recently on Go, DOTA 2, Starcraft 2 etc, but I was motivated to see how much progress could be made with existing RL techniques on a reasonably complex game - but with access to significantly less computational resources.
 Whilst I didn't end up with an agent that performs at a super-human level, there was clear learning progress and the results were quite interesting. I decided to do a full write-up of the project here, which I figured could be useful for anyone else who is interested in trying to apply DRL to a new, complicated environment. I also open-sourced all the code here for anyone interested.
 If anyone has any feedback or any questions at all that'd be great!

 We just submitted to ICML 2022 and got our reviews back. We were excited to see that 4/4 reviews were positive and acknowledged the contribution of the paper. However, there were some minor criticisms (e.g. didn't do good enough lit reviews, could use a few more experiments) across several reviews.
 I was wondering if it is ever acceptable to not submit a rebuttal? Can a rebuttal in this case actually hurt us by rocking the boat---or for ICML is the norm that you should always submit a rebuttal that addresses all the reviewers' criticisms.
 We were wondering what the norm is for ICML specifically?

 Abstract
  
Contrastive models like CLIP have been shown to learn robust representations of images that capture both semantics and style. To leverage these representations for image generation, we propose a two-stage model: a prior that generates a CLIP image embedding given a text caption, and a decoder that generates an image conditioned on the image embedding. We show that explicitly generating image representations improves image diversity with minimal loss in photorealism and caption similarity. Our decoders conditioned on image representations can also produce variations of an image that preserve both its semantics and style, while varying the non-essential details absent from the image representation. We use diffusion models for the decoder and experiment with both autoregressive and diffusion models for the prior, finding that the latter are computationally more efficient and produce higher-quality samples.

Reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to train a policy to perform a task via trial and error, but a major challenge in RL is learning policies from scratch in environments with hard exploration challenges. For example, consider the setting depicted in the door-binary-v0 environment from the adroit manipulation suite, where an RL agent must control a hand in 3D space to open a door placed in front of it. 
   


An RL agent must control a hand in 3D space to open a door placed in front of it. The agent receives a reward signal only when the door is completely open.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm curious about wether this unusual learning trajectory observed in humans has also been observed in artificial neural nets. A well known phenomenon in the 'dark souls' video game series is that ones first attempt at a boss is often much better than subsequent attempts. Boss hp at time of death by attempt might go something like: 35%, 55%, 85%, 87%, 75%, 54%, , 60%, 43%, 27%, 38%, 12%, 0%. This sounds very anecdotal, but its know to the community of these games to be a real thing. See this thread for evidence. Have NN playing games been known to exhibit a similar pattern, with peak in success early on, followed by a step descent , then a slow gradual climb? Or is this a purely human phenomenon?
 My hypothesis as to why this happens is that over the course of the first couple attempts, the player learns a bunch of bad strategies which must be slowly unlearned, whereas on attempt one, the player has no defined strategies good or bad.

 abstract: "The Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) model is an ensemble method extensively and successfully used in regression tasks due to its consistently strong predictive performance and its ability to quantify uncertainty. BART combines "weak" tree models through a set of shrinkage priors, whereby each tree explains a small portion of the variability in the data. However, the lack of smoothness and the absence of a covariance structure over the observations in standard BART can yield poor performance in cases where such assumptions would be necessary. We propose Gaussian processes Bayesian additive regression trees (GP-BART) as an extension of BART which assumes Gaussian process (GP) priors for the predictions of each terminal node among all trees. We illustrate our model on simulated and real data and compare its performance to traditional modelling approaches, outperforming them in many scenarios. An implementation of our method is available in the \textsf{R} package \texttt{rGPBART} available at: https://github.com/MateusMaiaDS/gpbart."

 I am using SAC(Soft Actor-Critic) to complete a reinforcement learning task with only four steps, each action is from one of four different action spaces. These four action spaces are essentially the same, and they are all chemical compound. I just want the agent to take different types of compounds at each step.
 I have the following questions：
  
Whether the different four steps can be trained? In fact, there is a paper that only has four steps in a reinforcement learning process, but his action space only has one discrete action space.
 Is there any article I can learn from? because I know that for the handle control of the game, there are usually multiple discrete action spaces, but each discrete space dimension of my task is larger, such as [800, 700, 500, 600]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a project in the course of my PhD, I had to create a prototype for a project. My PhD is application of machine learning in health care. The project definition and scope was faaaar too wide. However, I managed to create a working demo which encompasses some use cases of the project. At best, it can be called a framework, where I have put in different DL components and it works okay for those use cases only. Most of the components, I have used are pre-trained language models (maybe fine tuned them to my use case). However, there is no active training or learning involved. This is because I created this for a demo only. I also created a very small dataset and tested the framework over the dataset and the results were ok. However, my supervisor now wants me to write a paper, as he is confident, that the use case is rather unique and my working framework is a good first step. I believe, his aim is to get me started on the paper writing process, which I appreciate. However, I am not confident about it at all.
 My question is, can a 'framework' composed of pre-trained models with the end goal of solving a problem in health care is good enough? Are there precedents of any such paper? And if I trust my supervisor's instincts, are there any fancy ways to frame the framework so that it does not look so basic?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At my company we use RL to solve our problem. The thing is : our problem is rather complex, and this is the core of our product (so clients rely on the results produced). 
 In order to reach satisfying results despite an agent that doesn't learn very well, we use sampling at inference time : instead of taking the best trajectory according to the agent, we take X trajectories and keep only the one with the best reward.
 This seems completely fine at first (similar things are done in NLP for example, with beam search), but in our case the sampling size is huge : 1024. Usually when using beam search, we use maybe a beam size of 6. Maybe 10 if you have good hardware ?
 ​
 Now, the agent seems to be learning : the mean return is slightly increasing over time, the entropies for the actions are steadily decreasing, etc...
 Now the goal of the ML team is to improve agent's learning to decrease the sampling size at inference time (because it's costly to run 1024 trajectories through the environment...).
 But whatever we try, the improvements are not reflected (we compare all our experiments with 1024 sampling in order to see what the customers will see).
 ​
 IMO this is because our sampling size is way too huge, even a random agent can produce okay-ish results...
 Is my intuition the right one ?

I'm interested in the emergence of language in multi-agent reinforcement environments but I can't see how this would be important down the line when there are large language models that are completely dominating language and communication. 
 Should this stop me from pursuing this idea or should I let my interest in the idea take precedence?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ll give an example to better explain my question (don’t get hung up on the numbers, it’s all made up). Say you are using a tree based model trying to project how many points a player will score in a given basketball game.
 Most players shoot free throws at a slightly lower percentage on the road, than they do at home. However, the magnitude varies player to player. Let’s assume for 95% of players with significant data, the ratio of home free throw percentage to away is 1 to 1.15. Generally speaking, older players are closer to 1 and younger players are around 1.1 (since older players get used to the opposing crowd).
 Now also say it takes 100 home and 100 away free throws to get a stable reliable ratio.
 Now say a young player only has 50 home, and 50 away free throws. With this amount of data he has a ratio of 1, however the sample size is not enough to be fully stable.
 Which would be better…
 5 features into this model, his home away ratio, average ratio for players his age, home free throw count, and away free throw attempts.
 1 feature. His ‘projected’ home away ratio, which is a weighted average of his ratio with the average for plaeyrs his age. Since he’s 50% of the way to significance, 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 1.1 = 1.05
 The benefit of the of the first choice is that it may find other interactions that I never conceived of, however, it could incorporate noise. Is there a general consensus, or is this just a try both and see what works?

 It has PPO agents in MARL, all of them with multihead attention performed on the observation, in such a way that an attention map is created for each agent. This attention map has information about how strongly each agent is attending to various elements of the environment. With KL divergence, the agents are rewarded for minimizing the difference between their attention maps.

 Meta-Learning Machines in a Single Lifelong Trial: lecture video (24 min) presented at meta-learning workshops at ICML 2020 and NeurIPS 2021. URL of talk: https://youtu.be/2GgGVdkq2bU
 Abstract
 The most widely used machine learning algorithms were designed by humans and thus are hindered by our cognitive biases and limitations. Can we also construct meta-learning algorithms that can learn better learning algorithms so that our self-improving AIs have no limits other than those inherited from computability and physics? This question has been a main driver of my research since I wrote a thesis on it in 1987. In the past decade, it has become a driver of many other people's research as well. Here I summarize our work starting in 1994 on meta-reinforcement learning with self-modifying policies in a single lifelong trial, and - since 2003 - mathematically optimal meta-learning through the self-referential Gödel Machine. This talk was previously presented at meta-learning workshops at ICML 2020 and NeurIPS 2021. Many additional publications on meta-learning can be found at https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/metalearning.html

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We humans navigate the environment using all of our senses. Allen Institute researchers propose MERLOT Reserve, a model that learns to represent videos over time and across several modalities, including audio, subtitles, and video frames. It was trained using a new learning objective and more than 20 million YouTube videos.
 MERLOT Reserve is a unique, cutting-edge methodology for solving video-related inquiries. MERLOT Reserve can dependably choose the correct answer from a selection of multiple-choice answers when given a video and a question. This forecast is made by MERLOT Reserve jointly reasoning over the visual frames of the video, the video subtitles, and the audio in the movie.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I'm a first-year Grad Student in Computer Vision and I am trying to get caught up on the latest research in my field. It seems like everyone in CS has heard about all of the latest papers but I just have no idea how. My knowledge is limited to general ideas and doesn't know any specific papers unless they have like 20000+ citations.
 So my question is: how do you hear about these papers and get caught up? Is there a reference somewhere that puts together a list of all the "must-read" papers that have come out? I feel like I am already 5 years behind in my knowledge. It would be great if there was something like "Top 5 papers of the week" that I could read to stay on top of things.
 Also, this doesn't just apply to Vision. I would like to have an idea of the other major developments in other fields (like NLP, general ML/DL, etc.) since I think that can carry over to my field.
 Thanks! Looking forward to your replies

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Based on my experiences in both academia and industry, I see that many researchers get listed as authors on papers solely for having attended the relevant project meetings, despite not contributing anything substantial to the work. I know of several people who've gotten on dozens of papers this way, despite not being able to explain the main details behind many of the papers they "co-authored." Of course, they can then claim credit for the work publicly as well as have their academic profile benefit from the citations accrued by the work.
 I've noticed that typically, these people are initially invited onto the project because they are on chummy terms with someone on the project. Concerningly, the more someone successfully "paper-rides" this way, the stronger their publication record looks, which makes it easier for them to find their way onto more projects to paper ride in the future.
 It seems that the obsessive focus on paper counts and citations has encouraged the rise of intellectually dishonest strategies for maximizing one's academic footprint. The huge research scientist salaries at top industry labs, which similarly obsess over paper counts and citations in their hiring process, only amplifies the incentive for paper riding.
 The reason I think it is bad: As more people paper ride, co-authorship on a paper gradually becomes a worse indication of expertise. Not to mention, paper riders are intellectually dishonest, by claiming credit for research that they didn't significantly contribute to. In a sense, it seems like a roundabout form of plagiarism.
 I know some might disagree with this take, as some people believe in being as generous about co-authorship as possible. I find that mindset to create the perfect environment for paper riders to flourish. I'm wondering if you've also seen paper riding happen and whether you think this behavior is good or bad.

Ever queried a recommender system and found that the same search only a few moments later or on a different device yields very different results? This is not uncommon and can be frustrating if a person is looking for something specific. As a designer of such a system, it is also not uncommon for the metrics measured to change from design and testing to deployment, bringing into question the utility of the experimental testing phase. Some level of such irreproducibility can be expected as the world changes and new models are deployed. However, this also happens regularly as requests hit duplicates of the same model or models are being refreshed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. I've been stuck on this problem for a while and I thought I might be able to find some help here. Any kind of assistance would be greatly appreciated. 
 My setup is as follows. I have an environment with 3 agents. All 3 agents have a single policy network, and it is based on CommNet. My goal is to implement a replay buffer for this environment. I verified that my replay buffer logic is good. I tried running 3 different types of runs:
  
Normal on-policy run: The agents perform an episode, and at the end of each episode the data (such as the states, actions, etc) from this episode are used to calculate the loss
 Using just the last episode from the replay buffer: The agents perform an episode, and the data is stored in the replay buffer. At the end of each episode, the last episode is sampled from the replay buffer (which is the episode that was just performed). This is just to confirm that my replay buffer is working properly, and the reward curve for this case matches that from (1).
 Using 1 random episode from the replay buffer: The agents perform an episode, and the data is stored in the replay buffer. At the end of each episode, a random episode is sampled from the replay buffer and used to calculate the loss. The performance is terrible in this case, and the environment times out each time
  
For some reason, as soon as I turn on random sampling, progress is really bad. I'm sorry to pose such an open-ended question, but what are some things I could check to pinpoint the source of this problem? What could be a reason as to why performance is as expected when just sampling the last episode, whereas it is terrible when randomly sampling episodes? I've tried some things thus far but nothing has worked, and I turned to this community in hopes of getting some help. I'm new to the area of reinforcement learning, so I would be very grateful for any kind of help you can offer. Thanks in advance

 However, what I have seen is that the embedding space doesn't cluster the images as well as some contrastive methods. However contrastive methods require non-elegant negative sampling etc. 
 Can we somehow force the VAE to learn both the variational lower bound as well as learn a good metric between samples such as visually similar samples are better clustered together?

This will not replace data scientist, as we still need data scientists for their domain knowledge, which is critical for scoping business problems, pre-processing data, and deriving business insights from the trained model. However, since data scientists no longer need to deal with the technicalities of a model in the near future (i.e. they no longer have to tune hyperparameters, determine the best opitmistion function etc), is there still a need for aspiring data scientists to learn about the intricacies and nuances behind the various models (maybe by coding the model from scratch)? Or is it enough for them to learn how to operate an AutoML system? (My question is referring to the corporate world in general and not to academia) Thanks in advance for your answers :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 We've just launched a competition at the AutoML-Conf 2022, the DAC4AutoML competition. It has two tracks, one for configuring a Computer Vision model and one for a RL pipeline: https://automl.github.io/dac4automlcomp/ 
 And what is DAC exactly? It means we want to find well-performing hyperparameter configurations like in Algorithm Configuration, but we do it dynamically - thus DAC, Dynamic Algorithm Configuration. As to how that is supposed to happen? We don't put any restrictions on the solutions for the competitions, so you can submit your hand-tuned static hyperparameter setting if you want. Or you can use some sort of heuristic, a regression model, reinforcement learning, ... whatever works. 
 If you're interested in participating, you can submit from now on until the 18.06. AOE, the winners will be announced at the AutoML-Conf.

 Output from using model.learn(env) on both Envs
 On the left I have a simple dummy CustomEnv (Using Stable-Baselines3 with Gym) for testing, and on the right I have my actual CustomEnv that I am working on in a project.
 As you can see, the dummy environment gives me the rollout monitoring, whereas there is no rollout monitoring for the actual environment (just time + train statistics/monitoring). 
 I am using very similar code when setting up the training of the model, however the complexity of the actual model is significantly higher than the dummy. In theory, the complexity of the environment shouldnt make a big difference to the monitoring right? All of the key parts are still there (reward function, step function, reset function etc.).
 In both cases it says that the environments are being wrapped by the 'Moniter' wrapper so that cant be it.
 Does anyone know why this might be happening?

 That may be about to change with the rollout release of Stylegan-XL weights trained on Imagenet. This notebook (https://github.com/CasualGANPapers/StyleGANXL-CLIP) has had nice results with objects never seen by the model, such as "apple" and "ant", as well as scenes such as "judo athletes fighting"
 Please note that the Stylegan-XL weights are currently available for 128x128 pixels. ETA for the 256 resolution is 14.04.22

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, all. I got accepted into my top choice of college as an undecided major. Recently, I have decided to pursue artificial intelligence! Unfortunately, it is near impossible to transfer into computer science at my particular university. I was wondering if I can still pursue AI as a career if I complete one of the following majors:
 -Mathematics
 -Information or Data Science
 -Statistics
 -Linguistics
 Additionally, I could pursue one of these and minor in another. I should be able to minor in computer science as well if necessary. Hopefully, my choice of major would allow me to pursue research or an internship in artificial intelligence. I am willing to take additional summer courses and pursue relevant certifications to ensure that I am up to par with my computer science colleagues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My post is inspired by this discussion.
 In that thread, OP asked why support vector machines are still taught. People offered several thoughts: they're easier to think about, they're still perfectly good for some real-world problems, and for some problems they apparently rival deep networks.
 I did a project for a class around six years ago using an SVM as implemented in scikit-learn. I was pretty satisfied with the project, but I also experienced some frustrations, and came away with some questions. I started working with Tensorflow and DNNs in earnest soon after finishing that project, and I largely stopped thinking about SVM. I would like to revive the questions I asked, but never answered, here.
  
A DNN with multiple outputs can potentially use a single neuron in the prediction of more than one output. For multiple, mutually-exclusive categories, this makes good sense. An SVM with multiple outputs in scikit-learn was implemented as pairs of one-vs-one SVMs, each of which was independently fit to data. This gets inefficient quickly. Has this changed? Can it be changed?
 DNN training at scale is a problem that many people have worked hard to make practical. Even non-experts like myself use our home GPUs to accelerate training of DNNs on large data sets. In scikit-learn, SVM training was implemented in a single thread on one CPU core. If you are performing cross-validation or a hyperparameter optimization study, it might be practical to parallelize fitting; one thread for each distinct condition. But can you parallelize the SVM fitting algorithm for a single condition? I went looking for software, but I couldn't find anything.
  
Over to you folks. Cheers.

 I am interested in knowing whether hyperparameters such as dropout, or recurrent dropout, batchnorm, etc etc, are even necessary in the usage of seq2seq model, but couldn’t find anything on it for weeks.
 In the case, let’s say, using gridsearchCV, what hyperparameters do you tweak for ur seq2seq model? (Other than the usual stuff like number of neurons, etc). There is absolutely zero information for that on seq2seq model, and everyone just assumes that putting an attention mechanism solves everything without hyperparameters tunings. I have also looked up on codes on seq2seq, and no hyperparameters tunings were shown whatsoever. 
 FYI, this is in the context of time series data, using seq2seq, if that matters.

 Use case: I have been working on an animated movie to which I am the sole contributor. Though I have been putting it off while looking for an appropriate solution, the time has come to voice my various characters, who are a range of ages, both male and female. For several reasons, I am interested in voicing them all myself while doing the facial motion captures as well. What I am in need of is, essentially, something that does exactly what Respeecher does, but without the $200/month sub fee. I would love to be in a position to simply pay them what they are asking for in exchange…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I read the paper and several tutorials, I am quite confused about the details.
  
I see many implementations scale the running cumulative discounted reward in a certain way. However, each of them does it in a different way. let R be the running cumulative discounted reward, which is considered the best? Or is there a source of the method to use? implementations I saw from different places include: 
  
 directly use R to calculate the advantage and training value network (most PPO tutorials use this)
 use (R / std(R)), where std is the mini-batch standard deviation
 use (R / std(R)), where std is the running standard deviation
 use ((R - mean(R)) / std(R)), where both mean and std are mini-batch wise
 use ((R - mean(R)) / std(R)), where both mean and std are running stats.
 do the above and clip to a certain range ([-10, 10] or [-1, 1])
  
 I also see several different ways for the value network, let V be the output of the value network:
  
 output raw logit, without any scaling/output activation (most PPO tutorials use this)
 output raw logit, but use the same scaling as discussed above for running cumulative discounted reward, for example, if return value is (R / std(R)), value output will be (V / std(R))
 do the same as 2, but use the stat of V instead of R for scaling, for example, if the return value is (R / std(R)), the value output will be (V / std(V))
 output with tanh activation at the last layer
 output with tanh activation at the last layer, and multiply by a constant to match the range of the return
  
any help would be appreciated, thanks!

 This paper finds what seems to be a new phenomenon when working in the continual learning/life-long learning domain. If new tasks are continually introduced to an agent, it seems to loose it's ability to learn the more time progresses. Intuitively it's similar to this idea that "an old dog can't learn new tricks". They propose a fairly simple method of overcoming this limitation that involves resetting weights that are not contributing much to the outcome of the network. They call the method Continual Backprop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 As the title describes, I’ll be making my first model as part of my final project. I still have a pretty high-level understanding of everything, so forgive any inaccuracies as I describe what I’m going for.
 The problem I’m attempting to solve is known as the traveling salesman problem. Essentially, a route needs to be formulated that stops at n given locations. Finding the most efficient route with many stops algorithmically is impractical because the number of possible routes increases exponentially with each added location. 
 The environment will simulate travel on city roads. Speed will be a constant, set to whatever the roads speed limit is. I am using .pbf format vector GIS data from OSM so that the environment consists of real-world pathways. I’m using GeoPandas and Pyrosm to work with the data, and I’m collecting nodes for the location of gas stations so that the environment can simulate needing to fuel the vehicle. Gas price will be a constant, as well as vehicle fuel-efficiency.
 Scoring will be based on the calculated time it would take to complete a route and the calculated cost (in gas). The goal will be to find the most efficient route to take when n = some large number. 
 I’ve never worked with spatial data either, so I’m not sure what kind of challenges that poses. I worry that adding nodes for the locations of gas stations might be difficult. I’m also wondering if I’m better off using Tensorflow and Keras for this, but I’m not really aware of all the technical considerations I should be making before deciding on that.
 Do you have any tips that might help me out? Solutions to problems I haven’t hit just yet, but likely will? 
 Thanks for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As far as I am aware, StableBaselines3 is the gold standard for reliable implementations of most popular / SOTA deep RL methods. However working with them in the past, I don't find them to be the most usable when looking for extensibility (making changes to the provided implementations) due to how the code base is structured in the behind the scenes (inheritance, lots of helper methods & utilities, etc.).
 For example, if I wish to change some portion of a method's training update with SB3 it would probably involve overloading a class method before initialization, making sure al the untouched portions of the original method are carried over, etc.
 Could anyone point me in the direction of any implementations that are more workable from the perspective of extensibility? Ideally implementations that are largely self contained to a single class / file, aren't heavily abstracted aware across multiple interfaces, don't rely heavily on utility functions, etc.

 - New transfer learning capabilities, outperforms fine-tuned models with 50x less data (Codex-12B)
 - The interesting part is how it meta-learns techy geeky jokes and is able to correlate concepts, and explain jokes suggesting starting doing a bit more meta-learning than GPT3 ever could.... But still not enough to generate decent ones (though the joke wasn't particularly humorous, so I may be underestimating)
 SoTA on various tasks, chain-of-thought-reasoning still holds up to scaling and outperforms some reasoning benchmarks, BIG-bench sees a huge improvement and general LLM thingys :)

However, because the models may fail to understand program semantics, the quality of the generated code cannot be guaranteed.
 Microsoft researchers introduce Jigsaw, a new tool that can help these big language models perform better. Jigsaw is a Python Pandas API code generator that accepts multi-modal inputs. Jigsaw uses post-processing techniques to decipher the syntax and semantics of programs and then uses user feedback to improve future performance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I am running some starter code from openAI(FetchReach-v1, FetchPush-v1) gym with env.action_space.sample(). But I don't see the goal is actually achieved when done returned is True. I copied the code from here (https://openai.com/blog/ingredients-for-robotics-research/). I even let it sleep every step to watch more closely. Another related thing that I can't explain is that it always returns done==True rather quickly with very few sampled actions. These all make me worried about using it as my task environment.

In recent years, large neural networks trained for language understanding and generation have achieved impressive results across a wide range of tasks. GPT-3 first showed that large language models (LLMs) can be used for few-shot learning and can achieve impressive results without large-scale task-specific data collection or model parameter updating. More recent LLMs, such as GLaM, LaMDA, Gopher, and Megatron-Turing NLG, achieved state-of-the-art few-shot results on many tasks by scaling model size, using sparsely activated modules, and training on larger datasets from more diverse sources. Yet much work remains in understanding the capabilities that emerge with few-shot learning as we push the limits of …]]></summary>

 ​
 I really love creating music algorithmically, which is why I have dedicated my master’s thesis to the generation of music patterns by the use of artificial intelligence.
 In the course of the past 12 months, I have programmed a deep recurrent neural network in Python, which I have trained on 200 self-made music patterns in order to generate somehow novel motifs.
 ​
 In order to evaluate my model, I have set up a short online listening experiment.
 I’m looking for test subjects right now, so if you are interested in participating, I would really appreciate it.
 The listening experiment will take you just about 5 to 8 minutes to complete and the only thing you need is a pair of headphones.
 You can partake on your computer as well as on your smartphone or tablet.
 ​
 Here is the link which gets you to the listening experiment:
 https://forms.gle/rx1FUQ7RgpjMu1xx9

 Thank you very much for taking the time to help me reach my goal.
 Really appreciate it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello /r/reinforcementlearning. I have to choose electives pretty soon, and as i am interested in reinforcement learning, I wanted to know which of these would be the most beneficial. 
  
Monte Carlo Simulation
 Computational Learning Theory
  
The year after I will also take a course on Reinforcement Learning, but it has not been created yet. 
 Note: I can also take both if recommended, if I do so, I will take one of the courses before taking the RL course, and the other would be at the same time. 
 Some further thought I've had:
  
CLT includes Bandits, which is surely were useful to know, but it seems to be only a rather small part, and I'm unsure whether all the other topics like PAC Learning and Rademacher Bounds are useful?
 
MC is more practical while CLT is more theoretic (Apparently VERY theoretic according to the course description above). I am not afraid of theoretic courses, but I struggle more with them than more practical courses.
 
The sentiment around the MC course, is that it is pretty good. I don't know anyone who have taken the CLT course.
 
If I choose both, which order would you take them in?

 By creating a costum environment ray wants you to create an observationspace. That would be a gym box in my case. Anyway idk the exact high and low values. My values lay between -1 and 1 more or less. 
 My fear is now that ray would normalize the Observation values to a new range although they are already processed. Does ray normalized observationspace? If yes how can i turn it off?

So what can be done instead of this?

 For training purpose we used SBIC, IBC, and Stereoset. Though these only contain short sentences which are labeled as belonging to only one of the above categories.
 Is anyone aware of any other Dataset which can be used for this purpose, which hopefully contains text labeled as promoting or containing a political leaning (left/right, conservative/liberal, neutral) and further either any racial or religious stereotypes?

 Don't know if this is the right subreddit, but here goes....
 I'm looking to voice clone my father. He has passed recently, and despite being difficult for all, it's been especially hard for my mother, married early to him and together for 50 years. Her birthday is coming up, I'd love to be able to create a 5-10 second sound byte of him for her.
 Fortunately, there's likely to be lots of his voice recording around, part of his job was speaking and instructing.
 So, is there any way this is possible, to be done without great difficulty, and produce an accurate result?
 I am understanding the moralities of crafting something with his deceased voice. I thought about it quite a bit. However, I feel that it's for his soulmate who's struggling, who he had no qualms spending his life with and travelling abroad with, spent his last days with. I'm certain he would want to help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given that most benchmarks for image classification are based on regular, everyday world objects RGB images (or grayscale), what are some unconventional science cases where 2D inputs are substantially different from what we are used to perceive by eye? 
 For example, I'm interested in cases where spatial information can't be constrained to narrow pixel value ranges, such as exponential signals. Or that any standard normalisation (say min-max, zscore) and normalisation layers are not applicable and could lead to the loss of information.
 One of these cases is Astronomy. However, most practitioners try to to adapt the problem to established standards (say fake RGB images, log scaling flux images, etc). What are other cases out there where the nature of the 2D inputs are very distinct to what we are used to parse through our eyes and what deep nets are benchmarked on? I'm curious about tailored solutions that would intrinsically change the way the deep nets are constructed to solve the research question.

 I'm Atindriyo Sanyal, one of the founders of the ML company Galileo (https://rungalileo.io/). We're building a cool new tool/framework for ML practitioners that helps shine a light on the data you are training your models with.
 I'd love to get some feedback on the product, and since we're still in private beta, I'm looking for folks to try out the product on their datasets and models. It's easy to use and hooks into popular frameworks such as pyTorch, Tensorflow, Keras, SpaCy etc. 
 Caveat: Currently the tool only works for NLP use cases (think text classification, NER etc).
 I'll be giving $100 to folks who are willing to give some time to this and provide feedback on the usability of the product. If you're interested, here's a really tiny form (should take <1 minute to fill) for you to fill out. I'll review the applications and send you an email for a follow up Zoom chat where I'll share the software artifacts with you!
 https://docs.google.com/forms/d/11V20C_J_SyNaX7QL6DasnTe7f0UiueUyaKdmt3xL1oI/edit
 Look forward and happy (machine) learning!

 It’s relatively easy to formulate and use DQN type algorithms by using neural network and say pytorch + stochastic optimization but I want to try out some tree based methods. (at least to reproduce papers which claim to use them)
 But I don’t know 1) If we have to design the structures and learning algorithms by hand or is there any package I can use? 
 2) How should the learning be done? We obviously can’t go regression type learning because of the bootstrapping nature of the Bellman equation?

I'm not trying to sell anyone anything, but I want to look for feedback that will help me to build a better product.
 My current thoughts are
  
Ease of getting data into the platform
 Ease of getting data off of the platform
 Automation for spinning up and down instances
 Availability of the type of instance you want
 Price too high
 Not enough/too many abstractions
  
TIA and I look forward to some good discussions!

 We have released last week our paper "Efficient-VDVAE: Less is more" with code!
 We present simple modifications to the Very Deep VAE to make it converge up to 2.6x times faster and save up to 20x times memory load. We also introduce a gradient smoothing technique to improve stability during training. Our model achieves comparable or better negative log-likelihood (NLL) on 7 commonly used datasets.
 Additionally, we make an argument against existing 5-bit benchmarks. We empirically show as well that 3% of the latent space is enough to encode the data information without any performance loss. Thus, indicating the potential to efficiently leverage the Hierarchical VAE's latent space in downstream tasks.

 We've just released the code for our paper (accepted to CVPR2022) 
 DeepDPM is a nonparametric deep-clustering method which unlike most deep clustering methods, does not require knowing the number of clusters, K; rather, it infers it as a part of the overall learning. Using a split/merge framework to change the clusters number adaptively and a novel loss, our proposed method outperforms existing (both classical and deep) nonparametric methods.
 While the few existing deep nonparametric methods lack scalability, we show ours by being the first such method that reports its performance on ImageNet.

Below are some examples of clusters our method found in ImageNet.

 Introducing CodeGen: Creating Programs from Prompts
 The large-scale language model, CodeGen, which converts simple English prompts into executable code, is the first step toward this objective. The person doesn’t write any code; instead, (s)he describes what (s)he wants the code to perform in normal language, and the computer does the rest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I tried using RL for some work at my university, it did not really work all that well. 
 I'm wondering if there are some real life scenarios that I could use to create my own personal projects. Otherwise, I'd be fine with games. 
 I want to try all of it out from Dynamic Programming to crazy ass stuff like A3C, PPO and so on. I like RL, more so than any other form of ML, and I want to play around with it as a hobby. 
 This is really the area of ML for me. For starters, there are fundamentals behind it, so you can mostly explain why agents do one thing or another. Additionally, there isn't a need to have massive amounts of data. It's also the only type of ML that I've been able to successfully use with software engineering. 
 Designing the agent and the API it uses to take actions in an environment is as much a software engineering project as is creating a REST API. 
 I feel there is a lot of potential for me to go crazy with this, and I was wondering if people have any cool suggestions. Anything that is real time is anything that I want to do. Real time systems and RL are exactly the sort of thing I love to do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Confidence regions are the 2D version of a confidence interval. Almost everywhere in the literature, the shape is elliptic, but no justification is provided. You would think that a confidence region of level γ is defined as the domain of minimum area, covering a mass γ of the underlying probability distribution. That sounds perfectly logical, but it is mentioned nowhere. Based on this definition, the boundary of a confidence region is obtained by solving an optimization problem: it is a problem in calculus of variations -- finding a boundary curve encompassing a domain of minimum area. These problems are usually hard to solve, but in this case, the solution seems trivial: it must be a contour line. And if the underlying distribution is Gaussian, contour lines are obviously ellipses. This would be a solid justification as to why ellipses are so widespread.

 My question here is whether or not my argumentation makes sense, or if there is something faulty in my math. I discuss it in more details in one of my articles, here. If you need clarifications, please reply on Reddit, I will do my best to explain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The sensor to shooter timeline is affected by two main variables: satellite
positioning and asset positioning. Speeding up satellite positioning by adding
more sensors or by decreasing processing time is important only if there is a
prepared shooter, otherwise the main source of time is getting the shooter into
position. However, the intelligence community should work towards the
exploitation of sensors to the highest speed and effectiveness possible.
Achieving a high effectiveness while keeping speed high is a tradeoff that must
be considered in the sensor to shooter timeline. In this paper we investigate
two main ideas, increasing the effectiveness of satellite imagery through image
manipulation and how on-board image manipulation would affect the sensor to
shooter timeline. We cover these ideas in four scenarios: Discrete Event
Simulation of onboard processing versus ground station processing, quality of
information with cloud cover removal, information improvement with super
resolution, and data reduction with image to caption. This paper will show how
image manipulation techniques such as Super Resolution, Cloud Removal, and
Image to Caption will improve the quality of delivered information in addition
to showing how those processes effect the sensor to shooter timeline.]]></summary>

 This is my personal project developed two years ago. It covers major DRL algorithms like:
 - [DQN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602)- [Double DQN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461)- [Dueling DQN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06581)- [Prioritized Experience Replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05952)- [Noisy Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.10295)- [C51](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06887)- [Rainbow](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02298)- [QR-DQN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10044)- [IQR](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06923)- [FQF](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02140)- [DDPG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971)- [SAC](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01290)- [TD3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09477)- [MDQN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14430)
 What is amazing is its speed and memory efficiency after some optimization:
 With a single 2080Ti GPU and a 8 core AMD CPU, the training speed of rainbow for Atari could achieve 3000FPS, which means it can finish training of 10M frames within 1 hour. With compression of image frames, replay memory's RAM usage is down by 20%.
 I have tested several algorithms and games on Atari and get some initial result. Welcome to use and contribute!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am searching for regularization methods applied to DRL algorithms (either value or policy-based) to understand what has been done so far in the field. I cannot find any valid reference that studies the effect of applying a soft constraint to the reward function instead of to the policy objective. This may seem useless for some applications, but it is highly relevant for finance, which is my domain of application,
 The idea I have so far is that if you constrain the reward, it is like you are imposing limits on the agent's behavior. On the other hand, if you constrain the objective, you are not limiting the behavior, but you are correcting the ex-post the undesired behavior. The latter way does not allow the agent to learn not to behave in a certain way.
 ​
 Did anyone ever think about it? Are they good references that analyze the different effects of a constraint to whatever DRL algorithm?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Artificial Intelligence is being used in almost every aspect of life. AI symbolizes growth and productivity in the minds of some, but it is raising questions as well on the fairness, privacy, and security of these systems. Many legitimate issues exist, including biased choices, labor replacement, and a lack of security. When it comes to robots, this is very frightening. Self-driving automobiles, for example, can cause injury or death if they make mistakes. Responsible AI addresses these difficulties and makes AI systems more accountable.
 Responsible AI should fulfill the following aims:
  
Interpretability: We obtain an explanation for how a model makes predictions when we interpret it. An AI system makes predictions for a user. Even if these selections are correct, a user is likely to seek an explanation. Responsible AI can describe how we create interpretable models.
 Fairness: AI systems have the potential to make judgments that are biased towards particular groups of people. Bias in the training data is the source of this bias. The easier it is to assure fairness and rectify any bias in a model, the more interpretable it is. As a result, we need a Responsible AI framework to explain how we evaluate fairness and what to do if a model makes unjust predictions.
 Safety and Security: AI systems aren’t deterministic. When confronted with new situations, they are prone to making poor choices. The systems can even be tampered with to make unwise decisions. Therefore, we need to ensure safety and security in these systems.
 Data Governance: The data used must be of high quality. If the data used by AI has errors, the system may make wrong decisions.

According to Markets & Markets, the global market for video analytics was valued at USD 5.9 billion in 2021 and is predicted to reach USD 14.9 billion by 2026.
 Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have also enabled a wide range of video analytics applications (e.g., aerial surveys) since they provide aerial views of the environment, allowing for collecting aerial photos and processing with deep learning algorithms. Parking analytics is one of these critical smart city applications that uses deep learning and UAVs to collect real-time data and analyze it in order to maximize parking revenue, enhance parking resource allocations, and better manage public space.

 And they train LR model on Covid19 dataset [death/ didn't die] so it's binary classification problem However later on, they construct nomogram, which determines whether there is low/moderate/high risk of covid19 mortality. What I don't undestand is how they calculate the score the establish chances of death. E.G. If the score is <0.05 there is low possibility that patient will die.
 My general question is, how they constructed this nomogram from the binary classifier they had?

 Prior works require hand crafted curriculum and billion of interactions to solve a cube, we believe that order of magnitude more compute that it should take.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 there is a lot of work in the field of geometric deep learning for combinatorial optimization that yields good approximation algorithms for "hard" problems on graphs (see here), with the most prominent example being the TSP problem. However, as far as I can see, all these considered problems share the fact that the computed solution is a subset of the vertices/edges of the original graph. In my field (graph drawing), one of the most important considered properties is the crossing number). Hence, the solution would not consists of a labeling of the edges/vertices, but is rather a regression task on the whole graph. I have a dataset that consists of roughly 10000 graphs together with their crossing number. Treating the above problem as a supervised regression task and simply inserting the graph into a GNN does not work for me at all - is this a problem of my choice of architecture or is this sort of "function" that maps a graph to its crossing number something we can expect no current architecture to find.
 I appreciate any comment, even if it is just your intuition on the problem.
 Best regards,
 MrLemming

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was looking at this paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf) and came across this graph:
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/49ydy9bo61r81.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&s=729743449d6a99d2b84b81610e7e32d87ea4dfeb
 I am trying to understand the following two things about this graph:
 ​
  
What is PetaFLOP/s-days? I read that a PetaFLOP is 1,000,000,000,000,000 calculations (e.g. addition, subtraction). I am guessing that 10^2 would imply 100 * 1,000,000,000,000,000 calculations per day - is this correct? Is there any difference between PetaFLOP/days and PetaFLOP/s-days? (I also find it interesting they are probably referring to "computer resources" as simply "compute")
 What does "C" stand for in L = 2.57 * C^-0.048? I am guessing that the "dotted line" probably refers to the "average loss" for different Neural Networks with differing amounts of Parameters - but what exactly does "C" stand for?
 Finally, is there a reason that "Validation Loss" is not expressed as a percentage? For instance, what is a Validation Loss of 3? Is a Validation Loss of 3 the same as a Loss of 30%? Or does Validation Loss simply refer to the value of the Loss Function obtained during the Validation stage of Cross Validation?
  
Thank you!

shots of an individual. MyStyle allows to reconstruct, enhance and edit images
of a specific person, such that the output is faithful to the person's key
facial characteristics. Given a small reference set of portrait images of a
person (~100), we tune the weights of a pretrained StyleGAN face generator to
form a local, low-dimensional, personalized manifold in the latent space. We
show that this manifold constitutes a personalized region that spans latent
codes associated with diverse portrait images of the individual. Moreover, we
demonstrate that we obtain a personalized generative prior, and propose a
unified approach to apply it to various ill-posed image enhancement problems,
such as inpainting and super-resolution, as well as semantic editing. Using the
personalized generative prior we obtain outputs that exhibit high-fidelity to
the input images and are also faithful to the key facial characteristics of the
individual in the reference set. We demonstrate our method with fair-use images
of numerous widely recognizable individuals for whom we have the prior
knowledge for a qualitative evaluation of the expected outcome. We evaluate our
approach against few-shots baselines and show that our personalized prior,
quantitatively and qualitatively, outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives.]]></summary>

identification. The use of relation networks facilitates joint training of the

prototypical networks in speaker verification and to increase the
discriminability of the speaker embeddings, we train the model to classify
samples in the current episode amongst all speakers present in the training
set. Furthermore, we propose a new training regime for faster model convergence
by extracting more information from a given meta-learning episode with
negligible extra computation. We evaluate the proposed techniques on VoxCeleb,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) models are one of the most frequently
used deep learning networks, and extensively used in both academia and
industry. Recent studies demonstrated that adversarial attacks against such
models can maintain their effectiveness even when used on models other than the
one targeted by the attacker. This major property is known as transferability,
and makes CNNs ill-suited for security applications. In this paper, we provide
the first comprehensive study which assesses the robustness of CNN-based models
for computer networks against adversarial transferability. Furthermore, we
investigate whether the transferability property issue holds in computer
networks applications. In our experiments, we first consider five different
attacks: the Iterative Fast Gradient Method (I-FGSM), the Jacobian-based
Saliency Map (JSMA), the Limited-memory Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shanno BFGS
(L- BFGS), the Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), and the DeepFool attack. Then,
we perform these attacks against three well- known datasets: the Network-based
Detection of IoT (N-BaIoT) dataset, the Domain Generating Algorithms (DGA)
dataset, and the RIPE Atlas dataset. Our experimental results show clearly that
the transferability happens in specific use cases for the I- FGSM, the JSMA,
and the LBFGS attack. In such scenarios, the attack success rate on the target
network range from 63.00% to 100%. Finally, we suggest two shielding strategies
to hinder the attack transferability, by considering the Most Powerful Attacks
(MPAs), and the mismatch LSTM architecture.]]></summary>

diversified applications that demand real-time interaction. However, due to the
mobility of the end-users and the dynamic edge environment, it becomes
challenging to handle the task offloading with high performance. Moreover,
since each application in mobile devices has different characteristics, a task
orchestrator must be adaptive and have the ability to learn the dynamics of the
environment. For this purpose, we develop a deep reinforcement learning based
task orchestrator, DeepEdge, which learns to meet different task requirements
without needing human interaction even under the heavily-loaded stochastic
network conditions in terms of mobile users and applications. Given the dynamic
offloading requests and time-varying communication conditions, we successfully
model the problem as a Markov process and then apply the Double Deep Q-Network
(DDQN) algorithm to implement DeepEdge. To evaluate the robustness of DeepEdge,
we experiment with four different applications including image rendering,
infotainment, pervasive health, and augmented reality in the network under
various loads. Furthermore, we compare the performance of our agent with the
four different task offloading approaches in the literature. Our results show
that DeepEdge outperforms its competitors in terms of the percentage of

(MDP) optimization, is a important challenge in artificial intelligence. Two
key approaches to this problem are reinforcement learning (RL) and planning.
This paper presents a survey of the integration of both fields, better known as
model-based reinforcement learning. Model-based RL has two main steps. First,
we systematically cover approaches to dynamics model learning, including
challenges like dealing with stochasticity, uncertainty, partial observability,
and temporal abstraction. Second, we present a systematic categorization of
planning-learning integration, including aspects like: where to start planning,
what budgets to allocate to planning and real data collection, how to plan, and
how to integrate planning in the learning and acting loop. After these two
sections, we also discuss implicit model-based RL as an end-to-end alternative
for model learning and planning, and we cover the potential benefits of
model-based RL. Along the way, the survey also draws connections to several
related RL fields, like hierarchical RL and transfer learning. Altogether, the
survey presents a broad conceptual overview of the combination of planning and
learning for MDP optimization.]]></summary>

editing. To address its core challenge of attribute decoupling in a single
latent space, attempts have been made to adopt dual-space GAN for better
disentanglement of style and content representations. Nonetheless, these
methods are still incompetent to obtain plausible editing results with high
controllability, especially for complicated attributes. In this study, we
highlight the importance of interaction in a dual-space GAN for more
controllable editing. We propose TransEditor, a novel Transformer-based
framework to enhance such interaction. Besides, we develop a new dual-space
editing and inversion strategy to provide additional editing flexibility.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework in
image quality and editing capability, suggesting the effectiveness of
TransEditor for highly controllable facial editing.]]></summary>

representing high-dimensional distributions with structure. Recent years have
also seen big advances in designing multi-item mechanisms. Akin to overfitting,
however, these mechanisms can be extremely sensitive to the Bayesian prior that
they target, which becomes problematic when that prior is only approximately
known. At the same time, even if access to the exact Bayesian prior is given,
it is known that optimal or even approximately optimal multi-item mechanisms
run into sample, computational, representation and communication intractability
barriers.

We consider a natural class of multi-item mechanism design problems with very
large numbers of items, but where the bidders' value distributions can be
well-approximated by a topic model akin to those used in recommendation systems
with very large numbers of possible recommendations. We propose a mechanism
design framework for this setting, building on a recent robustification
framework by Brustle et al., which disentangles the statistical challenge of
estimating a multi-dimensional prior from the task of designing a good
mechanism for it, and robustifies the performance of the latter against the
estimation error of the former. We provide an extension of this framework
appropriate for our setting, which allows us to exploit the expressive power of
topic models to reduce the effective dimensionality of the mechanism design
problem and remove the dependence of its computational, communication and
representation complexity on the number of items.]]></summary>

sensitive nature of users' private data raises another challenge for sentiment

the heterogeneous semantics across multiple parties and the peculiarities of
word embedding, we pertinently provide corresponding solutions. First, we

better model aggregation and personalization in federated sentiment

approach to identify a sub-collection of features that ensure the fairness of
the dataset by performing conditional independence tests between different
subsets of features. We use group testing to improve the complexity of the
approach. We theoretically prove the correctness of the proposed algorithm to

conditional independence tests are sufficient to identify these variables. A

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi-agent reinforcement learning has made substantial empirical progresses
in solving games with a large number of players. However, theoretically, the
best known sample complexity for finding a Nash equilibrium in general-sum
games scales exponentially in the number of players due to the size of the
joint action space, and there is a matching exponential lower bound. This paper
investigates what learning goals admit better sample complexities in the
setting of $m$-player general-sum Markov games with $H$ steps, $S$ states, and
$A_i$ actions per player. First, we design algorithms for learning an
$\epsilon$-Coarse Correlated Equilibrium (CCE) in
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^5S\max_{i\le m} A_i / \epsilon^2)$ episodes, and an
$\epsilon$-Correlated Equilibrium (CE) in
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^6S\max_{i\le m} A_i^2 / \epsilon^2)$ episodes. This
is the first line of results for learning CCE and CE with sample complexities
polynomial in $\max_{i\le m} A_i$. Our algorithm for learning CE integrates an
adversarial bandit subroutine which minimizes a weighted swap regret, along
with several novel designs in the outer loop. Second, we consider the important
special case of Markov Potential Games, and design an algorithm that learns an
$\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibrium within
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(S\sum_{i\le m} A_i / \epsilon^3)$ episodes (when only
highlighting the dependence on $S$, $A_i$, and $\epsilon$), which only depends
linearly in $\sum_{i\le m} A_i$ and significantly improves over existing
efficient algorithm in the $\epsilon$ dependence. Overall, our results shed
light on what equilibria or structural assumptions on the game may enable
sample-efficient learning with many players.]]></summary>

recently emerge as a scalable alternative to reinforcement learning (RL)
approaches such as Q-learning or policy gradient, and are much faster when many
central processing units (CPUs) are available due to better parallelization. In
this paper, we propose a systematic incremental learning method for ES in
dynamic environments. The goal is to adjust previously learned policy to a new
one incrementally whenever the environment changes. We incorporate an instance
weighting mechanism with ES to facilitate its learning adaptation, while
retaining scalability of ES. During parameter updating, higher weights are
assigned to instances that contain more new knowledge, thus encouraging the
search distribution to move towards new promising areas of parameter space. We
propose two easy-to-implement metrics to calculate the weights: instance
novelty and instance quality. Instance novelty measures an instance's
difference from the previous optimum in the original environment, while
instance quality corresponds to how well an instance performs in the new
environment. The resulting algorithm, Instance Weighted Incremental Evolution
Strategies (IW-IES), is verified to achieve significantly improved performance
on challenging RL tasks ranging from robot navigation to locomotion. This paper
thus introduces a family of scalable ES algorithms for RL domains that enables
rapid learning adaptation to dynamic environments.]]></summary>

phenomenon is known as catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we look at TTS
modeling from a continual learning perspective, where the goal is to add new

experimental setup and show that serial fine-tuning for new speakers can cause
the forgetting of the earlier speakers. Then we exploit two well-known
techniques for continual learning, namely experience replay and weight
regularization. We reveal how one can mitigate the effect of degradation in
speech synthesis diversity in sequential training of new speakers using these

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A substantial body of empirical work documents the lack of robustness in deep
learning models to adversarial examples. Recent theoretical work proved that
adversarial examples are ubiquitous in two-layers networks with sub-exponential
width and ReLU or smooth activations, and multi-layer ReLU networks with
sub-exponential width. We present a result of the same type, with no
restriction on width and for general locally Lipschitz continuous activations.

More precisely, given a neural network $f(\,\cdot\,;{\boldsymbol \theta})$
with random weights ${\boldsymbol \theta}$, and feature vector ${\boldsymbol
x}$, we show that an adversarial example ${\boldsymbol x}'$ can be found with
high probability along the direction of the gradient $\nabla_{{\boldsymbol
x}}f({\boldsymbol x};{\boldsymbol \theta})$. Our proof is based on a Gaussian
conditioning technique. Instead of proving that $f$ is approximately linear in
a neighborhood of ${\boldsymbol x}$, we characterize the joint distribution of
$f({\boldsymbol x};{\boldsymbol \theta})$ and $f({\boldsymbol x}';{\boldsymbol
\theta})$ for ${\boldsymbol x}' = {\boldsymbol x}-s({\boldsymbol
x})\nabla_{{\boldsymbol x}}f({\boldsymbol x};{\boldsymbol \theta})$.]]></summary>

NLP field, but also vision and multimodal systems. However, although
visualization and interpretability tools have become available for NLP models,
internal mechanisms of vision and multimodal transformers remain largely
opaque. With the success of these transformers, it is increasingly critical to
understand their inner workings, as unraveling these black-boxes will lead to
more capable and trustworthy models. To contribute to this quest, we propose
VL-InterpreT, which provides novel interactive visualizations for interpreting
the attentions and hidden representations in multimodal transformers.
VL-InterpreT is a task agnostic and integrated tool that (1) tracks a variety
of statistics in attention heads throughout all layers for both vision and
language components, (2) visualizes cross-modal and intra-modal attentions
through easily readable heatmaps, and (3) plots the hidden representations of
vision and language tokens as they pass through the transformer layers. In this
paper, we demonstrate the functionalities of VL-InterpreT through the analysis
of KD-VLP, an end-to-end pretraining vision-language multimodal
transformer-based model, in the tasks of Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) and
WebQA, two visual question answering benchmarks. Furthermore, we also present a
few interesting findings about multimodal transformer behaviors that were
learned through our tool.]]></summary>

in addressing the challenge of climate change. One of the drawbacks of
wind-generated energy is the large space necessary to install a wind farm; this
arises from the fact that placing wind turbines in a limited area would hinder
their productivity and therefore not be economically convenient. This naturally
leads to an optimisation problem, which has three specific challenges: (1)
multiple conflicting objectives (2) computationally expensive simulation models
and (3) optimisation over design sets instead of design vectors. The first and
second challenges can be addressed by using surrogate-assisted e.g.\ Bayesian
multi-objective optimisation. However, the traditional Bayesian optimisation
cannot be applied as the optimisation function in the problem relies on design
sets instead of design vectors. This paper extends the applicability of
Bayesian multi-objective optimisation to set based optimisation for solving the
wind farm layout problem. We use a set-based kernel in Gaussian process to
quantify the correlation between wind farms (with a different number of
turbines). The results on the given data set of wind energy and direction
clearly show the potential of using set-based Bayesian multi-objective
optimisation.]]></summary>

identically distributed (i.i.d.) data. However, the performance of neural
networks often degenerates drastically when encountering out-of-distribution
(OoD) data, i.e., when training and test data are sampled from different
distributions. While a plethora of algorithms have been proposed for OoD
generalization, our understanding of the data used to train and evaluate these
algorithms remains stagnant. In this work, we first identify and measure two
distinct kinds of distribution shifts that are ubiquitous in various datasets.
Next, through extensive experiments, we compare OoD generalization algorithms
across two groups of benchmarks, each dominated by one of the distribution
shifts, revealing their strengths on one shift as well as limitations on the
other shift. Overall, we position existing datasets and algorithms from
different research areas seemingly unconnected into the same coherent picture.
It may serve as a foothold that can be resorted to by future OoD generalization
research. Our code is available at https://github.com/ynysjtu/ood_bench.]]></summary>

making deepfake detection a much-needed area of research. While researchers
have presented various techniques for detecting audio spoofs, it is often
unclear exactly why these architectures are successful: Preprocessing steps,
hyperparameter settings, and the degree of fine-tuning are not consistent
across related work. Which factors contribute to success, and which are
accidental? In this work, we address this problem: We systematize audio
spoofing detection by re-implementing and uniformly evaluating architectures
from related work. We identify overarching features for successful audio
deepfake detection, such as using cqtspec or logspec features instead of
melspec features, which improves performance by 37% EER on average, all other
factors constant. Additionally, we evaluate generalization capabilities: We
collect and publish a new dataset consisting of 37.9 hours of found audio
recordings of celebrities and politicians, of which 17.2 hours are deepfakes.
We find that related work performs poorly on such real-world data (performance
degradation of up to one thousand percent). This may suggest that the community
has tailored its solutions too closely to the prevailing ASVSpoof benchmark and
that deepfakes are much harder to detect outside the lab than previously
thought.]]></summary>

(sEMG) signals has recently shown significant potential for development of
advanced myoelectric-controlled prosthesis. Existing deep learning approaches,
typically, include only one model as such can hardly maintain acceptable
generalization performance in changing scenarios. In this paper, we aim to
address this challenge by capitalizing on the recent advances of hybrid models
and transformers. In other words, we propose a hybrid framework based on the
transformer architecture, which is a relatively new and revolutionizing deep
learning model. The proposed hybrid architecture, referred to as the
Transformer for Hand Gesture Recognition (TraHGR), consists of two parallel
paths followed by a linear layer that acts as a fusion center to integrate the
advantage of each module and provide robustness over different scenarios. We
evaluated the proposed architecture TraHGR based on the commonly used second
Ninapro dataset, referred to as the DB2. The sEMG signals in the DB2 dataset
are measured in the real-life conditions from 40 healthy users, each performing
49 gestures. We have conducted extensive set of experiments to test and
validate the proposed TraHGR architecture, and have compared its achievable
accuracy with more than five recently proposed HGR classification algorithms
over the same dataset. We have also compared the results of the proposed TraHGR
architecture with each individual path and demonstrated the distinguishing
power of the proposed hybrid architecture. The recognition accuracies of the
proposed TraHGR architecture are 86.18%, 88.91%, 81.44%, and 93.84%, which are
2.48%, 5.12%, 8.82%, and 4.30% higher than the state-ofthe-art performance for
DB2 (49 gestures), DB2-B (17 gestures), DB2-C (23 gestures), and DB2-D (9

6D pose and a grasp reference, our goal is to generate motions that move the
object to a target 6D pose. This is challenging, because it requires reasoning
about the complex articulation of the human hand and the intricate physical
interaction with the object. We propose a novel method that frames this problem
in the reinforcement learning framework and leverages a physics simulation,
both to learn and to evaluate such dynamic interactions. A hierarchical
approach decomposes the task into low-level grasping and high-level motion
synthesis. It can be used to generate novel hand sequences that approach,
grasp, and move an object to a desired location, while retaining

achieve promising performance via end-to-end phoneme recognition. One challenge
of such end-to-end solutions is the scarcity of human-annotated phonemes on
natural L2 speech. In this work, we leverage unlabeled L2 speech via a
pseudo-labeling (PL) procedure and extend the fine-tuning approach based on
pre-trained self-supervised learning (SSL) models. Specifically, we use Wav2vec
2.0 as our SSL model, and fine-tune it using original labeled L2 speech samples
plus the created pseudo-labeled L2 speech samples. Our pseudo labels are
dynamic and are produced by an ensemble of the online model on-the-fly, which
ensures that our model is robust to pseudo label noise. We show that
fine-tuning with pseudo labels gains a 5.35% phoneme error rate reduction and
2.48% MDD F1 score improvement over a labeled-samples-only fine-tuning
baseline. The proposed PL method is also shown to outperform conventional
offline PL methods. Compared to the state-of-the-art MDD systems, our MDD
solution achieves a more accurate and consistent phonetic error diagnosis. In
addition, we conduct an open test on a separate UTD-4Accents dataset, where our
system recognition outputs show a strong correlation with human perception,

data; hence, label noise is inevitable. Training with such noisy data
negatively impacts the generalization performance of deep neural networks. To
combat label noise, recent state-of-the-art methods employ some sort of sample
selection mechanism to select a possibly clean subset of data. Next, an
off-the-shelf semi-supervised learning method is used for training where
rejected samples are treated as unlabeled data. Our comprehensive analysis
shows that current selection methods disproportionately select samples from
easy (fast learnable) classes while rejecting those from relatively harder
ones. This creates class imbalance in the selected clean set and in turn,
deteriorates performance under high label noise. In this work, we propose
UNICON, a simple yet effective sample selection method which is robust to high
label noise. To address the disproportionate selection of easy and hard
samples, we introduce a Jensen-Shannon divergence based uniform selection
mechanism which does not require any probabilistic modeling and hyperparameter
tuning. We complement our selection method with contrastive learning to further
combat the memorization of noisy labels. Extensive experimentation on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of UNICON; we obtain an 11.4%
improvement over the current state-of-the-art on CIFAR100 dataset with a 90%
noise rate. Our code is publicly available]]></summary>

focus on bad-classified examples and ignore well-classified examples that are
far from the decision boundary. For instance, when training with cross-entropy
loss, examples with higher likelihoods (i.e., well-classified examples)
contribute smaller gradients in back-propagation. However, we theoretically
show that this common practice hinders representation learning, energy
optimization, and margin growth. To counteract this deficiency, we propose to
reward well-classified examples with additive bonuses to revive their
contribution to the learning process. This counterexample theoretically
addresses these three issues. We empirically support this claim by directly
verifying the theoretical results or significant performance improvement with
our counterexample on diverse tasks, including image classification, graph
classification, and machine translation. Furthermore, this paper shows that we
can deal with complex scenarios, such as imbalanced classification, OOD
detection, and applications under adversarial attacks because our idea can
solve these three issues. Code is available at:

target speakers are explicitly modeled. Second, threshold selection is no
longer needed. Through this formulation, we propose the speaker embedding-aware
neural diarization (SEND) framework, where a speech encoder, a speaker encoder,
two similarity scorers, and a post-processing network are jointly optimized to
predict the encoded labels according to the similarities between speech
features and speaker embeddings. Experimental results show that SEND has a
stable learning process and can be trained on highly overlapped data without

perception. These two problems, however, are largely studied in isolation by
the community. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end approach for detection
and motion forecasting based on raw sensor measurement as opposed to ground
truth tracks. Instead of predicting the current frame locations and forecasting
forward in time, we directly predict future object locations and backcast to
determine where each trajectory began. Our approach not only improves overall
accuracy compared to other modular or end-to-end baselines, it also prompts us
to rethink the role of explicit tracking for embodied perception. Additionally,
by linking future and current locations in a many-to-one manner, our approach
is able to reason about multiple futures, a capability that was previously
considered difficult for end-to-end approaches. We conduct extensive
experiments on the popular nuScenes dataset and demonstrate the empirical
effectiveness of our approach. In addition, we investigate the appropriateness
of reusing standard forecasting metrics for an end-to-end setup, and find a
number of limitations which allow us to build simple baselines to game these
metrics. We address this issue with a novel set of joint forecasting and
detection metrics that extend the commonly used AP metrics from the detection
community to measuring forecasting accuracy. Our code is available at

policy in data-driven optimization.Our approach exploits the optimization
problem's sensitivity analysis to estimate the gradient of the optimal
objective value with respect to the amount of noise in the data and uses the
estimated gradient to debias the policy's in-sample performance. Unlike
cross-validation techniques, our approach avoids sacrificing data for a test
set, utilizes all data when training and, hence, is well-suited to settings
where data are scarce. We prove bounds on the bias and variance of our
estimator for optimization problems with uncertain linear objectives but known,
potentially non-convex, feasible regions. For more specialized optimization
problems where the feasible region is "weakly-coupled" in a certain sense, we
prove stronger results. Specifically, we provide explicit high-probability
bounds on the error of our estimator that hold uniformly over a policy class
and depends on the problem's dimension and policy class's complexity. Our
bounds show that under mild conditions, the error of our estimator vanishes as
the dimension of the optimization problem grows, even if the amount of
available data remains small and constant. Said differently, we prove our
estimator performs well in the small-data, large-scale regime. Finally, we

approaches may face challenges for discovering repeated geographic patterns
with spatial contiguity maintained. In this paper, we propose a Spatial
Toeplitz Inverse Covariance-Based Clustering (STICC) method that considers both
attributes and spatial relationships of geographic objects for multivariate
spatial clustering. A subregion is created for each geographic object serving
as the basic unit when performing clustering. A Markov random field is then
constructed to characterize the attribute dependencies of subregions. Using a
spatial consistency strategy, nearby objects are encouraged to belong to the
same cluster. To test the performance of the proposed STICC algorithm, we apply
it in two use cases. The comparison results with several baseline methods show
that the STICC outperforms others significantly in terms of adjusted rand index
and macro-F1 score. Join count statistics is also calculated and shows that the
spatial contiguity is well preserved by STICC. Such a spatial clustering method
may benefit various applications in the fields of geography, remote sensing,
transportation, and urban planning, etc.]]></summary>

traditional algorithms, thanks to the ability of neural networks to learn
complex patterns. However, in two-class classification tasks like anomaly or
fraud detection, unsupervised methods could do even better, because their
prediction is not limited to previously learned types of anomalies. An
intuitive approach of anomaly detection can be based on the distances from the
centers of mass of the two respective classes. Autoencoders, although trained
without supervision, can also detect anomalies: considering the center of mass
of the normal points, reconstructions have now radii, with largest radii most
likely indicating anomalous points. Of course, radii-based classification were
already possible without interposing an autoencoder. In any space, radial
classification can be operated, to some extent. In order to outperform it, we
proceed to radial deformations of data (i.e. centric compression or expansions
of axes) and autoencoder training. Any autoencoder that makes use of a data
center is here baptized a centric autoencoder (cAE). A special type is the cAE
trained with a uniformly compressed dataset, named the centripetal autoencoder
(cpAE). The new concept is studied here in relation with a schematic artificial
dataset, and the derived methods show consistent score improvements. But tested
on real banking data, our radial deformation supervised algorithms alone still
perform better that cAEs, as expected from most supervised methods;
nonetheless, in hybrid approaches, cAEs can be combined with a radial
deformation of space, improving its classification score. We expect that
centric autoencoders will become irreplaceable objects in anomaly live
detection based on geometry, thanks to their ability to stem naturally on
geometrical algorithms and to their native capability of detecting unknown
anomaly types.]]></summary>

wireless setting is considered here. In our setup, the available limited

heterogeneous traffic, another major challenge stems from random service rates
due to time-varying wireless communication channels. Various approaches for

heuristics and constrained optimization to combinatorics. Those methods are
tailored to specific network or application configuration and are usually
suboptimal. To this purpose, we resort to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and

in deep representation learning due to the data scarcity issues such as data
imbalance, unseen distribution, and domain shift. To address the
above-mentioned issues, a variety of methods have been devised to explore the
sample relationships in a vanilla way (i.e., from the perspectives of either
the input or the loss function), failing to explore the internal structure of
deep neural networks for learning with sample relationships. Inspired by this,
we propose to enable deep neural networks themselves with the ability to learn
the sample relationships from each mini-batch. Specifically, we introduce a
batch transformer module or BatchFormer, which is then applied into the batch
dimension of each mini-batch to implicitly explore sample relationships during
training. By doing this, the proposed method enables the collaboration of
different samples, e.g., the head-class samples can also contribute to the
learning of the tail classes for long-tailed recognition. Furthermore, to
mitigate the gap between training and testing, we share the classifier between
with or without the BatchFormer during training, which can thus be removed
during testing. We perform extensive experiments on over ten datasets and the
proposed method achieves significant improvements on different data scarcity
applications without any bells and whistles, including the tasks of long-tailed
recognition, compositional zero-shot learning, domain generalization, and
contrastive learning. Code will be made publicly available at

compositional generalisation. Whether neural networks exhibit this ability is
usually studied by training models on highly compositional synthetic data.
However, compositionality in natural language is much more complex than the
rigid, arithmetic-like version such data adheres to, and artificial
compositionality tests thus do not allow us to determine how neural models deal
with more realistic forms of compositionality. In this work, we re-instantiate
three compositionality tests from the literature and reformulate them for
neural machine translation (NMT). Our results highlight that: i) unfavourably,
models trained on more data are more compositional; ii) models are sometimes
less compositional than expected, but sometimes more, exemplifying that
different levels of compositionality are required, and models are not always
able to modulate between them correctly; iii) some of the non-compositional
behaviours are mistakes, whereas others reflect the natural variation in data.
Apart from an empirical study, our work is a call to action: we should rethink
the evaluation of compositionality in neural networks and develop benchmarks
using real data to evaluate compositionality on natural language, where
composing meaning is not as straightforward as doing the math.]]></summary>

task-specific architectures and training objectives. As a result, it is hard to
transfer the learned knowledge and representations from one task to another,
thus restricting the generalization ability of existing recommendation
approaches, e.g., a sequential recommendation model can hardly be applied or
transferred to a review generation method. To deal with such issues,
considering that language grounding is a powerful medium to describe and
represent various problems or tasks, we present a flexible and unified
text-to-text paradigm called "Pretrain, Personalized Prompt, and Predict
Paradigm" (P5) for recommendation, which unifies various recommendation tasks
in a shared framework. In P5, all data such as user-item interactions, item
metadata, and user reviews are converted to a common format -- natural language
sequences. The rich information from natural language assist P5 to capture
deeper semantics for recommendation. P5 learns different tasks with the same
language modeling objective during pretraining. Thus, it possesses the
potential to serve as the foundation model for downstream recommendation tasks,
allows easy integration with other modalities, and enables instruction-based
recommendation, which will revolutionize the technical form of recommender
system towards universal recommendation engine. With adaptive personalized
prompt for different users, P5 is able to make predictions in a zero-shot or
few-shot manner and largely reduces the necessity for extensive fine-tuning. On
several recommendation benchmarks, we conduct experiments to show the
effectiveness of our generative approach. We will release our prompts and
pretrained P5 language model to help advance future research on Recommendation

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shape implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently shown to be
effective in shape analysis and reconstruction tasks. Existing INRs require
point coordinates to learn the implicit level sets of the shape. When a normal
vector is available for each point, a higher fidelity representation can be
learned, however normal vectors are often not provided as raw data.
Furthermore, the method's initialization has been shown to play a crucial role
for surface reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a divergence guided shape
representation learning approach that does not require normal vectors as input.
We show that incorporating a soft constraint on the divergence of the distance
function favours smooth solutions that reliably orients gradients to match the
unknown normal at each point, in some cases even better than approaches that
use ground truth normal vectors directly. Additionally, we introduce a novel
geometric initialization method for sinusoidal INRs that further improves
convergence to the desired solution. We evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach on the task of surface reconstruction and shape space learning and
show SOTA performance compared to other unoriented methods. Code and model

objects using tools. Previous works have shown that differentiable physics
simulators provide gradients to the environment state and help trajectory
optimization to converge orders of magnitude faster than model-free
reinforcement learning algorithms for deformable object manipulation. However,
such gradient-based trajectory optimization typically requires access to the
full simulator states and can only solve short-horizon, single-skill tasks due
to local optima. In this work, we propose a novel framework, named DiffSkill,
that uses a differentiable physics simulator for skill abstraction to solve
long-horizon deformable object manipulation tasks from sensory observations. In
particular, we first obtain short-horizon skills using individual tools from a
gradient-based optimizer, using the full state information in a differentiable
simulator; we then learn a neural skill abstractor from the demonstration
trajectories which takes RGBD images as input. Finally, we plan over the skills
by finding the intermediate goals and then solve long-horizon tasks. We show
the advantages of our method in a new set of sequential deformable object
manipulation tasks compared to previous reinforcement learning algorithms and
compared to the trajectory optimizer.]]></summary>

drawn from a distribution similar to that of the training set. However, DNNs'
predictions are brittle and unreliable when the test samples are drawn from a
dissimilar distribution. This is a major concern for deployment in real-world
applications, where such behavior may come at a considerable cost, such as
industrial production lines, autonomous vehicles, or healthcare applications.
Contributions. We frame Out Of Distribution (OOD) detection in DNNs as a
statistical hypothesis testing problem. Tests generated within our proposed
framework combine evidence from the entire network. Unlike previous OOD
detection heuristics, this framework returns a $p$-value for each test sample.
It is guaranteed to maintain the Type I Error (T1E - incorrectly predicting OOD
for an actual in-distribution sample) for test data. Moreover, this allows to
combine several detectors while maintaining the T1E. Building on this
framework, we suggest a novel OOD procedure based on low-order statistics. Our
method achieves comparable or better results than state-of-the-art methods on
well-accepted OOD benchmarks, without retraining the network parameters or
assuming prior knowledge on the test distribution -- and at a fraction of the
computational cost.]]></summary>

weighted programs. We present several case studies. For instance, we use
weighted programming to model the ski rental problem - an optimization problem.
We model not only the optimization problem itself, but also the best

making domains such as education, employment and driving automation. The
continued success of ML largely depends on our ability to trust the model we
are using. Recently, a new class of attacks called Backdoor Attacks have been
developed. These attacks undermine the user's trust in ML models. In this work,
we present NEO, a model agnostic framework to detect and mitigate such backdoor
attacks in image classification ML models. For a given image classification
model, our approach analyses the inputs it receives and determines if the model
is backdoored. In addition to this feature, we also mitigate these attacks by
determining the correct predictions of the poisoned images. An appealing
feature of NEO is that it can, for the first time, isolate and reconstruct the
backdoor trigger. NEO is also the first defence methodology, to the best of our
knowledge that is completely blackbox.

We have implemented NEO and evaluated it against three state of the art
poisoned models. These models include highly critical applications such as
traffic sign detection (USTS) and facial detection. In our evaluation, we show
that NEO can detect $\approx$88% of the poisoned inputs on average and it is as
fast as 4.4 ms per input image. We also reconstruct the poisoned input for the
user to effectively test their systems.]]></summary>

irregular glottal opening and low pitch. It occurs in diverse languages and is
prevalent in American English, where it is used not only to mark phrase
finality, but also sociolinguistic factors and affect. Due to its irregular
periodicity, creaky voice challenges automatic speech processing and
recognition systems, particularly for languages where creak is frequently used.

This paper proposes a deep learning model to detect creaky voice in fluent
speech. The model is composed of an encoder and a classifier trained together.
The encoder takes the raw waveform and learns a representation using a
convolutional neural network. The classifier is implemented as a multi-headed
fully-connected network trained to detect creaky voice, voicing, and pitch,
where the last two are used to refine creak prediction. The model is trained
and tested on speech of American English speakers, annotated for creak by

constructed by an embodied agent navigating within a space, where objects and
their relationships are modeled by continuous valued embeddings. Our method
captures feature relationships between objects, composes them into a graph

Our key insight is to embed pair-wise relationships between objects in a latent
space. This allows for a richer representation compared to discrete relations
(e.g., [support], [next-to]) commonly used for building scene representations.
CSR can track objects as the agent moves in a scene, update the representation
accordingly, and detect changes in room configurations. Using CSR, we
outperform state-of-the-art approaches for the challenging downstream task of
visual room rearrangement, without any task specific training. Moreover, we
show the learned embeddings capture salient spatial details of the scene and
show applicability to real world data. A summery video and code is available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We initiate a study of supervised learning from many independent sequences
("trajectories") of non-independent covariates, reflecting tasks in sequence
modeling, control, and reinforcement learning. Conceptually, our
multi-trajectory setup sits between two traditional settings in statistical
learning theory: learning from independent examples and learning from a single
auto-correlated sequence. Our conditions for efficient learning generalize the
former setting--trajectories must be non-degenerate in ways that extend
standard requirements for independent examples. They do not require that
trajectories be ergodic, long, nor strictly stable.

For linear least-squares regression, given $n$-dimensional examples produced
by $m$ trajectories, each of length $T$, we observe a notable change in
statistical efficiency as the number of trajectories increases from a few
(namely $m \lesssim n$) to many (namely $m \gtrsim n$). Specifically, we
establish that the worst-case error rate this problem is $\Theta(n / m T)$
whenever $m \gtrsim n$. Meanwhile, when $m \lesssim n$, we establish a (sharp)
lower bound of $\Omega(n^2 / m^2 T)$ on the worst-case error rate, realized by
a simple, marginally unstable linear dynamical system. A key upshot is that, in
domains where trajectories regularly reset, the error rate eventually behaves
as if all of the examples were independent altogether, drawn from their
marginals. As a corollary of our analysis, we also improve guarantees for the
linear system identification problem.]]></summary>

their repositories. An issue is a rich source of software information that
contains different reports including a problem, a request for new features, or
merely a question about the software product. As the number of these issues
increases, it becomes harder to manage them manually. Thus, automatic
approaches are proposed to help facilitate the management of issue reports.

This paper describes CatIss, an automatic CATegorizer of ISSue reports which
is built upon the Transformer-based pre-trained RoBERTa model. CatIss
classifies issue reports into three main categories of Bug reports,
Enhancement/feature requests, and Questions. First, the datasets provided for
the NLBSE tool competition are cleaned and preprocessed. Then, the pre-trained
RoBERTa model is fine-tuned on the preprocessed dataset. Evaluating CatIss on
about 80 thousand issue reports from GitHub, indicates that it performs very
well surpassing the competition baseline, TicketTagger, and achieving 87.2%
F1-score (micro average). Additionally, as CatIss is trained on a wide set of
repositories, it is a generic prediction model, hence applicable for any unseen
software project or projects with little historical data. Scripts for cleaning
the datasets, training CatIss, and evaluating the model are publicly available.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To ease the burden of labeling, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to
transfer knowledge in previous and related labeled datasets (sources) to a new
unlabeled dataset (target). Despite impressive progress, prior methods always
need to access the raw source data and develop data-dependent alignment
approaches to recognize the target samples in a transductive learning manner,
which may raise privacy concerns from source individuals. Several recent
studies resort to an alternative solution by exploiting the well-trained
white-box model from the source domain, yet, it may still leak the raw data
through generative adversarial learning. This paper studies a practical and
interesting setting for UDA, where only black-box source models (i.e., only
network predictions are available) are provided during adaptation in the target
domain. To solve this problem, we propose a new two-step knowledge adaptation
framework called DIstill and fine-tuNE (DINE). Taking into consideration the
target data structure, DINE first distills the knowledge from the source
predictor to a customized target model, then fine-tunes the distilled model to
further fit the target domain. Besides, neural networks are not required to be
identical across domains in DINE, even allowing effective adaptation on a
low-resource device. Empirical results on three UDA scenarios (i.e.,
single-source, multi-source, and partial-set) confirm that DINE achieves highly
competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art data-dependent approaches.

monotone operators, which may be nonlinear), despite the lack of a spectral gap
in the NTK, we then prove that the limit neural network, which satisfies the
infinite-dimensional ODE, converges in $L^2$ to the PDE solution as the
training time $\rightarrow \infty$. More generally, we can prove that any fixed

of classification due to high quantization errors. Interestingly, however, we
observe that the quantization could provide comparable and often superior

a firm operating an algorithmic system, such as a digital content
recommendation platform, to steer a population. We relate performative power to
the economic theory of market power. Traditional economic concepts are well
known to struggle with identifying anti-competitive patterns in digital
platforms--a core challenge is the difficulty of defining the market, its
participants, products, and prices. Performative power sidesteps the problem of
market definition by focusing on a directly observable statistical measure
instead. High performative power enables a platform to profit from steering
participant behavior, whereas low performative power ensures that learning from
historical data is close to optimal.

Our first general result shows that under low performative power, a firm
cannot do better than standard supervised learning on observed data. We draw an
analogy with a firm being a price-taker, an economic condition that arises
under perfect competition in classical market models. We then contrast this
with a market where performative power is concentrated and show that the
equilibrium state can differ significantly. We go on to study performative
power in a concrete setting of strategic classification where participants can
switch between competing firms. We show that monopolies maximize performative
power and disutility for the participant, while competition and outside options
decrease performative power. We end on a discussion of connections to measures
of market power in economics and of the relationship with ongoing antitrust
debates.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dealing with non-stationarity in environments (i.e., transition dynamics) and
objectives (i.e., reward functions) is a challenging problem that is crucial in
real-world applications of reinforcement learning (RL). Most existing
approaches only focus on families of stationary MDPs, in which the
non-stationarity is episodic, i.e., the change is only possible across
episodes. The few works that do consider non-stationarity without a specific
boundary, i.e., also allow for changes within an episode, model the changes
monolithically in a single shared embedding vector. In this paper, we propose
Factored Adaptation for Non-Stationary RL (FANS-RL), a factored adaption
approach that explicitly learns the individual latent change factors affecting
the transition dynamics and reward functions. FANS-RL learns jointly the
structure of a factored MDP and a factored representation of the time-varying
change factors, as well as the specific state components that they affect, via
a factored non-stationary variational autoencoder. Through this general
framework, we can consider general non-stationary scenarios with different
changing function types and changing frequency. Experimental results
demonstrate that FANS-RL outperforms existing approaches in terms of rewards,
compactness of the latent state representation and robustness to varying

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Continual learning describes a setting where machine learning models learn
novel concepts from continuously shifting training data, while simultaneously
avoiding degradation of knowledge on previously seen classes (a phenomenon
known as the catastrophic forgetting problem) which may disappear from the
training data for extended periods of time. Current approaches for continual
learning of a single expanding task (aka class-incremental continual learning)
require extensive rehearsal of previously seen data to avoid this degradation
of knowledge. Unfortunately, rehearsal comes at a sharp cost to memory and
computation, and it may also violate data-privacy. Instead, we explore
combining knowledge distillation and parameter regularization in new ways to
achieve strong continual learning performance without rehearsal. Specifically,
we take a deep dive into common continual learning techniques: prediction
distillation, feature distillation, L2 parameter regularization, and EWC
parameter regularization. We first disprove the common assumption that
parameter regularization techniques fail for rehearsal-free continual learning
of a single, expanding task. Next, we explore how to leverage knowledge from a
pre-trained model in rehearsal-free continual learning and find that vanilla L2
parameter regularization outperforms EWC parameter regularization and feature
distillation. We then highlight the impact of the rehearsal-free continual
learning settings with a classifier expansion benchmark, showing that a
strategy based on our findings combined with a positive/negative label
balancing heuristic can close the performance gap between the upper bound and
the existing strategies by up to roughly 50%. Finally, we show that a simple
method consisting of pre-training, L2 regularization, and prediction
distillation can even outperform rehearsal-based methods on the common
CIFAR-100 benchmark.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Schizophrenia is a severe mental health condition that requires a long and
complicated diagnostic process. However, early diagnosis is vital to control
symptoms. Deep learning has recently become a popular way to analyse and
interpret medical data. Past attempts to use deep learning for schizophrenia
diagnosis from brain-imaging data have shown promise but suffer from a large
training-application gap - it is difficult to apply lab research to the real
world. We propose to reduce this training-application gap by focusing on
readily accessible data. We collect a data set of psychiatric observations of
patients based on DSM-5 criteria. Because similar data is already recorded in
all mental health clinics that diagnose schizophrenia using DSM-5, our method
could be easily integrated into current processes as a tool to assist
clinicians, whilst abiding by formal diagnostic criteria. To facilitate
real-world usage of our system, we show that it is interpretable and robust.
Understanding how a machine learning tool reaches its diagnosis is essential to
allow clinicians to trust that diagnosis. To interpret the framework, we fuse
two complementary attention mechanisms, 'squeeze and excitation' and
'self-attention', to determine global attribute importance and attribute
interactivity, respectively. The model uses these importance scores to make
decisions. This allows clinicians to understand how a diagnosis was reached,
improving trust in the model. Because machine learning models often struggle to
generalise to data from different sources, we perform experiments with
augmented test data to evaluate the model's applicability to the real world. We
find that our model is more robust to perturbations, and should therefore
perform better in a clinical setting. It achieves 98% accuracy with 10-fold
cross-validation.]]></summary>

gathered particular attention for human computer interaction. Radar sensors
possess multiple intrinsic properties, such as their ability to work in low
illumination, harsh weather conditions, and being low-cost and compact, making
them highly preferable for a gesture recognition solution. However, most
literature work focuses on solutions with a limited range that is lower than a
meter. We propose a novel architecture for a long-range (1m - 2m) gesture
recognition solution that leverages a point cloud-based cross-learning approach
from camera point cloud to 60-GHz FMCW radar point cloud, which allows learning
better representations while suppressing noise. We use a variant of Dynamic
Graph CNN (DGCNN) for the cross-learning, enabling us to model relationships
between the points at a local and global level and to model the temporal
dynamics a Bi-LSTM network is employed. In the experimental results section, we
demonstrate our model's overall accuracy of 98.4% for five gestures and its
generalization capability.]]></summary>

variety of downstream tasks, these models have been observed to overfit to the
domain from which the unlabelled data originates. To alleviate this issue, we
propose PADA (Pruning Assisted Domain Adaptation) and zero out redundant
weights from models pre-trained on large amounts of out-of-domain (OOD) data.
Intuitively, this helps to make space for the target-domain ASR finetuning. The
redundant weights can be identified through various pruning strategies which
have been discussed in detail as a part of this work. Specifically, we
investigate the effect of the recently discovered Task-Agnostic and Task-Aware
pruning on PADA and propose a new pruning paradigm based on the latter, which
we call Cross-Domain Task-Aware Pruning (CD-TAW). CD-TAW obtains the initial
pruning mask from a well fine-tuned OOD model, which makes it starkly different
from the rest of the pruning strategies discussed in the paper. Our proposed
CD-TAW methodology achieves up to 20.6% relative WER improvement over our
baseline when fine-tuned on a 2-hour subset of Switchboard data without
language model (LM) decoding. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed analysis to
highlight the key design choices of our proposed method.]]></summary>

However, we often lack the ability to explain why a specific architecture
attains superior predictive accuracy for a given data set. Often, validation
accuracy is used as a performance heuristic quantifying how well a network
generalizes to unseen data, but it does not capture anything about the
information flow in the model. Mutual information can be used as a measure of
the quality of internal representations in deep learning models, and the
information plane may provide insights into whether the model exploits the
available information in the data. The information plane has previously been
explored for fully connected neural networks and convolutional architectures.
We present an architecture-agnostic method for tracking a network's internal
representations during training, which are then used to create the mutual
information plane. The method is exemplified for graph-based neural networks
fitted on citation data. We compare how the inductive bias introduced in
graph-based architectures changes the mutual information plane relative to a

are less likely to be examined - and thus clicked - by users, in spite of their
actual preferences between items. The prevalent approach to unbiased
click-based Learning-to-Rank (LTR) is based on counterfactual
Inverse-Propensity-Scoring (IPS) estimation. Unique about LTR is the fact that
standard Doubly-Robust (DR) estimation - which combines IPS with regression
predictions - is inapplicable since the treatment variable - indicating whether
a user examined an item - cannot be observed in the data. In this paper, we
introduce a novel DR estimator that uses the expectation of treatment per rank
instead. Our novel DR estimator has more robust unbiasedness conditions than
the existing IPS approach, and in addition, provides enormous decreases in
variance: our experimental results indicate it requires several orders of
magnitude fewer datapoints to converge at optimal performance. For the unbiased
LTR field, our DR estimator contributes both increases in state-of-the-art
performance and the most robust theoretical guarantees of all known LTR

approach to accelerating autoregressive translation with no quality loss,
through the collaboration of autoregressive and non-autoregressive translation
(NAT) of the Transformer. At each decoding iteration, GAD aggressively decodes
a number of tokens in parallel as a draft through NAT and then verifies them in
the autoregressive manner, where only the tokens that pass the verification are
kept as decoded tokens. GAD can achieve the same performance as autoregressive
translation but much more efficiently because both NAT drafting and
autoregressive verification are fast due to parallel computing. We conduct
experiments in the WMT14 English-German translation task and confirm that the
vanilla GAD yields exactly the same results as greedy decoding with an around
3x speedup, and that its variant (GAD++) with an advanced verification strategy
not only outperforms the greedy translation and even achieves the comparable
translation quality with the beam search result, but also further improves the
decoding speed, resulting in an around 5x speedup over autoregressive
translation. Our models and codes are available at

scaling up the size of training datasets and the number of parameters in the

the need to distribute computation on supercomputer clusters (e.g., TPUs),
prevent bottlenecks when infeeding data, and ensure reproducible results. In
this work, we present two software libraries that ease these issues:
$\texttt{t5x}$ simplifies the process of building and training large language
models at scale while maintaining ease of use, and $\texttt{seqio}$ provides a
task-based API for simple creation of fast and reproducible training data and
evaluation pipelines. These open-source libraries have been used to train
models with hundreds of billions of parameters on datasets with multiple
terabytes of training data.

Along with the libraries, we release configurations and instructions for
T5-like encoder-decoder models as well as GPT-like decoder-only architectures.

an offline clustering model. One is to predict the pseudo codes via masked
language modeling in encoder output, like HuBERT model, while the other lets
the decoder learn to reconstruct pseudo codes autoregressively instead of
generating textual scripts. In this way, the decoder learns to reconstruct
original speech information with codes before learning to generate correct
text. Comprehensive experiments on the LibriSpeech corpus show that the
proposed Speech2C can relatively reduce the word error rate (WER) by 19.2% over
the method without decoder pre-training, and also outperforms significantly the
state-of-the-art wav2vec 2.0 and HuBERT on fine-tuning subsets of 10h and 100h.]]></summary>

learn reusable locomotion skills for real legged robots. Our approach builds
upon previous work on imitating human or dog Motion Capture (MoCap) data to

for complex downstream tasks. Importantly, due to the prior imposed by the
MoCap data, our approach does not require extensive reward engineering to
produce sensible and natural looking behavior at the time of reuse. This makes
it easy to create well-regularized, task-oriented controllers that are suitable
for deployment on real robots. We demonstrate how our skill module can be used
for imitation, and train controllable walking and ball dribbling policies for
both the ANYmal quadruped and OP3 humanoid. These policies are then deployed on

implicit probabilistic models in discrete spaces, supporting distributions that
are practically infeasible to sample from using classical means. One of the
possible applications of such models, also known as Born machines, is
probabilistic inference, which is at the core of Bayesian methods. This paper
studies the use of Born machines for the problem of training binary Bayesian
neural networks. In the proposed approach, a Born machine is used to model the
variational distribution of the binary weights of the neural network, and data
from multiple tasks is used to reduce training data requirements on new tasks.
The method combines gradient-based meta-learning and variational inference via
Born machines, and is shown in a prototypical regression problem to outperform
conventional joint learning strategies.]]></summary>

neural networks can successfully predict future traffic conditions 1 hour into

reinterpreted the challenge of forecasting traffic conditions as a movie
completion task. U-Nets proved to be the winning architecture, demonstrating an
ability to extract relevant features in this complex real-world geo-spatial

on the question of model robustness and generalizability across time and space.
Moving from one city to an entirely different city, or moving from pre-COVID
times to times after COVID hit the world thus introduces a clear domain shift.
We thus, for the first time, release data featuring such domain shifts. The
competition now covers ten cities over 2 years, providing data compiled from
over 10^12 GPS probe data. Winning solutions captured traffic dynamics
sufficiently well to even cope with these complex domain shifts. Surprisingly,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent advances in neural text-to-speech research have been dominated by
two-stage pipelines utilizing low-level intermediate speech representation such
as mel-spectrograms. However, such predetermined features are fundamentally
limited, because they do not allow to exploit the full potential of a
data-driven approach through learning hidden representations. For this reason,
several end-to-end methods have been proposed. However, such models are harder
to train and require a large number of high-quality recordings with
transcriptions. Here, we propose WavThruVec - a two-stage architecture that
resolves the bottleneck by using high-dimensional Wav2Vec 2.0 embeddings as
intermediate speech representation. Since these hidden activations provide
high-level linguistic features, they are more robust to noise. That allows us
to utilize annotated speech datasets of a lower quality to train the
first-stage module. At the same time, the second-stage component can be trained
on large-scale untranscribed audio corpora, as Wav2Vec 2.0 embeddings are
time-aligned and speaker-independent. This results in an increased
generalization capability to out-of-vocabulary words, as well as to a better
generalization to unseen speakers. We show that the proposed model not only
matches the quality of state-of-the-art neural models, but also presents useful
properties enabling tasks like voice conversion or zero-shot synthesis.]]></summary>

task first proposed by Cui et al. (2021) in the Who's Waldo dataset. Given an
image and a caption, PCVG requires pairing up a person's name mentioned in a
caption with a bounding box that points to the person in the image. We find
that the original Who's Waldo dataset compiled for this task contains a large
number of biased samples that are solvable simply by heuristic methods; for
instance, in many cases the first name in the sentence corresponds to the
largest bounding box, or the sequence of names in the sentence corresponds to
an exact left-to-right order in the image. Naturally, models trained on these
biased data lead to over-estimation of performance on the benchmark. To enforce
models being correct for the correct reasons, we design automated tools to
filter and debias the original dataset by ruling out all examples of
insufficient context, such as those with no verb or with a long chain of
conjunct names in their captions. Our experiments show that our new sub-sampled
dataset contains less bias with much lowered heuristic performances and widened
gaps between heuristic and supervised methods. We also demonstrate the same
benchmark model trained on our debiased training set outperforms that trained
on the original biased (and larger) training set on our debiased test set. We
argue our debiased dataset offers the PCVG task a more practical baseline for
reliable benchmarking and future improvements.]]></summary>

Some of this attention is also driven by clients who, now more aware than ever,
are demanding for their money to be managed and invested responsibly. As the
interest in ESG grows, so does the need for investors to have access to
consumable ESG information. Since most of it is in text form in reports,
disclosures, press releases, and 10-Q filings, we see a need for sophisticated
NLP techniques for classification tasks for ESG text. We hypothesize that an
ESG domain-specific pre-trained model will help with such and study building of
the same in this paper. We explored doing this by fine-tuning BERTs pre-trained

adaptable to a variety of distribution shapes ranging from bell-shaped to
rectangular. From the viewpoint of computational tractability, the PDF based on
the Fermi-Dirac or logistic function is advantageous in estimating its shape
parameters. The most appropriate PDF for $n$-variate distribution is of the
form:
$p\left(\mathbf{x}\right)\propto\left[\cosh\left(\left[\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{m}\right)^{\mathsf{T}}\boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1}\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{m}\right)\right]^{n/2}\right)+\cosh\left(r^{n}\right)\right]^{-1}$
where $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{m}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$, $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ is an
$n\times n$ positive definite matrix, and $r>0$ is a shape parameter. The
flat-topped PDFs can be used as a component of mixture models in machine
learning to improve goodness of fit and make a model as simple as possible.]]></summary>

to its promising performance when compared to convolutional neural networks
(CNNs). As a result, many researchers have tried to incorporate ViT models in
hyperspectral image (HSI) classification tasks, but without achieving
satisfactory performance. To this paper, we introduce a new multimodal fusion
transformer (MFT) network for HSI land-cover classification, which utilizes
other sources of multimodal data in addition to HSI. Instead of using
conventional feature fusion techniques, other multimodal data are used as an
external classification (CLS) token in the transformer encoder, which helps
achieving better generalization. ViT and other similar transformer models use a
randomly initialized external classification token {and fail to generalize
well}. However, the use of a feature embedding derived from other sources of
multimodal data, such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR), offers the
potential to improve those models by means of a CLS. The concept of
tokenization is used in our work to generate CLS and HSI patch tokens, helping
to learn key features in a reduced feature space. We also introduce a new
attention mechanism for improving the exchange of information between HSI
tokens and the CLS (e.g., LiDAR) token. Extensive experiments are carried out
on widely used and benchmark datasets i.e., the University of Houston, Trento,
University of Southern Mississippi Gulfpark (MUUFL), and Augsburg. In the
results section, we compare the proposed MFT model with other state-of-the-art
transformer models, classical CNN models, as well as conventional classifiers.
The superior performance achieved by the proposed model is due to the use of
multimodal information as external classification tokens.]]></summary>

target speaker's voice while keeping text and prosody intact. VC is usually
used in entertainment and speaking-aid systems, as well as applied for speech
data generation and augmentation. The development of any-to-any VC systems,
which are capable of generating voices unseen during model training, is of

resource requirements of deep neural networks. To deal with the performance
drop induced by quantization errors, a popular method is to use training data
to fine-tune quantized networks. In real-world environments, however, such a
method is frequently infeasible because training data is unavailable due to
security, privacy, or confidentiality concerns. Zero-shot quantization
addresses such problems, usually by taking information from the weights of a
full-precision teacher network to compensate the performance drop of the
quantized networks. In this paper, we first analyze the loss surface of
state-of-the-art zero-shot quantization techniques and provide several
findings. In contrast to usual knowledge distillation problems, zero-shot
quantization often suffers from 1) the difficulty of optimizing multiple loss
terms together, and 2) the poor generalization capability due to the use of
synthetic samples. Furthermore, we observe that many weights fail to cross the
rounding threshold during training the quantized networks even when it is
necessary to do so for better performance. Based on the observations, we
propose AIT, a simple yet powerful technique for zero-shot quantization, which
addresses the aforementioned two problems in the following way: AIT i) uses a
KL distance loss only without a cross-entropy loss, and ii) manipulates
gradients to guarantee that a certain portion of weights are properly updated
after crossing the rounding thresholds. Experiments show that AIT outperforms
the performance of many existing methods by a great margin, taking over the
overall state-of-the-art position in the field.]]></summary>

networks, is a well-known technical and theoretical challenge. Recent work by
Mellor et al (2021) showed that there may exist correlations between the
accuracies of trained networks and the values of some easily computable
measures defined on randomly initialised networks which may enable to search
tens of thousands of neural architectures without training. Mellor et al used
the Hamming distance evaluated over all ReLU neurons as such a measure.
Motivated by these findings, in our work, we ask the question of the existence
of other and perhaps more principled measures which could be used as
determinants of success of a given neural architecture. In particular, we
examine, if the dimensionality and quasi-orthogonality of neural networks'
feature space could be correlated with the network's performance after
training. We showed, using the setup as in Mellor et al, that dimensionality
and quasi-orthogonality may jointly serve as network's performance
discriminants. In addition to offering new opportunities to accelerate neural
architecture search, our findings suggest important relationships between the
networks' final performance and properties of their randomly initialised
feature spaces: data dimension and quasi-orthogonality.]]></summary>

brain recognizes events and memorizes them and succeeded to reproduce the

cannot define well what is the features of the input data, and we need to
restrict the middle layer of the autoencoder artificially. We solve this
problem by defining a new loss function that reflects the information entropy,
and it enables the NN to compress the input data ideally and automatically
discover the hidden law behind the input data set. The loss function used in
our NN is based on the free-energy principle which is known as the unified
brain theory, and our study is the first concrete formularization of this

introduce a priori knowledge about physical systems into the learning
framework. PINNs are known to be robust for smaller training sets, derive

that using PINNs in comparison with purely data-driven neural networks is not
only favorable for training performance but allows us to extract significant
information on the quality of the approximated solution. Assuming that the
underlying differential equation for the PINN training is an ordinary
differential equation, we derive a rigorous upper limit on the PINN prediction
error. This bound is applicable even for input data not included in the
training phase and without any prior knowledge about the true solution.
Therefore, our a posteriori error estimation is an essential step to certify

requires the protection of patient confidentiality via data anonymisation. The
objective of this work is to calculate the risk of re-identification arising
from a malicious attack to an anonymised dataset, as described below. Methods:
We first present an analytical means of estimating the probability of
re-identification of a single patient in a k-anonymised dataset of Electronic
Health Record (EHR) data. Second, we generalize this solution to obtain the
probability of multiple patients being re-identified. We provide synthetic
validation via Monte Carlo simulations to illustrate the accuracy of the
estimates obtained. Results: The proposed analytical framework for risk
estimation provides re-identification probabilities that are in agreement with
those provided by simulation in a number of scenarios. Our work is limited by
conservative assumptions which inflate the re-identification probability.
Discussion: Our estimates show that the re-identification probability increases
with the proportion of the dataset maliciously obtained and that it has an
inverse relationship with the equivalence class size. Our recursive approach
extends the applicability domain to the general case of a multi-patient
re-identification attack in an arbitrary k-anonymisation scheme. Conclusion: We
prescribe a systematic way to parametrize the k-anonymisation process based on
a pre-determined re-identification probability. We observed that the benefits
of a reduced re-identification risk that come with increasing k-size may not be
worth the reduction in data granularity when one is considering benchmarking
the re-identification probability on the size of the portion of the dataset
maliciously obtained by the adversary.]]></summary>

practice for learning a wide range of downstream tasks. The typical approach of
fine-tuning different models for each task is performant, but incurs a
substantial memory cost. To efficiently learn multiple downstream tasks we
introduce Task Adaptive Parameter Sharing (TAPS), a general method for tuning a
base model to a new task by adaptively modifying a small, task-specific subset
of layers. This enables multi-task learning while minimizing resources used and
competition between tasks. TAPS solves a joint optimization problem which
determines which layers to share with the base model and the value of the
task-specific weights. Further, a sparsity penalty on the number of active
layers encourages weight sharing with the base model. Compared to other
methods, TAPS retains high accuracy on downstream tasks while introducing few
task-specific parameters. Moreover, TAPS is agnostic to the model architecture
and requires only minor changes to the training scheme. We evaluate our method
on a suite of fine-tuning tasks and architectures (ResNet, DenseNet, ViT) and
show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance while being simple to

squared error (MSE) sense, a Gaussian $K$-vector of unknown covariance by
observing only $m < K$ of its entries in each round. This reduces to learning

establish an exponential concentration bound for an estimate of the MSE for
each observable subset. We then frame the estimation problem with bandit
feedback in the best-subset identification setting. We propose a variant of the
successive elimination algorithm to cater to the adaptive estimation problem,
and we derive an upper bound on the sample complexity of this algorithm. In

RNN-Transducer (RNN-T) for speech recognition is challenging. Recently, a class
of methods such as density ratio (DR) and ILM estimation (ILME) have been
developed, outperforming the classic shallow fusion (SF) method. The basic idea
behind these methods is that RNN-T posterior should first subtract the
implicitly learned ILM prior, in order to integrate the external LM. While
recent studies suggest that RNN-T only learns some low-order language model
information, the DR method uses a well-trained ILM. We hypothesize that this
setting is appropriate and may deteriorate the performance of the DR method,
and propose a low-order density ratio method (LODR) by training a low-order
weak ILM for DR. Extensive empirical experiments are conducted on both
in-domain and cross-domain scenarios on English LibriSpeech & Tedlium-2 and
Chinese WenetSpeech & AISHELL-1 datasets. It is shown that LODR consistently
outperforms SF in all tasks, while performing generally close to ILME and

based on accuracy and F1 score have become the de facto standard to measure the
performance of lane detection methods. While they have played a major role in
improving the performance of lane detection methods, the validity of this
evaluation method in downstream tasks has not been adequately researched. In
this study, we design 2 new driving-oriented metrics for lane detection:
End-to-End Lateral Deviation metric (E2E-LD) is directly formulated based on
the requirements of autonomous driving, a core downstream task of lane
detection; Per-frame Simulated Lateral Deviation metric (PSLD) is a lightweight
surrogate metric of E2E-LD. To evaluate the validity of the metrics, we conduct
a large-scale empirical study with 4 major types of lane detection approaches
on the TuSimple dataset and our newly constructed dataset Comma2k19-LD. Our
results show that the conventional metrics have strongly negative correlations
($\leq$-0.55) with E2E-LD, meaning that some recent improvements purely
targeting the conventional metrics may not have led to meaningful improvements
in autonomous driving, but rather may actually have made it worse by
overfitting to the conventional metrics. As autonomous driving is a
security/safety-critical system, the underestimation of robustness hinders the
sound development of practical lane detection models. We hope that our study
will help the community achieve more downstream task-aware evaluations for lane
detection.]]></summary>

Hankel nuclear norm regularization. Hankel regularization encourages the
low-rankness of the Hankel matrix, which maps to the low-orderness of the
system. We provide novel statistical analysis for this regularization and
carefully contrast it with the unregularized ordinary least-squares (OLS)
estimator. Our analysis leads to new bounds on estimating the impulse response
and the Hankel matrix associated with the linear system. We first design an
input excitation and show that Hankel regularization enables one to recover the
system using optimal number of observations in the true system order and
achieve strong statistical estimation rates. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that
the input design indeed matters, by showing that intuitive choices such as
i.i.d. Gaussian input leads to provably sub-optimal sample complexity. To
better understand the benefits of regularization, we also revisit the OLS
estimator. Besides refining existing bounds, we experimentally identify when
regularized approach improves over OLS: (1) For low-order systems with slow
impulse-response decay, OLS method performs poorly in terms of sample
complexity, (2) Hankel matrix returned by regularization has a more clear
singular value gap that ease identification of the system order, (3) Hankel
regularization is less sensitive to hyperparameter choice. Finally, we
establish model selection guarantees through a joint train-validation procedure
where we tune the regularization parameter for near-optimal estimation.]]></summary>

a desired time horizon of prediction, a proper labeling scheme can be
designated to enable successful training of the DCNN and subsequent prediction

occur within the time horizon, a space-based labeling scheme can be applied to
predict, within certain resolution, the location at which the event will occur.
We use synthetic data from the 2D complex Ginzburg-Landau equation and
empirical wind speed data of the North Atlantic ocean to demonstrate and
validate our machine-learning based prediction framework. The trade-offs among
the prediction horizon, spatial resolution, and accuracy are illustrated, and

hyperparameter tuning in learning-based deformable image registration.
Classical registration algorithms perform an iterative pair-wise optimization
to compute a deformation field that aligns two images. Recent learning-based
approaches leverage large image datasets to learn a function that rapidly
estimates a deformation for a given image pair. In both strategies, the
accuracy of the resulting spatial correspondences is strongly influenced by the
choice of certain hyperparameter values. However, an effective hyperparameter
search consumes substantial time and human effort as it often involves training
multiple models for different fixed hyperparameter values and may lead to
suboptimal registration. We propose an amortized hyperparameter learning
strategy to alleviate this burden by learning the impact of hyperparameters on
deformation fields. We design a meta network, or hypernetwork, that predicts
the parameters of a registration network for input hyperparameters, thereby
comprising a single model that generates the optimal deformation field
corresponding to given hyperparameter values. This strategy enables fast,
high-resolution hyperparameter search at test-time, reducing the inefficiency
of traditional approaches while increasing flexibility. We also demonstrate
additional benefits of HyperMorph, including enhanced robustness to model
initialization and the ability to rapidly identify optimal hyperparameter
values specific to a dataset, image contrast, task, or even anatomical region,
all without the need to retrain models. We make our code publicly available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful improvement over the recent
Self-Supervised Audio Spectrogram Transformer (SSAST) model for speech and
audio classification. Specifically, we leverage the insight that the SSAST uses
a very high masking ratio (75%) during pretraining, meaning that the vast
majority of self-attention compute is performed on mask tokens. We address this
by integrating the encoder-decoder architecture from Masked Autoencoders are
Scalable Vision Learners (MAE) into the SSAST, where a deep encoder operates on
only unmasked input, and a shallow decoder operates on encoder outputs and mask
tokens. We find that MAE-like pretraining can provide a 3x speedup and 2x
memory usage reduction over the vanilla SSAST using current audio pretraining
strategies with ordinary model and input sizes. When fine-tuning on downstream
tasks, which only uses the encoder, we find that our approach outperforms the
SSAST on a variety of downstream tasks. We further conduct comprehensive
evaluations into different strategies of pretraining and explore differences in
MAE-style pretraining between the visual and audio domains.]]></summary>

estimation of sound sources based on an Icosahedral Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) applied over SRP-PHAT power maps computed from the signals
received by a microphone array. This icosahedral CNN is equivariant to the 60
rotational symmetries of the icosahedron, which represent a good approximation
of the continuous space of spherical rotations, and can be implemented using
standard 2D convolutional layers, having a lower computational cost than most
of the spherical CNNs. In addition, instead of using fully connected layers
after the icosahedral convolutions, we propose a new soft-argmax function that
can be seen as a differentiable version of the argmax function and allows us to
solve the DOA estimation as a regression problem interpreting the output of the
convolutional layers as a probability distribution. We prove that using models
that fit the equivariances of the problem allows us to outperform other

the collaborative training of a global model over decentralized local datasets
without sharing them. It spans a wide scope of applications from
Internet-of-Things (IoT) to biomedical engineering and drug discovery. To
support low-latency and high-privacy FL over wireless networks, in this paper,
we propose a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) empowered over-the-air FL
system to alleviate the dilemma between learning accuracy and privacy. This is
achieved by simultaneously exploiting the channel propagation reconfigurability
with RIS for boosting the receive signal power, as well as waveform
superposition property with over-the-air computation (AirComp) for fast model
aggregation. By considering a practical scenario where high-dimensional local
model updates are transmitted across multiple communication blocks, we
characterize the convergence behaviors of the differentially private federated
optimization algorithm. We further formulate a system optimization problem to
optimize the learning accuracy while satisfying privacy and power constraints
via the joint design of transmit power, artificial noise, and phase shifts at
RIS, for which a two-step alternating minimization framework is developed.
Simulation results validate our systematic, theoretical, and algorithmic
achievements and demonstrate that RIS can achieve a better trade-off between
privacy and accuracy for over-the-air FL systems.]]></summary>

speeches, was used to train and evaluate our model. For extracting and encoding

65536 in MoCo for instance, for which the performance of a dictionary-free
framework is often inferior because the negative sample size (NSS) is limited
by its mini-batch size (MBS). To decouple the NSS from the MBS, a dynamic
dictionary has been adopted in a large volume of CL frameworks, among which
arguably the most popular one is MoCo family. In essence, MoCo adopts a
momentum-based queue dictionary, for which we perform a fine-grained analysis
of its size and consistency. We point out that InfoNCE loss used in MoCo
implicitly attract anchors to their corresponding positive sample with various
strength of penalties and identify such inter-anchor hardness-awareness
property as a major reason for the necessity of a large dictionary. Our
findings motivate us to simplify MoCo v2 via the removal of its dictionary as
well as momentum. Based on an InfoNCE with the proposed dual temperature, our
simplified frameworks, SimMoCo and SimCo, outperform MoCo v2 by a visible
margin. Moreover, our work bridges the gap between CL and non-CL frameworks,
contributing to a more unified understanding of these two mainstream frameworks

to crack in condition monitoring of wind farms. Existing methods focus on
mechanism analysis of icing process, deviation degree analysis of feature
engineering. However, there have not been deep researches of neural networks
applied in this field at present. Supervisory control and data acquisition
(SCADA) makes it possible to train networks through continuously providing not
only operation parameters and performance parameters of wind turbines but also
environmental parameters and operation modes. This paper explores the
possibility that using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), generative
adversarial networks (GANs) and domain adaption learning to establish
intelligent diagnosis frameworks under different training scenarios.
Specifically, PGANC and PGANT are proposed for sufficient and non-sufficient
target wind turbine labeled data, respectively. The basic idea is that we
consider a two-stage training with parallel GANs, which are aimed at capturing
intrinsic features for normal and icing samples, followed by classification CNN
or domain adaption module in various training cases. Model validation on three
wind turbine SCADA data shows that two-stage training can effectively improve
the model performance. Besides, if there is no sufficient labeled data for a
target turbine, which is an extremely common phenomenon in real industrial
practices, the addition of domain adaption learning makes the trained model
show better performance. Overall, our proposed intelligent diagnosis frameworks
can achieve more accurate detection on the same wind turbine and more
generalized capability on a new wind turbine, compared with other machine
learning models and conventional CNNs.]]></summary>

structured data. Subgraph matching algorithms enumerate all isomorphic
embeddings of a query graph q in a data graph G. An important branch of
matching algorithms exploit the backtracking search approach which recursively
extends intermediate results following a matching order of query vertices. It
has been shown that the matching order plays a critical role in time efficiency
of these backtracking based subgraph matching algorithms. In recent years, many
advanced techniques for query vertex ordering (i.e., matching order generation)
have been proposed to reduce the unpromising intermediate results according to
the preset heuristic rules. In this paper, for the first time we apply the
Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) techniques to
generate the high-quality matching order for subgraph matching algorithms.
Instead of using the fixed heuristics to generate the matching order, our model
could capture and make full use of the graph information, and thus determine
the query vertex order with the adaptive learning-based rule that could
significantly reduces the number of redundant enumerations. With the help of
the reinforcement learning framework, our model is able to consider the
long-term benefits rather than only consider the local information at current
ordering step.Extensive experiments on six real-life data graphs demonstrate
that our proposed matching order generation technique could reduce up to two
orders of magnitude of query processing time compared to the state-of-the-art
algorithms.]]></summary>

between air traffic controllers (ATCOs) and aircraft pilots. The transcriptions
are used later to extract ATC named entities e.g., aircraft callsigns, command
types, or values. One common challenge is Speech Activity Detection (SAD) and
diarization system. If one of them fails then two or more single speaker
segments remain in the same recording, jeopardizing the overall system's
performance. We propose a system that combines the segmentation of a SAD module
with a BERT model that performs speaker change detection (SCD) and speaker role
detection (SRD) by chunking ASR transcripts i.e., diarization with a defined
number of speakers together with SRD. The proposed model is evaluated on
real-life ATC test sets. It reaches up to 0.90/0.95 F1-score on ATCO/pilot SRD,
which means a 27% relative improvement on diarization error rate (DER) compared
to standard acoustic-based diarization. Results are measured on ASR transcripts
of challenging ATC test sets with $\sim$13\% word error rate, and the
robustness of the system is even validated on noisy ASR transcripts.]]></summary>

in building today's best automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for
production. Similarly to the connectionist temporal classification (CTC)
objective, the RNN-T loss uses specific rules that define how a set of
alignments is generated to form a lattice for the full-sum training. However,
it is yet largely unknown if these rules are optimal and do lead to the best
possible ASR results. In this work, we present a new transducer objective
function that generalizes the RNN-T loss to accept a graph representation of
the labels, thus providing a flexible and efficient framework to manipulate
training lattices, e.g., for studying different transition rules, implementing
different transducer losses, or restricting alignments. We demonstrate that
transducer-based ASR with CTC-like lattice achieves better results compared to
standard RNN-T, while also ensuring a strictly monotonic alignment, which will
allow better optimization of the decoding procedure. For example, the proposed
CTC-like transducer achieves an improvement of 4.8% on the test-other condition
of LibriSpeech relative to an equivalent RNN-T based system.]]></summary>

probability density in the source domain, complementary to the existing source
domain labeled data. To further facilitate labeling efficiency, we design a
dynamic scheduling policy to adjust the labeling budgets between domain
exploration and model uncertainty over time. Extensive experiments show that
our method outperforms existing active learning and domain adaptation baselines

optimization, are being explored across experimental sciences as an efficient
alternative to traditional design of experiment. When combined with automated
laboratory hardware and high-performance computing, these strategies enable
next-generation platforms for autonomous experimentation. However, the
practical application of these approaches is hampered by a lack of flexible
software and algorithms tailored to the unique requirements of chemical
research. One such aspect is the pervasive presence of constraints in the
experimental conditions when optimizing chemical processes or protocols, and in
the chemical space that is accessible when designing functional molecules or
materials. Although many of these constraints are known a priori, they can be
interdependent, non-linear, and result in non-compact optimization domains. In
this work, we extend our experiment planning algorithms Phoenics and Gryffin
such that they can handle arbitrary known constraints via an intuitive and
flexible interface. We benchmark these extended algorithms on continuous and
discrete test functions with a diverse set of constraints, demonstrating their
flexibility and robustness. In addition, we illustrate their practical utility
in two simulated chemical research scenarios: the optimization of the synthesis
of o-xylenyl Buckminsterfullerene adducts under constrained flow conditions,
and the design of redox active molecules for flow batteries under synthetic
accessibility constraints. The tools developed constitute a simple, yet
versatile strategy to enable model-based optimization with known experimental
constraints, contributing to its applicability as a core component of

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our goal is to recover the 3D shape and pose of dogs from a single image.
This is a challenging task because dogs exhibit a wide range of shapes and
appearances, and are highly articulated. Recent work has proposed to directly
regress the SMAL animal model, with additional limb scale parameters, from
images. Our method, called BARC (Breed-Augmented Regression using
Classification), goes beyond prior work in several important ways. First, we
modify the SMAL shape space to be more appropriate for representing dog shape.
But, even with a better shape model, the problem of regressing dog shape from
an image is still challenging because we lack paired images with 3D ground
truth. To compensate for the lack of paired data, we formulate novel losses
that exploit information about dog breeds. In particular, we exploit the fact
that dogs of the same breed have similar body shapes. We formulate a novel
breed similarity loss consisting of two parts: One term encourages the shape of
dogs from the same breed to be more similar than dogs of different breeds. The
second one, a breed classification loss, helps to produce recognizable
breed-specific shapes. Through ablation studies, we find that our breed losses
significantly improve shape accuracy over a baseline without them. We also
compare BARC qualitatively to WLDO with a perceptual study and find that our
approach produces dogs that are significantly more realistic. This work shows
that a-priori information about genetic similarity can help to compensate for
the lack of 3D training data. This concept may be applicable to other animal
species or groups of species. Our code is publicly available for research
purposes at https://barc.is.tue.mpg.de/.]]></summary>

model-agnostic meta learning. To solve this class of stochastic optimization
problems, existing methods require either double-loop or two-timescale updates,
which are sometimes less efficient. This paper develops a new optimization
method for a class of stochastic bilevel problems that we term Single-Timescale
stochAstic BiLevEl optimization (STABLE) method. STABLE runs in a single loop
fashion, and uses a single-timescale update with a fixed batch size. To achieve
an $\epsilon$-stationary point of the bilevel problem, STABLE requires ${\cal
O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ samples in total; and to achieve an $\epsilon$-optimal

due to its compositional property. Most previous works adopt a bottom-up
two-stage or a point-based one-stage approach, which often suffers from high
time complexity or sub-optimal designs. In this work, we propose a novel SGG
method to address the aforementioned issues, formulating the task as a
bipartite graph construction problem. To solve the problem, we develop a
transformer-based end-to-end framework that first generates the entity and
predicate proposal set, followed by inferring directed edges to form the
relation triplets. In particular, we develop a new entity-aware predicate
representation based on a structural predicate generator that leverages the
compositional property of relationships. Moreover, we design a graph assembling
module to infer the connectivity of the bipartite scene graph based on our
entity-aware structure, enabling us to generate the scene graph in an
end-to-end manner. Extensive experimental results show that our design is able
to achieve the state-of-the-art or comparable performance on two challenging

efficiency in inference. We hope our model can serve as a strong baseline for

graph learning model. However, it can be notoriously challenging to inference
GCNs over large graph datasets, limiting their application to large real-world
graphs and hindering the exploration of deeper and more sophisticated GCN
graphs. This is because real-world graphs can be extremely large and sparse.
Furthermore, the node degree of GCNs tends to follow the power-law distribution
and therefore have highly irregular adjacency matrices, resulting in
prohibitive inefficiencies in both data processing and movement and thus
substantially limiting the achievable GCN acceleration efficiency. To this end,
this paper proposes a GCN algorithm and accelerator Co-Design framework dubbed
GCoD which can largely alleviate the aforementioned GCN irregularity and boost
GCNs' inference efficiency. Specifically, on the algorithm level, GCoD
integrates a split and conquer GCN training strategy that polarizes the graphs
to be either denser or sparser in local neighborhoods without compromising the
model accuracy, resulting in graph adjacency matrices that (mostly) have merely
two levels of workload and enjoys largely enhanced regularity and thus ease of
acceleration. On the hardware level, we further develop a dedicated two-pronged
accelerator with a separated engine to process each of the aforementioned
denser and sparser workloads, further boosting the overall utilization and
acceleration efficiency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate
that our GCoD consistently reduces the number of off-chip accesses, leading to
speedups of 15286x, 294x, 7.8x, and 2.5x as compared to CPUs, GPUs, and
prior-art GCN accelerators including HyGCN and AWB-GCN, respectively, while
maintaining or even improving the task accuracy. Codes are available at

encouraging potential to represent complex scenes with neural networks. One
major drawback of NeRF is its prohibitive inference time: Rendering a single
pixel requires querying the NeRF network hundreds of times. To resolve it,
existing efforts mainly attempt to reduce the number of required sampled
points. However, the problem of iterative sampling still exists. On the other
hand, Neural Light Field (NeLF) presents a more straightforward representation
over NeRF in novel view synthesis -- the rendering of a pixel amounts to one
single forward pass without ray-marching. In this work, we present a deep
residual MLP network (88 layers) to effectively learn the light field. We show
the key to successfully learning such a deep NeLF network is to have sufficient
data, for which we transfer the knowledge from a pre-trained NeRF model via
data distillation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
scenes show the merits of our method over other counterpart algorithms. On the
synthetic scenes, we achieve 26-35x FLOPs reduction (per camera ray) and 28-31x
runtime speedup, meanwhile delivering significantly better (1.4-2.8 dB average

continuous everywhere, nearly uniform around the mode of distribution, and
adaptable to a variety of distribution shapes ranging from bell-shaped to
rectangular. From the viewpoint of computational tractability, the PDF based on
the Fermi-Dirac or logistic function is advantageous in estimating its shape
parameters. The most appropriate PDF for $n$-variate distribution is of the
form:
$p\left(\mathbf{x}\right)\propto\left[\cosh\left(\left[\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{m}\right)^{\mathsf{T}}\boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1}\left(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{m}\right)\right]^{n/2}\right)+\cosh\left(r^{n}\right)\right]^{-1}$
where $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{m}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$, $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ is an
$n\times n$ positive definite matrix, and $r>0$ is a shape parameter. The
flat-topped PDFs can be used as a component of mixture models in machine

(MDP) optimization, is a important challenge in artificial intelligence. Two
key approaches to this problem are reinforcement learning (RL) and planning.
This paper presents a survey of the integration of both fields, better known as
model-based reinforcement learning. Model-based RL has two main steps. First,
we systematically cover approaches to dynamics model learning, including
challenges like dealing with stochasticity, uncertainty, partial observability,
and temporal abstraction. Second, we present a systematic categorization of
planning-learning integration, including aspects like: where to start planning,
what budgets to allocate to planning and real data collection, how to plan, and
how to integrate planning in the learning and acting loop. After these two
sections, we also discuss implicit model-based RL as an end-to-end alternative
for model learning and planning, and we cover the potential benefits of
model-based RL. Along the way, the survey also draws connections to several
related RL fields, like hierarchical RL and transfer learning. Altogether, the
survey presents a broad conceptual overview of the combination of planning and
learning for MDP optimization.]]></summary>

discovery. An ideal multivariate spatial clustering should consider both
spatial contiguity and aspatial attributes. Existing spatial clustering
approaches may face challenges for discovering repeated geographic patterns
with spatial contiguity maintained. In this paper, we propose a Spatial
Toeplitz Inverse Covariance-Based Clustering (STICC) method that considers both
attributes and spatial relationships of geographic objects for multivariate
spatial clustering. A subregion is created for each geographic object serving
as the basic unit when performing clustering. A Markov random field is then
constructed to characterize the attribute dependencies of subregions. Using a
spatial consistency strategy, nearby objects are encouraged to belong to the
same cluster. To test the performance of the proposed STICC algorithm, we apply
it in two use cases. The comparison results with several baseline methods show
that the STICC outperforms others significantly in terms of adjusted rand index
and macro-F1 score. Join count statistics is also calculated and shows that the
spatial contiguity is well preserved by STICC. Such a spatial clustering method
may benefit various applications in the fields of geography, remote sensing,
transportation, and urban planning, etc.]]></summary>

challenge in scientific computing. We develop a new numerical method for
solving elliptic-type PDEs by adapting the Q-learning algorithm in

the potential to overcome the curse of dimensionality. Using a neural tangent
kernel (NTK) approach, we prove that the neural network approximator for the
PDE solution, trained with the Q-PDE algorithm, converges to the trajectory of
an infinite-dimensional ordinary differential equation (ODE) as the number of
hidden units $\rightarrow \infty$. For monotone PDE (i.e. those given by
monotone operators, which may be nonlinear), despite the lack of a spectral gap
in the NTK, we then prove that the limit neural network, which satisfies the
infinite-dimensional ODE, converges in $L^2$ to the PDE solution as the
training time $\rightarrow \infty$. More generally, we can prove that any fixed
point of the wide-network limit for the Q-PDE algorithm is a solution of the
PDE (not necessarily under the monotone condition). The numerical performance
of the Q-PDE algorithm is studied for several elliptic PDEs.]]></summary>

computationally and/or financially expensive. Mono-surrogate Bayesian
optimisation (BO) is a popular model-based approach for optimising such
black-box functions. It combines objective values via scalarisation and builds
a Gaussian process (GP) surrogate of the scalarised values. The location which
maximises a cheap-to-query acquisition function is chosen as the next location
to expensively evaluate. While BO is an effective strategy, the use of GPs is
limiting. Their performance decreases as the problem input dimensionality
increases, and their computational complexity scales cubically with the amount
of data. To address these limitations, we extend previous work on BO by
density-ratio estimation (BORE) to the multi-objective setting. BORE links the
computation of the probability of improvement acquisition function to that of
probabilistic classification. This enables the use of state-of-the-art
classifiers in a BO-like framework. In this work we present MBORE:
multi-objective Bayesian optimisation by density-ratio estimation, and compare
it to BO across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks. We find that
MBORE performs as well as or better than BO on a wide variety of problems, and
that it outperforms BO on high-dimensional and real-world problems.]]></summary>

("trajectories") of non-independent covariates, reflecting tasks in sequence
modeling, control, and reinforcement learning. Conceptually, our
multi-trajectory setup sits between two traditional settings in statistical
learning theory: learning from independent examples and learning from a single
auto-correlated sequence. Our conditions for efficient learning generalize the
former setting--trajectories must be non-degenerate in ways that extend
standard requirements for independent examples. They do not require that
trajectories be ergodic, long, nor strictly stable.

For linear least-squares regression, given $n$-dimensional examples produced
by $m$ trajectories, each of length $T$, we observe a notable change in
statistical efficiency as the number of trajectories increases from a few
(namely $m \lesssim n$) to many (namely $m \gtrsim n$). Specifically, we
establish that the worst-case error rate this problem is $\Theta(n / m T)$
whenever $m \gtrsim n$. Meanwhile, when $m \lesssim n$, we establish a (sharp)
lower bound of $\Omega(n^2 / m^2 T)$ on the worst-case error rate, realized by
a simple, marginally unstable linear dynamical system. A key upshot is that, in
domains where trajectories regularly reset, the error rate eventually behaves
as if all of the examples were independent altogether, drawn from their
marginals. As a corollary of our analysis, we also improve guarantees for the
linear system identification problem.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi-agent reinforcement learning has made substantial empirical progresses
in solving games with a large number of players. However, theoretically, the
best known sample complexity for finding a Nash equilibrium in general-sum
games scales exponentially in the number of players due to the size of the
joint action space, and there is a matching exponential lower bound. This paper
investigates what learning goals admit better sample complexities in the
setting of $m$-player general-sum Markov games with $H$ steps, $S$ states, and
$A_i$ actions per player. First, we design algorithms for learning an
$\epsilon$-Coarse Correlated Equilibrium (CCE) in
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^5S\max_{i\le m} A_i / \epsilon^2)$ episodes, and an
$\epsilon$-Correlated Equilibrium (CE) in
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^6S\max_{i\le m} A_i^2 / \epsilon^2)$ episodes. This
is the first line of results for learning CCE and CE with sample complexities
polynomial in $\max_{i\le m} A_i$. Our algorithm for learning CE integrates an
adversarial bandit subroutine which minimizes a weighted swap regret, along
with several novel designs in the outer loop. Second, we consider the important
special case of Markov Potential Games, and design an algorithm that learns an
$\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibrium within
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(S\sum_{i\le m} A_i / \epsilon^3)$ episodes (when only
highlighting the dependence on $S$, $A_i$, and $\epsilon$), which only depends
linearly in $\sum_{i\le m} A_i$ and significantly improves over existing
efficient algorithm in the $\epsilon$ dependence. Overall, our results shed
light on what equilibria or structural assumptions on the game may enable
sample-efficient learning with many players.]]></summary>

phenomenons and human behaviours in the long history, with data-driven machine

training data, to increase models' generalizability and to ensure the physical
plausibility of results. In this paper, we survey an abundant number of recent

that has found widespread applications. Examples include selecting offers,
prices, advertisements to send to customers, as well as selecting which
medication to prescribe to a patient. However, existing literature rests on the
crucial assumption that the future environment where the learned policy will be
deployed is the same as the past environment that has generated the data -- an
assumption that is often false or too coarse an approximation. In this paper,
we lift this assumption and aim to learn a distributionally robust policy with
incomplete observational data. We first present a policy evaluation procedure
that allows us to assess how well the policy does under the worst-case
environment shift. We then establish a central limit theorem type guarantee for
this proposed policy evaluation scheme. Leveraging this evaluation scheme, we
further propose a novel learning algorithm that is able to learn a policy that
is robust to adversarial perturbations and unknown covariate shifts with a
performance guarantee based on the theory of uniform convergence. Finally, we
empirically test the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in synthetic
datasets and demonstrate that it provides the robustness that is missing using
standard policy learning algorithms. We conclude the paper by providing a
comprehensive application of our methods in the context of a real-world voting
dataset.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background. Commonly, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) generalize well on samples
drawn from a distribution similar to that of the training set. However, DNNs'
predictions are brittle and unreliable when the test samples are drawn from a
dissimilar distribution. This is a major concern for deployment in real-world
applications, where such behavior may come at a considerable cost, such as
industrial production lines, autonomous vehicles, or healthcare applications.
Contributions. We frame Out Of Distribution (OOD) detection in DNNs as a
statistical hypothesis testing problem. Tests generated within our proposed
framework combine evidence from the entire network. Unlike previous OOD
detection heuristics, this framework returns a $p$-value for each test sample.
It is guaranteed to maintain the Type I Error (T1E - incorrectly predicting OOD
for an actual in-distribution sample) for test data. Moreover, this allows to
combine several detectors while maintaining the T1E. Building on this
framework, we suggest a novel OOD procedure based on low-order statistics. Our
method achieves comparable or better results than state-of-the-art methods on
well-accepted OOD benchmarks, without retraining the network parameters or
assuming prior knowledge on the test distribution -- and at a fraction of the
computational cost.]]></summary>

encouraged the consideration of fairness throughout the ML lifecycle. Although
data integration is one of the primary steps to generate high quality training

consider fairness in the integration component of data management, aiming to
identify features that improve prediction without adding any bias to the

requiring the underlying structural causal model a priori, we propose an
approach to identify a sub-collection of features that ensure the fairness of
the dataset by performing conditional independence tests between different
subsets of features. We use group testing to improve the complexity of the
approach. We theoretically prove the correctness of the proposed algorithm to
identify features that ensure interventional fairness and show that sub-linear
conditional independence tests are sufficient to identify these variables. A
detailed empirical evaluation is performed on real-world datasets to

commonly used for multi-object matching, often involve computation-intensive
and memory-demanding matrix operations. These operations become intractable for
large scale structure-from-motion datasets. For pure permutation
synchronization, the recent Cycle-Edge Message Passing (CEMP) framework
suggests a memory-efficient and fast solution. Here we overcome the restriction
of CEMP to compact groups and propose an improved algorithm, CEMP-Partial, for
estimating the corruption levels of the observed partial permutations. It
allows us to subsequently implement a nonconvex weighted projected power method
without the need of spectral initialization. The resulting new PPS algorithm,
MatchFAME (Fast, Accurate and Memory-Efficient Matching), only involves sparse
matrix operations, and thus enjoys lower time and space complexities in
comparison to previous PPS algorithms. We prove that under adversarial
corruption, though without additive noise and with certain assumptions,
CEMP-Partial is able to exactly classify corrupted and clean partial
permutations. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art accuracy, speed and memory

neural networks (DNNs) and improve performances in single-channel and
user-independent brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) with small data lengths.
Approach: We propose the utilization of filter banks (creating sub-band
components of the EEG signal) in conjunction with DNNs. In this context, we
created three different models: a recurrent neural network (FBRNN) analyzing
the time domain, a 2D convolutional neural network (FBCNN-2D) processing
complex spectrum features and a 3D convolutional neural network (FBCNN-3D)
analyzing complex spectrograms, which we introduce in this study as possible
input for SSVEP classification. We tested our neural networks on three open
datasets and conceived them so as not to require calibration from the final
user, simulating a user-independent BCI. Results: The DNNs with the filter
banks surpassed the accuracy of similar networks without this preprocessing
step by considerable margins, and they outperformed common SSVEP classification
methods (SVM and FBCCA) by even higher margins. Conclusion and significance:
Filter banks allow different types of deep neural networks to more efficiently
analyze the harmonic components of SSVEP. Complex spectrograms carry more
information than complex spectrum features and the magnitude spectrum, allowing
the FBCNN-3D to surpass the other CNNs. The performances obtained in the
challenging classification problems indicates a strong potential for the
construction of portable, economical, fast and low-latency BCIs.]]></summary>

privacy-preserving, distributed learning with a network of clients (i.e., edge
devices). However, the data distribution among clients is often non-IID in
nature, making efficient optimization difficult. To alleviate this issue, many
FL algorithms focus on mitigating the effects of data heterogeneity across
clients by introducing a variety of proximal terms, some incurring considerable
compute and/or memory overheads, to restrain local updates with respect to the
global model. Instead, we consider rethinking solutions to data heterogeneity
in FL with a focus on local learning generality rather than proximal
restriction. To this end, we first present a systematic study informed by
second-order indicators to better understand algorithm effectiveness in FL.
Interestingly, we find that standard regularization methods are surprisingly
strong performers in mitigating data heterogeneity effects. Based on our
findings, we further propose a simple and effective method, FedAlign, to
overcome data heterogeneity and the pitfalls of previous methods. FedAlign
achieves competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art FL methods across a variety
of settings while minimizing computation and memory overhead. Code is available

computationally and/or financially expensive. Mono-surrogate Bayesian
optimisation (BO) is a popular model-based approach for optimising such
black-box functions. It combines objective values via scalarisation and builds
a Gaussian process (GP) surrogate of the scalarised values. The location which
maximises a cheap-to-query acquisition function is chosen as the next location
to expensively evaluate. While BO is an effective strategy, the use of GPs is
limiting. Their performance decreases as the problem input dimensionality
increases, and their computational complexity scales cubically with the amount
of data. To address these limitations, we extend previous work on BO by
density-ratio estimation (BORE) to the multi-objective setting. BORE links the
computation of the probability of improvement acquisition function to that of
probabilistic classification. This enables the use of state-of-the-art
classifiers in a BO-like framework. In this work we present MBORE:
multi-objective Bayesian optimisation by density-ratio estimation, and compare
it to BO across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks. We find that
MBORE performs as well as or better than BO on a wide variety of problems, and

and self-interested manner to minimize their individual travel costs, which, in
practice, often results in inefficient overall outcomes for society. As a
result, there has been a growing interest in designing road tolling schemes to
cope with these efficiency losses and steer users toward a system-efficient
traffic pattern. However, the efficacy of road tolling schemes often relies on
having access to complete information on users' trip attributes, such as their
origin-destination (O-D) travel information and their values of time, which may
not be available in practice.

Motivated by this practical consideration, we propose an online learning
approach to set tolls in a traffic network to drive heterogeneous users with
different values of time toward a system-efficient traffic pattern. In
particular, we develop a simple yet effective algorithm that adjusts tolls at
each time period solely based on the observed aggregate flows on the roads of
the network without relying on any additional trip attributes of users, thereby
preserving user privacy. In the setting where the O-D pairs and values of time
of users are drawn i.i.d. at each period, we show that our approach obtains an
expected regret and road capacity violation of $O(\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the
number of periods over which tolls are updated. Our regret guarantee is
relative to an offline oracle that has complete information on users' trip
attributes. We further establish a $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ lower bound on the regret
of any algorithm, which establishes that our algorithm is optimal up to
constants. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of our approach
relative to several benchmarks on a real-world transportation network, thereby
highlighting its practical applicability.]]></summary>

gap, this paper introduces two types of invertible attention mechanisms, i.e.,
map-based and transformer-based attentions, for both unconditional and
conditional generative flows. The key idea is to exploit a masked scheme of
these two attentions to learn long-range data dependencies in the context of
generative flows. The masked scheme allows for invertible attention modules
with tractable Jacobian determinants, enabling its seamless integration at any
positions of the flow-based models. The proposed attention mechanisms lead to
more efficient generative flows, due to their capability of modeling the
long-term data dependencies. Evaluation on multiple image synthesis tasks shows
that the proposed attention flows result in efficient models and compare
favorably against the state-of-the-art unconditional and conditional generative
flows.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New classes arise frequently in our ever-changing world, e.g., emerging
topics in social media and new types of products in e-commerce. A model should
recognize new classes and meanwhile maintain discriminability over old classes.
Under severe circumstances, only limited novel instances are available to
incrementally update the model. The task of recognizing few-shot new classes
without forgetting old classes is called few-shot class-incremental learning
(FSCIL). In this work, we propose a new paradigm for FSCIL based on
meta-learning by LearnIng Multi-phase Incremental Tasks (LIMIT), which
synthesizes fake FSCIL tasks from the base dataset. The data format of fake
tasks is consistent with the `real' incremental tasks, and we can build a
generalizable feature space for the unseen tasks through meta-learning.
Besides, LIMIT also constructs a calibration module based on transformer, which
calibrates the old class classifiers and new class prototypes into the same
scale and fills in the semantic gap. The calibration module also adaptively
contextualizes the instance-specific embedding with a set-to-set function.
LIMIT efficiently adapts to new classes and meanwhile resists forgetting over
old classes. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (CIFAR100, miniImageNet,
and CUB200) and large-scale dataset, i.e., ImageNet ILSVRC2012 validate that
LIMIT achieves state-of-the-art performance.]]></summary>

bachelor selects his wife from a pool of approximately 30 female contestants
over eight weeks of filming (American Broadcasting Company 2002). We collected
the following data on all 422 contestants that participated in seasons 11
through 25: their Age, Hometown, Career, Race, Week they got their first 1-on-1
date, whether they got the first impression rose, and what "place" they ended
up getting. We then trained three machine learning models to predict the ideal
characteristics of a successful contestant on $\textit{The Bachelor}$. The
three algorithms that we tested were: random forest classification, neural
networks, and linear regression. We found consistency across all three models,
although the neural network performed the best overall. Our models found that a
woman has the highest probability of progressing far on $\textit{The Bachelor}$
if she is: 26 years old, white, from the Northwest, works as an dancer,
received a 1-on-1 in week 6, and did not receive the First Impression Rose. Our
methodology is broadly applicable to all romantic reality television, and our
results will inform future $\textit{The Bachelor}$ production and contestant
strategies. While our models were relatively successful, we still encountered
high misclassification rates. This may be because: (1) Our training dataset had
fewer than 400 points or (2) Our models were too simple to parameterize the
complex romantic connections contestants forge over the course of a season.]]></summary>

affect cognition, emotion and behaviour with potentially detrimental effects on
health in the case of sustained exposure. Since the affective content of speech
is inherently modulated by an individual's physical and mental state, a
substantial body of research has been devoted to the study of paralinguistic
correlates of stress-inducing task load. Historically, voice stress analysis
(VSA) has been conducted using conventional digital signal processing (DSP)
techniques. Despite the development of modern methods based on deep neural
networks (DNNs), accurately detecting stress in speech remains difficult due to
the wide variety of stressors and considerable variability in the individual
stress perception. To that end, we introduce a set of five datasets for task
load detection in speech. The voice recordings were collected as either
cognitive or physical stress was induced in the cohort of volunteers, with a
cumulative number of more than a hundred speakers. We used the datasets to
design and evaluate a novel self-supervised audio representation that leverages
the effectiveness of handcrafted features (DSP-based) and the complexity of
data-driven DNN representations. Notably, the proposed approach outperformed
both extensive handcrafted feature sets and novel DNN-based audio
representation learning approaches.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many popular contextual bandit algorithms estimate reward models to inform
decision making. However, true rewards can contain action-independent
redundancies that are not relevant for decision making and only increase the
statistical complexity of accurate estimation. It is sufficient and more
data-efficient to estimate the simplest function that explains the reward
differences between actions, that is, the heterogeneous treatment effect,
commonly understood to be more structured and simpler than the reward.
Motivated by this observation, building on recent work on oracle-based
algorithms, we design a statistically optimal and computationally efficient
algorithm using heterogeneous treatment effect estimation oracles. Our results
provide the first universal reduction of contextual bandits to a
general-purpose heterogeneous treatment effect estimation method. We show that
our approach is more robust to model misspecification than reward estimation
methods based on squared error regression oracles. Experimentally, we show the
benefits of heterogeneous treatment effect estimation in contextual bandits
over reward estimation.]]></summary>

Hankel nuclear norm regularization. Hankel regularization encourages the
low-rankness of the Hankel matrix, which maps to the low-orderness of the
system. We provide novel statistical analysis for this regularization and
carefully contrast it with the unregularized ordinary least-squares (OLS)
estimator. Our analysis leads to new bounds on estimating the impulse response
and the Hankel matrix associated with the linear system. We first design an
input excitation and show that Hankel regularization enables one to recover the
system using optimal number of observations in the true system order and
achieve strong statistical estimation rates. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that
the input design indeed matters, by showing that intuitive choices such as
i.i.d. Gaussian input leads to provably sub-optimal sample complexity. To
better understand the benefits of regularization, we also revisit the OLS
estimator. Besides refining existing bounds, we experimentally identify when
regularized approach improves over OLS: (1) For low-order systems with slow
impulse-response decay, OLS method performs poorly in terms of sample
complexity, (2) Hankel matrix returned by regularization has a more clear
singular value gap that ease identification of the system order, (3) Hankel
regularization is less sensitive to hyperparameter choice. Finally, we
establish model selection guarantees through a joint train-validation procedure
where we tune the regularization parameter for near-optimal estimation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some exciting new approaches to neural architectures for the analysis of
conversation have been introduced over the past couple of years. These include
neural architectures for detecting emotion, dialogue acts, and sentiment
polarity. They take advantage of some of the key attributes of contemporary
machine learning, such as recurrent neural networks with attention mechanisms
and transformer-based approaches. However, while the architectures themselves
are extremely promising, the phenomena they have been applied to to date are
but a small part of what makes conversation engaging. In this paper we survey
these neural architectures and what they have been applied to. On the basis of
the social science literature, we then describe what we believe to be the most
fundamental and definitional feature of conversation, which is its
co-construction over time by two or more interlocutors. We discuss how neural
architectures of the sort surveyed could profitably be applied to these more
fundamental aspects of conversation, and what this buys us in terms of a better
analysis of conversation and even, in the longer term, a better way of
generating conversation for a conversational system.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent years, hypergraph learning has attracted great attention due to its
capacity in representing complex and high-order relationships. However, current
neural network approaches designed for hypergraphs are mostly shallow, thus
limiting their ability to extract information from high-order neighbors. In
this paper, we show both theoretically and empirically, that the performance of
hypergraph neural networks does not improve as the number of layers increases,
which is known as the over-smoothing problem. To tackle this issue, we develop
a new deep hypergraph convolutional network called Deep-HGCN, which can
maintain the heterogeneity of node representation in deep layers. Specifically,
we prove that a $k$-layer Deep-HGCN simulates a polynomial filter of order $k$
with arbitrary coefficients, which can relieve the problem of over-smoothing.
Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the superior performance
of the proposed model comparing to the state-of-the-art hypergraph learning
approaches.]]></summary>

great destruction and damage to critical systems and business operations.
Attackers are unfailingly finding innovative ways to bypass detection
mechanisms, whichencouraged the adoption of artificial intelligence. However,
most research summarizes the general features of AI and induces many false
positives, as the behavior of ransomware constantly differs to bypass
detection. Focusing on the key indicating features of ransomware becomes vital
as this guides the investigator to the inner workings and main function of
ransomware itself. By utilizing access privileges in process memory, the main
function of the ransomware can be detected more easily and accurately.
Furthermore, new signatures and fingerprints of ransomware families can be
identified to classify novel ransomware attacks correctly. The current research
used the process memory access privileges of the different memory regions of
the behavior of an executable to quickly determine its intent before serious
harm can occur. To achieve this aim, several well-known machine learning
algorithms were explored with an accuracy range of 81.38 to 96.28 percents. The

behaviors, which are more suitable to be described by stochastic differential
equations under non-Gaussian L\'evy noise. Among these complex phenomena, the
most likely transition paths between metastable states are important since
these rare events may have high impact in certain scenarios. Based on the large
deviation principle, the most likely transition path could be treated as the
minimizer of the rate function upon paths that connect two points. One of the
challenges to calculate the most likely transition path for stochastic
dynamical systems under non-Gaussian L\'evy noise is that the associated rate
function can not be explicitly expressed by paths. For this reason, we
formulate an optimal control problem to obtain the optimal state as the most
likely transition path. We then develop a neural network method to solve this
issue. Several experiments are investigated for both Gaussian and non-Gaussian

learned models have shown synthesis quality close to human speech. For example,
FastSpeech2 transforms an input text to a mel-spectrogram and then HiFi-GAN
generates a raw waveform from a mel-spectogram where they are called an
acoustic feature generator and a neural vocoder respectively. However, their
training pipeline is somewhat cumbersome in that it requires a fine-tuning and
an accurate speech-text alignment for optimal performance. In this work, we
present end-to-end text-to-speech (E2E-TTS) model which has a simplified
training pipeline and outperforms a cascade of separately learned models.
Specifically, our proposed model is jointly trained FastSpeech2 and HiFi-GAN
with an alignment module. Since there is no acoustic feature mismatch between
training and inference, it does not requires fine-tuning. Furthermore, we
remove dependency on an external speech-text alignment tool by adopting an
alignment learning objective in our joint training framework. Experiments on

uncertainty sets which are known to be hard to solve even if the underlying
deterministic problem is easy. Popular solution methods iteratively generate
scenario constraints and possibly second-stage variables. This way, by solving
a sequence of smaller problems, it is often possible to avoid the complexity of
considering all scenarios simultaneously. A key ingredient for the performance
of the iterative methods is a good selection of start scenarios. In this paper
we propose a data-driven heuristic to seed the iterative solution method with a
set of starting scenarios that provide a strong lower bound early in the
process, and result in considerably smaller overall solution times compared to
other benchmark methods. Our heuristic learns the relevance of a scenario by
extracting information from training data based on a combined similarity
measure between robust problem instances and single scenarios. Our experiments
show that predicting even a small number of good start scenarios by our method
can considerably reduce the computation time of the iterative methods.]]></summary>

focus on the performance of these online algorithms in the context of
estimating piecewise polynomial and bounded variation function classes in the

in addressing the challenge of climate change. One of the drawbacks of
wind-generated energy is the large space necessary to install a wind farm; this
arises from the fact that placing wind turbines in a limited area would hinder
their productivity and therefore not be economically convenient. This naturally
leads to an optimisation problem, which has three specific challenges: (1)
multiple conflicting objectives (2) computationally expensive simulation models
and (3) optimisation over design sets instead of design vectors. The first and
second challenges can be addressed by using surrogate-assisted e.g.\ Bayesian
multi-objective optimisation. However, the traditional Bayesian optimisation
cannot be applied as the optimisation function in the problem relies on design
sets instead of design vectors. This paper extends the applicability of
Bayesian multi-objective optimisation to set based optimisation for solving the
wind farm layout problem. We use a set-based kernel in Gaussian process to
quantify the correlation between wind farms (with a different number of
turbines). The results on the given data set of wind energy and direction
clearly show the potential of using set-based Bayesian multi-objective

are scarce, we propose a novel estimator of the out-of-sample performance of a
policy in data-driven optimization.Our approach exploits the optimization
problem's sensitivity analysis to estimate the gradient of the optimal
objective value with respect to the amount of noise in the data and uses the
estimated gradient to debias the policy's in-sample performance. Unlike
cross-validation techniques, our approach avoids sacrificing data for a test
set, utilizes all data when training and, hence, is well-suited to settings
where data are scarce. We prove bounds on the bias and variance of our
estimator for optimization problems with uncertain linear objectives but known,
potentially non-convex, feasible regions. For more specialized optimization
problems where the feasible region is "weakly-coupled" in a certain sense, we
prove stronger results. Specifically, we provide explicit high-probability
bounds on the error of our estimator that hold uniformly over a policy class
and depends on the problem's dimension and policy class's complexity. Our
bounds show that under mild conditions, the error of our estimator vanishes as
the dimension of the optimization problem grows, even if the amount of
available data remains small and constant. Said differently, we prove our
estimator performs well in the small-data, large-scale regime. Finally, we

improved by adaptation of the diffusion noise distribution to given acoustic
features. In this study, we propose SpecGrad that adapts the diffusion noise so
that its time-varying spectral envelope becomes close to the conditioning
log-mel spectrogram. This adaptation by time-varying filtering improves the
sound quality especially in the high-frequency bands. It is processed in the
time-frequency domain to keep the computational cost almost the same as the
conventional DDPM-based neural vocoders. Experimental results showed that
SpecGrad generates higher-fidelity speech waveform than conventional DDPM-based
neural vocoders in both analysis-synthesis and speech enhancement scenarios.

that has found widespread applications. Examples include selecting offers,
prices, advertisements to send to customers, as well as selecting which
medication to prescribe to a patient. However, existing literature rests on the
crucial assumption that the future environment where the learned policy will be
deployed is the same as the past environment that has generated the data -- an
assumption that is often false or too coarse an approximation. In this paper,
we lift this assumption and aim to learn a distributionally robust policy with
incomplete observational data. We first present a policy evaluation procedure
that allows us to assess how well the policy does under the worst-case
environment shift. We then establish a central limit theorem type guarantee for
this proposed policy evaluation scheme. Leveraging this evaluation scheme, we
further propose a novel learning algorithm that is able to learn a policy that
is robust to adversarial perturbations and unknown covariate shifts with a
performance guarantee based on the theory of uniform convergence. Finally, we
empirically test the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in synthetic
datasets and demonstrate that it provides the robustness that is missing using
standard policy learning algorithms. We conclude the paper by providing a
comprehensive application of our methods in the context of a real-world voting
dataset.]]></summary>

representing high-dimensional distributions with structure. Recent years have
also seen big advances in designing multi-item mechanisms. Akin to overfitting,
however, these mechanisms can be extremely sensitive to the Bayesian prior that
they target, which becomes problematic when that prior is only approximately
known. At the same time, even if access to the exact Bayesian prior is given,
it is known that optimal or even approximately optimal multi-item mechanisms
run into sample, computational, representation and communication intractability
barriers.

We consider a natural class of multi-item mechanism design problems with very
large numbers of items, but where the bidders' value distributions can be
well-approximated by a topic model akin to those used in recommendation systems
with very large numbers of possible recommendations. We propose a mechanism
design framework for this setting, building on a recent robustification
framework by Brustle et al., which disentangles the statistical challenge of
estimating a multi-dimensional prior from the task of designing a good
mechanism for it, and robustifies the performance of the latter against the
estimation error of the former. We provide an extension of this framework
appropriate for our setting, which allows us to exploit the expressive power of
topic models to reduce the effective dimensionality of the mechanism design
problem and remove the dependence of its computational, communication and
representation complexity on the number of items.]]></summary>

data is a long-standing challenge, especially in materials which undergo large
deformation. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed deep-learning
framework for the discovery of constitutive model parameterizations given
full-field displacement data and global force-displacement data. Contrary to
the majority of recent literature in this field, we work with the weak form of
the governing equations rather than the strong form to impose physical
constraints upon the neural network predictions. The approach presented in this
paper is computationally efficient, suitable for irregular geometric domains,
and readily ingests displacement data without the need for interpolation onto a
computational grid. A selection of canonical hyperelastic materials models
suitable for different material classes is considered including the
Neo-Hookean, Gent, and Blatz-Ko constitutive models as exemplars for general
hyperelastic behavior, polymer behavior with lock-up, and compressible foam
behavior respectively. We demonstrate that physics informed machine learning is
an enabling technology and may shift the paradigm of how full-field
experimental data is utilized to calibrate constitutive models under finite

bi-level optimization. However, the existing gradient-based bi-level
optimization algorithms cannot handle nonconvex or nonsmooth regularizers, and
they suffer from a high computation complexity in nonconvex bi-level

adopts the approximate implicit differentiation (AID) scheme for nonconvex

particular, the algorithm applies the Nesterov's momentum to accelerate the
computation of the implicit gradient involved in AID. We provide a
comprehensive analysis of the global convergence properties of this algorithm
through identifying its intrinsic potential function. In particular, we
formally establish the convergence of the model parameters to a critical point
of the bi-level problem, and obtain an improved computation complexity
$\mathcal{O}(\kappa^{3.5}\epsilon^{-2})$ over the state-of-the-art result.
Moreover, we analyze the asymptotic convergence rates of this algorithm under a

decision making. However, true rewards can contain action-independent
redundancies that are not relevant for decision making and only increase the
statistical complexity of accurate estimation. It is sufficient and more
data-efficient to estimate the simplest function that explains the reward
differences between actions, that is, the heterogeneous treatment effect,
commonly understood to be more structured and simpler than the reward.
Motivated by this observation, building on recent work on oracle-based
algorithms, we design a statistically optimal and computationally efficient
algorithm using heterogeneous treatment effect estimation oracles. Our results
provide the first universal reduction of contextual bandits to a
general-purpose heterogeneous treatment effect estimation method. We show that
our approach is more robust to model misspecification than reward estimation
methods based on squared error regression oracles. Experimentally, we show the

We lay the ground for such research by evaluating on various architectures a
representative set of adversarial attacks: targeted and untargeted,
optimization and speech processing-based, white-box, black-box and targeted
attacks. Our results show that the relative strengths of different attack
algorithms vary considerably when changing the model architecture, and that the
results of some attacks are not to be blindly trusted. They also indicate that

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We focus on Partial Differential Equation (PDE) based Data Assimilatio
problems (DA) solved by means of variational approaches and Kalman filter
algorithm. Recently, we presented a Domain Decomposition framework (we call it
DD-DA, for short) performing a decomposition of the whole physical domain along
space and time directions, and joining the idea of Schwarz' methods and
parallel in time approaches. For effective parallelization of DD-DA algorithms,
the computational load assigned to subdomains must be equally distributed.
Usually computational cost is proportional to the amount of data entities
assigned to partitions. Good quality partitioning also requires the volume of
communication during calculation to be kept at its minimum. In order to deal
with DD-DA problems where the observations are nonuniformly distributed and
general sparse, in the present work we employ a parallel load balancing
algorithm based on adaptive and dynamic defining of boundaries of DD -- which
is aimed to balance workload according to data location. We call it DyDD. As
the numerical model underlying DA problems arising from the so-called
discretize-then-optimize approach is the constrained least square model (CLS),
we will use CLS as a reference state estimation problem and we validate DyDD on
different scenarios.]]></summary>

critical for predicting and explaining observed properties. Binary population
synthesis with full stellar-structure and evolution simulations are
computationally expensive requiring a large number of mass-transfer sequences.
The recently developed binary population synthesis code POSYDON incorporates
grids of MESA binary star simulations which are then interpolated to model
large-scale populations of massive binaries. The traditional method of
computing a high-density rectilinear grid of simulations is not scalable for
higher-dimension grids, accounting for a range of metallicities, rotation, and
eccentricity. We present a new active learning algorithm, psy-cris, which uses
machine learning in the data-gathering process to adaptively and iteratively
select targeted simulations to run, resulting in a custom, high-performance
training set. We test psy-cris on a toy problem and find the resulting training
sets require fewer simulations for accurate classification and regression than
either regular or randomly sampled grids. We further apply psy-cris to the
target problem of building a dynamic grid of MESA simulations, and we
demonstrate that, even without fine tuning, a simulation set of only $\sim 1/4$
the size of a rectilinear grid is sufficient to achieve the same classification
accuracy. We anticipate further gains when algorithmic parameters are optimized
for the targeted application. We find that optimizing for classification only
may lead to performance losses in regression, and vice versa. Lowering the
computational cost of producing grids will enable future versions of POSYDON to
cover more input parameters while preserving interpolation accuracies.]]></summary>

load monitoring (NILM) to predict and optimize appliance load distribution in
real-time. NILM, or energy disaggregation, refers to the decomposition of
electricity usage conditioned on the aggregated power signals (i.e., smart
sensor on the main channel). Based on real-time appliance power prediction
using sensory technology, energy disaggregation has great potential to increase
electricity efficiency and reduce energy expenditure. With the introduction of
transformer models, NILM has achieved significant improvements in predicting
device power readings. Nevertheless, transformers are less efficient due to
O(l^2) complexity w.r.t. sequence length l. Moreover, transformers can fail to
capture local signal patterns in sequence-to-point settings due to the lack of
inductive bias in local context. In this work, we propose an efficient
localness transformer for non-intrusive load monitoring (ELTransformer).
Specifically, we leverage normalization functions and switch the order of
matrix multiplication to approximate self-attention and reduce computational
complexity. Additionally, we introduce localness modeling with sparse local
attention heads and relative position encodings to enhance the model capacity
in extracting short-term local patterns. To the best of our knowledge,
ELTransformer is the first NILM model that addresses computational complexity
and localness modeling in NILM. With extensive experiments and quantitative
analyses, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the the proposed
ELTransformer with considerable improvements compared to state-of-the-art
baselines.]]></summary>

modeling scheme, which takes into account the heterogeneity of the speakers in
each training segment and batch. We randomly and synthetically augment the
training data into a set of segments, each of which contains more than one
speaker and some overlapping parts. A soft label is imposed on each segment
based on its speaker occupation ratio, and the standard cross entropy loss is
implemented in model training. In this way, the speaker model should have the
ability to generate a geometrically meaningful embedding for each multi-speaker
segment. Experimental results show that our system is superior to the baseline
system using x-vectors in two speaker diarization tasks. In the CALLHOME task

knowledge of old classes is a very challenging research problem. Moreover, it
is imperative that such learning must respect certain memory and computational
constraints such as (i) training samples are limited to only a few per class,
(ii) the computational cost of learning a novel class remains constant, and
(iii) the memory footprint of the model grows at most linearly with the number
of classes observed. To meet the above constraints, we propose C-FSCIL, which
is architecturally composed of a frozen meta-learned feature extractor, a
trainable fixed-size fully connected layer, and a rewritable dynamically
growing memory that stores as many vectors as the number of encountered
classes. C-FSCIL provides three update modes that offer a trade-off between
accuracy and compute-memory cost of learning novel classes. C-FSCIL exploits
hyperdimensional embedding that allows to continually express many more classes
than the fixed dimensions in the vector space, with minimal interference. The
quality of class vector representations is further improved by aligning them
quasi-orthogonally to each other by means of novel loss functions. Experiments
on the CIFAR100, miniImageNet, and Omniglot datasets show that C-FSCIL
outperforms the baselines with remarkable accuracy and compression. It also
scales up to the largest problem size ever tried in this few-shot setting by
learning 423 novel classes on top of 1200 base classes with less than 1.6%
accuracy drop. Our code is available at

that describe the objects in the scene, and interpreting supplemental sentences
that relate the novel concept with other concepts. The learned concepts support
downstream applications, such as answering questions by reasoning about unseen
images. Our model, namely FALCON, represents individual visual concepts, such
as colors and shapes, as axis-aligned boxes in a high-dimensional space (the
"box embedding space"). Given an input image and its paired sentence, our model
first resolves the referential expression in the sentence and associates the
novel concept with particular objects in the scene. Next, our model interprets
supplemental sentences to relate the novel concept with other known concepts,
such as "X has property Y" or "X is a kind of Y". Finally, it infers an optimal
box embedding for the novel concept that jointly 1) maximizes the likelihood of
the observed instances in the image, and 2) satisfies the relationships between
the novel concepts and the known ones. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
model on both synthetic and real-world datasets.]]></summary>

positional embeddings, to process natural language sequences. Surprisingly, we
find that transformer language models without any explicit positional encoding
are still competitive with standard models, and that this phenomenon is robust
across different datasets, model sizes, and sequence lengths. Probing
experiments reveal that such models acquire an implicit notion of absolute
positions throughout the network, effectively compensating for the missing

Identifying whether or not the residents of the house are present, is important
in numerous scenarios. Possible scenarios include but are not limited to:
elderly people living alone, people suffering from dementia, home quarantine.
The majority of published papers focus on either pressure / door sensors or
cameras in order to detect outing events. Although the aforementioned
approaches provide solid results, they are intrusive and require modifications
for sensor placement. In our work, appliance electrical use is investigated as
a means for detecting the presence or absence of residents. The energy use is
the result of power disaggregation, a non intrusive / non invasive sensing
method. Since a dataset providing energy data and ground truth for home absence
is not available, artificial outing events were introduced on the UK-DALE
dataset, a well known dataset for Non Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM). Several
machine learning algorithms were evaluated using the generated dataset.
Benchmark results have shown that home absence detection using appliance power
consumption is feasible.]]></summary>

 Assume you have a simulation or access to an environment. There are certain parameters you can set to control the performance of a system which lives in this simulation/environment. Naturally, one wants to find the optimal parameters or optimal policy to set the parameter that can result the most reward, however that is defined. 
 For example, in the stock market, I may want to find the optimal market price to buy and sell, or the optimal policy. In a car driving game, I may want to determine the optimal policy to set speed and direction. 
 Do we know if there is formal way to study this type of problem? Thank you!

 So we decided to make a change proactively, and now we are in the process of enabling SSO for it. The initial result looks promising. Check it out to see what we have done: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7hBBLG5Fdc
 Is this something that you would love to have?
 Any other machine learning tools that you want to have SSO capability as well?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pretraining of BERT-type large language models, which may scale up to billions of parameters, is essential to achieving best-in-class performance on various natural language processing (NLP) applications. However, the pretraining procedure is costly, and it has become a hurdle for the industrial deployment of big language models.
 In a research paper, researchers from Google, New York University, and the University of Maryland recommend a simple but effective “token dropping” method that drastically reduces the pretraining cost of transformer models like BERT while maintaining downstream fine-tuning performance.
 Token dropping is a technique for speeding up the pretraining of transformer models like BERT without sacrificing their performance on downstream tasks. Starting with an intermediate layer in the model, they eliminate uninteresting tokens to let the model focus on key tokens more effectively, given its limited computing resources. The model’s last layer then picks up the dropped tokens, producing full-length sequences. They use the built-in masked language modeling (MLM) loss and its dynamics to detect non-essential tokens with little computing complexity. According to their tests, this straightforward strategy decreases BERT’s pretraining cost by 25% while yielding somewhat higher overall fine-tuning performance on conventional downstream tasks.

 Exploration is one of the oldest challenges for Reinforcement Learning algorithms, with no clear solution to date. Especially in environments with sparse rewards, agents face significant challenges in deciding which parts of the environment to explore further. Providing intrinsic motivation in form of a pseudo-reward is sometimes used to overcome this challenge, but often relies on hand-crafted heuristics, and can lead to deceptive dead-ends. This paper proposes to use language descriptions of encountered states as a method of assessing novelty. In two procedurally generated environments, they demonstrate the usefulness of language, which is in itself highly concise and abstractive, which lends itself well for this task.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Benchmarks are an important way to measure progress in AI research – but artificial intelligence is constantly achieving new bests. Are we running out of AI benchmarks? 
 ...
 Researchers at the Medical University of Vienna and the University of Oxford now show in a meta-study of AI benchmarks that saturated or stagnant benchmarks are common. The researchers examined 1,688 benchmarks with 406 tasks in computer vision and natural language processing since 2013, and draw the following conclusions:
  
In some cases, there would be continuous growth, such as in the ImageNet benchmark.
 However, a majority of all benchmarks quickly reach technological stagnation or saturation.
 In some cases, a lack of research interest is also a cause of stagnation. The researchers cite the UCF101 action recognition benchmark as an example of saturation.
 However, the dynamics of performance improvement do not follow a clearly discernible pattern: in some cases, phases of stagnation are followed by unpredictable leaps. This is what happened in the PROTEINS benchmark.
  
...
 Moreover, of the 1,688 benchmarks, only 66 percent have more than three results at different points in time – so in practice, 33 percent of all AI benchmarks are not used and therefore useless. 
 ...
 In the future, new benchmarks should be developed by large, collaborative teams from many institutions, knowledge domains, and cultures to ensure high-quality benchmarks and avoid fragmentation of the benchmark landscape, the researchers conclude.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Integrating machine learning capabilities to MySQL systems is prohibitively difficult and time-consuming. The process involves extracting data from the database and into another system to construct and deploy machine learning models. As data flows around, this strategy produces silos for applying machine learning to application data and causes latency. This results in data leakage, making the database more open to security attacks. Moreover, existing machine learning (ML) solutions lack the ability to explain why the model developers build delivers specific predictions.
 Recently, Oracle released MySQL HeatWave, the only MySQL cloud database service that supports in-database machine learning (ML). It automates the ML lifecycle and saves all trained models in the MySQL database, removing the need to migrate data or models to a machine learning tool or service. This decreases application complexity, saves costs, and increases data and model security. It produces a model with the best algorithm, features, and hyper-parameters for a specific data collection and application.

Automatic translation of speech from one language to speech in another language, called speech-to-speech translation (S2ST), is important for breaking down the communication barriers between people speaking different languages. Conventionally, automatic S2ST systems are built with a cascade of automatic speech recognition (ASR), text-to-text machine translation (MT), and text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis sub-systems, so that the system overall is text-centric. Recently, work on S2ST that doesn’t rely on intermediate text representation is emerging, such as end-to-end direct S2ST (e.g., Translatotron) and cascade S2ST based on learned discrete representations of speech (e.g., Tjandra et al.).

The training loop now has a new graph state (edges changed between nodes) plus a vector of the first action selected. 
 The agent is able to learn well however, even with a negative reward provided to the agent if it takes illegal actions (choosing the same node in each step and thus creating a self connection), even when it learns to maximise reward, it still take illegal actions…]]></summary>

 This is my first time trying reinforcement learning and Unity and wanted some help. 
 I am trying to train a quadcopter to hover and keep a stationary ball in its camera frame using just visual inputs by a camera sensor. So the input to the network would be an 84*84 grayscale image and the output would be the four forces to the rotor.
 My reward function is 
 ​
 Reward Function
 where x and y is the position of the drone and a is the rotation of the drone with respect to the target. I have set A, d and c to 3 and lambda as 1/180. I have also added a condition where if the quadcopter drops below a certain height from the platform, it punishes it by a reward of -1 and resets the episode.
 The network I am using is the ppop network used by the coin-collector example in mlagents. 
 My training log is below: 
 Training log
 The cumulative reward and episode length just drops after a while and the value loss explodes. I think something maybe wrong with my rewards or network. 
 If anyone has any ideas what might be going wrong and tell me, that would be great. 
 Thanks

 I want to run a feedforward autoregressive network to forecast the potential sales of specific SKUs for the following months. The idea is to capture the non-linearity in the data. Does it make sense to use ReLU? or given that all my data points are positive values this function will return the same number (max(0,x)), therefore is not suitable for what I am trying to do?
 I have also checked other activation functions, but sigmoid for example is for classification, and hyperbolic tangent returns values that can be negative.

 We designed it as a drop-in replacement for ReLU, and we would love to hear what you think.
 The code is up on GitHub, and the preprint should be up soon, too: https://github.com/rasbt/cyclemoid-pytorch
 PS: Currently, we only have a PyTorch implementation but would welcome it if someone could port it to TensorFlow/Keras (my Tf/Keras skills are just too rusty for it.)

 - comma.ai self-driving system.
 - Weather nowcasting
 - Tokamak fision reactor feeedback control
 - Hardware design: New gen. TPU
 - Datacenter cooling optimization
 - Adaptive locomotion for quadrupedal robots *
 - Portfolio optimization (financial instruments)
 There is a lot of work in games, particularly board games, but these do not really solve something "useful" for society. I have seen also lots of toy examples with libraries like gym and some robotics but in general these are rather proof-of-concept models or just models that do not work at all. One that actually does work is Solving Rubik’s Cube with a Robot Hand, not regarding the solution of the cube but its dexterous manipulation with a robotic hand. This is pretty cool, but again, the domain of the problem is too narrow to be considered actually a successful application to a real-world problem. So my question is, am I missing some examples? For example, is any company out there trying to apply deep RL to self-driving vehicles or to NLP, and have they had any success?
 * Boston dynamics solves this without ML, just good'ol control theory so this is a 50-50 win for RL.
 ​
 Edit: Thanks everyone for the responses, I have updated the list with more projects from the comments.
 Edit 2: Took Alphafold out because the current version (2.x) does not use RL.

Chatbots will be armed with Conversational AI - and powered by an in-depth understanding of the client and their past behaviors - will be able to offer the service which is most likely to suit each client.
 Retailers can take advantage of the ability to engage potential customers through virtual attendants. Along with this opportunity is a growing range of new and exciting ways to utilize chatbots within retail spaces. A lack of customer engagement through mobile messaging costs retailers around $1 trillion annually, as customers are increasingly becoming reluctant to contact mainstream outlets for recommendations due to their negative experiences, or because they have already made up their mind on what they want.
 This can be potentially overcome by utilizing Chatbots; in-store systems powered by AI that can be utilized across multiple channels, including the outlet's website and branded social media profiles.

 The thing is that I want to study text-to-image synthesis; but I see that there are lots of work already done up until now. I am kind of confused about how I should start studying.
 About my experience, I am trying to learn as much as I can. I started by following Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning course on Coursera; and now I continue with Deep Learning Specialization (almost finished). Apart from these, I check NVIDIA blog, some YouTube channels, Slack communities and of course here on Reddit along with a few other channels. As I said, I am trying to follow what’s going on. 
 To tell the truth, I didn’t do much in terms of building models. I mean, not a real-life project or something like that. My experience is more based on projects for the courses that I attend/attended. By the way, I don’t know how it will affect things’ turning out; but I have recently begun a graduate program as well in artificial intelligence. Moreover, during my undergraduate program, I took some courses that might help (at least I guess so) including Calculus and Linear Algebra.
 I also want to mention that as for hardware there is an NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit available to me.
 I hope that what I am asking is clear and information I provided help you answering. If not, please ask me.
 Best regards.

 I am working on an extension of this implementation https://github.com/philtabor/Youtube-Code-Repository/tree/master/ReinforcementLearning/ICM of the intrinsic curiosity module. It uses A3C(Actor -critic) as a policy and the ICM is a bolt on module.
 I need to fix the seeds for reproducibility but no matter what i have tried I cannot achieve it.
 The implementation uses multithreading on cpu and plays on the oepnai gym cartpole or atari environments.
 I believe that it has something to do with multithreading but im not sure.
 Could someone know what is the solution?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently I’m trying to figure out if I want to stay in academia or not. My decision hinges on what makes doing science enjoyable. My current understanding is in order for science to be enjoyable, there has to be an element of surprise. A tension that builds. And release of that tension. This is most obvious in theoretical works where the scientist makes a prediction, and later empirical data verifies that prediction. Excitement. Joy. Wonder. In experimental work, surprise can take the form of not knowing how the experiment will turn out. Once you get the result of the experiment, it'll disambiguate competing theories you had in your mind or elucidate a new theory. "Everything clicks" or at the very least you'll be put into a fever trying to integrate the new surprising data with previous …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Folks,
 I'm in a bit of a dilemma here on a specific fine grained classification problem that we have. The task at hand is to classify the subspecies of plant seeds. Firstly, the seeds are super tiny, but we have camera setup to take zoomed images of the seeds. Secondly, even the experts can't tell the exact difference between 2 subspecies of seeds. They go by their experience and intuition. All the subspecies put together looks similar but the data points within the same subspecies are vastly different. The requirement being classifying the subspecies based on their morphological properties. Here is the catch, the requirement is 98%+ accuracy. I tried few preprocessing and models (transformers, resnets, inception and other sort) but can't hit the 98% accuracy mark. Even if I could, the model sometimes fail on external sets or on production.
 I would like some expert (ML side) take on this issue on how to approach this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, Reddit!
 Excited to share with you guys, Nix-TTS 🐤! Our latest research in lightweight neural Text-to-Speech.
 We've seen how synthetic voices generated by recent neural TTS are getting more and more natural, but most of the time the models suffer from slow CPU inference and are not end-to-end, which requires an additional vocoder model.
 Nix-TTS 🐤 is an incredibly lightweight end-to-end TTS model achieved by applying non end-to-end knowledge distillation to a powerful yet large-sized generative TTS teacher model.
 Our proposed model is end-to-end (vocoder-free) with only 5.23M parameters or up to 82% reduction of the teacher model. We also employed a stochastic duration predictor to improve its expressiveness.
 It is capable to run 10x faster than real-time on Intel i7 CPU and 0.5 times faster than real-time on Raspberry Pi Model 3B. Making it suitable for deployment in resource-constrained settings. Here we attached the complexity and speedup detail from the paper.
 ​

 If you could change/significantly improve one thing about building ML systems, what would it be? Some examples could be:
  
Reducing the computational overhead
 Reducing or eliminating the need for large datasets
 Simplifying the process of constructing models
  
However, it’s not limited to just those three.
 Curious to see where this goes!

We can get multimodal data(texts, images, and audio) and we want to do this: collect negative and positive pairs from each user's swiping history and do a binary classification (matching). Then we would get together as many users' data as possible and train a model.
 Though it sounds nice, this is hard as we could not find an existing developer tool or paper that supports combining such rich multimodal data. Any existing research out there to achieve this task? Moreover, is there already any library or AutoML tool that supports this? Checked Google AutoML, does not support this.
 Any help and advice would be much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/MachineLearning,
 https://github.com/jacobgil/pytorch-grad-cam is a project that has a comprehensive collection of Pixel Attribution Methods for PyTorch (like the package name grad-cam that was the original algorithm implemented).
 Typically pixel attribution methods are adapted for classification: they let you understand what part of the image correspond to a certain classification category.
 However some deep learning models output embeddings instead of category scores.You can then match these embeddings against other embeddings and measure their similarity. For example: in face recognition models, or in self supervised networks.
 In this case to apply pixel attribution, we could create embeddings of concepts, and then for new query images we would be asking: "what parts of the image have feature representations that match the concept features?"
 Or in other words: "where in the query image do we see the concepts?"
 ​
 I wrote a tutorial that shows how to use the pytorch-grad-cam project, to adapt pixel attribution for the embedding case, and visualize where different concept feature representations match the image:
 https://github.com/jacobgil/pytorch-grad-cam/blob/master/tutorials/Pixel%20Attribution%20for%20embeddings.ipynb
 An example is the image below. The two left images are "concept" images of clouds, and a car.
 Then given a new query image, we can try to see where in the image do we feature representations that match these concepts.
 Given images of concepts and a query image, attribute what parts of the query image match the concepts
 I hope someone finds this useful !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Say a computer vision model learns a pattern you don't want it to, you know that it's learnt it because of analysis through tools like occlusion sensitivity map.
 What data-centric techniques can you use to resolve it? Could some form of cropping augmentation do the trick?Classic example is ruler beside melanoma, while there may be a correlation between presence of ruler and presence of melanoma you don't want to the model to depend on that information because it may not exist 'in production'. Below is a quotation describing another similar problem.
 "In another paper a similar issue was found because doctors sometimes use purple markers to highlight potentially-malignant skin cancers for easier examination. Some argue that the purple marks are a real signal that should be incorporated in the model just as the visual appearance of the tumor itself is incorporated. However, if your goal is robust generalizability over time it is probably best to not have your AI incorporate the human applied purple marks as signal, as the standards for applying those marks may vary across teams and across time." https://menloml.com/2020/01/11/recognizing-a-ruler-instead-of-a-cancer/
 f you're working with that dataset, what tools are available to you to solve that problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05483
 TL;DR; from LeCun: Recurrent nets in which the weight matrix is unitary are interesting beasts: they are invertible, they don't suffer from vanishing/exploding gradient, and they perform computation akin to what happens in quantum computers. training them can be difficult or expensive. We propose a low-rank (low-cost) update method to update unitary weight matrices with gradient descent.
 Abstract: In learning with recurrent or very deep feed-forward networks, employing unitary matrices in each layer can be very effective at maintaining long-range stability. However, restricting network parameters to be unitary typically comes at the cost of expensive parameterizations or increased training runtime. We propose instead an efficient method based on rank-k updates -- or their rank-k approximation -- that maintains performance at a nearly optimal training runtime. We introduce two variants of this method, named Direct (projUNN-D) and Tangent (projUNN-T) projected Unitary Neural Networks, that can parameterize full N-dimensional unitary or orthogonal matrices with a training runtime scaling as O(kN^2). Our method either projects low-rank gradients onto the closest unitary matrix (projUNN-T) or transports unitary matrices in the direction of the low-rank gradient (projUNN-D). Even in the fastest setting (k=1), projUNN is able to train a model's unitary parameters to reach comparable performances against baseline implementations. By integrating our projUNN algorithm into both recurrent and convolutional neural networks, our models can closely match or exceed benchmarked results from state-of-the-art algorithms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi-object tracking aims to locate and track all objects in a video feed. It’s a fundamental component in domains like mobile robots, where an autonomous system must navigate dynamic surroundings populated by other mobile agents. Thanks to breakthroughs in deep learning and object detection, tracking-by-detection has become the dominant tracking paradigm in recent years.
 Tracking-by-detection simplifies the process by reducing it to just two steps: detection and association. First, an object detector searches each video stream frame for probable items. The second phase is an association step, which connects detections over time. Local trackers are greedy when it comes to pairwise relationships. They keep track of each trajectory’s state based on its position and/or identity traits and correlate current-frame detections with it based on its last visible status.

But when it comes to document classification, in terms of using embeddings for a downstream classification task, would that be considered tabular data? You will end up with data that fits in a table that you wish to classify...it's high dimensional but you could reduce dimensions until you end up with just a smaller set of columns and the labels. 
 I guess I'm unclear about what defines tabular data in this context, and if it makes sense to use a different model (like XBGboost) for the classification task, vs having it as a final layer in the embedding network.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm having a doubt that may be a little stupid, but I ask to be sure.
 Assume that in my environment rewards are delayed by a random number n of steps, i.e. the agent takes an action but receives the reward n steps after taking that action. At every step a reward is produced, therefore the reward r_t in transitions s_t, a_t, r_t, s_{t+1} collected by the agent is actually the reward corresponding to the transition at time t-n. 
 An example scenario: the RL agent control a transportation network, and a reward is generated only when a package reach its destination. Thus, the reward arrives with possibly several steps of delay with respect to when the relevant actions were taken. 
 Now, I know that delayed rewards are not generally an issue, e.g. all those settings in which there is only one reward +1 at the end, but I am wondering if this case is equivalent. What makes me wonder is that here, for a state s_t onwards to state s_{t+n}, there are n rewards in the middle that depend on states previous to s_t. 
 Does this make the problem non-markovian? How can one learn the value function V(s_t) if its estimation is always affected by unrelated rewards r_{t-n} ... r_{t-1}?

 Abstract: A fundamental goal of scientific research is to learn about causal relationships. However, despite its critical role in the life and social sciences, causality has not had the same importance in Natural Language Processing (NLP), which has traditionally placed more emphasis on predictive tasks. This distinction is beginning to fade, with an emerging area of interdisciplinary research at the convergence of causal inference and language processing. Still, research on causality in NLP remains scattered across domains without unified definitions, benchmark datasets and clear articulations of the remaining challenges. In this survey, we consolidate research across academic areas and situate it in the broader NLP landscape. We introduce the statistical challenge of estimating causal effects, encompassing settings where text is used as an outcome, treatment, or as a means to address confounding. In addition, we explore potential uses of causal inference to improve the performance, robustness, fairness, and interpretability of NLP models. We thus provide a unified overview of causal inference for the computational linguistics community.

The initial idea was to use the camera to identify playing cards and sorting them into groups, like different suits, odd/even, face and non face, but after meeting with the professor in charge, was informed that this idea of identifying and sorting is not really marketable. I tried explaining that sorting in the different ways could be used in many different applications and businesses, but still was told it was not really marketable. I was wondering if maybe there was a way to tweak it a bit to make it so, or if maybe turning it into an API would help. Any ideas and/or opinions on the project would be very helpful. Thank you very much.
 I understand this may fall under beginner related questions and project, but was curious to know if my group and I are on a right track or not, as we haven’t had any sort of guidance up to date.

 In China, the state and companies are researching AI models with trillions of parameters. They want to prove that they can develop “brain-scale” AI.
 In the race to build ever-larger AI models, China is showing that cooperation between the state, universities and the private sector holds the potential for gigantic AI models. The researchers are talking about “brain-scale” AI: according to their definition, these are AI models with parameters beyond the 100-trillion mark.
 ...
 In a new paper, researchers from Tsinghua University, Alibaba Group, Zhejiang Lab and Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence present BaGuaLu, a framework that enables the training of large AI models using the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture.
 ...
 In an initial test, the researchers trained a 1.93 trillion model with their framework, outperforming Google’s Switch Transformer. They also demonstrate that their framework enables models with 14.5 trillion and a full 174 trillion parameters.
 ...
 BaGuaLu could soon be used to train the first models beyond 100 trillion parameters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello reddit hivemind,
 This might be a quite specific question but im not sure where else to go and ask. I'm currently an intern and charged with implementing and comparing different active learning algorithms to see which work best for our specific usecase. Since the coreset approach ( [1708.00489] Active Learning for Convolutional Neural Networks: A Core-Set Approach (arxiv.org) ) is now around for a long time, one of the best documented and shows promising results in a variety of papers I implemented it and ran some experiments with it. The results were a bit dissappointing. It got even outperformed by the random baseline .... To understand the bad performance I dug a bit deeper since I spend a significant amount of time implementing it. What I made out now as the issue is using the l_2 norm of penultimate layer as the metric. This leads to an oversampling of data samples with a certain softmax output due to the way the softmax function behaves. Has someone experienced the same issues? The only point where I could see coreset to be of some use is with a dataset that has a ton of redundant/similar images.
 Thank's a lot

 During the project implementation for my bachelor's thesis [1], a software (named dike, as the Greek goddess of justice) capable of analyzing malicious programs using artificial intelligence techniques, I was unable to locate an open source dataset with labeled malware samples in the public domain. As a result, I created DikeDataset, a dataset with labeled PE and OLE samples [2]. Because it was not the main focus of my thesis, the samples attributes are not evenly distributed (the benign-malicious and OLE-PE ratios are quite low), but the dataset aided greatly in the research process.
 This week, I was surprised to see that the public GitHub repository (which was used only for storage, without any promotion on communities like this) gained some organic reach (views, clones and stars). Furthermore, I was thrilled to learn that it was used in a research article published in 2021 [3]!
 As a result, I'd like to share this project with the community in the hopes that it will be useful to some members of the community.

 Some time ago, we had the idea to start building tools to facilitate 3D computer vision development. We started by looking at some of the 3D tools out there and realized that there wasn't anything that fit our needs or could be extended to do some of the things we wanted to do. 
 We started working on a tool to annotate point clouds with different label types (bounding box, rectangles, keypoints) to use as a base for our projects. We recently open sourced the tool, which you can find here: https://github.com/StrayRobots/3d-annotation-tool
 In the future we might add more tools, for example to paint point clouds or a polygon label type. 
 We would love to hear your feedback on the tool. Has anyone here built any 3D vision datasets? What kind of tools did you use?

 I work as a web dev for almost 2 years. Before that when I was studying in college, I thought ML is the only field which was in demand. I put my 100% into it but the professor was so bad that not only me but a lot of my peers found ML,DS to be very difficult. We were able to built project around but never tried to learn more. 
 I tired many udemy or coursea courses but never found it engaging. 
 Is it just me or did you also found ML difficult? Is my approach to learning it wrong? If anyone has any advice I'd really appreciate it

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently working on a project related to multimodal summarization using transformers.
 My input is a image and long text and output will be a summary of the text pertaining to the image.
 ​
 For extracting image features, I'm using pretrained resnet model. It gives me a [49 * 2048] vector for an image.
 For extracting paragraph features, I'm getting embeddings for each sentence, so the data_dimension will be [no_of_sentences * 512]
 ​
 I need to attend to both these set of features and generate output. I have gone through tutorials to understand the working of transformers but couldn't understand how to combine these into a single input so that the encoder can attend over both image and the paragraph together at the same time.
 ​
 Any pointers to tutorials will be very helpful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, an anonymous open letter and accompanying Financial Times (paywall) article were published accusing DeepMind of mishandling allegations of sexual abuse by a senior member of the research team. 
 The FT article (reported on here in Fortune) goes on to suggest that the mishandling may have been deliberate in order to exploit legal loopholes in the UK where victims have a limited amount of time to take a case to employment tribunal. 
 This comes shortly after Mustafa Suleyman, one of the cofounders was quietly shuffled out to Google (he has subsequently left and founded a new startup with another DeepMind alum) after he was found to have bullied and humiliated staff for years.
 Google itself also has a poor record when it comes to sexual harassment, bullying and retaliation at the highest levels resulting in payouts of hundreds of millions of dollars. 
 Given that DeepMind and Google have a pretty strong grip on the development of AI in terms of employing many of the key people across many of the various subfields, having access to unparalleled data and compute and pushing forward more and more into health (for example the DeepMind offshoot Isomorphic Labs which itself is headed by Demis and staffed by DeepMinders, and the various Google healthcare bets and projects), can we really trust them to be stewards of fair and responsible AI development? 
 Bad things happen in all large organizations. But DeepMind isn’t that big and in the past five years, DeepMind leadership have presided over a steady stream of sexual harassment, bullying and other scandals and handled them all extremely poorly and showed little signs that things have changed. This points to something rotten in the culture and leadership there and at it’s parent organization.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Surveillance cameras have an identity crisis exacerbated by a conflict between function and privacy. Machine learning techniques have automated video content analysis on a vast scale as these sophisticated small sensors have shown up seemingly everywhere. Still, with increased mass monitoring, there are currently no legally enforceable standards to curb privacy invasions.
 Security cameras have evolved into wiser and more capable tools than the grainy images of the past, which were frequently used as the “hero tool” in crime dramas. Video surveillance can now assist health regulators in determining the percentage of persons using masks, transportation departments in monitoring the density and flow of automobiles, cyclists and walkers, and businesses in gaining a better understanding of buying habits. But why has privacy remained a second-class citizen?
 Privid
 Currently, the footage is retrofitted with blurred faces or black boxes. This prevents analysts from asking some legitimate questions (for example, are people wearing masks? ). Dissatisfied with the present status quo, MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) developed a system with other institutions to better guarantee privacy in surveillance video footage. The system, dubbed “Privid,” allows analysts to input video data searches and then adds a tiny amount of noise (additional data) to the result to ensure that no one can be identified. The method is based on a formal notion of privacy known as “differential privacy,” which permits without having access to aggregate statistics about private data disclosing individually identifying information.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So in the pose estimation landscape (specifically 3D) there are 3 common evaluation metrics MPJPE (mean per joint precision error measured in mm), PCK (percent correct keypoints measured at a 150mm threshold) and then AUC. One oddity I have noticed when training a few models is that a model with a lower MPJPE then some methods does not alwayshave a higher PCK (higher is better for this metric) but the mean joint precsion error is substantially below the threshold used for PCK (I do recognize that this metric is an average).

 Does anyone have any experience with this, seen the same behavior, or have any intuition why this would be occurring?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today Google had a webinar on Tensorflow Quantum for big data, which I attended. I was surprised that it was almost all quantum computing theory, but there was a link in the talk resources to Tensorflow Quantum where I was told I could find a tutorial with demo code for a classifier system to compare it to my classical approaches -- I use logistic regression, support vector machine, and Tensorflow DNN classifiers; mostly SVM because it works almost as accurately on my job's data sets as DNNs but takes a tiny fraction of the time to train.
 So, I took a look at it: https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum/tutorials/mnist
 This was the first sign that quantum classification might not be a viable alternative:
  
An image size of 28x28 is much too large for current quantum computers.
 -- https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum/tutorials/mnist#12_downscale_the_images
  
You really have to see it to believe it, but this demo requires downscaling legible digits for handwriting recognition to 4-by-4 pixel completely indiscernible blobs! Resulting in, as you might expect, terrible accuracy. A classical model using the full resolution images achieves 99.9%+ accuracy in relatively almost no time to train.
 So I scrolled down to the "Comparison" section and saw this:
  
a classical model of similar power (~32 parameters) trains to a similar accuracy in a fraction of the time. One way or the other, the classical neural network easily outperforms the quantum neural network. For classical data, it is difficult to beat a classical neural network.
  
The remainder of the tutorial didn't offer any improvement. The "quantum convolutional" NN classifier wasn't any better in speed or accuracy.
  
So, am I correct in assuming that I am best off ignoring quantum computing for classification tasks for the foreseeable future?
 How long do you think it will be until quantum ML can compete on real-world problems?

 after testing a bit I found it helps training if you modify how many N steps you reset epsilon as you train, e.g. I start on 3k for 100k frames and then 10k for 100k frames and then no resetting.
 I can't be the first and I understand there are much more mathematically stronger exploration techniques but is this a poorman's exploration technique?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Training datasets are very important for experimenting with varied data to train new AI models. However, many commonly used public data sets contain labeling errors. This makes it challenging to train robust models, particularly for novel tasks. Many researchers use techniques such as employing a variety of data quality control procedures to overcome these shortcomings. However, there is no centralized repository consisting of examples of using these strategies.
 Meta AI researchers have recently released Mephisto. It is a new platform to collect, share, and iterate on the most promising approaches to collecting training datasets for AI models. Researchers can exchange unique collecting strategies with Mephisto in a reusable and iterable format. It also allows them to change out components and quickly locate the exact annotations required, minimizing the barrier to custom task creation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello All,
 I am currently working on the project wherein I have to apply DL to CFD simulations. The simulation data is basically a set of 2d points (x,y) and their corresponding velocity and pressure values. I have such data for a 100 timesteps. The goal is to predict the flow(i.e. velocity and pressure) for each grid point for the last time step. I was thinking of reshaping the data in the form of a square so that I can use a CNN, but using a CNN wouldn't take care of the time dependence between the data. Is there a hybrid approach I can use that can take care of both temporal and spatial dependencies?
 ​
 Really need some guidance. Even any unrelated advice would be much appreciated. Thank you in advance!
 ​
 Edit: Also needed some help with regards to making the dataset. I have 100 csv files, each file corresponding to one time step. Each file contains the pressure and velocities of around 900 points. How do I make a dataset out of this either in pytorch or tensorflow?

 One interesting thing, even if a person already had one of these, is the way the bias and bias gradient were calculated. It only cost O(out_channels), ignoring the data size entirely.

 By making the AI guess what would be around the square of the video? 
 I remember I once saw something like this in a video on two minute papers youtube channel
 Where they used an example with a eagle flying in the sky
 But I haven't been able to find the video since
 And I have been looking for a long time 
 But having such AI will be very help full to video editing

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pretty much as the title says. I work in research with electroencephalography (EEG) classification (those electrodes they stick on peoples heads). EEG is notoriously noisy and prone to overfitting, I have generally used validation accuracy as an optimization metric for a Bayesian HP tuning approach, but I find this tends to result in fairly unreliable models, even using cross validation approaches. These models are really noisy and while they may reach pretty good accuracy, that is a single epoch where it got a decent spike. I was wondering if there are common resolutions for this that I have missed, or if anyone has had luck with a custom metric that takes into account not just the validation accuracy, but the consistency and the difference between validation and training accuracy to better account for overfitting. Thanks!

 Recently I'm on research about neural architecture search. While reading through tons of papers about neural architecture search, I just got curious about 'how do we predefine primitive operations?' Because most of the paper goes like 'we have these ops in candidates, and we searched through candidates so elegantly...' I mean, how do we know we've predefined our candidates well? Is there any reference to 'good ops candidates'? I know certain cells and ops are often used in certain tasks, but still, I want to find a robust reference about 'The ops candidates for NAS'.
 It will cure my high blood pressure if you guys give your precious opinions about it.

These could be reports, reviews, briefs, policies, etc. Nowadays, readers wish to have a concise summary including major elements of their document, helping them prioritize their work efficiently. However, writing a document summary from scratch manually is a time-consuming task.
 To aid document writers in writing content summaries, Google announced a new feature enabling Google Docs to generate ideas automatically when they are available. The team employs a machine learning (ML) model to understand document text and provide a one- to two-sentence natural language description of the material. On the other hand, the document writer retains complete control, choosing whether to accept the proposal as-is, make necessary adjustments to better capture the document summary, or ignore it entirely. This section, combined with the outline, can help readers understand and navigate the work at a high level. While anybody can contribute summaries, only Google Workspace business customers have access to auto-generated ideas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had an idea recently for a ML regression strategy and I'm just wondering if something like this already exists. It has similarities with both boosting and bagging, but I think it's ultimately different from both.
 The basic idea is that you start with a subset of input features and train a model on that subset. Any common model will do as long as it doesn't just spit out the exact target value when making a prediction on the training set (i.e., you couldn't use a 1-neighbor KNN). After fitting the model, you make predictions on the training set (with the same subset of features) and calculate the prediction errors.
 Then using another subset of features (I would think it should be mutually exclusive from the first subset but maybe it doesn't have to be), you train a separate model, but rather than training on the original Y training data, you use the error of the previous model as the target for the second model.
 You repeat this process until all features have been used or as many times as desired. To make a prediction, the parent model would simply sum the predictions of the child models.
 As an additional thought, you might use more regularization, larger leaf size for decision trees, etc. for each additional model. You could also use bagging to create multiple instances of the strategy with different feature subsets in order to create multiple "pathways" through the data.
 A few questions:
  
Is this sufficiently different from existing boosting/bagging techniques?
 If yes to #1, are there any existing packages (preferably in Python) that implement this kind of technique?
 Could this be used to reduce overfitting for higher dimensional datasets? If so, would additional steps need to be taken (e.g., like the iterative regularization scheme I mentioned)? My thought is that it's a kind of divide-and-conquer strategy where each subsequent model is asked to do a little less than the previous model.
  
Any thoughts are appreciated.

 Abstract: Representation learning constructs low-dimensional representations to summarize essential features of high-dimensional data. This learning problem is often approached by describing various desiderata associated with learned representations; e.g., that they be non-spurious, efficient, or disentangled. It can be challenging, however, to turn these intuitive desiderata into formal criteria that can be measured and enhanced based on observed data. In this paper, we take a causal perspective on representation learning, formalizing non-spuriousness and efficiency (in supervised representation learning) and disentanglement (in unsupervised representation learning) using counterfactual quantities and observable consequences of causal assertions. This yields computable metrics that can be used to assess the degree to which representations satisfy the desiderata of interest and learn non-spurious and disentangled representations from single observational datasets.

 I quite like how acme does a lot of heavy lifting in the background and lays out their thoughts on best practices, but perhaps I'm being shortsighted by all the bells and whistles

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was hoping I could get some insight into the tooling that you use (or would use) for some production RL work? I'm mostly doing it all on my home machine as a fun side project. 
 I've got the following existing infrastructure: 
 - An interface based loosely on the standard RL setup. I'm thinking about adapting it to fit Acme to let it do more heavy lifting since I quite like `Haiku`, `rlax` and the rest of what they do.
 - I've got some models across languages (Pytorch and Jax) and this has been causing me some headache trying to make sure everything is abstract enough. Should I just stick to one language and make sure all my friends just use that same language? 
 - I'm currently using comet-ml for my experiment tracking, and for the most part I like it. However, I'm now looking around to see what's out there and I'm a little overwhelmed by (1) how many tools there are and (2) how some of them seem to "overlap" so I don't really know how to compose them.
 - configs all stored in a python file in a separate repo that is kept synced between my other repos.
 - I currently store my agent experiences (off policy) in a database that I later query to rapidly fill up the replay buffer. The limitation is that this is for a single agent. What drew me to Acme is that it seems to allow multiple agents to all use the same buffer? 
 _____________
 tl;dr
 1) Has anyone used Acme? I'm thinking of moving my project to it, but it might end up being a lot of effort for very little reward
 2) How do you and your teams handle multiple languages? Do you just have abstract gym wrappers that convert data? 
 3) What tools do you use and how do you compose them together? I'm so so lost trying to navigate this space
 4) How do you keep your configs synced when they are used between repos?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flower is an end-to-end federated learning framework that allows for a smoother transition from simulation-based experimental research to system research on many real-world edge devices. Flower has individual strengths in both domains (i.e., simulation and real-world devices) and the capacity to switch back and forth between the two extremes as needed throughout exploration and development. Researchers present use cases that drive our viewpoint, design goals, the resultant framework architecture, and comparisons to other frameworks in this part.
 Federated Learning (FL) has shown to be a viable option for enabling edge devices to develop a shared prediction model cooperatively while maintaining their training data on the device, divorcing the capacity to execute machine learning from the requirement to store data in the cloud. However, FL is challenging to implement practically in size and system heterogeneity. Although there are several research frameworks for simulating FL algorithms, none of them facilitate the investigation of scalable FL workloads on heterogeneous edge devices.
 Flower 0.18 released
 Thanks to a longer gap than usual, the latest Flower release has more upgrades than any previous release. Also, thanks to the wonderful community for your continuing support and generosity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm trying to run QAT on a MobileNetV2 based model but having some issues hitting the same training losses in the QAT phase as I did in the not-QAT phase.
 As a test, I'd trained the network for 1 epoch, then trained the QAT phase for 5 epochs and managed to get the same loss (actually lower). However, after training the model (non-QAT part) for 150 epochs, the QAT phase is really struggling to get down to the same loss.
 In my first test it dropped then completely levelled off for 2-3 epochs then nosedived again for another epoch, I'm not seeing the same in this longer train though.
 I was wondering if anyone has any advice on things like, should the learning rate be reset at the start of the QAT phase or should it carry on from where the training left off? I'm using Adam as the optimiser in the first phase, is that still ok in the second phase. Any other things that I could try? I did read a paper on improving quantization loss in MobileNet by L2 weighting the separable conv weights and swapping out ReLU6 for ReLU but I wasn't really seeing the same benefit as the paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08607.pdf) did in my tests, I was getting a worse initial network.
 Thanks for any insight that anyone can provide!

 I'm going through research to figure out how the Date Inference protocols might be implemented. Given a text containing the phrase "5 days from now", I would need it to infer the date April 3rd. The 'now' part is a trivial problem, but the inference is something I'm struggling with. I could use regex but all the possible edge cases are tricky. 
 The inference would need to work on unstructured cases like "April 23rd", "Next Sunday", etc. It would need to work forwards and backward (5 days ago etc.)
 ​
 Any great papers/resources? I searched for date inference, but nothing similar to what I'm looking for

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a researcher who is deeply interested in deep generative models. There are excellent textbooks I want to read if time allows, such as:
 Probabilistic ML: https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html
 PRML: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf
 However, there are also many papers I have to read, new theories I have to learn, and works I need to finish. The problem is that reading textbooks could deepen the fundamental understanding of the field but rarely gives an immediate reward. Practically, reading a textbook from start to end can take > 1000 hours, in which one can read more than a hundred papers. Given the situation, I have studied basic stuff only when I need them for my research (you know, publish or perish).
 ​
 However, I think the time to read textbooks will decrease rather than increase, and only junior researchers will be able to afford to read them. It means that if I don't read them now, I won't be able to read later. Is there any general advice on this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a project featuring 5+ years of data detailing mechanic reports. Essentially, I want to use ML to build a model that can make suggested actions to fix an issue based on these mechanic reports. For example, if a user typed in that a car “makes a squeaky sound” then it suggests three courses of action that may fix the issue based on similar issues and solutions detailed in the mechanic reports. 
 Furthermore, when returning these suggestions, I want the user to see some sort of score indicating how likely it is to fix the issue (i.e. option A worked 97% of the time, option B 2% of the time, and option C 1% of the time). I also want the user to be able to try the options and give feedback on if they fixed the issue. 
 My brain immediately went to a recommender system, but I don’t have much experience with creating them. Can they do all of the above (recommend solutions, score solutions, and allow for user input to keep training the model) or do I need to somehow pair with another method/model? I’m just not sure where to start.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In their recent post on how Google keeps Maps information reliable, the company elaborates how they use machine learning and human operators to block nearly 100 million attempted fraudulent edits to Google Business Profiles. Machine learning, in simple terms, is a sort of artificial intelligence (AI) that lets software applications improve their accuracy at predicting events without having to be explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use past data as input to forecast new output values.
 The world changed with the introduction of vaccinations, revisions to mask regulations, and new COVID variations in 2021. Accordingly, their Maps community updated Google Maps with further information about their nearby areas. Their contributions have helped Google provide updated company information, such as a location’s hours of operation or its health and safety regulations, for 30% more firms in 2021 than 2020.

 For iterative pruning algorithms referring to research papers like:
 ​
  
Learning both Weights and Connections for Efficient Neural Networks
 Deep Compression
 Comparing Rewinding and Fine-Tuning in Neural Network Pruning
  
I have found that during these pruning rounds, the pruned sub-network starts to overfit excessively, with training accuracy approaching almost 100%. This can be attributed to the fact that the surviving trained parameters are not reinitialized to either the randomly initialized values or to a previous value from earlier in the training.
 Whereas, for "The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis" and it's family of related research papers such as:
  
The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis
 Stabilizing the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis
 One ticket to win them all
 Deconstructing Lottery Tickets
  
such overfitting is usually not observed due to the weight rewinding scheme.
 Since, the original & unpruned deep learning architecture is already trained with strategies such as: data augmentation, weight decay, learning rate schedule, etc., the resulting iterative pruning rounds result in overfitting.
 Can you suggest a way to avoid these overfitting during these iterative pruning rounds?

 I'm a student at the University of Glasgow building a linux app that is trying to use CNNs to teach people the ASL (american sign language) alphabet. We just released the first version of our software which (although admittedly buggy) is worth sharing with interested communities. In brief, a MobileNetv2 model is trained on kaggle data for each sign in the ASL alphabet, this is executed within the OpenCV framework and run on camera frames of the user in real time. The user is challenged to make different signs and rewarded when the correct sign is made. We would love for interested people to try out our software and let us know about enhancement ideas or any bugs they may find.
 If you are interested in the project, please head over to our GitHub to have a look:

 ​
 i am an EE student, i am currently taking a class (my first) in machine learning, also i am enjoying it so much, now we have reached the point where we are studying neural networks.. back propgation, CNN, RNN, Autoencoders, Deep Learning etc..
 ​
 and my prof wants us to get working with some projects (using neural network)
 ​
 basically he wants us to get some already written code in Gethub (((written with Pytorch))) and understand it, understand the task, the motivation, the structure and the math, and modify it if needed, and implement it, and this will be the project, no one starts from scratch
 ​
 for example:
 image classification
 object detection
 ​
 also he said that the code that identify numbers is simple for a project, it will be an assignment.
 ​
 so any ideas?
 or links
 or any advice in general
 ​
 thanks guys and all the best

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. Our DS & DA team open sourced a Python library that helps in dealing with categorical variables for machine learning algorithms.
 It leverages Tensorflow/Keras embedding layers and builds a neural network that learns a dense representation of each unique class. This is all packaged inside a regular scikit-learn transformer that can be used within pipelines and can have its hyperparameters optimized with regular sklearn methods.
 Just do pip install embedding-encoder[tf]. Check out the readme at Github or the blog post for examples.
 Github: https://github.com/cpa-analytics/embedding-encoder
 PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/embedding-encoder/
 Blog post: https://cpa-analytics.github.io/embedding-encoder-intro/
 This was inspired by the 3rd place solution in the Rossmann Store Sales Kaggle competition. Some implementations have surfaced over the years but we are not aware of working one that integrates well with existing libraries.
 This is just another preprocessing technique. It can be optimal for your task or not. As always, try multiple approaches and evaluate the results!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone!
 I'd like to use a large language model like T0pp or GPT-NeoX-20B to take a natural-language input from a user and map it to one of ~2000 possible VS Code command palette commands. Essentially, this is a classification problem of the form "NLP input -> command".
 The idea is to let users give voice input in natural language and then have the model figure out what command they most likely want to activate.
 Given the number of possible commands I clearly can't rely on prompt design to solve this. It might be a good fit for a model with explicit retrieval augmentation like a memorizing transformer. But that's still a very active area of research without high-quality pre-trained models.
 Given that, I'm thinking that doing some kind of fine tuning to an existing model is the best bet. But it's unclear to me what the training data should look like... should I just generate a few examples of each command of the form input: "vscode command: 'open new file'", output: "explorer.newFile", and then fine-tune on those? Is there some way to ensure that the model understands that I *always* want it to return one of the commands provided in fine-tuning, instead of arbitrary text?
 Interested in others' experiences with similar tasks! 
 Background: I'm working on an open source VS Code extension called Clippy AI. Currently it only performs code modifications to the current file and is a thin wrapper around the OpenAI API. But I'd like to use it to automate other editor actions as well!
