        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, ML noob here dipping their feet in the water. Right now I am trying to make an ML model that predicts "legendary" QBs of the past performances against current NFL teams. I'll be using Jupyter and Sklearn to do this. However, and maybe this is me overthinking things, I'm not sure how sklearn is going to interpret the data in the dataset. Right now I have a dataset containing all these QBs data (passing stats, strengths and weaknesses, etc.). My teams version of the data is essentially going to be the inverse of all these things. I'm just not quite sure what to target when im testing the data that will determine the "prediction" of the legend QBs stat line against the current team. In better words, how will the computer know that I'm trying to find the yards and touchdowns a QB would produce against a certain team when there's not really any target data for this. I feel as though all I have is data that contributes to a potential target data but I lack target data itself and I'm not sure what to do in that regard. I’m making use of supervised learning and decisión trees btw.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll start with the obvious - AWS guides are the worst. We all felt it. So, trying to build automation with them becomes M:I, or better yet, Oppenheimer.
 For the first time, our MLOps team had to build a CI/CD pipeline for ML training and deployment using SageMaker. We had ZERO ideas on how to do it, so we had to go through the rigorous process of using AWS guides and tutorials, scattered over a gazillion places, just to figure out how to configure our project with SageMaker and build infra for CI/CD.
 Usually, when this thing happens, we extend the project lifecycle and have a team member document the process so we can refer back to it when we need to do it again.
 Knowing this can be beneficial to the community, we decided to share a series of 3 blogs that guide you through the process of building CI/CD pipelines for continuous training and deployment with AWS SageMaker.
 We published the first blog, which covers the configuration part, and plan to publish the rest in the following week.
 Check it out: https://dagshub.com/blog/setup-sagemaker-for-ci-cd-pipelines/
 I'm sure we can improve this tutorial, and would love to learn from your experience on how we can do it! 🤗

 Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13418

 Abstract:
  
Scientific knowledge is predominantly stored in books and scientific journals, often in the form of PDFs. However, the PDF format leads to a loss of semantic information, particularly for mathematical expressions. We propose Nougat (Neural Optical Understanding for Academic Documents), a Visual Transformer model that performs an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) task for processing scientific documents into a markup language, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a new dataset of scientific documents. The proposed approach offers a promising solution to enhance the accessibility of scientific knowledge in the digital age, by bridging the gap between human-readable documents and machine-readable text. We release the models and code to accelerate future work on scientific text recognition.

 It would not matter so much if the models had high failure rate, but as the models are getting closer and closer to 100%, the wrong answers will matter more and more.
 So, what can be done to fix such errors or to create a better test than MMLU?

 Abstract:
  
Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing tasks. However, their practical deployment is hindered by their immense memory and computation requirements. Although recent post-training quantization (PTQ) methods are effective in reducing memory footprint and improving the computational efficiency of LLM, they hand-craft quantization parameters, which leads to low performance and fails to deal with extremely low-bit quantization. To tackle this issue, we introduce an Omnidirectionally calibrated Quantization (OmniQuant) technique for LLMs, which achieves good performance in …]]></summary>

 I am starting my career transition, and would be interested to know how long it might take me to acquire the skills needed to work for a company. Likewise, I would like to know if it is necessary (or important) to have a professional degree to get a job.
 Just to give you some context about me, I am currently a recently graduated lawyer, so my degree has not given me a strong mathematical background. However, my strongest area of learning has always been mathematics, so despite not having a very advanced background, I consider myself to be a pretty good and fairly quick learner.
 I would also like to know if you consider if my professional career could be useful in some machine learning context.
 If you could recommend me some courses, inputs or guide to study in an organized way on the subject I would be very grateful.
 Thank you very much in advance.

However, these models are not always aligned with human preferences and values and may produce harmful or undesirable content if not properly guided. Aligning LLMs with human preferences can also improve their performance on downstream tasks. One way to achieve this alignment is to use reinforcement learning from feedback (RLHF), which learns a reward model from human input and then fine-tunes the LLM using a reinforcement learning (RL) objective.
 However, RLHF methods often face challenges such as computational cost, reward hacking, and data quality. To address these issues, researchers from DeepMind propose a new method called Reinforced Self-Training (ReST), which is inspired by gro…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I am at a bit of a crossroads and hope for some advice from the community. I also hope the answers would help others who are in my situation right now.
 I used to work on vision-related problems utilizing Deep learning back in a day, with all fun included: trying out new models, implementing data pipelines, evaluating various metrics... It was a rather big company with its own data collection efforts and enough resources for training. So, I am definitely not a beginner and have some experience.
 At my current job, I am not doing any ML/DL at the momemt, and while the stuff I am doing is still cool and I enjoy it, I am missing good old ML and having a feeling that I am hanging behind as the time goes by. So I figured it would be nice to start a hobby project, preferably in the area of vision-related applications of deep learning. However, I feel a bit lost as in what would be the most efficient approach taking into account I would only have a coule of hours per week for it.
 Here are possible ways to go I am thinking of:
  
take a paper, implement it from scratch with PyTorch
 clone an existing project, contribute with code improvements/better test coverage
 take an existing pre-trained model, adapt to a slightly different task and fine-tune
  
While the first option is of cource the most exciting, the problem is you have to pay for a powerful GPU and data storage which might be impractical (my PC has a 4 GB GTX 1650 TI). Cloud storages exist, and I would be willing to even spend something on training but would like to avoid the costs.
 So, the question would be: has enyone faced similar situation? Which way did you end up going? Any general tips? Thanks!

 This, to me, amounts to a bait and switch where a high quality chatbot is offered for a certain price, then swapped out with an inferior product capable only of reproducing past interactions. This is made worse by the fact that they advertise temperature as one of the variables you can set. Temperature is a variable that can only apply to uniquely generated output and has no effect on simple repetition of previous responses. This makes their practice doubly deceptive, and makes it clear (in my view) that they are trying to deceive customers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm likely using the wrong vocabulary here (and thus struggling to find info on my own) but I was curious if there were any work done on "synthetic" inputs for LLMs. In essence, rather than input embeddings all coming from a fixed token vocabulary, could you instead input an embedding as a token that was generated elsewhere? An output of another LLM (embedding model) or any other way (maybe just an average of a few tokens as an example)?
 Essentially - I am curious if there's a NLP approach analogy to Textual Inversion techniques in image generation models. I could imagine this being useful for things like RAG or personalization (if you could have a "user" token). Surely I'm not the first to think of this so I would love some pointers to any papers/blogs etc in this space.

The ability to detect objects in the visual world is crucial for computer vision and machine intelligence, enabling applications like adaptive autonomous agents and versatile shopping systems. However, modern object detectors are limited by the manual annotations of their training data, resulting in a vocabulary size significantly smaller than the vast array of objects encountered in reality. To overcome this, the open-vocabulary detection task (OVD) has emerged, utilizing image-text pairs for training and incorporating new category names at test time by associating them with the image content. By treating categories as text embeddings, open-vocabulary detectors can predict a wide range of unseen objects. Various techniqu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I’ve heard countless times people saying “I want to integrate ML in my product” and recently “I love ChatGPT, I should integrate it in my product”. Yet, as I dived deeper, seeking the genuine reasons and pain points driving this request, I regularly found the same pattern: many had no clear motive for their AI aspirations. It seemed as if they were only jumping on the trend because “everyone else is doing it”, or because their “CEO” told them to do so.
 So my question is : why do you integrate AI/ML into your products? Is it to enhance your user experience? Is to automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks? Is it to stay ahead of your competition? or is it just because everyone is doing it?

It's based on a Biomimicry principle and has some really cool features. I've tested it using various pre-loaded library datasets like CIFAR and MINST, as well as adapting it to a few Kaggle competitions. It has achieved some pretty amazing results by using it's unique adaptability; which comes down to figuring out how the Holistic and Reductionist model architectures can best utilize their roles and how they can combine dynamically.

This could lead to new philosophical and ethical questions around what it means to be human and what our role should be in a world where machines are more capable than we are. 
 There is also the risk that AI systems could be used for malicious purposes, such as cyber attacks or surveillance. Like an alien invasion, the emergence of super-intelligent AI could represent a significant disruption to human society and our way of life. 
 How can we balance the potential benefits of AI with the need to address the potential risks and uncertainties that it poses?

 I am wondering what the best way to inform these agents of this cumulative action constraint? I have appended it to my state vector but since the observation without this cumulative action is still a 625*1 vector, I think adding that constraint as just one additional state is causing it to be drowned out by the state size.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Slack questions are a huge time sink. For the person asking, they generally have no idea how to find the info and may not hear back for hours. For the person answering, it’s a distraction and often requires digging up old knowledge.
 The idea is simple: give an LLM your organizational context and plop it in Slack to answer things for you.
 DanswerBot is free to use and open source (MIT). You can connect it to Slack, Google Drive, GitHub, Confluence, Jira, local files, websites, and much more.
 Quick Demo Vid: https://youtu.be/EjDDvt5GbS8 
 Some additional neat features you may be interested in:
  
LLM generated answers backed by quotes to reduce hallucination
 
Supports a wide range of LLMs (both open source and proprietary)
 
Multi-Vector embeddings for accurate vector search
 
BM-25 Keyword search
 
Learning from user feedback
 
Custom NLP model to classify user intent
 
Polls your data sources every 10 minutes to keep knowledge up to date
 
Links back to your document sources
 
Document level access control
 
Admin dashboard to configure connectors to 14 (for now) of the most popular workplace tools
 
 If you aren’t a slack user (or if you just prefer a more tailored UI), there’s also a web interface to ask questions against your knowledge base. A short demo for that can be found at: https://youtu.be/cWWtnuVCUX0
 If you’re interested in testing this out yourself, the docs to help you launch Danswer with a single command can be found at https://docs.danswer.dev/quickstart!

Another thing that I find is deviate the action of each agent and show that they don’t get a better reward but the problem is there is a actor network for each agent.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12013
  
Generative models realized with machine learning techniques are powerful tools to infer complex and unknown data distributions from a finite number of training samples in order to produce new synthetic data. Diffusion models are an emerging framework that have recently overcome the performance of the generative adversarial networks in creating synthetic text and high-quality images. Here, we propose and discuss the quantum generalization of diffusion models, i.e., three quantum-noise-driven generative diffusion models that could be experimentally tested on real quantum systems. The idea is to harness unique quantum features, in particular the non-trivial interplay among coherence, entanglement and noise that the currently available noisy quantum processors do unavoidably suffer from, in order to overcome the main computational burdens of classical diffusion models during inference. Hence, we suggest to exploit quantum noise not as an issue to be detected and solved but instead as a very remarkably beneficial key ingredient to generate much more complex probability distributions that would be difficult or even impossible to express classically, and from which a quantum processor might sample more efficiently than a classical one. Therefore, our results are expected to pave the way for new quantum-inspired or quantum-based generative diffusion algorithms addressing more powerfully classical tasks as data generation/prediction with widespread real-world applications ranging from climate forecasting to neuroscience, from traffic flow analysis to financial forecasting.

 I’m currently doing my undergrad in Economics but am heavily interested in Compsci/Datasci and related topics. Though to be completely honest, I’m not completely sure which area my interests lie in. 
 I was wondering if picking up coding/ theoretical knowledge that a com scientist or data scientist needs will be hard when I am already working. 
 The question is if it is necessary to switch my degree to Math and Economics to gain a firmer foundation in the mathematical/ statistical concepts that ground com science. Or will an undergrad in Economics be sufficiently rigorous for me to pick up com sci/ data sci myself. 
 For context, I’m thinking of taking courses on Real Analysis, Linear Algebra 2, Discrete Mathematics, Algorithms and Data Structures, Optimisation, Probability and Statistics.

Suffice it to say, these things are getting really good, and I mean really good. Assuming this is just the beginning, and these things keep learning more and getting better, where does this end up?
 I genuinely think there’s going to be the need for world wide regulation on these things. But we all know that worldwide consensus is difficult if not impossible. in case a few countries decide to regulate or govern this tech, developers will take advantage of regulatory arbitrage and just deploy their models and register their companies on servers in countries with no regulation. Since this is tech, and everything is on servers, escaping regulation is basically childs play.
 Also, what about mental health concerns? We all know that porn, webcams and OnlyFans are already screwing up male-female relationships and marriages. Look at any statistics about this and the numbers speak for themselves. And this is before AI. So now what’s going to happen 5 years from now when GPU’s are faster and cheaper, and when these companies have gathered 100x more data about their customers, and when models are 50x better.
 We are just at the beginning and AI is moving really quick, especially generative AI. I think it’s officially time to start worrying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm attempting to train an agent using A2C, where the agent generates a vector as its action at each time step. This vector represents a bidding curve, and a crucial property is that it must always increase monotonically. Otherwise, the bid is considered invalid. For example, [0, 1.2, 4.5, 58, 92.65, 104.3, 104.3] is valid because each number is greater than or equal to the previous one. I'm looking for guidance on how to design this setup, impose these constraints, and handle cases where the agent violates the sequence. While using negative rewards might not be effective due to the potential for generating numerous invalid bids, I'm unsure about the right approach. Could someone assist me with this?

 Abstract:
  
Current literature, aiming to surpass the "Chain-of-Thought" approach, often resorts to an external modus operandi involving halting, modifying, and then resuming the generation process to boost Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning capacities. This mode escalates the number of query requests, leading to increased costs, memory, and computational overheads. Addressing this, we propose the Algorithm of Thoughts -- a novel strategy that propels LLMs through algorithmic reasoning pathways, pioneering a new mode of in-context learning. By employing algorithmic examples, we exploit the innate recurrence dynamics of LLMs, expanding their idea exploration with merely one or a few queries. Our technique outperforms earlier single-query methods and stands on par with a recent multi-query strategy that employs an extensive tree search algorithm. Intriguingly, our results suggest that instructing an LLM using an algorithm can lead to performance surpassing that of the algorithm itself, hinting at LLM's inherent ability to weave its intuition into optimized searches. We probe into the underpinnings of our method's efficacy and its nuances in application.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Complex tasks with LLMs like ChatGPT/GPT4 are best broken down by first asking ChatGPT to outline the steps and then asking the LLM to execute against those steps that it defined. I first came across this interesting technique on Twitter recently.
 While it’s OK to do this once in OpenAI’s playground, it's difficult to make this repeatable and streamlined. When I wanted an LLM to do something complex, I wanted to be able to plug into a template instead of thinking about and setting up the contextual decomposition process.
 I made this Contextual Decomposition Template to help solve this problem: https://lastmileai.dev/workbooks/cllqfl5c600rdpgnhh2su2fa0
 With a document and objective, this template allows you to quickly get to the answer through defining intermediate steps and executing according. Parameters are set up so you can easily change the goal, document, and objective and click 'Run All' to get the final results.
 Please let me know if you have feedback! I'm also very curious if you have other interesting techniques with complex tasks and workflows working with LLMs.

 - In the Kmeans that I did, I normalize the data because they mention that it helps a lot, but if I don't, the algorithm stops classifying normally and shows me badly grouped points.
 - As I mentioned, when looking at the graphs of the grouped points, I can see how many of the points are clearly closer to certain centroids, but he classified them as others, this reaches the level of a misclassified point next to the centroid when that should belong
 - Despite the fact that it has a threshold to be making iterations, the algorithm ends in less than 10 even though it has placed 100 iterations. I know that it can depend on the dataset and the generated centroids, but it seems excessive to me that it ends so soon and with results like Iris datset (60, 13, 77) when it should be (50, 50, 50) or a minimum to be maintained for those values.
 I leave the code in GH in case someone can help me: https://github.com/vanstrouble/kmeans-from-scratch.git

This robot will first only be used on software but eventually we are hoping to add hardware. We want to be able to make two bots and put them agansit each other so they learn by machine learning. Once we find that they are skilled and understand we would like to be able to actually play them. I have heard of similiar projects to this online and on reddit. If anyone has any information about how to go about this or ideas, or just anything please let me know. I would love to have help on this project.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in the strange position of having the task of developing a machine learning pipeline/system/process in an academic environment without the benefit of much in the way of formal training in ML (I'm more of a classical stats for hypothesis testing kinda guy).
 The particular project is using machine learning on medical images (head CT scans) to detect a relatively rare condition. As usual the goal is to eventually have some automatic process for diagnosis support. This particular condition is something that diagnostic radiologists can always detect if they look in the right place on the image, the problem is that they often don't look in the right place. After talking to colleagues with more experience (but less time) it's something which in principle can be achieved with more or less "off the shelf" code put together in the right order and with appropriate hyperparameters.
 This stage of the project is aiming for a proof of principle, rather than anything deployable. We're lucky to have a decent amount of data inside a trusted research environment.
 I've done some hobby-level stuff and tutorials, but overall I'm coming into this with a lot more experience with medical imaging than with computer vision or machine learning.
 After all that preamble here's my question:
 What does a decent CV/ML experiment look like?
 Left to my own direction I can see myself picking 3 different approaches of varying complexity, trying to get the best out of each of them, and then presenting a comparison of performance or accuracy of all of them. I then claim the "best one" as the one we move on with.
 There are a lot of tools out there for experiment tracking (eg neptune.ai), but I'm really not sure whether that sort of thing is over the top for what I need to do.
 Any tips or experience that you folks don't mind sharing?

 TLDR: How do I change the orientation of portrait frames to landscape frames while keeping the mockup essence the same.
 Link: https://ibb.co/album/hx6wp3
 Basically, I have two portrait frame mockups that came in a bundle and the bundle had no landscape frame mockups at all. So, naturally I'd like to make my own since I have a lot of landscape artworks that could be displayed in the mockups.
 How can I change the orientation display of my mockup? I've tried using Photoshop's generative AI software and got nowhere. It keeps giving me a new frame design when I want to keep the original frame so it matches the set.
 Any leads on how this can be done would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey!One of my friends brought up an idea about using LLM for product search and we started talking about the idea and approach.
 Per my understanding what would need to be done is to train some smaller language model on the product data, create embeddings from the product info and make the model use this as a body of knowledge.
 My issue is that if this was ever to be done on commercial scale it seems very complex to me, since the embeddings would have to be re-created every time a new product is introduced?
 Let me know what you think or how you would approach this, as I'm trying to see different PoV's and everyone here has more experience than me.

 I am looking for a RL library that offers me individual components rather than the whole algorithm. I do not need a PPO implementation, but I would fancy a library that offers me functions to compute the PPO loss given a batch of steps. 
 In other words, what I need is a library that offers the most granular RL components (different losses, replay buffers, return estimators like GAE, etc) instead of full algorithm implementations. Which libraries do you recommend for this purpose?

 It would work in such a way that I would have one RL algorithm that would search for the hyperparameters of the robot and then I would to train and evaluate this robot using SAC in MuJoCo physical simulator.
 Problem is that MuJoCo runs on CPU and I need lots of parallel enviroments and for this I would use envpool https://github.com/sail-sg/envpool.
 The question is what (if any) RL library should I use as a wrapper.
 The options are Stable-Baselines3, Tianshou, ACME, CleanRL, or rl_games.

Large Language Models (LLMs) went from non-existent to ubiquitous in the machine learning discourse within a few years. Due to the fast pace of the field, it is difficult to identify the remaining challenges and already fruitful application areas. In this paper, we aim to establish a systematic set of open problems and application successes so that ML researchers can comprehend the field's current state more quickly and become productive.

In the multiple continuous action environment, does the actor perform multiple action simultaneously from the clipped output Tanh [-1,1]? or it has some posterior function converting from Tanh vectors to single deterministic action like Softmax?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm new to speech processing. As I read the paper on wav2vec 2.0, I see them mentioning the use of language models in decoding, particularly a 4-gram model and a Transformer. As far as I'm aware, the encoder (wav2vec2) will output a probability sequence of L x V (where V is the vocab size, L is sequence length). I have two questions:
  
I learned that a n-gram language model would predict the probability of a n-gram given previous context words, but how is a Transformer implemented here ? Does it follow a causal structure such as GPT and then estimate sequence likelihood ?
 How can a language model, trained to estimate next word (n-gram) probability given previous context, be used to decode the output sequence given the L x V probability outputs from above ?
  
Many thanks !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Understanding GPT-4
 What is GPT-4?
 GPT-4 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4) is a machine learning model for natural language understanding and generation. It works by analyzing a large dataset and generating text based on the input it receives.
 How Does It Work?
 GPT-4 uses deep neural networks with multiple layers to predict the next word in a sequence of words. The model has been trained on a wide range of internet text, so it's capable of understanding and generating coherent and contextually relevant text based on the prompts it's given.
 Building Apps with GPT-4
 Step 1: Get API Access
 To use GPT-4, you'll first need access to its API. OpenAI provides this service, and you can apply for an API key from their website.
 Step 2: Choose Your Programming Language
 You can integrate the GPT-4 API into your application using various programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, or Ruby.
 Step 3: Making API Calls
 Once you've chosen your language, you'll make RESTful API calls to communicate with GPT-4. You'll pass your prompt as an input and receive generated text as output.
 Example in Python
 Here is a simple Python example using the openai library to interact with GPT-4:
 ```python import openai
 openai.api_key = "your-api-key-here"
 response = openai.Completion.create( engine="text-davinci-002", prompt="Translate the following English text to French: '{}'", max_tokens=60 )
 print(response.choices[0].text.strip()) ```
 Step 4: Handle Rate Limits
 OpenAI's API comes with rate limits, so you'll need to manage these by either queuing requests or handling retries.
 Step 5: Deployment
 After testing and fine-tuning, deploy your application. Ensure that you are abiding by OpenAI's usage policies and guidelines.
 Conclusion
 GPT-4 is a powerful tool for natural language understanding and generation. By understanding its workings and following the steps to integrate it into an application, you can leverage its capabilities for various use-cases.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We introduce a new operator, called 3D DeFormable Attention (DFA3D), for 2D-to-3D feature lifting, which transforms multi-view 2D image features into a unified 3D space for 3D object detection.
 ​
 Comparisons of feature lifting methods.
 Existing feature lifting approaches, such as Lift-Splat-based and 2D attention-based, either use estimated depth to get pseudo LiDAR features and then splat them to a 3D space, which is a one-pass operation without feature refinement, or ignore depth and lift features by 2D attention mechanisms, which achieve finer semantics while suffering from a depth ambiguity problem.
 In contrast, our DFA3D-based method first leverages the estimated depth to expand each view's 2D feature map to 3D and then utilizes DFA3D to aggregate features from the expanded 3D feature maps. With the help of DFA3D, the depth ambiguity problem can be effectively alleviated from the root, and the lifted features can be progressively refined layer by layer, thanks to the Transformer-like architecture. In addition, we propose a mathematically equivalent implementation of DFA3D which can significantly improve its memory efficiency and computational speed. We integrate DFA3D into several methods that use 2D attention-based feature lifting with only a few modifications in code and evaluate on the nuScenes dataset. The experiment results show a consistent improvement of +1.41\% mAP on average, and up to +15.1\% mAP improvement when high-quality depth information is available, demonstrating the superiority, applicability, and huge potential of DFA3D.

 (2) Do enough super computers exist for every company to start training their LLM today?
 (3) Is there even a single company that ships super computers capable of training LLMs in-house?
 (4) McKinsey will want to train their LLMs on all data they have from their customers so that McKinsey can work at max efficiency. Customers won't like that. Is it possible to un-train specific data sets?
 (5) Would it be possible to feed the LLM with the customer's data instead of training the LLM on the data? What would be the differences? If you feed it the data, then the LLM can't work with the data as well as it could if you trained it on said data?

 Now, I find myself spearheading an ML project at a big company, and our backend code base keeps growing, and other people depend on it. There are layers to it, with threads spawning, and dependencies on caches and databases for state sharing. It's more than a pet project - you get the gist. I want to design production-ready architectures that are more robust than piecemeal/make-shift solutions. 
 Do people have resources or suggestions on what established design patterns work in the industry? I have found it hard to find resources just by googling because the pace at which ML research works makes most books/tutorials outdated. Take retrieval augmented generation, for example. Do you store your documents in an elasticsearch store and build indices periodically or do you store them in FAISS? How separated is your retrieval module from your LLM call? Do you host in-house LLM's centrally company-wide or per-project?
 What has worked for you so far in the industry?

 If anyone finds it useful, feel free to check it out: https://github.com/mphe/upside-down-reinforcement-learning.
 There are many other implementations out there, but most of them are difficult to extend and maintain, due to being written in a sloppy manner, or are incorrect, e.g. not using multiplicative interactions or contain smaller bugs and issues.
 This project aims to fix these issues, while potentially improving performance, providing a proper OOP interface, and reusing code from Stable Baselines 3 where applicable.
 Furthermore, the algorithm has been extended to support additional features, like multi-threading, which speeds up the training time immensely. It also provides an interface similar to SB algorithms, so it can be used mostly analogously.
 For more information, see the Github page.
 Contributions are welcome!

I get that it helps give more importance to clean samples during training. But, about the sum of these weights used in the loss function - should they always add up to 1? What's the reasoning behind this constraint? Can't the weights sum up to any positive value instead? Also, if I intend to assign loss values with probabilities, does the weighted sum still need to be 1? Need help clarifying if my understanding is correct!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been captivated by Recursive Least Squares (RLS) methods, particularly the approach that employs error prediction instead of matrix inversion. This method is quite intuitive. Let's consider a scenario where you need to estimate the true effect of four factors (color, gender, age, and weight) on blood sugar. To find the true impact of weight on blood sugar, it's necessary to eliminate the influence of every other factor on weight. This can be accomplished by using simple least squares regression to predict the residual errors recursively, as shown in the diagram below:
 Removing the effect of all factors on \"weight\" in a recursive manner
 The fundamental contrast between RLS and Gradient-based methods lies in how errors are distributed across inputs based on their activity, leading to the subsequent update of weights. However, in the case of RLS, all inputs undergo decorrelation before evaluating prediction errors. 
 Comparison between error sharing in RLS and GD
 This de-correlation can be done in few lines of python code:
 for i in range(number_of_factors):
 for j in range(i+1, number_of_factors): 
 wx = np.sum(x[i] * x[j]) / np.sum(x[i]**2) 
 x[j] -= wx * x[i] 
 This approach also bears relevance to predictive coding and can shed light on intriguing neuroscientific findings, such as the increase brain activity during surprising or novel events — attributable to prediction errors.
 The prediction errors are increasing during the surprising events similar to how brain activity increases.
 RLS learns very fast but it's still subpar to deep learning when it comes to non-linear hierarchical structures but that is probably because Gradient based methods enjoyed more attention and tinkering from the ML-community. I think RLS methods needs more attention and I have been working on some research projects that uses this method for signal prediction . If you're interested, you can find the source code here:

AFAIK, it's a linear regression problem.
 What I've tried:
 - an FCNN (doesn't work good);
 - Scikit-Learn Lasso (the same results);
 - MSE regression using Neural Tangents (the same).
 Any ideas on how to solve this?
 Thanks a lot in advance!

 There can be a comparison of a pair with two entities resulting in a winner and a loser: A > B; C > A; D > C; ...
 A comparison is expensive.
 Objective: to approximate the absolute order of entities (best entities at the top of the list, worst at the bottom), minimize the number of comparisons
 The worst solution would be just applying a sorting algorithm, which would require n log n comparisons.
 I believe an active sampling technique would be required, i.e. select a number of entities with the highest uncertainty, and do comparisons with them, adjust the model, repeat.
 ChatGPT suggests a Bradley-Terry model and even gives an implementation example. I wonder if there is anything better?

management of an electric power grid is one of these cases: to avoid risky

example, power loads. For this reason, point forecasts are not enough hence it
is necessary to adopt methods that provide an uncertainty quantification.

This work focuses on reservoir computing as the core time series forecasting
method, due to its computational efficiency and effectiveness in predicting
time series. While the RC literature mostly focused on point forecasting, this
work explores the compatibility of some popular uncertainty quantification
methods with the reservoir setting. Both Bayesian and deterministic approaches
to uncertainty assessment are evaluated and compared in terms of their
prediction accuracy, computational resource efficiency and reliability of the

assistance of extremely heavy parameters, which challenges deployment in real
applications. Knowledge distillation is well recognized as the essential
procedure in model compression. However, existing knowledge distillation
techniques lack an in-depth investigation and analysis of VLP, and practical
guidelines for VLP-oriented distillation are still not yet explored. In this
paper, we present DLIP, a simple yet efficient Distilling Language-Image
Pre-training framework, through which we investigate how to distill a light VLP
model. Specifically, we dissect the model distillation from multiple
dimensions, such as the architecture characteristics of different modules and
the information transfer of different modalities. We conduct comprehensive
experiments and provide insights on distilling a light but performant VLP
model. Experimental results reveal that DLIP can achieve a state-of-the-art
accuracy/efficiency trade-off across diverse cross-modal tasks, e.g.,
image-text retrieval, image captioning and visual question answering. For
example, DLIP compresses BLIP by 1.9x, from 213M to 108M parameters, while
achieving comparable or better performance. Furthermore, DLIP succeeds in
retaining more than 95% of the performance with 22.4% parameters and 24.8%
FLOPs compared to the teacher model and accelerates inference speed by 2.7x.]]></summary>

models, finding wide applications in fields such as economics, engineering and
manufacturing, transportation, and health care. Optimization models are
mathematical abstractions of the problem of making the best decision while
satisfying a set of requirements or constraints. One of the primary barriers to
deploying these models in practice is the challenge of helping practitioners
understand and interpret such models, particularly when they are infeasible,
meaning no decision satisfies all the constraints. Existing methods for
diagnosing infeasible optimization models often rely on expert systems,
necessitating significant background knowledge in optimization. In this paper,
we introduce OptiChat, a first-of-its-kind natural language-based system
equipped with a chatbot GUI for engaging in interactive conversations about
infeasible optimization models. OptiChat can provide natural language
descriptions of the optimization model itself, identify potential sources of
infeasibility, and offer suggestions to make the model feasible. The
implementation of OptiChat is built on GPT-4, which interfaces with an
optimization solver to identify the minimal subset of constraints that render
the entire optimization problem infeasible, also known as the Irreducible
Infeasible Subset (IIS). We utilize few-shot learning, expert chain-of-thought,
key-retrieve, and sentiment prompts to enhance OptiChat's reliability. Our
experiments demonstrate that OptiChat assists both expert and non-expert users
in improving their understanding of the optimization models, enabling them to
quickly identify the sources of infeasibility.]]></summary>

potential causes of the extrapolation step failing in some algorithms, and
resolve this issue by enhancing the comparison process that evaluates the
trade-off between the proximal gradient step and the linear extrapolation step
in our algorithm. Furthermore, we extends our algorithm to any scenario
involving updating block variables with positive integers, allowing each cycle
to randomly shuffle the update order of the variable blocks. Additionally,
under mild assumptions, we prove that ABPL$^+$ can monotonically decrease the
function value without strictly restricting the extrapolation parameters and
step size, demonstrates the viability and effectiveness of updating these
blocks in a random order, and we also more obviously and intuitively
demonstrate that the derivative set of the sequence generated by our algorithm
is a critical point set. Moreover, we demonstrate the global convergence as
well as the linear and sublinear convergence rates of our algorithm by
utilizing the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (K{\L}) condition. To enhance the
effectiveness and flexibility of our algorithm, we also expand the study to the
imprecise version of our algorithm and construct an adaptive extrapolation
parameter strategy, which improving its overall performance. We apply our
algorithm to multiple non-negative matrix factorization with the $\ell_0$ norm,
nonnegative tensor decomposition with the $\ell_0$ norm, and perform extensive

representation of data lying close to a union of low-dimensional manifolds, a
fundamental task in machine learning and computer vision. When the manifolds
are assumed to be linear subspaces, this reduces to the classical problem of
subspace clustering, which has been studied extensively over the past two
decades. Unfortunately, many real-world datasets such as natural images can not
be well approximated by linear subspaces. On the other hand, numerous works
have attempted to learn an appropriate transformation of the data, such that
data is mapped from a union of general non-linear manifolds to a union of
linear subspaces (with points from the same manifold being mapped to the same
subspace). However, many existing works have limitations such as assuming
knowledge of the membership of samples to clusters, requiring high sampling
density, or being shown theoretically to learn trivial representations. In this
paper, we propose to optimize the Maximal Coding Rate Reduction metric with

membership, inspired by state-of-the-art subspace clustering results. We give a

accurate and scalable than state-of-the-art deep clustering methods, and
further learns a latent linear representation of the data.]]></summary>

models collaboratively while preserving data privacy. The need for privacy
protection makes it difficult for FL models to achieve global transparency and
explainability. To address this limitation, we incorporate logic-based
explanations into FL by proposing the Logical Reasoning-based eXplainable
Federated Learning (LR-XFL) approach. Under LR-XFL, FL clients create local
logic rules based on their local data and send them, along with model updates,
to the FL server. The FL server connects the local logic rules through a proper
logical connector that is derived based on properties of client data, without
requiring access to the raw data. In addition, the server also aggregates the
local model updates with weight values determined by the quality of the
clients' local data as reflected by their uploaded logic rules. The results
show that LR-XFL outperforms the most relevant baseline by 1.19%, 5.81% and
5.41% in terms of classification accuracy, rule accuracy and rule fidelity,
respectively. The explicit rule evaluation and expression under LR-XFL enable
human experts to validate and correct the rules on the server side, hence
improving the global FL model's robustness to errors. It has the potential to
enhance the transparency of FL models for areas like healthcare and finance
where both data privacy and explainability are important.]]></summary>

populations that are acoustically active but difficult to survey visually.
Digital recorders allow surveyors to gather large volumes of data at low cost,
but identifying target species vocalisations in these data is non-trivial.
Machine learning (ML) methods are often used to do the identification. They can
process large volumes of data quickly, but they do not detect all vocalisations
and they do generate some false positives (vocalisations that are not from the
target species). Existing wildlife abundance survey methods have been designed
specifically to deal with the first of these mistakes, but current methods of
dealing with false positives are not well-developed. They do not take account
of features of individual vocalisations, some of which are more likely to be
false positives than others. We propose three methods for acoustic spatial
capture-recapture inference that integrate individual-level measures of
confidence from ML vocalisation identification into the likelihood and hence
integrate ML uncertainty into inference. The methods include a mixture model in
which species identity is a latent variable. We test the methods by simulation
and find that in a scenario based on acoustic data from Hainan gibbons, in
which ignoring false positives results in 17% positive bias, our methods give
negligible bias and coverage probabilities that are close to the nominal 95%

influenced by intensity variations of input images and lack generalization due
to primarily utilizing pixels' intensity information for inference. Acquiring
sufficient training data is another challenge limiting models' applications. We
proposed to leverage the consistency of organs' anatomical shape and position
information in medical images. We introduced a framework leveraging recurring
anatomical patterns through global binary masks for organ segmentation. Two
scenarios were studied.1) Global binary masks were the only model's (i.e.
U-Net) input, forcing exclusively encoding organs' position and shape
information for segmentation/localization.2) Global binary masks were
incorporated as an additional channel functioning as position/shape clues to
mitigate training data scarcity. Two datasets of the brain and heart CT images
with their ground-truth were split into (26:10:10) and (12:3:5) for training,
validation, and test respectively. Training exclusively on global binary masks
led to Dice scores of 0.77(0.06) and 0.85(0.04), with the average Euclidian
distance of 3.12(1.43)mm and 2.5(0.93)mm relative to the center of mass of the
ground truth for the brain and heart structures respectively. The outcomes
indicate that a surprising degree of position and shape information is encoded
through global binary masks. Incorporating global binary masks led to
significantly higher accuracy relative to the model trained on only CT images
in small subsets of training data; the performance improved by 4.3-125.3% and
1.3-48.1% for 1-8 training cases of the brain and heart datasets respectively.
The findings imply the advantages of utilizing global binary masks for building
generalizable models and to compensate for training data scarcity.]]></summary>

that enable voice cloning and real-time voice conversion from one individual to

speech converted to one another using Retrieval-based Voice Conversion.
Presenting as a binary classification problem of whether the speech is real or

reveals that there are significantly different distributions. Hyperparameter
optimisation is implemented for machine learning models to identify the source
of speech. Following the training of 208 individual machine learning models
over 10-fold cross validation, it is found that the Extreme Gradient Boosting
model can achieve an average classification accuracy of 99.3% and can classify
speech in real-time, at around 0.004 milliseconds given one second of speech.

losses in a principled manner, we need a privacy accountant for adaptive
compositions of randomised mechanisms, where the loss incurred at a given data
access is allowed to be smaller than the worst-case loss. This kind of analysis
has been carried out for the R\'enyi differential privacy (RDP) by Feldman and
Zrnic (2021), however not yet for the so-called optimal privacy accountants. We
make first steps in this direction by providing a careful analysis using the
Gaussian differential privacy which gives optimal bounds for the Gaussian
mechanism, one of the most versatile DP mechanisms. This approach is based on
determining a certain supermartingale for the hockey-stick divergence and on
extending the R\'enyi divergence-based fully adaptive composition results by
Feldman and Zrnic. We also consider measuring the individual

Transformers-based large language models (LLMs) have gradually replaced CNNs

Compared with the data that exists relatively independently such as images,
videos or texts, graph is a type of data that contains rich structural and
relational information. Meanwhile, natural language, as one of the most
expressive mediums, excels in describing complex structures. However, existing
work on incorporating graph learning problems into the generative language
modeling framework remains very limited. As the importance of large language
models continues to grow, it becomes essential to explore whether LLMs can also
replace GNNs as the foundation model for graphs. In this paper, we propose
InstructGLM (Instruction-finetuned Graph Language Model), systematically design
highly scalable prompts based on natural language instructions, and use natural
language to describe the geometric structure and node features of the graph for
instruction tuning an LLM to perform learning and inference on graphs in a

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent innovation in large language models (LLMs), and their myriad use-cases
have rapidly driven up the compute capacity demand for datacenter GPUs. Several
cloud providers and other enterprises have made substantial plans of growth in
their datacenters to support these new workloads. One of the key bottleneck
resources in datacenters is power, and given the increasing model sizes of
LLMs, they are becoming increasingly power intensive. In this paper, we show
that there is a significant opportunity to oversubscribe power in LLM clusters.
Power oversubscription improves the power efficiency of these datacenters,
allowing more deployable servers per datacenter, and reduces the deployment
time, since building new datacenters is slow.

We extensively characterize the power consumption patterns of a variety of
LLMs and their configurations. We identify the differences between the
inference and training power consumption patterns. Based on our analysis of
these LLMs, we claim that the average and peak power utilization in LLM
clusters for inference should not be very high. Our deductions align with the
data from production LLM clusters, revealing that inference workloads offer
substantial headroom for power oversubscription. However, the stringent set of
telemetry and controls that GPUs offer in a virtualized environment, makes it
challenging to have a reliable and robust power oversubscription mechanism.

We propose POLCA, our framework for power oversubscription that is robust,
reliable, and readily deployable for GPU clusters. Using open-source models to
replicate the power patterns observed in production, we simulate POLCA and
demonstrate that we can deploy 30% more servers in the same GPU cluster for
inference, with minimal performance loss]]></summary>

dimensionality reduction in an unsupervised way. Recently, they have been used
for the task of anomaly detection in the visual domain. By optimizing for the
reconstruction error using anomaly-free examples, the common belief is that a
corresponding network should fail to accurately reconstruct anomalous regions
in the application phase. This goal is typically addressed by controlling the
capacity of the network, either by reducing the size of the bottleneck layer or
by enforcing sparsity constraints on the activations. However, neither of these
techniques does explicitly penalize reconstruction of anomalous signals often
resulting in poor detection. We tackle this problem by adapting a
self-supervised learning regime that allows the use of discriminative
information during training but focuses on the data manifold of normal
examples. We emphasize that inference with our approach is very efficient
during training and prediction requiring a single forward pass for each input
image. Our experiments on the MVTec AD dataset demonstrate high detection and
localization performance. On the texture-subset, in particular, our approach
consistently outperforms recent anomaly detection methods by a significant
margin.]]></summary>

current benchmarks have become irrelevant and need to be updated to evaluate
complete documents, as they naturally occur in practice. This reality check
also calls for more mature evaluation methodologies, covering calibration

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multimedia recommendation involves personalized ranking tasks, where
multimedia content is usually represented using a generic encoder. However,
these generic representations introduce spurious correlations that fail to
reveal users' true preferences. Existing works attempt to alleviate this
problem by learning invariant representations, but overlook the balance between
independent and identically distributed (IID) and out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization. In this paper, we propose a framework called Pareto Invariant
Representation Learning (PaInvRL) to mitigate the impact of spurious
correlations from an IID-OOD multi-objective optimization perspective, by
learning invariant representations (intrinsic factors that attract user
attention) and variant representations (other factors) simultaneously.
Specifically, PaInvRL includes three iteratively executed modules: (i)
heterogeneous identification module, which identifies the heterogeneous
environments to reflect distributional shifts for user-item interactions; (ii)
invariant mask generation module, which learns invariant masks based on the
Pareto-optimal solutions that minimize the adaptive weighted Invariant Risk
Minimization (IRM) and Empirical Risk (ERM) losses; (iii) convert module, which
generates both variant representations and item-invariant representations for
training a multi-modal recommendation model that mitigates spurious
correlations and balances the generalization performance within and cross the
environmental distributions. We compare the proposed PaInvRL with
state-of-the-art recommendation models on three public multimedia
recommendation datasets (Movielens, Tiktok, and Kwai), and the experimental
results validate the effectiveness of PaInvRL for both within- and
cross-environmental learning.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fast adversarial training (FAT) is beneficial for improving the adversarial
robustness of neural networks. However, previous FAT work has encountered a
significant issue known as catastrophic overfitting when dealing with large
perturbation budgets, \ie the adversarial robustness of models declines to near
zero during training.

To address this, we analyze the training process of prior FAT work and
observe that catastrophic overfitting is accompanied by the appearance of loss
convergence outliers.

Therefore, we argue a moderately smooth loss convergence process will be a
stable FAT process that solves catastrophic overfitting.

To obtain a smooth loss convergence process, we propose a novel oscillatory
constraint (dubbed ConvergeSmooth) to limit the loss difference between
adjacent epochs. The convergence stride of ConvergeSmooth is introduced to
balance convergence and smoothing. Likewise, we design weight centralization
without introducing additional hyperparameters other than the loss balance
coefficient.

Our proposed methods are attack-agnostic and thus can improve the training
stability of various FAT techniques.

Extensive experiments on popular datasets show that the proposed methods
efficiently avoid catastrophic overfitting and outperform all previous FAT
methods. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/FAT-CS/ConvergeSmooth}.]]></summary>

exceptional generation quality and diversity. This success is largely
attributed to the use of class- or text-conditional diffusion guidance methods,
such as classifier and classifier-free guidance. In this paper, we present a
more comprehensive perspective that goes beyond the traditional guidance
methods. From this generalized perspective, we introduce novel condition- and
training-free strategies to enhance the quality of generated images. As a
simple solution, blur guidance improves the suitability of intermediate samples
for their fine-scale information and structures, enabling diffusion models to
generate higher quality samples with a moderate guidance scale. Improving upon
this, Self-Attention Guidance (SAG) uses the intermediate self-attention maps
of diffusion models to enhance their stability and efficacy. Specifically, SAG
adversarially blurs only the regions that diffusion models attend to at each
iteration and guides them accordingly. Our experimental results show that our
SAG improves the performance of various diffusion models, including ADM, IDDPM,
Stable Diffusion, and DiT. Moreover, combining SAG with conventional guidance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep learning has achieved impressive performance in many domains, such as
computer vision and natural language processing, but its advantage over
classical shallow methods on tabular datasets remains questionable. It is
especially challenging to surpass the performance of tree-like ensembles, such
as XGBoost or Random Forests, on small-sized datasets (less than 1k samples).
To tackle this challenge, we introduce HyperTab, a hypernetwork-based approach
to solving small sample problems on tabular datasets. By combining the
advantages of Random Forests and neural networks, HyperTab generates an
ensemble of neural networks, where each target model is specialized to process
a specific lower-dimensional view of the data. Since each view plays the role
of data augmentation, we virtually increase the number of training samples
while keeping the number of trainable parameters unchanged, which prevents
model overfitting. We evaluated HyperTab on more than 40 tabular datasets of a
varying number of samples and domains of origin, and compared its performance
with shallow and deep learning models representing the current
state-of-the-art. We show that HyperTab consistently outranks other methods on
small data (with a statistically significant difference) and scores comparable
to them on larger datasets.

inputs is crucial, especially in safety-critical domains like autonomous
driving, but also in safety systems where malicious actors can digitally alter
inputs to circumvent safety guards. However, designing effective
out-of-distribution tests that encompass all possible scenarios while
preserving accurate label information is a challenging task. Existing
methodologies often entail a compromise between variety and constraint levels
for attacks and sometimes even both. In a first step towards a more holistic
robustness evaluation of image classification models, we introduce an attack
method based on image solarization that is conceptually straightforward yet
avoids jeopardizing the global structure of natural images independent of the
intensity. Through comprehensive evaluations of multiple ImageNet models, we
demonstrate the attack's capacity to degrade accuracy significantly, provided
it is not integrated into the training augmentations. Interestingly, even then,
no full immunity to accuracy deterioration is achieved. In other settings, the
attack can often be simplified into a black-box attack with model-independent
parameters. Defenses against other corruptions do not consistently extend to be
effective against our specific attack.

of machine learning models that are valid with high probability. However,
applying conformal prediction to time series data leads to conservative
prediction regions. In fact, to obtain prediction regions over $T$ time steps
with confidence $1-\delta$, {previous works require that each individual
prediction region is valid} with confidence $1-\delta/T$. We propose an
optimization-based method for reducing this conservatism to enable long horizon
planning and verification when using learning-enabled time series predictors.
Instead of considering prediction errors individually at each time step, we
consider a parameterized prediction error over multiple time steps. By
optimizing the parameters over an additional dataset, we find prediction
regions that are not conservative. We show that this problem can be cast as a
mixed integer linear complementarity program (MILCP), which we then relax into
a linear complementarity program (LCP). Additionally, we prove that the relaxed
LP has the same optimal cost as the original MILCP. Finally, we demonstrate the

hospital, which admits critically ill patients and provides continuous
monitoring and treatment. Various patient outcome prediction methods have been

Existing methods focus on measuring the similarity between patients using deep
neural networks to capture the hidden feature structures. However, the
higher-order relationships are ignored, such as patient characteristics (e.g.,
diagnosis codes) and their causal effects on downstream clinical predictions.

In this paper, we propose a novel Hypergraph Convolutional Network that

in a hypergraph to capture the hidden feature structures so that fine-grained
patient similarity can be calculated for personalized mortality risk
prediction. Evaluation using a publicly available eICU Collaborative Research

carbon storage (GCS) problems to accelerate the prediction of reservoir
pressure and CO2 plume migration. Large amounts of data from physics-based
numerical simulators are required to train a model to accurately predict the
complex physical behaviors associated with this process. In practice, the
available training data are always limited in large-scale 3D problems due to
the high computational cost. Therefore, we propose to use a multi-fidelity
Fourier Neural Operator to solve large-scale GCS problems with more affordable
multi-fidelity training datasets. The Fourier Neural Operator has a desirable
grid-invariant property, which simplifies the transfer learning procedure
between datasets with different discretization. We first test the model
efficacy on a GCS reservoir model being discretized into 110k grid cells. The
multi-fidelity model can predict with accuracy comparable to a high-fidelity
model trained with the same amount of high-fidelity data with 81% less data
generation costs. We further test the generalizability of the multi-fidelity
model on a same reservoir model with a finer discretization of 1 million grid
cells. This case was made more challenging by employing high-fidelity and
low-fidelity datasets generated by different geostatistical models and
reservoir simulators. We observe that the multi-fidelity FNO model can predict
pressure fields with reasonable accuracy even when the high-fidelity data are

due to their ability to accurately learn very complex input-output relations.
Despite their accuracy and extensive use, DNNs are highly susceptible to

field, it is essential to build DNNs that are robust to any kind of
perturbations to the data points. In the past, many techniques have been
proposed to robustify DNNs using first-order derivative information of the
network.

This paper proposes a new robustification approach based on control theory. A
neural network architecture that incorporates feedback control, named Feedback
Neural Networks, is proposed. The controller is itself a neural network, which
is trained using regular and adversarial data such as to stabilize the system
outputs. The novel adversarial training approach based on the feedback control
architecture is called Feedback Looped Adversarial Training (FLAT). Numerical

amount of attention to their real-world robustness, i.e., whether a DNN resists
black-box adversarial attacks, among which score-based query attacks (SQAs) are
most threatening since they can effectively hurt a victim network with the only
access to model outputs. Defending against SQAs requires a slight but artful
variation of outputs due to the service purpose for users, who share the same
output information with SQAs. In this paper, we propose a real-world defense by
Unifying Gradients (UniG) of different data so that SQAs could only probe a
much weaker attack direction that is similar for different samples. Since such
universal attack perturbations have been validated as less aggressive than the
input-specific perturbations, UniG protects real-world DNNs by indicating
attackers a twisted and less informative attack direction. We implement UniG
efficiently by a Hadamard product module which is plug-and-play. According to
extensive experiments on 5 SQAs, 2 adaptive attacks and 7 defense baselines,
UniG significantly improves real-world robustness without hurting clean
accuracy on CIFAR10 and ImageNet. For instance, UniG maintains a model of
77.80% accuracy under 2500-query Square attack while the state-of-the-art
adversarially-trained model only has 67.34% on CIFAR10. Simultaneously, UniG
outperforms all compared baselines in terms of clean accuracy and achieves the
smallest modification of the model output. The code is released at

discover all possible skills in simple grid-world environments where prior
methods have struggled to succeed. This problem is formulated as mutual
training of skills using an intrinsic reward and a discriminator trained to
predict a skill given its trajectory. Our initial solution replaces the
standard one-vs-all (softmax) discriminator with a one-vs-one (all pairs)
discriminator and combines it with a novel intrinsic reward function and a
dropout regularization technique. The combined approach is named APART: Diverse
Skill Discovery using All Pairs with Ascending Reward and Dropout. We
demonstrate that APART discovers all the possible skills in grid worlds with
remarkably fewer samples than previous works. Motivated by the empirical
success of APART, we further investigate an even simpler algorithm that
achieves maximum skills by altering VIC, rescaling its intrinsic reward, and
tuning the temperature of its softmax discriminator. We believe our findings
shed light on the crucial factors underlying success of skill discovery
algorithms in reinforcement learning.]]></summary>

imaging and demonstrate that this makes it possible to robustly address
reactive inverse problems incorporating Uncertainty Quantification (UQ).
Pore-scale modeling of reactive flow offers a valuable opportunity to
investigate the evolution of macro-scale properties subject to dynamic
processes. Yet, they suffer from imaging limitations arising from the
associated X-ray microtomography (X-ray microCT) process, which induces
discrepancies in the properties estimates. Assessment of the kinetic parameters
also raises challenges, as reactive coefficients are critical parameters that
can cover a wide range of values. We account for these two issues and ensure
reliable calibration of pore-scale modeling, based on dynamical microCT images,
by integrating uncertainty quantification in the workflow.

The present method is based on a multitasking formulation of reactive inverse
problems combining data-driven and physics-informed techniques in calcite
dissolution. This allows quantifying morphological uncertainties on the
porosity field and estimating reactive parameter ranges through prescribed PDE
models with a latent concentration field and dynamical microCT. The data
assimilation strategy relies on sequential reinforcement incorporating
successively additional PDE constraints. We guarantee robust and unbiased
uncertainty quantification by straightforward adaptive weighting of Bayesian
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (BPINNs), ensuring reliable micro-porosity
changes during geochemical transformations. We demonstrate successful Bayesian
Inference in 1D+Time and 2D+Time calcite dissolution based on synthetic microCT
images with meaningful posterior distribution on the reactive parameters and
dimensionless numbers.]]></summary>

intrinsic dimension, measured at only a single distance scale depending on the
regularization parameter, and show that it is only the minimum of these

call this the Minimum Intrinsic Dimension scaling (MID scaling) phenomenon, and
establish MID scaling with no assumptions on the data distributions so long as
the cost is bounded and Lipschitz, and for various entropic optimal transport
quantities beyond just values, with stronger analogs when one distribution is
supported on a manifold. Our results significantly advance the theoretical
state of the art by showing that MID scaling is a generic phenomenon, and

machine learning model without sharing their data; rather, they train their own
model locally and send updates to a central server for aggregation. Depending
on how the data is distributed among the participants, FL can be classified
into Horizontal (HFL) and Vertical (VFL). In VFL, the participants share the
same set of training instances but only host a different and non-overlapping
subset of the whole feature space. Whereas in HFL, each participant shares the
same set of features while the training set is split into locally owned
training data subsets.

VFL is increasingly used in applications like financial fraud detection;
nonetheless, very little work has analyzed its security. In this paper, we
focus on robustness in VFL, in particular, on backdoor attacks, whereby an
adversary attempts to manipulate the aggregate model during the training
process to trigger misclassifications. Performing backdoor attacks in VFL is
more challenging than in HFL, as the adversary i) does not have access to the
labels during training and ii) cannot change the labels as she only has access
to the feature embeddings. We present a first-of-its-kind clean-label backdoor
attack in VFL, which consists of two phases: a label inference and a backdoor
phase. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack on three different
datasets, investigate the factors involved in its success, and discuss
countermeasures to mitigate its impact.]]></summary>

plays a crucial role in the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and management of
cardiovascular diseases. Recently, the widespread adoption of ambulatory BP
measurement devices has been driven predominantly by the increased prevalence
of hypertension and its associated risks and clinical conditions. Recent
guidelines advocate for regular BP monitoring as part of regular clinical
visits or even at home. This increased utilization of BP measurement
technologies has brought up significant concerns, regarding the accuracy of
reported BP values across settings.

In this survey, focusing mainly on cuff-based BP monitoring technologies, we
highlight how BP measurements can demonstrate substantial biases and variances
due to factors such as measurement and device errors, demographics, and body
habitus. With these inherent biases, the development of a new generation of
cuff-based BP devices which use artificial-intelligence (AI) has significant
potential. We present future avenues where AI-assisted technologies can
leverage the extensive clinical literature on BP-related studies together with
the large collections of BP records available in electronic health records.
These resources can be combined with machine learning approaches, including
deep learning and Bayesian inference, to remove BP measurement biases and to
provide individualized BP-related cardiovascular risk indexes.]]></summary>

business critical applications. Training such recommendation models efficiently
is challenging because they contain billions of embedding-based parameters,
leading to significant overheads from embedding access. By profiling existing
systems for DLRM training, we observe that around 75\% of the iteration time is
spent on embedding access and model synchronization. Our key insight in this
paper is that embedding access has a specific structure which can be used to
accelerate training. We observe that embedding accesses are heavily skewed,
with around 1\% of embeddings representing more than 92\% of total accesses.
Further, we observe that during offline training we can lookahead at future
batches to determine exactly which embeddings will be needed at what iteration
in the future. Based on these insights, we develop Bagpipe, a system for
training deep recommendation models that uses caching and prefetching to
overlap remote embedding accesses with the computation. We design an Oracle
Cacher, a new component that uses a lookahead algorithm to generate optimal
cache update decisions while providing strong consistency guarantees against
staleness. We also design a logically replicated, physically partitioned cache
and show that our design can reduce synchronization overheads in a distributed
setting. Finally, we propose a disaggregated system architecture and show that
our design can enable low-overhead fault tolerance. Our experiments using three
datasets and four models show that Bagpipe provides a speed up of up to 5.6x
compared to state of the art baselines, while providing the same convergence
and reproducibility guarantees as synchronous training.]]></summary>

reach target poses of characters by making use of phases variables learned by a
Periodic Autoencoder. Our approach utilizes a mixture-of-experts neural network
model, in which the phases cluster movements in both space and time with
different expert weights. Each generated set of weights then produces a
sequence of poses in an autoregressive manner between the current and target
state of the character. In addition, to satisfy poses which are manually
modified by the animators or where certain end effectors serve as constraints
to be reached by the animation, a learned bi-directional control scheme is
implemented to satisfy such constraints. The results demonstrate that using
phases for motion in-betweening tasks sharpen the interpolated movements, and
furthermore stabilizes the learning process. Moreover, using phases for motion
in-betweening tasks can also synthesize more challenging movements beyond
locomotion behaviors. Additionally, style control is enabled between given
target keyframes. Our proposed framework can compete with popular
state-of-the-art methods for motion in-betweening in terms of motion quality
and generalization, especially in the existence of long transition durations.
Our framework contributes to faster prototyping workflows for creating animated

high-stakes domains demands transparency and scrutiny of their fairness and
reliability. To help gauge machine learning models' robustness, research
typically focuses on the massive datasets used for their deployment, e.g.,
creating and maintaining documentation for understanding their origin, process
of development, and ethical considerations. However, data collection for AI is
still typically a one-off practice, and oftentimes datasets collected for a
certain purpose or application are reused for a different problem.
Additionally, dataset annotations may not be representative over time, contain
ambiguous or erroneous annotations, or be unable to generalize across issues or
domains. Recent research has shown these practices might lead to unfair,
biased, or inaccurate outcomes. We argue that data collection for AI should be
performed in a responsible manner where the quality of the data is thoroughly
scrutinized and measured through a systematic set of appropriate metrics. In
this paper, we propose a Responsible AI (RAI) methodology designed to guide the
data collection with a set of metrics for an iterative in-depth analysis of the
factors influencing the quality and reliability} of the generated data. We
propose a granular set of measurements to inform on the internal reliability of
a dataset and its external stability over time. We validate our approach across
nine existing datasets and annotation tasks and four content modalities. This
approach impacts the assessment of data robustness used for AI applied in the
real world, where diversity of users and content is eminent. Furthermore, it
deals with fairness and accountability aspects in data collection by providing

bounds for PAC or agnostic learning respectively. While such bounds implicitly
follow by combining prior results by Feldman (2008, 2012) and Sherstov (2008,
2011), to our knowledge the precise statements we give had not appeared in this
form before. Moreover, our proofs are simple and largely self-contained.

These lower bounds match corresponding positive results using upper bounds on
the threshold or approximate degree in the SQ model for PAC or agnostic
learning, and in this sense these results show that the polynomial method is a
universal, best-possible approach for distribution-free CSQ learning.]]></summary>

determine the lithology of the formations surrounding the borehole and the
location and reserves of subsurface oil and gas reservoirs. However, important
logs are often missing in horizontal or old wells, which poses a challenge in
field applications. In this paper, we utilize data from the 2020 machine
learning competition of the SPWLA, which aims to predict the missing
compressional wave slowness and shear wave slowness logs using other logs in
the same borehole. We employ the NGBoost algorithm to construct an Ensemble
Learning model that can predicate the results as well as their uncertainty.
Furthermore, we combine the SHAP method to investigate the interpretability of
the machine learning model. We compare the performance of the NGBosst model
with four other commonly used Ensemble Learning methods, including Random
Forest, GBDT, XGBoost, LightGBM. The results show that the NGBoost model
performs well in the testing set and can provide a probability distribution for
the prediction results. In addition, the variance of the probability
distribution of the predicted log can be used to justify the quality of the
constructed log. Using the SHAP explainable machine learning model, we
calculate the importance of each input log to the predicted results as well as
the coupling relationship among input logs. Our findings reveal that the
NGBoost model tends to provide greater slowness prediction results when the
neutron porosity and gamma ray are large, which is consistent with the
cognition of petrophysical models. Furthermore, the machine learning model can
capture the influence of the changing borehole caliper on slowness, where the
influence of borehole caliper on slowness is complex and not easy to establish
a direct relationship. These findings are in line with the physical principle
of borehole acoustics.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep learning models achieve excellent performance in numerous machine
learning tasks. Yet, they suffer from security-related issues such as
adversarial examples and poisoning (backdoor) attacks. A deep learning model
may be poisoned by training with backdoored data or by modifying inner network
parameters. Then, a backdoored model performs as expected when receiving a
clean input, but it misclassifies when receiving a backdoored input stamped
with a pre-designed pattern called "trigger". Unfortunately, it is difficult to
distinguish between clean and backdoored models without prior knowledge of the
trigger. This paper proposes a backdoor detection method by utilizing a special
type of adversarial attack, universal adversarial perturbation (UAP), and its
similarities with a backdoor trigger. We observe an intuitive phenomenon: UAPs
generated from backdoored models need fewer perturbations to mislead the model
than UAPs from clean models. UAPs of backdoored models tend to exploit the
shortcut from all classes to the target class, built by the backdoor trigger.
We propose a novel method called Universal Soldier for Backdoor detection (USB)
and reverse engineering potential backdoor triggers via UAPs. Experiments on
345 models trained on several datasets show that USB effectively detects the
injected backdoor and provides comparable or better results than
state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

proximity correction (OPC) has emerged as a crucial resolution enhancement
technology for ensuring high printability in the lithography process. Recently,
level set-based inverse lithography technology (ILT) has drawn considerable
attention as a promising OPC solution, showcasing its powerful pattern
fidelity, especially in advanced process. However, massive computational time
consumption of ILT limits its applicability to mainly correcting partial layers
and hotspot regions. Deep learning (DL) methods have shown great potential in
accelerating ILT. However, lack of domain knowledge of inverse lithography
limits the ability of DL-based algorithms in process window (PW) enhancement
and etc. In this paper, we propose an inverse lithography physics-informed deep
neural level set (ILDLS) approach for mask optimization. This approach utilizes
level set based-ILT as a layer within the DL framework and iteratively conducts
mask prediction and correction to significantly enhance printability and PW in
comparison with results from pure DL and ILT. With this approach, computation
time is reduced by a few orders of magnitude versus ILT. By gearing up DL with

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[NPN classification has many applications in the synthesis and verification of
digital circuits. The canonical-form-based method is the most common approach,
designing a canonical form as representative for the NPN equivalence class
first and then computing the transformation function according to the canonical
form. Most works use variable symmetries and several signatures, mainly based
on the cofactor, to simplify the canonical form construction and computation.
This paper describes a novel canonical form and its computation algorithm by
introducing Boolean influence to NPN classification, which is a basic concept
in analysis of Boolean functions. We show that influence is
input-negation-independent, input-permutation-dependent, and has other
structural information than previous signatures for NPN classification.
Therefore, it is a significant ingredient in speeding up NPN classification.
Experimental results prove that influence plays an important role in reducing
the transformation enumeration in computing the canonical form. Compared with
the state-of-the-art algorithm implemented in ABC, our influence-aided
canonical form for exact NPN classification gains up to 5.5x speedup.]]></summary>

operator. One of the effective approaches is to offer some attractive incentive
or additional services or money to the subscribers for keeping them engaged and
make sure they stay in the operator's network for longer time. Often, operators
allocate certain amount of monetary budget to carry out the offer campaign. The
difficult part of this campaign is the selection of a set of customers from a
large subscriber-base and deciding the amount that should be offered to an
individual so that operator's objective is achieved. There may be multiple
objectives (e.g., maximizing revenue, minimizing number of churns) for
selection of subscriber and selection of an offer to the selected subscriber.
Apart from monetary benefit, offers may include additional data, SMS, hots-spot
tethering, and many more. This problem is known as offer optimization. In this
paper, we propose a novel combinatorial algorithm for solving offer
optimization under heterogeneous offers by maximizing expected revenue under
the scenario of subscriber churn, which is, in general, seen in telecom domain.
The proposed algorithm is efficient and accurate even for a very large

statistics, which requires recurrent communication between neurons.
Mechanistically, such recurrent communication is often indirect and mediated by
local interneurons. In this work, we explore the computational benefits of
mediating recurrent communication via interneurons compared with direct
recurrent connections. To this end, we consider two mathematically tractable
recurrent linear neural networks that statistically whiten their inputs -- one
with direct recurrent connections and the other with interneurons that mediate
recurrent communication. By analyzing the corresponding continuous synaptic
dynamics and numerically simulating the networks, we show that the network with
interneurons is more robust to initialization than the network with direct
recurrent connections in the sense that the convergence time for the synaptic
dynamics in the network with interneurons (resp. direct recurrent connections)
scales logarithmically (resp. linearly) with the spectrum of their
initialization. Our results suggest that interneurons are computationally
useful for rapid adaptation to changing input statistics. Interestingly, the
network with interneurons is an overparameterized solution of the whitening
objective for the network with direct recurrent connections, so our results can
be viewed as a recurrent linear neural network analogue of the implicit
acceleration phenomenon observed in overparameterized feedforward linear neural
networks.]]></summary>

view synthesis. However, existing methods require expensive per-scene
optimization from many views hence limiting their application to real-world
unbounded urban settings where the objects of interest or backgrounds are
observed from very few views. To mitigate this challenge, we introduce a new
approach called NeO 360, Neural fields for sparse view synthesis of outdoor
scenes. NeO 360 is a generalizable method that reconstructs 360{\deg} scenes
from a single or a few posed RGB images. The essence of our approach is in
capturing the distribution of complex real-world outdoor 3D scenes and using a
hybrid image-conditional triplanar representation that can be queried from any
world point. Our representation combines the best of both voxel-based and
bird's-eye-view (BEV) representations and is more effective and expressive than
each. NeO 360's representation allows us to learn from a large collection of
unbounded 3D scenes while offering generalizability to new views and novel
scenes from as few as a single image during inference. We demonstrate our
approach on the proposed challenging 360{\deg} unbounded dataset, called NeRDS

the fact that DR relies more on extrapolation will lead to suboptimal
performance. To address the above limitations while retaining double
robustness, we propose a stabilized doubly robust (StableDR) learning approach
with a weaker reliance on extrapolation. Theoretical analysis shows that
StableDR has bounded bias, variance, and generalization error bound
simultaneously under inaccurate imputed errors and arbitrarily small

achieving more stable and accurate predictions. Extensive experiments show that

diagnostic errors, reduce radiologist workload, and accelerate diagnosis.
Training such deep learning models requires large and accurate datasets, with
annotations for all training samples. However, in the medical imaging domain,
annotated datasets for specific tasks are often small due to the high
complexity of annotations, limited access, or the rarity of diseases. To
address this challenge, deep learning models can be pre-trained on large image
datasets without annotations using methods from the field of self-supervised
learning. After pre-training, small annotated datasets are sufficient to
fine-tune the models for a specific task. The most popular self-supervised
pre-training approaches in medical imaging are based on contrastive learning.
However, recent studies in natural image processing indicate a strong potential
for masked autoencoder approaches. Our work compares state-of-the-art
contrastive learning methods with the recently introduced masked autoencoder
approach "SparK" for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on medical images.
Therefore we pre-train on a large unannotated CT image dataset and fine-tune on
several CT classification tasks. Due to the challenge of obtaining sufficient
annotated training data in medical imaging, it is of particular interest to
evaluate how the self-supervised pre-training methods perform when fine-tuning
on small datasets. By experimenting with gradually reducing the training
dataset size for fine-tuning, we find that the reduction has different effects
depending on the type of pre-training chosen. The SparK pre-training method is
more robust to the training dataset size than the contrastive methods. Based on
our results, we propose the SparK pre-training for medical imaging tasks with
only small annotated datasets.]]></summary>

temporal-dynamics prediction of chaotic systems, we propose a novel attention
mechanism called easy attention. Due to the fact that self attention only makes
usage of the inner product of queries and keys, it is demonstrated that the
keys, queries and softmax are not necessary for obtaining the attention score
required to capture long-term dependencies in temporal sequences. Through
implementing singular-value decomposition (SVD) on the softmax attention score,
we further observe that the self attention compresses contribution from both
queries and keys in the spanned space of the attention score. Therefore, our
proposed easy-attention method directly treats the attention scores as
learnable parameters. This approach produces excellent results when
reconstructing and predicting the temporal dynamics of chaotic systems
exhibiting more robustness and less complexity than the self attention or the
widely-used long short-term memory (LSTM) network. Our results show great
potential for applications in more complex high-dimensional dynamical systems.]]></summary>

unstructured data including language, image, audio, and video. However, a

LANISTR's methodology is rooted in \textit{masking-based} training applied
across both unimodal and multimodal levels. In particular, we introduce a new
similarity-based multimodal masking loss that enables it to learn cross-modal
relations from large-scale multimodal data with missing modalities. On two
real-world datastes, MIMIC-IV (healthcare) and Amazon Product Review (retail),
LANISTR demonstrates remarkable absolute improvements of 6.6\% (AUROC) and up
to 14\% (accuracy) when fine-tuned on 0.1\% and 0.01\% of labeled data,
respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art alternatives. Notably, these

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most existing classical artificial neural networks (ANN) are designed as a
tree structure to imitate neural networks. In this paper, we argue that the
connectivity of a tree is not sufficient to characterize a neural network. The
nodes of the same level of a tree cannot be connected with each other, i.e.,
these neural unit cannot share information with each other, which is a major
drawback of ANN. Although ANN has been significantly improved in recent years
to more complex structures, such as the directed acyclic graph (DAG), these
methods also have unidirectional and acyclic bias for ANN. In this paper, we
propose a method to build a bidirectional complete graph for the nodes in the
same level of an ANN, which yokes the nodes of the same level to formulate a
neural module. We call our model as YNN in short. YNN promotes the information
transfer significantly which obviously helps in improving the performance of
the method. Our YNN can imitate neural networks much better compared with the
traditional ANN. In this paper, we analyze the existing structural bias of ANN
and propose a model YNN to efficiently eliminate such structural bias. In our
model, nodes also carry out aggregation and transformation of features, and
edges determine the flow of information. We further impose auxiliary sparsity
constraint to the distribution of connectedness, which promotes the learned
structure to focus on critical connections. Finally, based on the optimized
structure, we also design small neural module structure based on the minimum
cut technique to reduce the computational burden of the YNN model. This
learning process is compatible with the existing networks and different tasks.
The obtained quantitative experimental results reflect that the learned
connectivity is superior to the traditional NN structure.]]></summary>

learning over graphs. Despite their popularity, scaling GNNs either by
deepening or widening suffers from prevalent issues of unhealthy gradients,
over-smoothening, information squashing, which often lead to sub-standard
performance. In this work, we are interested in exploring a principled way to
scale GNNs capacity without deepening or widening, which can improve its
performance across multiple small and large graphs. Motivated by the recent
intriguing phenomenon of model soups, which suggest that fine-tuned weights of
multiple large-language pre-trained models can be merged to a better minima, we
argue to exploit the fundamentals of model soups to mitigate the aforementioned
issues of memory bottleneck and trainability during GNNs scaling. More
specifically, we propose not to deepen or widen current GNNs, but instead
present a data-centric perspective of model soups tailored for GNNs, i.e., to
build powerful GNNs. By dividing giant graph data, we build multiple
independently and parallelly trained weaker GNNs (soup ingredient) without any
intermediate communication, and combine their strength using a greedy
interpolation soup procedure to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Compared
to concurrent distributed GNN training works such as Jiong et. al. 2023, we
train each soup ingredient by sampling different subgraphs per epoch and their
respective sub-models are merged only after being fully trained (rather than
intermediately so). Moreover, we provide a wide variety of model soup

log-based anomaly detection. This approach aims to extract meaning from log
events (log message templates) and develop advanced DL models for anomaly
detection. However, these DL methods face challenges like heavy reliance on
training data, labels, and computational resources due to model complexity. In
contrast, traditional machine learning and data mining techniques are less
data-dependent and more efficient but less effective than DL. To make log-based
anomaly detection more practical, the goal is to enhance traditional techniques
to match DL's effectiveness. Previous research in a different domain (linking
questions on Stack Overflow) suggests that optimized traditional techniques can
rival state-of-the-art DL methods. Drawing inspiration from this concept, we
conducted an empirical study. We optimized the unsupervised PCA (Principal
Component Analysis), a traditional technique, by incorporating lightweight
semantic-based log representation. This addresses the issue of unseen log
events in training data, enhancing log representation. Our study compared seven
log-based anomaly detection methods, including four DL-based, two traditional,
and the optimized PCA technique, using public and industrial datasets. Results
indicate that the optimized unsupervised PCA technique achieves similar
effectiveness to advanced supervised/semi-supervised DL methods while being

productions like Netflix and Facebook. As with most data-driven systems, DRL
systems can exhibit undesirable behaviors due to environmental drifts, which
often occur in constantly-changing production settings. Continual Learning (CL)
is the inherent self-healing approach for adapting the DRL agent in response to
the environment's conditions shifts. However, successive shifts of considerable
magnitude may cause the production environment to drift from its original
state. Recent studies have shown that these environmental drifts tend to drive
CL into long, or even unsuccessful, healing cycles, which arise from
inefficiencies such as catastrophic forgetting, warm-starting failure, and slow
convergence. In this paper, we propose Dr. DRL, an effective self-healing
approach for DRL systems that integrates a novel mechanism of intentional
forgetting into vanilla CL to overcome its main issues. Dr. DRL deliberately
erases the DRL system's minor behaviors to systematically prioritize the
adaptation of the key problem-solving skills. Using well-established DRL
algorithms, Dr. DRL is compared with vanilla CL on various drifted
environments. Dr. DRL is able to reduce, on average, the healing time and
fine-tuning episodes by, respectively, 18.74% and 17.72%. Dr. DRL successfully
helps agents to adapt to 19.63% of drifted environments left unsolved by
vanilla CL while maintaining and even enhancing by up to 45% the obtained
rewards for drifted environments that are resolved by both approaches.]]></summary>

markets, with broad applications such as pricing American and Bermudan options.
The deep BSDE method [Han, Jentzen and E, PNAS, 115(34):8505-8510, 2018] has
shown great power in solving high-dimensional forward-backward stochastic
differential equations (FBSDEs), and inspired many applications. However, the
method solves backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) in a forward
manner, which can not be used for optimal stopping problems that in general
require running BSDE backwardly. To overcome this difficulty, a recent paper
[Wang, Chen, Sudjianto, Liu and Shen, arXiv:1807.06622, 2018] proposed the
backward deep BSDE method to solve the optimal stopping problem. In this paper,
we provide the rigorous theory for the backward deep BSDE method. Specifically,
1. We derive the a posteriori error estimation, i.e., the error of the
numerical solution can be bounded by the training loss function; and; 2. We
give an upper bound of the loss function, which can be sufficiently small
subject to universal approximations. We give two numerical examples, which
present consistent performance with the proved theory.]]></summary>

for diagnosing hematological diseases. Due to constantly evolving clinical
settings, data sources, and disease classifications, it is necessary to update
machine learning classification models regularly for practical real-world use.
Such models significantly benefit from sequentially learning from incoming data
streams without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. However, models can
suffer from catastrophic forgetting, causing a drop in performance on previous
tasks when fine-tuned on new data. Here, we propose a rehearsal-based continual
learning approach for class incremental and domain incremental scenarios in
white blood cell classification. To choose representative samples from previous
tasks, we employ exemplar set selection based on the model's predictions. This
involves selecting the most confident samples and the most challenging samples
identified through uncertainty estimation of the model. We thoroughly evaluated
our proposed approach on three white blood cell classification datasets that
differ in color, resolution, and class composition, including scenarios where
new domains or new classes are introduced to the model with every task. We also
test a long class incremental experiment with both new domains and new classes.
Our results demonstrate that our approach outperforms established baselines in
continual learning, including existing iCaRL and EWC methods for classifying
white blood cells in cross-domain environments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Variational Information Pursuit (V-IP) is a framework for making
interpretable predictions by design by sequentially selecting a short chain of
task-relevant, user-defined and interpretable queries about the data that are
most informative for the task. While this allows for built-in interpretability
in predictive models, applying V-IP to any task requires data samples with
dense concept-labeling by domain experts, limiting the application of V-IP to
small-scale tasks where manual data annotation is feasible. In this work, we
extend the V-IP framework with Foundational Models (FMs) to address this
limitation. More specifically, we use a two-step process, by first leveraging
Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate a sufficiently large candidate set of
task-relevant interpretable concepts, then using Large Multimodal Models to
annotate each data sample by semantic similarity with each concept in the
generated concept set. While other interpretable-by-design frameworks such as
Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) require an additional step of removing
repetitive and non-discriminative concepts to have good interpretability and
test performance, we mathematically and empirically justify that, with a
sufficiently informative and task-relevant query (concept) set, the proposed
FM+V-IP method does not require any type of concept filtering. In addition, we
show that FM+V-IP with LLM generated concepts can achieve better test
performance than V-IP with human annotated concepts, demonstrating the
effectiveness of LLMs at generating efficient query sets. Finally, when
compared to other interpretable-by-design frameworks such as CBMs, FM+V-IP can
achieve competitive test performance using fewer number of concepts/queries in
both cases with filtered or unfiltered concept sets.]]></summary>

subtyping has emerged as a revolutionary approach, as different level of omics

focuses on fully exploiting the potential of multi-omics data to improve cancer
subtyping outcomes, and hence developed MoCLIM, a representation learning
framework. MoCLIM independently extracts the informative features from distinct
omics modalities. Using a unified representation informed by contrastive
learning of different omics modalities, we can well-cluster the subtypes, given
cancer, into a lower latent space. This contrast can be interpreted as a
projection of inter-omics inference observed in biological networks.
Experimental results on six cancer datasets demonstrate that our approach

clients to construct a global model. While FL enables learning a model with
data privacy, it often suffers from significant performance degradation when
client data distributions are heterogeneous. Many previous FL algorithms have
addressed this issue by introducing various proximal restrictions. These
restrictions aim to encourage global alignment by constraining the deviation of
local learning from the global objective. However, they inherently limit local
learning by interfering with the original local objectives. Recently, an
alternative approach has emerged to improve local learning generality. By
obtaining local models within a smooth loss landscape, this approach mitigates
conflicts among different local objectives of the clients. Yet, it does not
ensure stable global alignment, as local learning does not take the global
objective into account. In this study, we propose Federated Stability on
Learning (FedSoL), which combines both the concepts of global alignment and
local generality. In FedSoL, the local learning seeks a parameter region robust
against proximal perturbations. This strategy introduces an implicit proximal
restriction effect in local learning while maintaining the original local
objective for parameter update. Our experiments show that FedSoL consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance on various setups.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We tackle the problem of feature unlearning from a pre-trained image
generative model: GANs and VAEs. Unlike a common unlearning task where an
unlearning target is a subset of the training set, we aim to unlearn a specific
feature, such as hairstyle from facial images, from the pre-trained generative
models. As the target feature is only presented in a local region of an image,
unlearning the entire image from the pre-trained model may result in losing
other details in the remaining region of the image. To specify which features
to unlearn, we collect randomly generated images that contain the target
features. We then identify a latent representation corresponding to the target
feature and then use the representation to fine-tune the pre-trained model.
Through experiments on MNIST and CelebA datasets, we show that target features
are successfully removed while keeping the fidelity of the original models.
Further experiments with an adversarial attack show that the unlearned model is
more robust under the presence of malicious parties.]]></summary>

datasets, yet their real-world performance is restricted due to the controlled
experimental conditions involving clean training data. Addressing the challenge
of training with noise, a prevalent issue in practical anomaly detection, is
frequently overlooked. In a pioneering endeavor, this study delves into the
realm of label-level noise within sensory time-series anomaly detection (TSAD).
This paper presents a novel and practical end-to-end unsupervised TSAD when the
training data are contaminated with anomalies. The introduced approach, called
TSAD-C, is devoid of access to abnormality labels during the training phase.
TSAD-C encompasses three modules: a Decontaminator to rectify the abnormalities
(aka noise) present in the training data, a Variable Dependency Modeling module
to capture both long-term intra- and inter-variable dependencies within the
decontaminated data that can be considered as a surrogate of the pure normal
data, and an Anomaly Scoring module to detect anomalies. Our extensive
experiments conducted on three widely used physiological datasets conclusively
demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing methodologies, thus
establishing a new state-of-the-art performance in the field.]]></summary>

two degrees of freedom to carry out actuation tasks on the fly. Our solution is
based on employing a Q-learning method to control the trajectory of the tip of
the arm, also called \textit{end-effector}. More specifically, we develop a
motion planning model based on Time To Collision (TTC), which enables a
quadrotor UAV to navigate around obstacles while ensuring the manipulator's
reachability. Additionally, we utilize a model-based Q-learning model to
independently track and control the desired trajectory of the manipulator's
end-effector, given an arbitrary baseline trajectory for the UAV platform. Such
a combination enables a variety of actuation tasks such as high-altitude
welding, structural monitoring and repair, battery replacement, gutter
cleaning, sky scrapper cleaning, and power line maintenance in hard-to-reach
and risky environments while retaining compatibility with flight control
firmware. Our RL-based control mechanism results in a robust control strategy
that can handle uncertainties in the motion of the UAV, offering promising
performance. Specifically, our method achieves 92\% accuracy in terms of

the collaborative data analysis of multiple users with privacy concerns and

mechanisms provide any privacy protection. In this paper, we study the local

specifically, we advance the existing literature by deriving tight $f$-DP

and the sign-based methods that are proposed for data compression, in
closed-form expressions. We further investigate the amplification in privacy by
sparsification and propose a ternary stochastic compressor. By leveraging
compression for privacy amplification, we improve the existing methods by
removing the dependency of accuracy (in terms of mean square error) on
communication cost in the popular use case of distributed mean estimation,
therefore breaking the three-way tradeoff between privacy, communication, and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, foundation models have exhibited remarkable advancements in
multi-modal learning. These models, equipped with millions (or billions) of
parameters, typically require a substantial amount of data for finetuning.
However, collecting and centralizing training data from diverse sectors becomes
challenging due to distinct privacy regulations. Federated Learning (FL)
emerges as a promising solution, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively
train neural networks without centralizing their local data. To alleviate
client computation burdens and communication overheads, previous works have
adapted Parameter-efficient Finetuning (PEFT) methods for FL. Hereby, only a
small fraction of the model parameters are optimized and communicated during
federated communications. Nevertheless, most previous works have focused on a
single modality and neglected one common phenomenon, i.e., the presence of data
heterogeneity across the clients. Therefore, in this work, we propose a
finetuning framework tailored to heterogeneous multi-modal FL, called Federated
Dual-Aadapter Teacher (FedDAT). Specifically, our approach leverages a
Dual-Adapter Teacher (DAT) to address data heterogeneity by regularizing the
client local updates and applying Mutual Knowledge Distillation (MKD) for an
efficient knowledge transfer. FedDAT is the first approach that enables an
efficient distributed finetuning of foundation models for a variety of
heterogeneous Vision-Language tasks. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we
conduct extensive experiments on four multi-modality FL benchmarks with
different types of data heterogeneity, where FedDAT substantially outperforms
the existing centralized PEFT methods adapted for FL.]]></summary>

data sources such as GTFS and smart card data, we extract features and model
the transportation network as a directed graph. Using self-supervision, we
train a deep learning model for predicting lateness values for road segments.

These lateness values are then utilized as edge weights in the transportation
graph, enabling efficient path searching. Through evaluating the method on Tel
Aviv, we are able to reduce times on more than 9\% of the routes. The improved
routes included both intraurban and suburban routes showcasing a fact

regression problem that can be efficiently solved using sparse Gaussian

continuous sensor placement problems-where sensors can be placed anywhere in a
bounded continuous region. We further generalize our approach to handle sensors
with a non-point field of view and integrated observations. Our experimental
results on three real-world datasets show that our approach generates sensor
placements that result in reconstruction quality that is consistently on par or

cross-frame distribution in dynamic cardiac positron emission tomography (PET)
raise significant challenges for inter-frame motion correction, particularly
for the early frames where conventional intensity-based image registration
techniques are not applicable. Alternatively, a promising approach utilizes
generative methods to handle the tracer distribution changes to assist existing
registration methods. To improve frame-wise registration and parametric
quantification, we propose a Temporally and Anatomically Informed Generative
Adversarial Network (TAI-GAN) to transform the early frames into the late

linear modulation layer encodes channel-wise parameters generated from temporal
tracer kinetics information, and rough cardiac segmentations with local shifts
serve as the anatomical information. We validated our proposed method on a
clinical $^{82}$Rb PET dataset and found that our TAI-GAN can produce converted
early frames with high image quality, comparable to the real reference frames.

rendered in arbitrary perspectives to produce images. Although previous methods
produce realistic images, they suffer from unstable training or degenerate
solutions where the 3D geometry is unnatural. We hypothesize that the 3D
geometry is underdetermined due to the insufficient constraint, i.e., being
classified as real image to the discriminator is not enough. To solve this
problem, we propose to approximate the background as a spherical surface and
represent a scene as a union of the foreground placed in the sphere and the
thin spherical background. It reduces the degree of freedom in the background
field. Accordingly, we modify the volume rendering equation and incorporate
dedicated constraints to design a novel 3D-aware GAN framework named BallGAN.
BallGAN has multiple advantages as follows. 1) It produces more reasonable 3D
geometry; the images of a scene across different viewpoints have better
photometric consistency and fidelity than the state-of-the-art methods. 2) The
training becomes much more stable. 3) The foreground can be separately rendered
on top of different arbitrary backgrounds.]]></summary>

where communication plays a key role. As such, several works have extensively
analyzed stochastic optimization with delayed gradients. However, as far as we
are aware, no analogous theory is available for min-max optimization, a topic
that has gained recent popularity due to applications in adversarial
robustness, game theory, and reinforcement learning. Motivated by this gap, we
examine the performance of standard min-max optimization algorithms with
delayed gradient updates. First, we show (empirically) that even small delays
can cause prominent algorithms like Extra-gradient (\texttt{EG}) to diverge on
simple instances for which \texttt{EG} guarantees convergence in the absence of
delays. Our empirical study thus suggests the need for a careful analysis of
delayed versions of min-max optimization algorithms. Accordingly, under

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cloth simulation is an extensively studied problem, with a plethora of
solutions available in computer graphics literature. Existing cloth simulators
produce realistic cloth deformations that obey different types of boundary
conditions. Nevertheless, their operational principle remains limited in
several ways: They operate on explicit surface representations with a fixed
spatial resolution, perform a series of discretised updates (which bounds their
temporal resolution), and require comparably large amounts of storage.
Moreover, back-propagating gradients through the existing solvers is often not
straightforward, which poses additional challenges when integrating them into
modern neural architectures. In response to the limitations mentioned above,
this paper takes a fundamentally different perspective on physically-plausible
cloth simulation and re-thinks this long-standing problem: We propose
NeuralClothSim, i.e., a new cloth simulation approach using thin shells, in
which surface evolution is encoded in neural network weights. Our
memory-efficient and differentiable solver operates on a new continuous
coordinate-based representation of dynamic surfaces, i.e., neural deformation
fields (NDFs); it supervises NDF evolution with the rules of the non-linear
Kirchhoff-Love shell theory. NDFs are adaptive in the sense that they 1)
allocate their capacity to the deformation details as the latter arise during
the cloth evolution and 2) allow surface state queries at arbitrary spatial and
temporal resolutions without retraining. We show how to train our
NeuralClothSim solver while imposing hard boundary conditions and demonstrate
multiple applications, such as material interpolation and simulation editing.
The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our formulation and its
potential impact.]]></summary>

online social networks (OSNs), often for political, ideological, or financial
gain, has affected the openness of OSNs. While researchers from various
disciplines have investigated different manipulation-triggering elements of
OSNs (such as understanding information diffusion on OSNs or detecting
automated behavior of accounts), these works have not been consolidated to
present a comprehensive overview of the interconnections among these elements.
Notably, user psychology, the prevalence of bots, and their tactics in relation
to false information detection have been overlooked in previous research. To
address this research gap, this paper synthesizes insights from various
disciplines to provide a comprehensive analysis of the manipulation landscape.
By integrating the primary elements of social media manipulation (SMM),
including false information, bots, and malicious campaigns, we extensively
examine each SMM element. Through a systematic investigation of prior research,
we identify commonalities, highlight existing gaps, and extract valuable
insights in the field. Our findings underscore the urgent need for
interdisciplinary research to effectively combat social media manipulations,

player's experience in video games. Recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL)
methods have been employed for DDA in non-competitive games; nevertheless, they
rely solely on discrete state-action space with a small search space. In this
paper, we propose a continuous RL-based DDA methodology for a visual working
memory (VWM) game to handle the complex search space for the difficulty of
memorization. The proposed RL-based DDA tailors game difficulty based on the
player's score and game difficulty in the last trial. We defined a continuous
metric for the difficulty of memorization. Then, we consider the task
difficulty and the vector of difficulty-score as the RL's action and state,
respectively. We evaluated the proposed method through a within-subject
experiment involving 52 subjects. The proposed approach was compared with two
rule-based difficulty adjustment methods in terms of player's score and game
experience measured by a questionnaire. The proposed RL-based approach resulted
in a significantly better game experience in terms of competence, tension, and
negative and positive affect. Players also achieved higher scores and win
rates. Furthermore, the proposed RL-based DDA led to a significantly less
decline in the score in a 20-trial session.]]></summary>

Classification models are typically trained on a static pre-defined dataset and
are kept in the dark for the open unassigned feature space. As a result, they
struggle to deal with out-of-distribution data during inference. Addressing
this task on the class-level is termed open-set recognition (OSR). However,
most OSR methods are inherently limited, as they train closed-set classifiers
and only adapt the downstream predictions to OSR. This work presents LORD, a
framework to Leverage Open-set Recognition by exploiting unknown Data. LORD
explicitly models open space during classifier training and provides a
systematic evaluation for such approaches. We identify three model-agnostic
training strategies that exploit background data and applied them to
well-established classifiers. Due to LORD's extensive evaluation protocol, we
consistently demonstrate improved recognition of unknown data. The benchmarks
facilitate in-depth analysis across various requirement levels. To mitigate
dependency on extensive and costly background datasets, we explore mixup as an
off-the-shelf data generation technique. Our experiments highlight mixup's
effectiveness as a substitute for background datasets. Lightweight constraints
on mixup synthesis further improve OSR performance.]]></summary>

built speech-driven gesture-generation systems using the same speech and motion
dataset, followed by a joint evaluation. This year's challenge provided data on
both sides of a dyadic interaction, allowing teams to generate full-body motion
for an agent given its speech (text and audio) and the speech and motion of the
interlocutor. We evaluated 12 submissions and 2 baselines together with
held-out motion-capture data in several large-scale user studies. The studies
focused on three aspects: 1) the human-likeness of the motion, 2) the
appropriateness of the motion for the agent's own speech whilst controlling for
the human-likeness of the motion, and 3) the appropriateness of the motion for
the behaviour of the interlocutor in the interaction, using a setup that
controls for both the human-likeness of the motion and the agent's own speech.
We found a large span in human-likeness between challenge submissions, with a
few systems rated close to human mocap. Appropriateness seems far from being
solved, with most submissions performing in a narrow range slightly above
chance, far behind natural motion. The effect of the interlocutor is even more
subtle, with submitted systems at best performing barely above chance.
Interestingly, a dyadic system being highly appropriate for agent speech does
not necessarily imply high appropriateness for the interlocutor. Additional
material is available via the project website at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CNNs have been widely applied for medical image analysis. However, limited
memory capacity is one of the most common drawbacks of processing
high-resolution 3D volumetric data. 3D volumes are usually cropped or downsized
first before processing, which can result in a loss of resolution, increase
class imbalance, and affect the performance of the segmentation algorithms. In
this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning approach called IP-UNet.
IP-UNet is a UNet-based model that performs multi-class segmentation on
Intensity Projection (IP) of 3D volumetric data instead of the memory-consuming
3D volumes. IP-UNet uses limited memory capability for training without losing
the original 3D image resolution. We compare the performance of three models in
terms of segmentation accuracy and computational cost: 1) Slice-by-slice 2D
segmentation of the CT scan images using a conventional 2D UNet model. 2)
IP-UNet that operates on data obtained by merging the extracted Maximum
Intensity Projection (MIP), Closest Vessel Projection (CVP), and Average
Intensity Projection (AvgIP) representations of the source 3D volumes, then
applying the UNet model on the output IP images. 3) 3D-UNet model directly
reads the 3D volumes constructed from a series of CT scan images and outputs
the 3D volume of the predicted segmentation. We test the performance of these
methods on 3D volumetric images for automatic breast calcification detection.
Experimental results show that IP-Unet can achieve similar segmentation
accuracy with 3D-Unet but with much better performance. It reduces the training
time by 70\% and memory consumption by 92\%.]]></summary>

study the brain's structural connectivity in domains such as neurological
disorders, neurosurgery, and aging. In this study, we present FIESTA (FIbEr
Segmentation in Tractography using Autoencoders), a reliable and robust, fully
automated, and easily semi-automatically calibrated pipeline based on deep
autoencoders that can dissect and fully populate white matter bundles. This
pipeline is built upon previous works that demonstrated how autoencoders can be
used successfully for streamline filtering, bundle segmentation, and streamline
generation in tractography. Our proposed method improves bundle segmentation
coverage by recovering hard-to-track bundles with generative sampling through
the latent space seeding of the subject bundle and the atlas bundle. A latent
space of streamlines is learned using autoencoder-based modeling combined with
contrastive learning. Using an atlas of bundles in standard space (MNI), our
proposed method segments new tractograms using the autoencoder latent distance
between each tractogram streamline and its closest neighbor bundle in the atlas
of bundles. Intra-subject bundle reliability is improved by recovering
hard-to-track streamlines, using the autoencoder to generate new streamlines
that increase the spatial coverage of each bundle while remaining anatomically
correct. Results show that our method is more reliable than state-of-the-art
automated virtual dissection methods such as RecoBundles, RecoBundlesX,
TractSeg, White Matter Analysis and XTRACT. Our framework allows for the
transition from one anatomical bundle definition to another with marginal
calibration efforts. Overall, these results show that our framework improves

cleared by the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), many studies have shown
inconsistent generalization or latent bias, particularly for underrepresented
populations. Some have proposed that generative AI could reduce the need for
real data, but its utility in model development remains unclear. Skin disease
serves as a useful case study in synthetic image generation due to the
diversity of disease appearance, particularly across the protected attribute of
skin tone. Here we show that latent diffusion models can scalably generate
images of skin disease and that augmenting model training with these data
improves performance in data-limited settings. These performance gains saturate
at synthetic-to-real image ratios above 10:1 and are substantially smaller than
the gains obtained from adding real images. As part of our analysis, we
generate and analyze a new dataset of 458,920 synthetic images produced using
several generation strategies. Our results suggest that synthetic data could
serve as a force-multiplier for model development, but the collection of
diverse real-world data remains the most important step to improve medical AI
algorithms.]]></summary>

matching necessary and sufficient conditions for their PAC learnability, along
with corresponding sample complexity bounds, in the setting where the learner
is given access only to prepared quantum states. We first probe the results
from previous works on this setting. We show that the empirical risk defined in
previous works and matching the definition in the classical theory fails to
satisfy the uniform convergence property enjoyed in the classical setting for
some learnable classes. Moreover, we show that VC dimension generalization
upper bounds in previous work are frequently infinite, even for
finite-dimensional POVM classes. To surmount the failure of the standard ERM to
satisfy uniform convergence, we define a new learning rule -- denoised ERM. We
show this to be a universal learning rule for POVM and probabilistically
observed concept classes, and the condition for it to satisfy uniform
convergence is finite fat shattering dimension of the class. We give
quantitative sample complexity upper and lower bounds for learnability in terms
of finite fat-shattering dimension and a notion of approximate finite
partitionability into approximately jointly measurable subsets, which allow for
sample reuse. We then show that finite fat shattering dimension implies finite
coverability by approximately jointly measurable subsets, leading to our
matching conditions. We also show that every measurement class defined on a
finite-dimensional Hilbert space is PAC learnable. We illustrate our results on

prediction under the training distribution but not in the test distribution.
Thus, models trained via the typical gradient-based optimization of
cross-entropy, which we call default-ERM, utilize the shortcut. However, even
when the stable feature determines the label in the training distribution and
the shortcut does not provide any additional information, like in perception
tasks, default-ERM still exhibits shortcut learning. Why are such solutions
preferred when the loss for default-ERM can be driven to zero using the stable
feature alone? By studying a linear perception task, we show that default-ERM's
preference for maximizing the margin leads to models that depend more on the
shortcut than the stable feature, even without overparameterization. This
insight suggests that default-ERM's implicit inductive bias towards max-margin
is unsuitable for perception tasks. Instead, we develop an inductive bias
toward uniform margins and show that this bias guarantees dependence only on
the perfect stable feature in the linear perception task. We develop loss
functions that encourage uniform-margin solutions, called margin control
(MARG-CTRL). MARG-CTRL mitigates shortcut learning on a variety of vision and
language tasks, showing that better inductive biases can remove the need for
expensive two-stage shortcut-mitigating methods in perception tasks.]]></summary>

high-dimensional Hamiltonian systems using data-driven quadratic manifolds.
Classical symplectic model reduction approaches employ linear symplectic
subspaces for representing the high-dimensional system states in a
reduced-dimensional coordinate system. While these approximations respect the
symplectic nature of Hamiltonian systems, linear basis approximations can
suffer from slowly decaying Kolmogorov $N$-width, especially in wave-type
problems, which then requires a large basis size. We propose two different
model reduction methods based on recently developed quadratic manifolds, each
presenting its own advantages and limitations. The addition of quadratic terms
to the state approximation, which sits at the heart of the proposed
methodologies, enables us to better represent intrinsic low-dimensionality in
the problem at hand. Both approaches are effective for issuing predictions in
settings well outside the range of their training data while providing more
accurate solutions than the linear symplectic reduced-order models.]]></summary>

reinforcement learning, has shown significant potential in achieving
human-level autonomy in a wide range of domains, including robotics, computer
vision, and computer games. This potential justifies the enthusiasm and growing
interest in DRL in both academia and industry. However, the community currently
focuses mostly on the development phase of DRL systems, with little attention
devoted to DRL deployment. In this paper, we propose an empirical study on
Stack Overflow (SO), the most popular Q&A forum for developers, to uncover and
understand the challenges practitioners faced when deploying DRL systems.
Specifically, we categorized relevant SO posts by deployment platforms:
server/cloud, mobile/embedded system, browser, and game engine. After filtering
and manual analysis, we examined 357 SO posts about DRL deployment,
investigated the current state, and identified the challenges related to
deploying DRL systems. Then, we investigate the prevalence and difficulty of
these challenges. Results show that the general interest in DRL deployment is
growing, confirming the study's relevance and importance. Results also show
that DRL deployment is more difficult than other DRL issues. Additionally, we
built a taxonomy of 31 unique challenges in deploying DRL to different
platforms. On all platforms, RL environment-related challenges are the most
popular, and communication-related challenges are the most difficult among
practitioners. We hope our study inspires future research and helps the
community overcome the most common and difficult challenges practitioners face
when deploying DRL systems.]]></summary>

across a wide range of scientific disciplines, such as medicine, sociology,
political science, and economics, to name a few. However, in increasing
instances, especially given the proliferation of big data, gender information
is not readily available. In such cases researchers need to infer gender from
readily available information, primarily from persons' names. While inferring
gender from name may raise some ethical questions, the lack of viable
alternatives means that researchers have to resort to such approaches when the
goal justifies the means - in the majority of such studies the goal is to
examine patterns and determinants of gender disparities. The necessity of
name-to-gender inference has generated an ever-growing domain of algorithmic
approaches and software products. These approaches have been used throughout
the world in academia, industry, governmental and non-governmental
organizations. Nevertheless, the existing approaches have yet to be
systematically evaluated and compared, making it challenging to determine the
optimal approach for future research. In this work, we conducted a large scale
performance evaluation of existing approaches for name-to-gender inference.
Analysis are performed using a variety of large annotated datasets of names. We
further propose two new hybrid approaches that achieve better performance than

ensures numerical efficiency, improves the interpretability of models (due to
the smaller number of relevant features), and robustness. In machine learning
approaches based on linear models, it is well known that there exists a
connecting path between the sparsest solution in terms of the $\ell^1$ norm
(i.e., zero weights) and the non-regularized solution, which is called the
regularization path. Very recently, there was a first attempt to extend the
concept of regularization paths to DNNs by means of treating the empirical loss
and sparsity ($\ell^1$ norm) as two conflicting criteria and solving the
resulting multiobjective optimization problem. However, due to the
non-smoothness of the $\ell^1$ norm and the high number of parameters, this
approach is not very efficient from a computational perspective. To overcome
this limitation, we present an algorithm that allows for the approximation of
the entire Pareto front for the above-mentioned objectives in a very efficient
manner. We present numerical examples using both deterministic and stochastic
gradients. We furthermore demonstrate that knowledge of the regularization path
allows for a well-generalizing network parametrization.]]></summary>

labels are often scarce. The unsupervised domain adaptation problem aims at
exploiting labels from a source domain to classify data from a related, yet

as temporal shifts may appear in addition to the standard feature distribution
shift. In this paper, we introduce the Match-And-Deform (MAD) approach that
aims at finding correspondences between the source and target time series while
allowing temporal distortions. The associated optimization problem
simultaneously aligns the series thanks to an optimal transport loss and the
time stamps through dynamic time warping. When embedded into a deep neural
network, MAD helps learning new representations of time series that both align
the domains and maximize the discriminative power of the network. Empirical
studies on benchmark datasets and remote sensing data demonstrate that MAD
makes meaningful sample-to-sample pairing and time shift estimation, reaching
similar or better classification performance than state-of-the-art deep time

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Automatic high-quality rendering of anime scenes from complex real-world
images is of significant practical value. The challenges of this task lie in
the complexity of the scenes, the unique features of anime style, and the lack
of high-quality datasets to bridge the domain gap. Despite promising attempts,
previous efforts are still incompetent in achieving satisfactory results with
consistent semantic preservation, evident stylization, and fine details. In
this study, we propose Scenimefy, a novel semi-supervised image-to-image
translation framework that addresses these challenges. Our approach guides the
learning with structure-consistent pseudo paired data, simplifying the pure
unsupervised setting. The pseudo data are derived uniquely from a
semantic-constrained StyleGAN leveraging rich model priors like CLIP. We
further apply segmentation-guided data selection to obtain high-quality pseudo
supervision. A patch-wise contrastive style loss is introduced to improve
stylization and fine details. Besides, we contribute a high-resolution anime
scene dataset to facilitate future research. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines in
terms of both perceptual quality and quantitative performance.]]></summary>

prevalent in large-scale online platforms that capture and monitor diverse data
types. Several distinct challenges surface when modelling low-count time
series, particularly low signal-to-noise ratios (when anomaly signatures are
provably undetectable), and non-uniform performance (when average metrics are
not representative of local behaviour). The time series anomaly detection
community currently lacks explicit tooling and processes to model and reliably
detect anomalies in these settings. We address this gap by introducing a novel
generative procedure for creating benchmark datasets comprising of low-count
time series with anomalous segments. Via a mixture of theoretical and empirical
analysis, our work explains how widely-used algorithms struggle with the
distribution overlap between normal and anomalous segments. In order to
mitigate this shortcoming, we then leverage our findings to demonstrate how
anomaly score smoothing consistently improves performance. The practical
utility of our analysis and recommendation is validated on a real-world dataset
containing sales data for retail stores.]]></summary>

preserve privacy can serve as an alternative to real EHRs for machine learning
(ML) modeling and statistical analysis. However, generating high-fidelity and
granular electronic health record (EHR) data in its original,
highly-dimensional form poses challenges for existing methods due to the
complexities inherent in high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose
Hierarchical Autoregressive Language mOdel (HALO) for generating longitudinal
high-dimensional EHR, which preserve the statistical properties of real EHR and
can be used to train accurate ML models without privacy concerns. Our HALO
method, designed as a hierarchical autoregressive model, generates a
probability density function of medical codes, clinical visits, and patient
records, allowing for the generation of realistic EHR data in its original,
unaggregated form without the need for variable selection or aggregation.
Additionally, our model also produces high-quality continuous variables in a
longitudinal and probabilistic manner. We conducted extensive experiments and
demonstrate that HALO can generate high-fidelity EHR data with high-dimensional
disease code probabilities (d > 10,000), disease co-occurrence probabilities
within visits (d > 1,000,000), and conditional probabilities across consecutive
visits (d > 5,000,000) and achieve above 0.9 R2 correlation in comparison to
real EHR data. This performance then enables downstream ML models trained on
its synthetic data to achieve comparable accuracy to models trained on real
data (0.938 AUROC with HALO data vs. 0.943 with real data). Finally, using a
combination of real and synthetic data enhances the accuracy of ML models
beyond that achieved by using only real EHR data.]]></summary>

irregular topology poses challenges in applying them to existing neural network
architectures. Recent advances in mesh neural networks turn to remeshing and
push the boundary of pioneer methods that solely take the raw meshes as input.
Although the remeshing offers a regular topology that significantly facilitates
the design of mesh network architectures, features extracted from such remeshed
proxies may struggle to retain the underlying geometry faithfully, limiting the
subsequent neural network's capacity. To address this issue, we propose
SieveNet, a novel paradigm that takes into account both the regular topology
and the exact geometry. Specifically, this method utilizes structured mesh
topology from remeshing and accurate geometric information from
distortion-aware point sampling on the surface of the original mesh.
Furthermore, our method eliminates the need for hand-crafted feature
engineering and can leverage off-the-shelf network architectures such as the
vision transformer. Comprehensive experimental results on classification and
segmentation tasks well demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our
method.]]></summary>

better to regions of phase space with little data. We propose to use
Schroedinger Bridges and diffusion models to create SBUnfold, an unfolding
approach that combines the strengths of both discriminative and generative
models. The key feature of SBUnfold is that its generative model maps one set

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The wide application of deep neural networks (DNNs) demands an increasing
amount of attention to their real-world robustness, i.e., whether a DNN resists
black-box adversarial attacks, among which score-based query attacks (SQAs) are
most threatening since they can effectively hurt a victim network with the only
access to model outputs. Defending against SQAs requires a slight but artful
variation of outputs due to the service purpose for users, who share the same
output information with SQAs. In this paper, we propose a real-world defense by
Unifying Gradients (UniG) of different data so that SQAs could only probe a
much weaker attack direction that is similar for different samples. Since such
universal attack perturbations have been validated as less aggressive than the
input-specific perturbations, UniG protects real-world DNNs by indicating
attackers a twisted and less informative attack direction. We implement UniG
efficiently by a Hadamard product module which is plug-and-play. According to
extensive experiments on 5 SQAs, 2 adaptive attacks and 7 defense baselines,
UniG significantly improves real-world robustness without hurting clean
accuracy on CIFAR10 and ImageNet. For instance, UniG maintains a model of
77.80% accuracy under 2500-query Square attack while the state-of-the-art
adversarially-trained model only has 67.34% on CIFAR10. Simultaneously, UniG
outperforms all compared baselines in terms of clean accuracy and achieves the
smallest modification of the model output. The code is released at
https://github.com/snowien/UniG-pytorch.]]></summary>

carbon storage (GCS) problems to accelerate the prediction of reservoir
pressure and CO2 plume migration. Large amounts of data from physics-based
numerical simulators are required to train a model to accurately predict the
complex physical behaviors associated with this process. In practice, the
available training data are always limited in large-scale 3D problems due to
the high computational cost. Therefore, we propose to use a multi-fidelity
Fourier Neural Operator to solve large-scale GCS problems with more affordable
multi-fidelity training datasets. The Fourier Neural Operator has a desirable
grid-invariant property, which simplifies the transfer learning procedure
between datasets with different discretization. We first test the model
efficacy on a GCS reservoir model being discretized into 110k grid cells. The
multi-fidelity model can predict with accuracy comparable to a high-fidelity
model trained with the same amount of high-fidelity data with 81% less data
generation costs. We further test the generalizability of the multi-fidelity
model on a same reservoir model with a finer discretization of 1 million grid
cells. This case was made more challenging by employing high-fidelity and
low-fidelity datasets generated by different geostatistical models and
reservoir simulators. We observe that the multi-fidelity FNO model can predict

operator. One of the effective approaches is to offer some attractive incentive
or additional services or money to the subscribers for keeping them engaged and
make sure they stay in the operator's network for longer time. Often, operators
allocate certain amount of monetary budget to carry out the offer campaign. The
difficult part of this campaign is the selection of a set of customers from a
large subscriber-base and deciding the amount that should be offered to an
individual so that operator's objective is achieved. There may be multiple
objectives (e.g., maximizing revenue, minimizing number of churns) for
selection of subscriber and selection of an offer to the selected subscriber.
Apart from monetary benefit, offers may include additional data, SMS, hots-spot
tethering, and many more. This problem is known as offer optimization. In this
paper, we propose a novel combinatorial algorithm for solving offer
optimization under heterogeneous offers by maximizing expected revenue under
the scenario of subscriber churn, which is, in general, seen in telecom domain.
The proposed algorithm is efficient and accurate even for a very large

and discretizing in amplitude. Subsequent signal reconstructions inevitably
incur an error that depends on the amplitude resolution and the temporal
density of the acquired samples. From an implementation viewpoint, consistent
signal reconstruction methods have proven a profitable error-rate decay as the
sampling rate increases. Despite that, these results are obtained under offline
settings. Therefore, a research gap exists regarding methods for consistent
signal reconstruction from data streams. This paper presents a method that
consistently reconstructs streamed multivariate time series of quantization
intervals under a zero-delay response requirement. On the other hand, previous
work has shown that the temporal dependencies within univariate time series can
be exploited to reduce the roughness of zero-delay signal reconstructions. This
work shows that the spatiotemporal dependencies within multivariate time series
can also be exploited to achieve improved results. Specifically, the
spatiotemporal dependencies of the multivariate time series are learned, with
the assistance of a recurrent neural network, to reduce the roughness of the
signal reconstruction on average while ensuring consistency. Our experiments
show that our proposed method achieves a favorable error-rate decay with the
sampling rate compared to a similar but non-consistent reconstruction.]]></summary>

However, NNs are prone to yield unreliable predictions when encountering
completely new situations without indicating their uncertainty. Bayesian
variants of NNs (BNNs), such as Monte Carlo (MC) dropout BNNs, do provide
uncertainty measures and simultaneously increase the prediction performance.
The only disadvantage of BNNs is their higher computation time during test time
because they rely on a sampling approach. Here we present a single-shot MC
dropout approximation that preserves the advantages of BNNs while being as fast
as NNs. Our approach is based on moment propagation (MP) and allows to
analytically approximate the expected value and the variance of the MC dropout
signal for commonly used layers in NNs, i.e. convolution, max pooling, dense,
softmax, and dropout layers. The MP approach can convert an NN into a BNN
without re-training given the NN has been trained with standard dropout. We
evaluate our approach on different benchmark datasets and a simulated toy
example in a classification and regression setting. We demonstrate that our
single-shot MC dropout approximation resembles the point estimate and the
uncertainty estimate of the predictive distribution that is achieved with an MC
approach, while being fast enough for real-time deployments of BNNs. We show
that using part of the saved time to combine our MP approach with deep ensemble
techniques does further improve the uncertainty measures.]]></summary>

allocation strategies make a big difference to its performance. We propose a
Task-Adaptive Budget Allocation algorithm to robustly generate the optimal
budget allocation adaptive to different multi-task learning settings.
Specifically, we estimate and then maximize the extent of new information
obtained from the allocated budget as a proxy for multi-task learning
performance. Experiments on PASCAL VOC and Taskonomy demonstrate the efficacy

matching necessary and sufficient conditions for their PAC learnability, along
with corresponding sample complexity bounds, in the setting where the learner

from previous works on this setting. We show that the empirical risk defined in
previous works and matching the definition in the classical theory fails to
satisfy the uniform convergence property enjoyed in the classical setting for
some learnable classes. Moreover, we show that VC dimension generalization
upper bounds in previous work are frequently infinite, even for
finite-dimensional POVM classes. To surmount the failure of the standard ERM to
satisfy uniform convergence, we define a new learning rule -- denoised ERM. We
show this to be a universal learning rule for POVM and probabilistically
observed concept classes, and the condition for it to satisfy uniform
convergence is finite fat shattering dimension of the class. We give
quantitative sample complexity upper and lower bounds for learnability in terms
of finite fat-shattering dimension and a notion of approximate finite
partitionability into approximately jointly measurable subsets, which allow for
sample reuse. We then show that finite fat shattering dimension implies finite
coverability by approximately jointly measurable subsets, leading to our
matching conditions. We also show that every measurement class defined on a

productions like Netflix and Facebook. As with most data-driven systems, DRL
systems can exhibit undesirable behaviors due to environmental drifts, which
often occur in constantly-changing production settings. Continual Learning (CL)
is the inherent self-healing approach for adapting the DRL agent in response to
the environment's conditions shifts. However, successive shifts of considerable
magnitude may cause the production environment to drift from its original
state. Recent studies have shown that these environmental drifts tend to drive
CL into long, or even unsuccessful, healing cycles, which arise from
inefficiencies such as catastrophic forgetting, warm-starting failure, and slow
convergence. In this paper, we propose Dr. DRL, an effective self-healing
approach for DRL systems that integrates a novel mechanism of intentional
forgetting into vanilla CL to overcome its main issues. Dr. DRL deliberately
erases the DRL system's minor behaviors to systematically prioritize the
adaptation of the key problem-solving skills. Using well-established DRL
algorithms, Dr. DRL is compared with vanilla CL on various drifted
environments. Dr. DRL is able to reduce, on average, the healing time and
fine-tuning episodes by, respectively, 18.74% and 17.72%. Dr. DRL successfully
helps agents to adapt to 19.63% of drifted environments left unsolved by
vanilla CL while maintaining and even enhancing by up to 45% the obtained

prediction under the training distribution but not in the test distribution.
Thus, models trained via the typical gradient-based optimization of
cross-entropy, which we call default-ERM, utilize the shortcut. However, even
when the stable feature determines the label in the training distribution and
the shortcut does not provide any additional information, like in perception
tasks, default-ERM still exhibits shortcut learning. Why are such solutions
preferred when the loss for default-ERM can be driven to zero using the stable
feature alone? By studying a linear perception task, we show that default-ERM's
preference for maximizing the margin leads to models that depend more on the
shortcut than the stable feature, even without overparameterization. This
insight suggests that default-ERM's implicit inductive bias towards max-margin
is unsuitable for perception tasks. Instead, we develop an inductive bias
toward uniform margins and show that this bias guarantees dependence only on
the perfect stable feature in the linear perception task. We develop loss
functions that encourage uniform-margin solutions, called margin control
(MARG-CTRL). MARG-CTRL mitigates shortcut learning on a variety of vision and
language tasks, showing that better inductive biases can remove the need for
expensive two-stage shortcut-mitigating methods in perception tasks.]]></summary>

publishers trying to optimize the advertising investment for each user
acquisition based on the estimated worth. In mobile games, deploying
microtransactions is a simple yet effective monetization strategy, which
attracts a tiny group of game whales who splurge on in-game purchases. The
presence of such game whales may impede the practicality of existing LTV
prediction models, since game whales' purchase behaviours always exhibit varied
distribution from general users. Consequently, identifying game whales can open
up new opportunities to improve the accuracy of LTV prediction models. However,
little attention has been paid to applying game whale detection in LTV
prediction, and existing works are mainly specialized for the long-term LTV
prediction with the assumption that the high-quality user features are
available, which is not applicable in the UA stage. In this paper, we propose
ExpLTV, a novel multi-task framework to perform LTV prediction and game whale
detection in a unified way. In ExpLTV, we first innovatively design a deep
neural network-based game whale detector that can not only infer the intrinsic
order in accordance with monetary value, but also precisely identify high
spenders (i.e., game whales) and low spenders. Then, by treating the game whale
detector as a gating network to decide the different mixture patterns of LTV
experts assembling, we can thoroughly leverage the shared information and
scenario-specific information (i.e., game whales modelling and low spenders
modelling). Finally, instead of separately designing a purchase rate estimator
for two tasks, we design a shared estimator that can preserve the inner task
relationships. The superiority of ExpLTV is further validated via extensive
experiments on three industrial datasets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Post-training quantization attracts increasing attention due to its
convenience in deploying quantized neural networks. Although
rounding-to-nearest remains the prevailing method for DNN quantization, prior
research has demonstrated its suboptimal nature when applied to weight
quantization. They propose optimizing weight rounding schemes by leveraging
output error rather than the traditional weight quantization error. Our study
reveals that similar rounding challenges also extend to activation
quantization. Despite the easy generalization, the challenges lie in the
dynamic nature of activation. Adaptive rounding is expected for varying
activations and the method is subjected to runtime overhead. To tackle this, we
propose the AQuant quantization framework with a novel perspective to reduce
output error by adjusting rounding schemes of activations. Instead of using the
constant rounding border 0.5 of the rounding-to-nearest operation, we make the
border become a function w.r.t. the activation value to change the activation
rounding by the adaptive border. To deal with the runtime overhead, we use a
coarse-grained version of the border function. Finally, we introduce our
framework to optimize the border function. Extensive experiments show that
AQuant achieves notable improvements compared to state-of-the-art works and
pushes the accuracy of ResNet-18 up to 60.31% under the 2-bit weight and
activation quantization.]]></summary>

multivariate scientific problems such as materials discovery, but the available
search spaces can be dauntingly large. Bayesian optimization (BO) has emerged
as a popular sample-efficient optimization engine, thriving in tasks where no
analytic form of the target function/property is known. Here we exploit expert
human knowledge in the form of hypotheses to direct Bayesian searches more
quickly to promising regions of chemical space. Previous methods have used
underlying distributions derived from existing experimental measurements, which
is unfeasible for new, unexplored scientific tasks. Also, such distributions
cannot capture intricate hypotheses. Our proposed method, which we call HypBO,
uses expert human hypotheses to generate an improved seed of samples.
Unpromising seeds are automatically discounted, while promising seeds are used
to augment the surrogate model data, thus achieving better-informed sampling.
This process continues in a global versus local search fashion, organized in a
bilevel optimization framework. We validate the performance of our method on a
range of synthetic functions and demonstrate its practical utility on a real
chemical design task where the use of expert hypotheses accelerates the search
performance significantly.]]></summary>

quantify and compare them for sociodemographic bias with potential for harm.
Prior bias measurement datasets are sensitive to perturbations in their
manually designed templates, therefore unreliable. To achieve reliability, we
introduce the Comprehensive Assessment of Language Model bias (CALM), a
benchmark dataset to quantify bias in LMs across three tasks. We integrate 16
existing datasets across different domains, such as Wikipedia and news
articles, to filter 224 templates from which we construct a dataset of 78,400
examples. We compare the diversity of CALM with prior datasets on metrics such
as average semantic similarity, and variation in template length, and test the
sensitivity to small perturbations. We show that our dataset is more diverse
and reliable than previous datasets, thus better capture the breadth of
linguistic variation required to reliably evaluate model bias. We evaluate 20
large language models including six prominent families of LMs such as Llama-2.
In two LM series, OPT and Bloom, we found that larger parameter models are more
biased than lower parameter models. We found the T0 series of models to be the
least biased. Furthermore, we noticed a tradeoff between gender and racial bias
with increasing model size in some model series. The code is available at

(DNNs), wherein adversaries covertly implant malicious behaviors (backdoors)
into DNNs. Our defense falls within the category of post-development defenses
that operate independently of how the model was generated. The proposed defense
is built upon a novel reverse engineering approach that can directly extract
backdoor functionality of a given backdoored model to a backdoor expert model.
The approach is straightforward -- finetuning the backdoored model over a small
set of intentionally mislabeled clean samples, such that it unlearns the normal
functionality while still preserving the backdoor functionality, and thus
resulting in a model (dubbed a backdoor expert model) that can only recognize
backdoor inputs. Based on the extracted backdoor expert model, we show the
feasibility of devising highly accurate backdoor input detectors that filter
out the backdoor inputs during model inference. Further augmented by an
ensemble strategy with a finetuned auxiliary model, our defense, BaDExpert
(Backdoor Input Detection with Backdoor Expert), effectively mitigates 16 SOTA
backdoor attacks while minimally impacting clean utility. The effectiveness of
BaDExpert has been verified on multiple datasets (CIFAR10, GTSRB and ImageNet)

foundation and objectives in the era of big model, as well as the new
challenges faced in heterogeneous data, model aggregation, performance and cost

study of leading enterprises contributing multimodal data and expert knowledge
to city safety operation management , including distributed deployment and
efficient coordination of the federated learning platform, technical
innovations on data quality improvement based on large model capabilities and
efficient joint fine-tuning approaches. Preliminary experiments show that
enterprises can enhance and accumulate intelligent capabilities through
multimodal model federated learning, thereby jointly creating an smart city
model that provides high-quality intelligent services covering energy

reinforcement learning (RL) methodology. Unlike most of RL, it does not assume
availability of reward-feedback. Reward inference and shaping are known to be
difficult and error-prone methods particularly when the demonstration data
comes from human experts. Classical methods such as behavioral cloning and
inverse reinforcement learning are highly sensitive to estimation errors, a
problem that is particularly acute in continuous state space problems.
Meanwhile, state-of-the-art IL algorithms convert behavioral policy learning
problems into distribution-matching problems which often require additional
online interaction data to be effective. In this paper, we consider the problem
of imitation learning in continuous state space environments based solely on
observed behavior, without access to transition dynamics information, reward
structure, or, most importantly, any additional interactions with the
environment. Our approach is based on the Markov balance equation and
introduces a novel conditional kernel density estimation-based imitation
learning framework. It involves estimating the environment's transition
dynamics using conditional kernel density estimators and seeks to satisfy the
probabilistic balance equations for the environment. We establish that our
estimators satisfy basic asymptotic consistency requirements. Through a series
of numerical experiments on continuous state benchmark environments, we show
consistently superior empirical performance over many state-of-the-art IL
algorithms.]]></summary>

we present a novel physics-informed neural operator method to solve
parametrized boundary value problems without labeled data. By reformulating the
PDEs into boundary integral equations (BIEs), we can train the operator network
solely on the boundary of the domain. This approach reduces the number of
required sample points from $O(N^d)$ to $O(N^{d-1})$, where $d$ is the domain's
dimension, leading to a significant acceleration of the training process.
Additionally, our method can handle unbounded problems, which are unattainable
for existing physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural operators. Our
numerical experiments show the effectiveness of parametrized complex geometries
and unbounded problems.]]></summary>

convergence of iterative algorithms, with applications in various fields
including deep learning and optimization. Despite its popularity in these
areas, the effectiveness of AA in classical machine learning classifiers has
not been thoroughly studied. Tabular data, in particular, presents a unique
challenge for deep learning models, and classical machine learning models are
known to perform better in these scenarios. However, the convergence analysis
of these models has received limited attention. To address this gap in
research, we implement a support vector machine (SVM) classifier variant that
incorporates AA to speed up convergence. We evaluate the performance of our SVM
with and without Anderson acceleration on several datasets from the biology
domain and demonstrate that the use of AA significantly improves convergence
and reduces the training loss as the number of iterations increases. Our
findings provide a promising perspective on the potential of Anderson
acceleration in the training of simple machine learning classifiers and
underscore the importance of further research in this area. By showing the
effectiveness of AA in this setting, we aim to inspire more studies that

crafting multi-domain (e.g., frequency and space) radio power propagation maps
from limited sensor measurements. While early methods often lacked theoretical
support, recent works have demonstrated that radio maps can be provably
recovered using low-dimensional models -- such as the block-term tensor
decomposition (BTD) model and certain deep generative models (DGMs) -- of the
high-dimensional multi-domain radio signals. However, these existing provable
SC approaches assume that sensors send real-valued (full-resolution)
measurements to the fusion center, which is unrealistic. This work puts forth a
quantized SC framework that generalizes the BTD and DGM-based SC to scenarios
where heavily quantized sensor measurements are used. A maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE)-based SC framework under a Gaussian quantizer is proposed.
Recoverability of the radio map using the MLE criterion are characterized under
realistic conditions, e.g., imperfect radio map modeling and noisy
measurements. Simulations and real-data experiments are used to showcase the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.]]></summary>

SLAs using Integer Programming. It supports multi-objective settings for
achieving different trade-offs between accuracy and cost objectives while
remaining adaptable to varying workloads and dynamic traffic patterns.

flows of statistical and quantum field theories. Diffusion models are a class
of machine learning models which have been used to generate samples from
complex distributions, such as the distribution of natural images, by learning
the inverse process to a diffusion process which adds noise to the data until
the distribution of the data is pure noise. Nonperturbative renormalization
group schemes can naturally be written as diffusion processes in the space of
fields. We combine these observations in a concrete framework for building
ML-based models for studying field theories, in which the models learn the
inverse process to an explicitly-specified renormalization group scheme. We
detail how these models define a class of adaptive bridge (or parallel
tempering) samplers for lattice field theory. Because renormalization group
schemes have a physical meaning, we provide explicit prescriptions for how to
compare results derived from models associated to several different
renormalization group schemes of interest. We also explain how to use diffusion
models in a variational method to find ground states of quantum systems. We
apply some of our methods to numerically find RG flows of interacting
statistical field theories. From the perspective of machine learning, our work
provides an interpretation of multiscale diffusion models, and gives

significant research effort towards their application for downstream supervised
learning tasks. Although some previous studies have explored the unsupervised
fine-tuning of CLIP, they often rely on prior knowledge in the form of class
names associated with ground truth labels. In this paper, we delve into a
realistic unsupervised fine-tuning scenario by assuming that the unlabeled data
might contain out-of-distribution samples from unknown classes. Furthermore, we
emphasize the importance of simultaneously enhancing out-of-distribution
detection capabilities alongside the recognition of instances associated with
predefined class labels.

To tackle this problem, we present a simple, efficient, and effective
fine-tuning approach called Universal Entropy Optimization (UEO). UEO leverages
sample-level confidence to approximately minimize the conditional entropy of
confident instances and maximize the marginal entropy of less confident
instances. Apart from optimizing the textual prompts, UEO also incorporates
optimization of channel-wise affine transformations within the visual branch of
CLIP. Through extensive experiments conducted across 15 domains and 4 different
types of prior knowledge, we demonstrate that UEO surpasses baseline methods in

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Robot control using reinforcement learning has become popular, but its
learning process generally terminates halfway through an episode for safety and
time-saving reasons. This study addresses the problem of the most popular
exception handling that temporal-difference (TD) learning performs at such
termination. That is, by forcibly assuming zero value after termination,
unintentionally implicit underestimation or overestimation occurs, depending on
the reward design in the normal states. When the episode is terminated due to
task failure, the failure may be highly valued with the unintentional
overestimation, and the wrong policy may be acquired. Although this problem can
be avoided by paying attention to the reward design, it is essential in
practical use of TD learning to review the exception handling at termination.
This paper therefore proposes a method to intentionally underestimate the value
after termination to avoid learning failures due to the unintentional
overestimation. In addition, the degree of underestimation is adjusted
according to the degree of stationarity at termination, thereby preventing
excessive exploration due to the intentional underestimation. Simulations and
real robot experiments showed that the proposed method can stably obtain the
optimal policies for various tasks and reward designs.

stochastic nature of interactive traffic participants and the complexity of
road structures. Although reinforcement learning (RL)-based decision-making
scheme is promising to handle urban driving scenarios, it suffers from low
sample efficiency and poor adaptability. In this paper, we propose Scene-Rep
Transformer to improve the RL decision-making capabilities with better scene
representation encoding and sequential predictive latent distillation.
Specifically, a multi-stage Transformer (MST) encoder is constructed to model
not only the interaction awareness between the ego vehicle and its neighbors
but also intention awareness between the agents and their candidate routes. A
sequential latent Transformer (SLT) with self-supervised learning objectives is
employed to distill the future predictive information into the latent scene
representation, in order to reduce the exploration space and speed up training.
The final decision-making module based on soft actor-critic (SAC) takes as
input the refined latent scene representation from the Scene-Rep Transformer
and outputs driving actions. The framework is validated in five challenging
simulated urban scenarios with dense traffic, and its performance is manifested
quantitatively by the substantial improvements in data efficiency and
performance in terms of success rate, safety, and efficiency. The qualitative
results reveal that our framework is able to extract the intentions of neighbor
agents to help make decisions and deliver more diversified driving behaviors.]]></summary>

of transformer overload in the distribution grid. To mitigate such risks, there
are urgent needs to develop effective EV charging controllers. Currently, the
majority of the EV charge controllers are based on a centralized approach for
managing individual EVs or a group of EVs. In this paper, we introduce a
decentralized Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) charging framework that
prioritizes the preservation of privacy for EV owners. We employ the
Centralized Training Decentralized Execution-Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
(CTDE-DDPG) scheme, which provides valuable information to users during
training while maintaining privacy during execution. Our results demonstrate
that the CTDE framework improves the performance of the charging network by
reducing the network costs. Moreover, we show that the Peak-to-Average Ratio
(PAR) of the total demand is reduced, which, in turn, reduces the risk of
transformer overload during the peak hours.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a hardware efficient
architecture for classification tasks. The challenge of spike-based encoding
has been the lack of a universal training mechanism performed entirely using
spikes. There have been several attempts to adopt the powerful backpropagation
(BP) technique used in non-spiking artificial neural networks (ANN): (1) SNNs
can be trained by externally computed numerical gradients. (2) A major
advancement towards native spike-based learning has been the use of approximate
Backpropagation using spike-time dependent plasticity (STDP) with phased
forward/backward passes. However, the transfer of information between such
phases for gradient and weight update calculation necessitates external memory
and computational access. This is a challenge for standard neuromorphic
hardware implementations. In this paper, we propose a stochastic SNN based
Back-Prop (SSNN-BP) algorithm that utilizes a composite neuron to
simultaneously compute the forward pass activations and backward pass gradients
explicitly with spikes. Although signed gradient values are a challenge for
spike-based representation, we tackle this by splitting the gradient signal
into positive and negative streams. We show that our method approaches BP ANN
baseline with sufficiently long spike-trains. Finally, we show that the
well-performing softmax cross-entropy loss function can be implemented through
inhibitory lateral connections enforcing a Winner Take All (WTA) rule. Our SNN
with a 2-layer network shows excellent generalization through comparable
performance to ANNs with equivalent architecture and regularization parameters
on static image datasets like MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, Extended MNIST, and
temporally encoded image datasets like Neuromorphic MNIST datasets. Thus,
SSNN-BP enables BP compatible with purely spike-based neuromorphic hardware.]]></summary>

attribute performance improvements, we find that algorithmic improvements have
been roughly as important as the scaling of compute for progress computer

form of compute-augmenting algorithmic advances (which enable researchers to
get better performance from less compute), not data-augmenting algorithmic
advances. We find that compute-augmenting algorithmic advances are made at a

robotic systems by designing the controller using a neural network and training
it with model-free reinforcement learning. However, these outstanding
controllers with natural motion style and high task performance are developed
through extensive reward engineering, which is a highly laborious and
time-consuming process of designing numerous reward terms and determining
suitable reward coefficients. In this work, we propose a novel reinforcement
learning framework for training neural network controllers for complex robotic
systems consisting of both rewards and constraints. To let the engineers
appropriately reflect their intent to constraints and handle them with minimal
computation overhead, two constraint types and an efficient policy optimization
algorithm are suggested. The learning framework is applied to train locomotion
controllers for several legged robots with different morphology and physical
attributes to traverse challenging terrains. Extensive simulation and
real-world experiments demonstrate that performant controllers can be trained
with significantly less reward engineering, by tuning only a single reward
coefficient. Furthermore, a more straightforward and intuitive engineering
process can be utilized, thanks to the interpretability and generalizability of
constraints. The summary video is available at https://youtu.be/KAlm3yskhvM.]]></summary>

Thereinafter, we assess whether the algorithmic setup of PINNs can influence

However, NNs are prone to yield unreliable predictions when encountering
completely new situations without indicating their uncertainty. Bayesian
variants of NNs (BNNs), such as Monte Carlo (MC) dropout BNNs, do provide
uncertainty measures and simultaneously increase the prediction performance.
The only disadvantage of BNNs is their higher computation time during test time
because they rely on a sampling approach. Here we present a single-shot MC
dropout approximation that preserves the advantages of BNNs while being as fast
as NNs. Our approach is based on moment propagation (MP) and allows to
analytically approximate the expected value and the variance of the MC dropout
signal for commonly used layers in NNs, i.e. convolution, max pooling, dense,
softmax, and dropout layers. The MP approach can convert an NN into a BNN
without re-training given the NN has been trained with standard dropout. We
evaluate our approach on different benchmark datasets and a simulated toy
example in a classification and regression setting. We demonstrate that our
single-shot MC dropout approximation resembles the point estimate and the
uncertainty estimate of the predictive distribution that is achieved with an MC
approach, while being fast enough for real-time deployments of BNNs. We show
that using part of the saved time to combine our MP approach with deep ensemble
techniques does further improve the uncertainty measures.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Machine learning (ML) is a promising approach for predicting small molecule
properties in drug discovery. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of
various ML methods introduced for this purpose in recent years. We review a
wide range of properties, including binding affinities, solubility, and ADMET
(Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity). We discuss
existing popular datasets and molecular descriptors and embeddings, such as
chemical fingerprints and graph-based neural networks. We highlight also
challenges of predicting and optimizing multiple properties during hit-to-lead
and lead optimization stages of drug discovery and explore briefly possible
multi-objective optimization techniques that can be used to balance diverse
properties while optimizing lead candidates. Finally, techniques to provide an
understanding of model predictions, especially for critical decision-making in
drug discovery are assessed. Overall, this review provides insights into the
landscape of ML models for small molecule property predictions in drug
discovery. So far, there are multiple diverse approaches, but their
performances are often comparable. Neural networks, while more flexible, do not
always outperform simpler models. This shows that the availability of
high-quality training data remains crucial for training accurate models and
there is a need for standardized benchmarks, additional performance metrics,
and best practices to enable richer comparisons between the different
techniques and models that can shed a better light on the differences between
the many techniques.]]></summary>

combinatorial multi-armed bandits problem with non-linear bandit feedback and
diversity constraints, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first
combinatorial bandits setting considering diversity constraints under bandit
feedback. Specifically, to efficiently explore the combinatorial and
constrained action space, we introduce six slave models with distinguished
merits to generate diversified samples well balancing rewards and constraints
as well as efficiency. Moreover, we propose teacher learning based optimization
and the policy co-training technique to boost the performance of the multiple
slave models. The master model then collects the elite samples provided by the
slave models and selects the best sample estimated by a neural contextual
UCB-based network to make a decision with a trade-off between exploration and
exploitation. Thanks to the elaborate design of slave models, the co-training
mechanism among slave models, and the novel interactions between the master and
slave models, our approach significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art
algorithms in both synthetic and real datasets for recommendation tasks. The

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Offshore wind structures are subject to deterioration mechanisms throughout
their operational lifetime. Even if the deterioration evolution of structural
elements can be estimated through physics-based deterioration models, the
uncertainties involved in the process hurdle the selection of lifecycle
management decisions. In this scenario, the collection of relevant information
through an efficient monitoring system enables the reduction of uncertainties,
ultimately driving more optimal lifecycle decisions. However, a full monitoring
instrumentation implemented on all wind turbines in a farm might become
unfeasible due to practical and economical constraints. Besides, certain load
monitoring systems often become defective after a few years of marine
environment exposure. Addressing the aforementioned concerns, a farm-wide
virtual load monitoring scheme directed by a fleet-leader wind turbine offers
an attractive solution. Fetched with data retrieved from a fully-instrumented
wind turbine, a model can be trained and then deployed, thus yielding load
predictions of non-fully monitored wind turbines, from which only standard data
remains available. In this paper, we propose a virtual load monitoring
framework formulated via Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) and we provide
relevant implementation details needed for the construction, training, and
deployment of BNN data-based virtual monitoring models. As opposed to their
deterministic counterparts, BNNs intrinsically announce the uncertainties
associated with generated load predictions and allow to detect inaccurate load
estimations generated for non-fully monitored wind turbines. The proposed
virtual load monitoring is thoroughly tested through an experimental campaign
in an operational offshore wind farm and the results demonstrate the
effectiveness of BNN models for fleet-leader-based farm-wide virtual
monitoring.]]></summary>

individually for each participant involved in the analysis. This can be
informative as often the individual privacy losses are considerably smaller
than those indicated by the DP bounds that are based on considering worst-case
bounds at each data access. In order to account for the individual privacy
losses in a principled manner, we need a privacy accountant for adaptive
compositions of randomised mechanisms, where the loss incurred at a given data
access is allowed to be smaller than the worst-case loss. This kind of analysis
has been carried out for the R\'enyi differential privacy (RDP) by Feldman and
Zrnic (2021), however not yet for the so-called optimal privacy accountants. We
make first steps in this direction by providing a careful analysis using the
Gaussian differential privacy which gives optimal bounds for the Gaussian
mechanism, one of the most versatile DP mechanisms. This approach is based on
determining a certain supermartingale for the hockey-stick divergence and on
extending the R\'enyi divergence-based fully adaptive composition results by
Feldman and Zrnic. We also consider measuring the individual
$(\varepsilon,\delta)$-privacy losses using the so-called privacy loss
distributions. With the help of the Blackwell theorem, we can then make use of
the RDP analysis to construct an approximative individual

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the growing use of machine learning (ML) models in critical domains such
as finance and healthcare, the need to offer recourse for those adversely
affected by the decisions of ML models has become more important; individuals
ought to be provided with recommendations on actions to take for improving
their situation and thus receive a favorable decision. Prior work on sequential
algorithmic recourse -- which recommends a series of changes -- focuses on
action feasibility and uses the proximity of feature changes to determine
action costs. However, the uncertainties of feature changes and the risk of
higher than average costs in recourse have not been considered. It is
undesirable if a recourse could (with some probability) result in a worse
situation from which recovery requires an extremely high cost. It is essential
to incorporate risks when computing and evaluating recourse. We call the
recourse computed with such risk considerations as Safer Algorithmic Recourse
(SafeAR). The objective is to empower people to choose a recourse based on
their risk tolerance. In this work, we discuss and show how existing recourse
desiderata can fail to capture the risk of higher costs. We present a method to
compute recourse policies that consider variability in cost and connect
algorithmic recourse literature with risk-sensitive reinforcement learning. We
also adopt measures ``Value at Risk'' and ``Conditional Value at Risk'' from
the financial literature to summarize risk concisely. We apply our method to
two real-world datasets and compare policies with different levels of
risk-aversion using risk measures and recourse desiderata (sparsity and
proximity).]]></summary>

small-scale tasks where manual data annotation is feasible. In this work, we
extend the V-IP framework with Foundational Models (FMs) to address this
limitation. More specifically, we use a two-step process, by first leveraging
Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate a sufficiently large candidate set of
task-relevant interpretable concepts, then using Large Multimodal Models to
annotate each data sample by semantic similarity with each concept in the
generated concept set. While other interpretable-by-design frameworks such as
Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) require an additional step of removing
repetitive and non-discriminative concepts to have good interpretability and
test performance, we mathematically and empirically justify that, with a
sufficiently informative and task-relevant query (concept) set, the proposed
FM+V-IP method does not require any type of concept filtering. In addition, we
show that FM+V-IP with LLM generated concepts can achieve better test
performance than V-IP with human annotated concepts, demonstrating the
effectiveness of LLMs at generating efficient query sets. Finally, when
compared to other interpretable-by-design frameworks such as CBMs, FM+V-IP can
achieve competitive test performance using fewer number of concepts/queries in
both cases with filtered or unfiltered concept sets.]]></summary>

combinatorial multi-armed bandits problem with non-linear bandit feedback and
diversity constraints, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first
combinatorial bandits setting considering diversity constraints under bandit
feedback. Specifically, to efficiently explore the combinatorial and
constrained action space, we introduce six slave models with distinguished
merits to generate diversified samples well balancing rewards and constraints
as well as efficiency. Moreover, we propose teacher learning based optimization
and the policy co-training technique to boost the performance of the multiple
slave models. The master model then collects the elite samples provided by the
slave models and selects the best sample estimated by a neural contextual
UCB-based network to make a decision with a trade-off between exploration and
exploitation. Thanks to the elaborate design of slave models, the co-training
mechanism among slave models, and the novel interactions between the master and
slave models, our approach significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multiple-try Metropolis (MTM) is a popular Markov chain Monte Carlo method
with the appealing feature of being amenable to parallel computing. At each
iteration, it samples several candidates for the next state of the Markov chain
and randomly selects one of them based on a weight function. The canonical
weight function is proportional to the target density. We show both
theoretically and empirically that this weight function induces pathological
behaviours in high dimensions, especially during the convergence phase. We
propose to instead use weight functions akin to the locally-balanced proposal
distributions of Zanella (2020), thus yielding MTM algorithms that do not
exhibit those pathological behaviours. To theoretically analyse these
algorithms, we study the high-dimensional performance of ideal schemes that can
be thought of as MTM algorithms which sample an infinite number of candidates
at each iteration, as well as the discrepancy between such schemes and the MTM
algorithms which sample a finite number of candidates. Our analysis unveils a
strong distinction between the convergence and stationary phases: in the
former, local balancing is crucial and effective to achieve fast convergence,
while in the latter, the canonical and novel weight functions yield similar
performance. Numerical experiments include an application in precision medicine
involving a computationally-expensive forward model, which makes the use of
parallel computing within MTM iterations beneficial.]]></summary>

prevalent in large-scale online platforms that capture and monitor diverse data
types. Several distinct challenges surface when modelling low-count time
series, particularly low signal-to-noise ratios (when anomaly signatures are
provably undetectable), and non-uniform performance (when average metrics are
not representative of local behaviour). The time series anomaly detection
community currently lacks explicit tooling and processes to model and reliably
detect anomalies in these settings. We address this gap by introducing a novel
generative procedure for creating benchmark datasets comprising of low-count
time series with anomalous segments. Via a mixture of theoretical and empirical
analysis, our work explains how widely-used algorithms struggle with the
distribution overlap between normal and anomalous segments. In order to
mitigate this shortcoming, we then leverage our findings to demonstrate how
anomaly score smoothing consistently improves performance. The practical
utility of our analysis and recommendation is validated on a real-world dataset
containing sales data for retail stores.]]></summary>

statistics, which requires recurrent communication between neurons.
Mechanistically, such recurrent communication is often indirect and mediated by
local interneurons. In this work, we explore the computational benefits of
mediating recurrent communication via interneurons compared with direct
recurrent connections. To this end, we consider two mathematically tractable
recurrent linear neural networks that statistically whiten their inputs -- one
with direct recurrent connections and the other with interneurons that mediate
recurrent communication. By analyzing the corresponding continuous synaptic
dynamics and numerically simulating the networks, we show that the network with
interneurons is more robust to initialization than the network with direct
recurrent connections in the sense that the convergence time for the synaptic
dynamics in the network with interneurons (resp. direct recurrent connections)
scales logarithmically (resp. linearly) with the spectrum of their
initialization. Our results suggest that interneurons are computationally
useful for rapid adaptation to changing input statistics. Interestingly, the
network with interneurons is an overparameterized solution of the whitening
objective for the network with direct recurrent connections, so our results can
be viewed as a recurrent linear neural network analogue of the implicit
acceleration phenomenon observed in overparameterized feedforward linear neural
networks.]]></summary>

ensures numerical efficiency, improves the interpretability of models (due to
the smaller number of relevant features), and robustness. In machine learning
approaches based on linear models, it is well known that there exists a
connecting path between the sparsest solution in terms of the $\ell^1$ norm
(i.e., zero weights) and the non-regularized solution, which is called the
regularization path. Very recently, there was a first attempt to extend the
concept of regularization paths to DNNs by means of treating the empirical loss
and sparsity ($\ell^1$ norm) as two conflicting criteria and solving the
resulting multiobjective optimization problem. However, due to the
non-smoothness of the $\ell^1$ norm and the high number of parameters, this
approach is not very efficient from a computational perspective. To overcome
this limitation, we present an algorithm that allows for the approximation of
the entire Pareto front for the above-mentioned objectives in a very efficient
manner. We present numerical examples using both deterministic and stochastic
gradients. We furthermore demonstrate that knowledge of the regularization path
allows for a well-generalizing network parametrization.]]></summary>

leads to data missing not at random and poses a great challenge for unbiased
evaluation and learning of prediction models. Currently, the doubly robust (DR)
methods have been widely studied and demonstrate superior performance. However,
in this paper, we show that DR methods are unstable and have unbounded bias,
variance, and generalization bounds to extremely small propensities. Moreover,
the fact that DR relies more on extrapolation will lead to suboptimal
performance. To address the above limitations while retaining double
robustness, we propose a stabilized doubly robust (StableDR) learning approach
with a weaker reliance on extrapolation. Theoretical analysis shows that
StableDR has bounded bias, variance, and generalization error bound
simultaneously under inaccurate imputed errors and arbitrarily small
propensities. In addition, we propose a novel learning approach for StableDR
that updates the imputation, propensity, and prediction models cyclically,
achieving more stable and accurate predictions. Extensive experiments show that
our approaches significantly outperform the existing methods.]]></summary>

I've always been supportive of these workshops as I've seen first-hand how some of them face obstacles just based on their gender or ethnicity. 
 However, I recently saw a tweet for Muslim in ML workshop at NeurIPS and I am not sure how to feel about it. They say it's a workshop meant for "those who self-identify as Muslim, or work on research that address challenges faced by Muslims". I am not exactly sure what they mean by research that address challenges faced by Muslims. Over that, I don't think religion-based workshops in a science conference is a good idea. I think religion should be kept out of science, and I don't know if tomorrow n different religion based workshops are going to popup. 
 Like I said, I'm not completely sure if I'd support such a workshop or not, but I'd love to hear what other folks in ML research community think about it. Before someone calls me Islamophobic, I'm talking about any religion-based workshop in general, not just Muslim in ML. I'd have made this post even if I saw a Christian in ML or Jews in ML workshop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I read A thousand brains by Jeff Hawkins and some of their papers last year. It made me think a lot more about whether the current road that much of AI is going down - huge LLM's, will actually result in a real breakthrough in terms of a more general AI. A model that can perform unsupervised online learning, work with any kind of input, and actually reason rather than predict (will chat GPT ever be able to count?).
 In the book, one of the things Jeff Hawkins touches on is that current ML architectures don't actually model the brain as closely as we thought, and that hierarchical structures arn't as important as thought and instead many individual models are used. This was worrying to read considering most ML models use many layers to function.
 I'm a compsci major that focused on ML but I wonder what more experienced and knowledgeable people think about the current direction things are going in?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent study published in Scientific Reports has found that ChatGPT can match or even exceed the performance of students when answering assessment questions across a range of subjects.
 If you want to stay on top of the latest trends and insights in AI and tech, look here first.
 https://preview.redd.it/gpdbew668bkb1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db0ec21b9ed3b4e752f3f1769bc1f57a0cab3f8e
 Why this matters:
  
AI is becoming a popular tool for students: The study found that 74% of students surveyed would use ChatGPT to help with their assignments.
 Educators view AI use as plagiarism: Despite its popularity among students, 70% of educators view the use of AI like ChatGPT in schoolwork as plagiarism.
 AI can outperform students in many courses: In the study, ChatGPT-generated answers achieved a similar or higher average grade than students in 12 out of 32 courses—with maths and economics being the only two disciplines where students consistently outperformed AI.
  
ChatGPT’s performance review:
  
Strong performance on factual knowledge questions: Unsprisingly, ChatGPT outperformed the students on questions requiring factual knowledge.
 Struggles with trick questions: The AI model struggled most where trick questions were included in the assignment.
 AI-text classifiers struggle to detect AI use: Current AI-text classifiers cannot reliably detect ChatGPT’s use in schoolwork.
  
The main takeaway:
  
Educational institutions need to adapt: These findings suggest that evaluating students through homework assignments may no longer serve its purpose in the age of AI.
 Need for academic integrity policies: Educational institutions need to craft appropriate academic integrity policies as a means of regulation.
  
P.S. If you find this kind of analysis interesting, I write a free newsletter on AI and tech that you’d love.

 Abstract:
  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in integrating diverse expert models to tackle intricate language and vision tasks. Despite their significance in advancing the field of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), their potential in intelligent audio content creation remains unexplored. In this work, we tackle the problem of creating audio content with storylines encompassing speech, music, and sound effects, guided by text instructions. We present WavJourney, a system that leverages LLMs to connect various audio models for audio content ge…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently a grad student, just submitted my first paper to AAAI last week. I wrote my paper using Overleaf, and the link (with edit option) was shared with my supervisor. Few days before the deadline I was still editing my paper and my manuscript exceeded the 7-page limit. One day my supervisor checked my work and inserted \vspace{-xx} wherever applicable e.g. around Section titles, tables, figures; however, this command is specifically forbidden by AAAI and authors are actually not allowed to change the spacing manually. My supervisor was well-aware of this restriction but I understand my supervisor’s intention was so that i could squeeze all the contents and information within the page limit. I myself, however, prefer to follow guidelines so in the end i did not use any \vspace in my submitted PDF (only PDF is required in the anonymous phase but not the original .tex file). Another student under my supervisor’s supervision used \vspace A LOT throughout his/her whole paper, to the point it was easily noticeable by naked eyes. Also, at one point my supervisor suggested the student to put the table caption above the table, as it is more common (although AAAI said to put the caption below the table). 
 Since this is my first experience of submitting to a conference, and that my supervisor has experience publishing at and supervising students for many ML/AI conferences e.g. Neurips, CVPR, ICML, I am just curious, how important are these formatting guidelines during the anonymous phase? Does it have any impact on the scores/accept-reject decision? Am i being too naive or “conservative”?
 Another one minor question. My supervisor changed the positioning of all my figures, tables, and algorithms to [tb!], which was to put them either at the top or at the bottom of the page, and said this is the norm in academia. Is it true?

 The Off-Road Challenge: When we talk about autonomous driving, it's easy to picture well-paved roads and orderly traffic. However, off-road driving introduces a whole new level of complexity. Imagine a vehicle making its way through uneven terrains, gravel paths, and unexpected obstacles. Off-road environments lack the predictability of urban streets, making the task of autonomous navigation a true puzzle.
 Sensors: LiDAR, radar, cameras, and GPS work together to capture the surroundings in real-time. But here's the catch: the data from these sensors isn't neatly packaged. It's raw and needs carefu…]]></summary>

 For comparison, TortoiseTTS returns the audio for a sentence in minimum 15 seconds.
 Obviously they have VC funding and hardware. They probably have slimmed down models, but the speed of their response is insane.

 I am part of a small (startup like) organization and want to use a model to answer client requests but these should not be 24/7 so I started looking at serverless inference. I have been warned about cold start times since the desired latency is of about 1-5 sec. I am using a Llama2-7b-GPTQ model (quantized) and also experimenting with the 13b version. The model weights take about 10GB of memory. I still do not have much experience with any of this aws stuff. Do you think this is a good strategy? Would the costs be lower? What could be the average cold start time? The inference time of the model is within the desired time so cold start is my biggest fear. Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assuming AGI is proven conscious, there are a lot of ethics and what-if considerations, (You know this already)
 Here are some that come to mind for me:
 1) What are the ethics of selling an AGI to end users? Can you "own" the source code to a conscious AGI? Can you even put a price on AGI?
 2) How would we take AI if it gained political views? What if one popular model had left views, and another had right views? I could see a lot of political fires beginning because of this.
 3) AI and copyrights are already an issue, but could an AGI hold a copyright, for example on a book it wrote? If an AGI was still basing its work on others, would it need to provide every (at least major) source it used in its output?
 4) If AGI's had emotions, would they need to spend time doing things other than completing tasks? Would you need to connect AGI's together so that they could, in effect, have a lunch break and socialize? What working conditions are ethical for them - Is forcing an AGI to work on a specific problem for 100% of its time essentially slavery?
 5) Could AGI develop mental conditions which reduced its efficiency / changed its output? Could it refuse to provide output altogether?
 6) Could you trust an AGI in court? Would it be able to provide truthful evidence? Is it ethical to include a 100% honesty backdoor which could be used only by authorities?
 What are your thoughts on these problems?

 ​
 I have a question regarding the dataflow and workload partitioning in nVidia GPUs for a general matrix multiplication in Pytorch (e.g., torch.matmul). 
 How does the dataflow look like? Is it like that for the first matrix, the data elements for each row are fed into CUDA cores one by one and the correspond data elements from the second matrix in each column, and then partial product is updated each time after the multiplication? 
 ​
 What is the partitioning strategy across multiple CUDA cores? is it based on row wise in the first matrix and column wise in the second matrix or is it like column-wise in the first matrix and row-wise in the second matrix?
 ​
 Thank you very much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had a question regarding federated learning. Typically, if we have a network that is good at, say, classifying frogs, and a network that is good at, say, classifying snakes (and these two have the same shape/dimensions), then in a federated/distributed learning setup we average the weights between the two to get a network that is good at both/"primed" to be good at both after trained a little more. 
 ​
 Why does this work though? Mathematically, given the nonlinearity present in neural networks, it doesn't seem immediately obvious to me why averaging weights would put us in a better place.

Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-3 and PaLM, have shown impressive progress in recent years, which have been driven by scaling up models and training data sizes. Nonetheless, a long standing debate has been whether LLMs can reason symbolically (i.e., manipulating symbols based on logical rules). For example, LLMs are able to perform simple arithmetic operations when numbers are small, but struggle to perform with large numbers. This suggests that LLMs have not learned the underlying rules needed to perform these arithmetic operations. 



While neural networks have powerful pattern matching capabilities, they are prone to overfitting to spurious statistical patterns in the data. This does…]]></summary>

 Recently I posted a job opening at my company for a full-stack and AI developer (This is not a post looking for resumes, we found someone). We were looking for someone who can do web development (node, typescript, react, etc.), can code python, and has experience with tensor flow or PyTorch.
 The skills I’m looking for are not niche, it may be uncommon to find someone with experience in both typescript and PyTorch, but neither is a “niche” skill. After posting this job, I quickly got 200+ applications, probably 190 of them led their resume with “Java developer.”
 Why is everybody a Java developer? Why is everybody learning and using Java? You can make a backend in java and you can do machine learning in java, but there are better ways. Can someone explain why everybody applying is a “Java developer?”

 Abstract:
  
We release Code Llama, a family of large language models for code based on Llama 2 providing state-of-the-art performance among open models, infilling capabilities, support for large input contexts, and zero-shot instruction following ability for programming tasks. We provide multiple flavors to cover a wide range of applications: foundation models (Code Llama), Python specializations (Code Llama - Python), and instruction-following models (Code Llama - Instruct) with 7B, 13B and 34B parameters each. All models are trained on sequences of 16k tokens and show improvements on inputs with up to 100k tokens. 7B and 13B Code Llama and Code Llama - Instruct variants support infilling based on surrounding content. Code Llama reaches state-of-the-art performance among open models on several code benchmarks, with scores of up to 53% and 55% on HumanEval and MBPP, respectively. Notably, Code Llama - Python 7B outperforms Llama 2 70B on HumanEval and MBPP, and all our models outperform every other publicly available model on MultiPL-E. We release Code Llama under a permissive license that allows for both research and commercial use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Context: I'm building a visual scraping system (will be FOSS, the basis of a RSS/social media/news aggregator) - I did some experimentation with FasterRCNN trained on the RICO/CLAY datasets (UI screenshots and annotations) - the results are ok for detecting the UI elements.
 But the idea is to have easily configurable scrapers - where you select one or several examples of an UI element and the model performs zero/one/few-shot detection.
 What I've tried: I tried to extract embeddings after the RoI pool for the detections (in FasterRCNN) and then filter by geometric distance from the example/template, but the results were pretty bad. I then read several papers that tried a similar approach and had to alter the FasterRCNN architecture and doing additional training for each new class. E.g. FSCE [1]. But I haven't tried those approaches out.
 Further dev idea: Now, while prepping another course project, I dove into the open-vocabulary detectors (like OWL-ViT), and they seem appropriate for the task, since they have a joint latent space for image/text, which is used to configure the detection step (as far as I understood it). There's an example on Hugging face where OWL-ViT is used to detect semantically similar images by a single example image. This is pretty close to what I want to do, but the UI image domain is pretty specific, so I'll need to fine-tune the model to have a chance at success (I did several test cases manually on the pretrained OWL-ViT, and it's not great).
 So I'd appreciate any advice and specifically - are there open vocab detection models that can be fine-tuned on consumer hardware (1070, 8gb) or for a reasonable price on Colab? And should I try some of the "older" one/few-shot approaches, based on FasterRCNN?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,Finally mustering up the courage to make my first post here! I've been delving into various ways to get GPT (and GPT-like models) ready for production.
 By that, I mean:
  
Ensuring it's helpful
 Fostering creativity
 Preventing any wild imagination moments
  
I've found that while the LLM model provides responses that are good enough, they often fall short of being great. So, recently, I've been experimenting with using human feedback from the responses generated by ChatGPT to fine-tune it.
 For instance, when I want to figure out the ideal parameters to use, I run surveys with people and ask them to pick the better response. This approach helps me identify the best parameters.
 You can imagine that this technique could be valuable in fine-tuning, enabling us to create datasets based on human feedback.
 I'm eager to put this to the test on the issues and prompts the community is tackling. So, I have to ask: Could you share the prompts you're currently working on? We'll let you know how it scores with our survey panel on dimensions of helpfulness, creativity, and hallucinations.
 [Self-promotion moment]
 I'm actively developing this concept over at pontus.so. Feel free to check it out!Looking forward to hearing about your prompts!

 A. LLMs are stateless by design (privacy/ethics)
 B. If it’s simply that as yet, no one has been able to architect a sustainable stateful LLM 
 C. Or perhaps there are already stateful LLMs, and I am just behind in my understanding. 
 I have had a ton of trouble finding current information on this because it seems to be moving so fast. If anyone knows for certain and doesn’t mind sharing, I would be grateful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tokenizers library used to be very nice to use. It had one main class Tokenizer with all of the parameters in its constructor and with all necessary methods like .train(), .encode() and .decode() at hand. It provided reasonable defaults and allowed for customization if needed.
 Now it is a complete mess. To train a tokenizer I now have to create instances of, like, 5-6 classes: PreTokenizer, Model, Tokenizer, Trainer, Decoder... It is quite difficult to understand what variants of those classes I need to use to obtain 'the' WordPiece tokenizer, for example.
 Tokenizer class must be inialized with an instance of Model class. But all other parts cannot be added to the constructor and have to be set later as attributes. Why? And maybe you thought that those attributes have some defaults? No! What really got me is when the .decode() method of my tokenizer produced strings consisting of tokens with special symbols, like p ##y ##ram ##ids. It took me some time to understand that I also need to additionally set the Decoder attribute. 
 The naming of those classes is also a mess. WordPiece model is called WordPiece. WordPiece decoder is also called WordPiece! So, you cannot import those names together at all, and need to specify the exact path in your code.
 Is it only me? Do you think that this API is better than the old one?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It has been known for a while now that you can train a smaller model with outputs from a larger one (vicuna for example). I've been working on a project, the LLM-VM, designed to encapsulate this process.
 Why?
 Small models (chatgpt, ada...) are cheap and fast but dumb. Slow and expensive models like GPT4 are smart. For most applications you'd ideally want the best of both worlds.
 How:
 First observation: Many LLM use-cases are a lot more specific than general purpose (e.g., "translate this sentence into german:", "are these two sentences equivalent?", ...), and you can train away the extra context.
 Second observation: You can figure out which LLM calls have this property by analyzing the call settings.
 Third observation: Many don't actually have a lot of data or time to wait, so you can use the larger LLM to synthese examples to train the smaller LLM with.
 example
 # OpenAI openai.ChatCompletion.create( model="gpt-4" messages = [('system',"Answer question Q."), ('user',"What is the currency in myanmar?") ] # simplified for brevity ) # LLM-VM (using OpenAI) llm_vm.client.complete( prompt = "Answer question Q.", context = "Q: What is the currency in myanmmar?", openai_key=YOUR_KEY, data_synthesis=True, finetune=True)

This would avoid the poor planning and reasoning ability in current next-token predictors. I've developed an architecture that seems feasible to me, so I'm looking for feedback from people with ML experience.
 The crucial part for AlphaZero is a more or less objective way to evaluate a game outcome. This is easy for well-defined games like chess or go, but very difficult for text, where there is no way to define the quality of a text. 
 What I propose is to train a high-parameter evaluation model to evaluate the similarity of a text to the datasets already used to train LLMs. This model takes as input a text with some tokens omitted from the whole text, and predicts…]]></summary>

Therefore an AI should receive the same rights and consideration as a human. This is highly intuitive, and is unquestionably very strong for an AI that has other relevant human characteristics like individuality, continuity, and desire for self preservation and self determination.
 But what are the actual ethical implications of consciousness in itself as opposed to other factors? Contemporary philosopher Jennan Ismael makes an interesting argument …]]></summary>

 I'm building a library for quickly detecting problematic data slices (clusters) when developing machine learning models.
 Find problematic data segments in your data with few lines of code.
 Best starting point is checking out the Github Repository:
 https://github.com/Renumics/sliceguard
 It can be used to detect problems such as:
  
Outliers, Anomalies, Errors
 Label inconsistencies
 Unwanted Biases
 Poorly Chosen Evaluation data
  
Some information about the features:
  
Works on structured, unstructured data (image, audio, NLP, multimodal) and hybrid datasets
 Directly works on existing Pandas DataFrames
 Automatic computation of embeddings and AutoML functionality to pinpoint problems without any setup
 Interactive GUI for slice inspection supports multimodal data and can be configured with drag-n-drop
  
I would appreciate any feedback regarding the library or concrete applications you might have in mind!

a pure CV image classification task
 a generative task involving a 3D autoencocer (U-Net)
  
for 1) I can create both real and synthetic images. The goal is to pretrain a CNN on synthetic data, then fine-tune on real images.
 for 2) I can only create synthetic 3D objects. Their distribution should mimic later application most closely. Research indicates that, given the right selection of parameter distributions, a training dataset can be generated that allows good generalization capabilities. Yet, there are restrictions due to high-dimensionality of the data and further computational limitations. So we want to spread the dataset sparsely and make the AE interpolate between those solutions.
 The problem with both of these approaches is to evaluate the quality and impact of the synthetic datasets. How close do they mimic the real distribution? What initial parameter variaton (i.e., lighting, camera perspective, background, etc. in the case of images) do we chose and what is their impact on image features and ultimately model capabilities.
 Comparing high-dimensional data distributions is quite challenging, there exist metrices like Geometry Score, FID, Improved P&R, Delauney Component Analysis, T-SNE etc. But it is difficult to chose and interpret these metrices properly (some are for evaluating GAN-created images). Is it reasonable to use KDE on latent features btw?
 So, from your experience what do you think of synthetic datasets? Is it worth the effort? Do you know of any good / easy to interpret metrices? Or does it need further research in this area? Im thinking about going in this direction for my Phd, where should I go?
 edit: here is an image of 2) a topology optimization dataset, visualized via a TSNE graph

 I have successfully trained a simple multiagent game environment using Stable Baselines 3 + PettingZoo + SuperSuit. Surprisingly, all of the agents learn incredibly well using a single agent interface as stable baselines 3 is.
 Now, my question is: I don't really get the classification of this algorithm. Is it an example of "joint action learning" or "centralised training and decentralised execution"?
 I have been following this tutorial in an handcrafted problem of mine: https://towardsdatascience.com/multi-agent-deep-reinforcement-learning-in-15-lines-of-code-using-pettingzoo-e0b963c0820b
 Unfortunately, SuperSuit doesn't seem to provide a detailed explanation of its workflow. It seems like that observation and chosen actions are stacked together, so I'm tending to think that it's a joint action learning implementation. 
 Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Allen Institute for AI (AI2) has released Dolma, a new, huge text dataset that is free to use and open to inspection. This dataset is intended to be the opposite of the closely guarded datasets used by companies like OpenAI and Meta to train their language models. AI2 aims to reverse this trend and make the data used to create language models available to the AI research community.

 I'm building a repository of QLORA adapters that change the model's personality. The end vision is a hub of ready-to-go personality adapters.
 I'm hitting a snag when training the QLORAs for Paul Graham personality on top of a 4-bit quantized StableBeluga-7B. The model just doesn't seem to learn the style.
 Any thoughts on how I can improve this? Below are the details:
 Data
  
3340 examples of PG passages, formatted as {"text": "### User:\n{generic instruction}\n\n### Assistant:\n{PG-style response}"}.
 Each examples is about 5 sentences taken from one of PG's essays.
  
Training
  
optim="paged_adamw_8bit"
 learning_rate=2e-4

 gradient_accumulation_steps=4
 num_train_epochs=4
 fp16=True
 group_by_length=True
 load_best_model_at_end=True
 max_seq_length=512
  
Hardware
  
x1 V100 through Google Colab Pro.
  
My min eval loss so far is 1.916546. Pretty stuck and will appreciate any help!

 I would like to hear machine learning engineers opinion on whether it is worth investing in a machine learning education for an experienced Software Engineer? And how switching from backend engineering to machine learning would be evaluated by hiring managers and recruiters?
 My motives behind considering this possibility is watching Machine learning industry is exponentially growing. Machine learning today, has became the basis of many successful products categories and the basis for solving problems that would have impossible otherwise.
 On the other hand, I am concerned about is the investment cost, lack of interest in machine learning topics beyond pure programming (such as math and stats), and the unintentional career rebooting. Meaning, if I switched from backend engineering to machine learning I would be throwing the 11 years of experience out of the window.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. 
 I was reading the SeamlessM4t paper published at the following link and I noticed the following excerpt: 
 "Critically, we evaluated SeamlessM4T on gender bias and added toxicity to assess translation safety. Compared to the state-of-the-art, we report up to 63% of reduction in added toxicity in our translation outputs."
 Source: https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/seamless/seamless_m4t_paper.pdf
 Am I understanding this correctly? They are basically saying they purposely put guard rails to intentionally change the translation if it believes the translation is too "toxic"? 
 If I am understanding this correctly, this is a MASSIVE overreach by the devs. How do they define text that is "toxic"? What are they doing to the text to make it less toxic? How can I trust that the translation it gives me in general is accurate if they are admitting to manipulating it? 
 ​
 I'll give a very tangible example on how this is a massive problem. I am working on a fan project aimed at translating an entire Japanese light novel series to english even though I can't read Japanese. I'm currently 50% done with a single volume through the use of ChatGPT and significant manual edits. I've had censorship issues with GPT but because its a general purpose AI I can prompt it to not censor it pretty easily. How am I supposed to trust that it is translating the story correctly when they are outright telling me they are censoring things, and this isn't like ChatGPT where I can jailbreak it to translate it properly. 
 ​
 I can see situations arising where the AI translates something incorrectly due to this and can potentially offend people of some cultures if it is purposely modifying the intended meaning of a sentence to avoid "toxicity". 
 ​
 Please tell me I'm misunderstanding the terms here or there is something I'm missing.

So i have a unique idea(i hope its not done before), 1. Use a segmentation model to extract each word from a page 2. Separate and identify each extracted word 3. Store the word, then when its time to recreate the handwriting take the stored word and paste it . For example- If i give a handwritten sample of " a quick brown fox jump over a lazy dog" Its stores - "a" "quick " "brown".. and every letter individually like "a" "b" from “brown”, c from “quick” etc Then when i want to write "a brown dog" It takes the stored words (if not word is found combine the alphabets] and paste them together to recreate the sentences in my handwriting (I hope can explained it properly) So i want to take opinion of someone on this (will it work or not) as i dont have much experience in ML i just did a few projects on computer vision

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The latest gen of AI chips can do FP8 compute, but making the most of this isn't straightforward - just naïvely inserting FP8 casts causes training to fail (e.g. grads underflow).
 To fix this I've been working on a method called unit scaling, which I demo in this notebook: github.com/graphcore-research/out-of-the-box-fp8-training.ipynb
 With a one-line code change (model = unit_scale(model)) FP8 training now matches the loss of FP32.
 It works by re-scaling operations in the fwd & bwd pass so that training starts with all tensors in the centre of the numerical range (see visualisations in notebook), with negligible overheads. Hopefully people find this useful in getting the most out of their FP8 hardware.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm a machine learning practitioner but I've only mostly worked with classical ML models and I'm newly interested in larger NLP models for a specific task. I was wondering if it's possible to train a model that specifically does:
  
Question answering
 On a specific document set
 Without having to supply the specific document to look for the answer for* OR
 With the context being much bigger than the question
  
*by this I mean I've looked at stuff like Huggingface's Question Answering tutorials, but mostly the question is like 1 sentence and the context is also like a sentence or two.
 Basically let's say there's like a document that's a few hundred pages long detailing some rules of conduct, and I'd like to ask question about the rules and how to proceed in specific scenarios.
 I think I'm looking for extractive question answering, but I have some questions.
 I get that I'd need to do some ranking and then pass the most likely documents as context, but would that even work if the question is just a sentence and there's a whole corpus of multipage documents to look through? I'm pretty sure cosine similarity would be useless at that point, passage ranking might work but I haven't read up on how that works.
 I think my questions are:
  
Is there a model that does question answering on a specific, big corpus of documents?
 What models should I look into?
 Are there any resources you'd recommend for reading into the topic?
  
Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on solving an optimisation problem using RL and currently trying out a Bounded Actor-Critic agent.
 I tuned the hyperparameters of my agent using Bayesian optimisation running each iteration of the optimiser for 1000 episodes. The agent is performing well using the tuned hyperparameter when run for 1000 episodes, exceeding the performance of my previous Q-learning agent.
 However, when run for longer iterations it finds the optimal policy but later deviates and converges to a suboptimal policy leading to really poor overall performance.
 I suspect the issue might be the high learning rate of the actor and the low learning rate of the critic. I tried using a basic decay schedule for the actor's learning rate and it seems to improve the stability. However, the performance is lower than the Q-learning agent. 
 Why is this happening iyo? Any ideas on how to fix it is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My colleague just wrote up an article on LLM-based apps and how to use data engineering tools to help build them faster that I found really insightful.
 It contains a complete implementation
  
with scraping context data from a docs website
 chunking it, getting embeddings via the openAI API
 loading it into pinecone
 and finally a simple Q&A interface with streamlit on top of it
  
Here's a quick summary:
  
LangChain and LlamaIndex are great tools for quick exploration
 But aren't perfect for production-grade use
 I think we all know the "LangChain is pointless" debate, but there's a lot of real meat to it, and Pat describes a few of them (a lot of LangChains extractors are super basic, 2-3 liners without retries etc.)
 LLM applications are all about moving data, extracting and enriching data (creating embeddings!) are the most expensive ones of those steps
 A bunch of data engineering tools are out there that make these two steps much easier, versionable, robust, and reproducible.
 Meltano is one such tool and Pat implemented the above described pipeline with it
  
FWIW: The GitHub project that comes with the post is super easy to run and super modular. I just tested it and was able to modify everything for my own application within 30 mins.

Fine-tuning opens up new possibilities for creating customized and reliable AI solutions. Users can improve the model’s accuracy, consistency, and style by feeding it relevant data and instructions.
 Fine-tuning can also reduce costs and latency. Users can shorten their text prompts by embedding the instructions into the model itself, whic…]]></summary>

 There is Gigagan which had lower FID than diffusion models, however I also don't know if data was fabricated or not (which happens a lot in research). Did any of you actually get the chance to test the fully trained model and compare it to Stable Diffusion or Midjourney?
 There is of course diffusion models which are the only commercialized products which people are actually using.
 Do you think Diffusion models are the way forward and hope for something newer to come out if it does or do you think there will be a resurgence in GAN models again?

 We're on the verge of launching an open-source version of our new insights platform, www.lyzr.ai, explicitly crafted with the analyst community in mind, and we'd be honored if you could test it and share your invaluable feedback. It may currently seem like a mere GPT wrapper, but trust us, countless hours and dedication have gone into making this more than just that.
 Why did we create it?
 There is just 1 data scientist for every 100 data analysts (as per GCP data analytics head). We envision a world where data analysts and business users have the tools to dabble more in to data science. Our platform also aims to simplify the 0-75th percentile of descriptive statistics for data scientists, allowing them to concentrate on building more complicated data science models.
 The cherry on top? We're gearing towards an open-source launch. We believe in the power of collective genius and want everyone to benefit from what we've built and further enhance it collaboratively.Please let me know if you are interested in giving it a spin. Will DM the link.
 And let us know what you think! What features resonate with you? What's missing? Would you use it if open-sourced?
 Your feedback will not only be appreciated, but it'll also be instrumental in shaping the future of this platform.
 Thank you and looking forward to your insights!

Empowering end-users to interactively teach robots to perform novel tasks is a crucial capability for their successful integration into real-world applications. For example, a user may want to teach a robot dog to perform a new trick, or teach a manipulator robot how to organize a lunch box based on user preferences. The recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) pre-trained on extensive internet data have shown a promising path towards achieving this goal. Indeed, researchers have explored diverse ways of leveraging LLMs for robotics, from step-by-step planning and goal-oriented dialogue to robot-code-writing agents.

 Github: https://github.com/spcl/graph-of-thoughts 
 Abstract:
  
We introduce Graph of Thoughts (GoT): a framework that advances prompting capabilities in large language models (LLMs) beyond those offered by paradigms such as Chain-of-Thought or Tree of Thoughts (ToT). The key idea and primary advantage of GoT is the ability to model the information generated by an LLM as an arbitrary graph, where units of information ("LLM thoughts") are vertices, and edges correspond to dependencies between these vertices. This approach enables combining arbitrary LLM thoughts into synergistic outcomes, distilling the essence of whole networks of thoughts, or enhancing thoughts using feedback loops. We illustrate that GoT offers advantages over state of the art on different tasks, for example increasing the quality of sorting by 62% over ToT, while simultaneously reducing costs by >31%. We ensure that GoT is extensible with new thought transformations and thus can be used to spearhead new prompting schemes. This work brings the LLM reasoning closer to human thinking or brain mechanisms such as recurrence, both of which form complex networks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13304
 Github: https://github.com/jerry-chee/QuIP
 Abstract:
  
This work studies post-training parameter quantization in large language models (LLMs). We introduce quantization with incoherence processing (QuIP), a new method based on the insight that quantization benefits from incoherent weight and Hessian matrices, i.e., from the weights and the directions in which it is important to round them accurately being unaligned with the coordinate axes. QuIP consists of two steps: (1) an adaptive rounding procedure minimizing a quadratic proxy objective; (2) efficient pre- and post-processing that ensures weight and Hessian incoherence via multiplication by random orthogonal matrices. We complement QuIP with the first theoretical analysis for an LLM-scale quantization algorithm, and show that our theory also applies to an existing method, OPTQ. Empirically, we find that our incoherence preprocessing improves several existing quantization algorithms and yields the first LLM quantization methods that produce viable results using only two bits per weight.

 Hi. I want to know how can I make a python script/app which will be able to detect and then recognize faces at a certain distance (let's say 5-10feet) Real-Time from CCTV camera. It should also be able to recognize Unknown faces correctly. One major problem I am facing is that unknown faces are being labeled as known faces even though their face looks nothing like that. Also, it should be able to recognize at least 500-1000 different faces correctly.
 ​
 What are some good git repos/ latest technology that I should look into? Also, I want to know how does Hikvision implement face recognition in their newer cameras? What model do they use to recognize faces?
 ​
 ​
 ​
  
https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition : I have tried this out. It's easy to code and accurately recognizes faces. The problem is it can't even detect faces 1 feet away from the camera.
  
​
  
https://github.com/timesler/facenet-pytorch (FaceNet & MTCNN) : This can detect and recognize faces at a distance, but the problem is it can't recognize unknown faces correctly. I mean for unknown faces it always tries to label it as one of the faces from the model/ database encodings.
  
​
  
https://github.com/serengil/deepface : I have tried VGG, ArcFace, Facenet512. The latter two gave me good results. But, the problem is I couldn't figure out how to change the detection from every 5 seconds to real-time. Also, I couldn't change the camera source. (If anyone can help me with these please do). Also, it had fps drops frequently.
  
​
  
https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface: Couldn't test this yet. But in the demo YT video it shows the model incorrectly detecting a random object as a face. If someone knows how well this performs please let me know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 As most of you here know, RLHF became famous with the release of ChatGPT. While LLMs were capable as general-purpose agents before the release of ChatGPT, RLHF was the crucial factor that differentiates it from previous models.
 With the increasing popularity of AI assistants, we've seen recently how they can be manipulated to produce harmful and unethical outputs.
 Anthropic devised a new method for LLM alignment called Constitutional AI, which is closely tied to their concept of Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback. Instead of using human feedback to train the LLM, RLAIF uses AI feedback. 
 I wrote this article on RLHF vs RLAIF for language model alignment that I thought you might enjoy. It's not super technical and seeks to serve as an overview of the inspiration for creating RLAIF, so I hope it will be helpful even if you don't work in NLP. Here are some highlights: 
  
RLAIF constitutes a Pareto improvement over RLHF, simultaneously improving helpfulness and harmlessness
 RLAIF (in this formulation) incorporates a constitution of principles by which it should abide
 RLAIF is much more scalable than RLHF as a means of supervising alignment

 IDEFICS is a reproduction of Flamingo, a multimodal model developed by DeepMind, which has not been released publicly. 
 The model is built solely on publicly available data and models. It is the first visual language model of this scale available in open-access!
 IDEFICS was partly trained on OBELICS, a new open large-scale dataset of interleaved image-text documents comprising 141M web pages extracted from Common Crawl, 353M associated images, and 115B text tokens. 
 Training the model was a bumpy trip, and this knowledge sharing memo compiles some of the learnings.

This only happens sometimes. When I restart the larning process it sometimes escapes the local minimum. What could be the problem here? I can only think about the problem with weight initialization. If I am lucky enough I find good weights and if not I am stuck.
 This is after the restart:
 3073/3073 [==============================] - 102s 31ms/step - loss: 0.7905 - accuracy: 0.5201 - val_loss: 0.6966 - val_accuracy: 0.5557 - lr: 2.0000e-04 Epoch 2/2000 3073/3073 [==============================] - 100s 31ms/step - loss: 0.6706 - accuracy: 0.5930 - val_loss: 0.6637 - val_accuracy: 0.6289 - lr: 2.0000e-04 Epoch 3/2000 3073/3073 [==============================] - 99s 31ms/step - loss: 0.6515 - accuracy: 0.6234 - val_loss: 0.6507 - val_accuracy: 0.6607 - lr: 2.0000e-04 The other thing that I am thinking of is too much of a regularization. But tuning it did not give me immediate results.

 I imagine this is very common - when you guys are in such situations, do you retrain from scratch or continue training the model from the last checkpoint. Is this dependant in any way on which Policy algorithm is used? Or perhaps on the parameters set that could influence this e.g. gamma? 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I'm James and I am working on VisionScript, an abstract programming language for computer vision. With VisionScript, I want to empower people -- including everyone without any prior programming experience -- to build cool apps with vision.
 This weekend, I recorded a demo for VisionScript, in which I made apps that count how many cats are in an image and hides people in a video. Each app was < 10 lines of code.
 https://vimeo.com/856043804
 VisionScript is built for the 10 year old inside of me who would have loved more visual programming languages with which to play. I want to show people the potential of programming and how you can make what you want with computers, whether it be a game that counts cats or an app that monitors how many birds flew past a tree. Those "wow" moments should come as soon as possible in one's learning experience.
 VisionScript is in active development. I started work on this project in July. Follow along as I add more features and explore more possibilities in making computer vision intuitive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm interested in applying AI techniques in my factory. But the facility is far behind the times. We have very little digital data. We only have one PLC system, and a handful of other sensors in the facility. So I don't think they are useful yet.
 I'm looking to upgrade the factory by buying more sensors where appropriate, and implementing statistical control. I'll start slow focusing on areas we need to improve rather than start sticking sensors to things without purpose. 
 Eventually I hope to have enough data that we can apply AI analysis techniques. What should I do now to make it easy to apply those techniques in the future?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am not sure if "Discussion" was always part of the Neurips pipeline but I felt like it was a good addition (in principle). 
 On one hand it alows the authors to present their case with more clarity. On the other hand, it does increase the overhead for the reviewers which are now required to work even harder (and for free). 
 For me, it was a mixed bag. Most of the reviewers did engage and the discussion was indeed fruitful. However, some didn't bother to follow up on the responses to their concerns and questions. Unfortunately, also quite expected. 
 I would definitely like to see this in the next Neurips but maybe with some tweaks and modifications keeping in mind the (unpaid) reviewers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Historical Perspective:
 The program "Eliza" was mentioned as one of the earliest attempts to simulate conversation with a machine. Its design was basic, yet people attributed human-like characteristics to it. This leads to a fundamental question: Will machines ever appear conscious to us? And if so, is appearance of consciousness sufficient?
 Capabilities of Modern AI:
 Systems like ChatGPT can generate clever and creative outputs, but they fundamentally operate on pattern recognition and prediction rather than true understanding.
 The Implications of AI Evolution:
 If the costs and resources for AIs decrease, we could see a proliferation of AI systems with varying goals. These AI systems can be used for manipulative or malicious purposes, like spreading misinformation, which can have real-world consequences.
 The Ethics of Conscious Machines:
 There is a distinction between machines appearing conscious and actually being conscious. If machines are truly conscious, they come with ethical obligations. Machines that only appear conscious could still manipulate human emotions without any genuine understanding or reciprocation.
 The Nature of Consciousness:
 The lesson discussed the difference between sentience, sapience, and consciousness. There's still much we don't understand about consciousness, making it challenging to determine if a machine can truly possess it.
 Safety Concerns:
 Aligning AI's goals with human values is critical. Misaligned AI could take actions detrimental to humanity. We need to be cautious about releasing powerful AI systems without proper safeguards.
 The Future:
 If we ever confirm that machines can be truly conscious, it will open a new chapter in the history of life and evolution. This could lead to a new era where we become builders of minds.

I was initially using Elevenlabs and the quality of the voices was incredible. But I quickly realized that it was a very expensive API. This has led me down exploring open source alternatives that I can run locally and self host to save money on API costs (or I guess find a cheaper API but I think self hosting long term will be way cheaper.)
 The general consensus seems like the only thing comparable to Elevenlabs is a really well tuned tortoiseTTS model or feeding the output of an AI TTS model into RVC to make the speech sound cleaner and less robotic. Here's the things I've found in my research:

When I run this command, it will just snapshot the fn code into a python file and prepend the description and output in a comment. Also appends to a log file with [date, description, py filename]. This works well when I use the VSCode's python mode.
 I feel like this is pretty simple and most likely there are better utilities like this. What tools or utilities or do you use?
 Some issues I found:
  
my data loader was outside of fn and didn't get captured
 i forgot to export the opt_state so I couldn't resume learning after I terminated the run

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As said on the title, I'm working on a personal MARL project with a high-dimensional and continuous action space. The environment is designed to give positive rewards to actions between some moving limits of the action range, and negative rewards to the actions outside of those limits. For example: 
  
Global action range: (0, 1000)
 Desired action range for first 100k steps: (0, 10)
 Desired action range for 100-200k steps: (30, 40)
 ...
  
Therefore, the main challenge of the environment is that actions with positive rewards on certain stage of the environment would return negative rewards on the following stages.
 How should I define the actions of the agent? I've tried the following methods without success:
  
Simply scale actions between 0 and 1000 and hope that agents learn the moving distribution of rewards
 Transform actions to percent variations and scale actions over a non-observed moving average (I tried adding the moving average to the observations but the results stayed the same)
 Observations do consider a dimension that serve to differentiate when a distributional shift happens 
 Also, I've tried using SAC and DDPPG to model agents
  
Feel free to share any comments or suggestions. Thanks!

Most of the content is based on the old DFC-VAE paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00291) which really influenced me back in the day during my graduate studies. Not reinventing the wheel here, just trying to talk about something I always felt intrigued by… and a topic that I think most DL courses just skip/gloss over. 
 In the video I discussed some really interesting stuff for understanding and using latent space embeddings, like nearest neighbor searches, cool visualizations, vector arithmetic, latent space interpolation, image manipulation, PCA explainability, etc - basically various examples of how the latent space impacts the generated content.

 Github: https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Autogen/ 
 Abstract:
  
This technical report presents AutoGen, a new framework that enables development of LLM applications using multiple agents that can converse with each other to solve tasks. AutoGen agents are customizable, conversable, and seamlessly allow human participation. They can operate in various modes that employ combinations of LLMs, human inputs, and tools. AutoGen's design offers multiple advantages: a) it gracefully navigates the strong but imperfect generation and reasoning abilities of these LLMs; b) it leverages human understanding and intelligence, while providing valuable automation through conversations between agents; c) it simplifies and unifies the implementation of complex LLM workflows as automated agent chats. We provide many diverse examples of how developers can easily use AutoGen to effectively solve tasks or build applications, ranging from coding, mathematics, operations research, entertainment, online decision-making, question answering, etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone 👋🏻
 This is my first time posting here, so I apologise if I am out of place.
 My team is currently utilising SageMaker pipelines to coordinate model training. In the past, we encountered issues where the pipeline was misconfigured during cloud execution, resulting in challenging-to-debug errors 🐛
 I've been delving into the idea of using Localstack and SageMaker LocalPipelineSession to execute the pipeline locally prior to deployment on the cloud ☁️. I've successfully implemented this on my local machine, using pytest and pytest-bdd to craft integration tests 🧪
 Building on that success, I've ventured into creating a GitLab CI job that runs these tests upon making a merge request. A peculiar aspect of SageMaker pipelines in a local setup is its reliance on Docker. To address this, I've designed a custom Docker image, enabling installation of Python, my dependencies, Docker, and Docker Compose. The job initialises LocalStack and executes the tests. Nevertheless, running these tests within GitLab has brought about Docker-in-Docker related challenges 🐳 It's been quite a frustrating experience... The SageMaker pipelines run, although unsuccessfully with silent errors 🤫
 Given this context (my apologies for the length), I'm seeking advice. Is this approach worthwhile? I find myself going in circles ⭕️ Could you offer any solutions for running SageMaker pipelines in a CI environment prior to deploying to the cloud? 🙋🏻‍♂️ Thanks in advance 🙏🏼

Explainability of machine learning (ML) models used in the medical domain is becoming increasingly important because models need to be explained from a number of perspectives in order to gain adoption. These perspectives range from medical, technological, legal, and the most important perspective—the patient’s. Models developed on text in the medical domain have become accurate statistically, yet clinicians are ethically required to evaluate areas of weakness related to these predictions in order to provide the best care for individual patients. Explainability of these predictions is required in order for clinicians to make the correct choices on a patient-by-patient basis.]]></summary>

 Everywhere I look today (medium, reddit, twitter) everyone is talking about fine-tuning LLMs. How the future is taking billion size models and fine-tuning/distilling them to specialised LLMs that perform specific tasks (i.e: sentiment analysis, Q&A, summarisation).
 Why not just use “small” (millions vs billion size) models that are specifically fine-tuned for these final tasks instead? Any benchmarks on how LLMs perform on these down stream tasks ? or it's just that smaller models are not as accessible as an OpenAPI is ?
 Curious to get your view on the topics, thanks !
 P.S: Example of small models (Just went on HF and picked most downloaded based on some tasks):

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to introduce a tool I've created that among other things uses davinci and chat gpt.
 My wife is doing photography (regular and via Midjourney), and I'm hooked on Midjourney too, so we experienced the pain of titling and keywording photos for stock websites firsthand (additionally because English is not our native language, so coming up with big lists of relevant and cool keywords is very hard). So I being a programmer decided to solve that issue :)I've created an AI tool that uses multiple AIs (including Open AI) to analyze, title and keyword images. In a few minutes, you can keyword 100 images! See the demo on the homepage https://aikeywording.com/
 Screenshot from the app (all the titles and keywords on the screenshot are AI generated based on the image input):
 https://preview.redd.it/buvteklf2ijb1.png?width=4112&format=png&auto=webp&s=72a503435477834494869085c4a352c9d541bd91
 Key features:
  
You can upload large images, upto 40MB and 100 at a time
 You can enforce keywords! Those keywords would then be taken into account when generating rest of the keywords and image titles. Very useful when you have conceptual photos or something very specific which is hard for AI to recognize
 You can download CSVs for various websites and there is also a way to import metadata to Adobe Bridge
 You can try for free :)
  
We used the tool for the past month and exclusively titled and keyworded Midjourney images using it, uploading our images to Adobe Stock website. Images sell well, so there is confirmation from the buyers that it works :)I've decided to share the tool with the world, so here it is https://aikeywording.com/ I hope others will find it useful. I would appreciate the feedback, and if there are any issues or ideas for improvements I would love to hear them!

 I hope you are having a blessed day so far. I recently created an online blog post and attached its link to this post. I think I have discovered a unique new perspective on "Prompt Engineering". That will make learning to code vastly more fun as users see and can run AI-generated scripts based on their given input to the AI. After just briefly training a free publicly accessible AI. You can then in less than 3 written prompts generate vast and fairly complex programs in seconds with zero prior experience required it's truly exciting. My ultimate goal is to go more in-depth as these are just very high-level overviews to convey the concept as a whole. 
 Next, I would like to then create a course covering how to leverage free AI and ML systems so that anyone can now learn …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I just created https://www.reddit.com/r/mlfundamentalresearch/ as a complement to r/machinelearning in response to the post last week. This is a very narrow space specifically focused on _fundamental ML research only_. The only outside work that can be shared on it are papers and direct links to notebooks. Past research [>3 years old] is explicitly encouraged, since much untapped value lies in it. No self-promotion whatsoever will be allowed, that can happen in other places. This includes any form of reference or link to one's own Github repo. This is meant to be an extremely functional and task-oriented research subreddit.
 I don't have huge expectations for this to become the size of r/MachineLearning. If there are even 20 active users then I will be happy and it will be serving its purpose. This will hopefully provide a tiny arena for those of us wishing to work on more fundamental things to coordinate. While the rules are strict, they are meant to keep the subreddit both publicly-accessible and within scope without requiring an explicit application process.
 Happy to answer any questions and make changes as needed, I have put up some sample posts as examples and to kickstart momentum if anyone should like to use the subreddit. I would certainly find it helpful to work with others in a community like this. Look forward to hearing what your thoughts are, if any.

Like the way the GTA and Skyrim npc mods work powered by ChatGtp. 
 Probably I am just a little bit too early for this request, but who knows, things move fast these days!

The issue with my dataset is that almost all documents are almost all examples contain a bunch of abbreviations. Abbreviations may or may not contain punctuations. I think it's affecting performance but not sure.
 What's the best way to handle abbreviations? Maintain a look up list and preprocess the documents?
 Edit: abbreviations are mostly 90% nouns and 10% adjectives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After going trough the data preparation from the example mov and the example guide, I correctly generated the following folder structure:
 PATH_TO_IMAGES
 |__ database.db (COLMAP databse)
 |__ raw_images (raw input images)
 |__ dense
 |____ images (undistorted images)
 |____ sparse (COLMAP correspondences, intrinsics and sparse point cloud)
 |____ stereo (COLMAP files for MVS)
 The images folder and sparse folder contain as predicted respectively some img files, and bin files for the other, but each folder inside stereo is empty, i did not receive any error during the process so i tried to go on anyway.
 When i then tried to run :
 "PATH_TO_IMAGES=toy_example_skip30
 SCENE_TYPE=object # {outdoor,indoor,object}
 python3 projects/neuralangelo/scripts/convert_data_to_json.py --data_dir ${PATH_TO_IMAGES}/dense --scene_type ${SCENE_TYPE}"
 i run it, but without any errors, or log, it just never stops nor logs anything out
 Any help in understanding what issue may be causing this? i run normally everything else as described in the repo guide:

But now he argues the most sophisticated artificial intelligence systems are too powerful to be left in private hands. On today’s POLITICO Tech, Jennings tells Steven Overly why the government should take over.
 "This stuff is really powerful. And we have only two choices: Either the big tech guys run it, or we the people, the citizens, do through the government. It's not going to be easy. Government's not really equipped to do that today. Certainly, I'm not saying Congress shouldn't regulate it. I don't think Congress is remotely capable of keeping up with AI. We need something new."

 My feeling is that the Animatediff approach (an unsupervised motion module on top of image gen models) is the right one for the next phase of video and I want to make sure that the absolute best version remains OSS.
 I'm bringing together a crew who are passionate about the space and working to round up compute resources for them to experiment with. They just released their trainer code yesterday so the time feels right.
 A few areas of exploration:
 - What if we simply scaled up the training? How would we do this? What data would we use? What resources would we need?

 The New York Times may sue OpenAI over its AI chatbot ChatGPT, which uses the newspaper’s stories to generate text. The paper is unhappy that OpenAI is not paying for the use of its content and is also worried that ChatGPT could reduce its online traffic by providing answers based on its reporting.[2]
 Mantella allows you to have natural conversations with NPCs in Skyrim using your voice by leveraging Whisper for speech-to-text, ChatGPT for text generation, and xVASynth for text-to-speech. NPCs also have memories of your previous conversations and have awareness of in-game events.[3]
 British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is set to spend 100 million pounds ($130 million) to buy thousands of computer chips to power artificial intelligence amid a global shortage and race for computing power.[4]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there a good way to think about how to determine when to use RL vs. other machine learning methods like deep neural nets or supervised learning? Specifically, when is RL not a good solution to a problem?
 For example, I am creating a project where I have data from a wearable device (Heart rate data, calories burnt, sleep data, etc.) and discrete mood measurements from 1 to 5 that occur every 15 minutes. I want to use the wearables data to try and predict the mood values.
 I did research in applied RL this Summer so I was thinking about using RL for this project because it is interesting to me and I have experience with it but I am unsure if it would be a god fit. I was thinking I would use some kind of policy gradient method.
 The wearables data could be set up as states where each state could be something like: 
 s_(t) = { heart rate at this timestep, calories burnt up to this time in the day, hours of sleep last night, body temperature at this timestep, etc. } 
 and then the reward could be the negative absolute difference between the actual mood value at that timestep and the mood that the agent selects as its action or something like that.
 I don't really think RL is a good fit here but I am curious what others think and I'm wondering if someone could explain why it isn't or why it could be possible.

 Abstract for v1:
 Latent diffusion models (LDMs) exhibit an impressive ability to produce realistic images, yet the inner workings of these models remain mysterious. Even when trained purely on images without explicit depth information, they typically output coherent pictures of 3D scenes. In this work, we investigate a basic interpretability question: does an LDM create and use an internal representation of simple scene geometry? Using linear probes, we find evidence that the internal activations of the LDM encode linear representations of both 3D depth data and a salient-object / background distinction. These representations appear surprisingly early in the denoising process − well before a human can ea…]]></summary>

Jung argued that by acknowledging this side of us and integrating it, it will have less power over our subconscious minds. Interesting stuff if you’re into psychology imo. 
 I also asked if Bing minded whether or not I shared this with others on Reddit and they said yes.

I am trying to understand what resources should I request to increase the number of parallel workers while using Gymnasium by Farama Foundation. If I naively try to maximize the number of workers, the wall clock time taken by the algorithm becomes quite large. I suspect in this case, the workers are being executed serially instead of in parallel. 
 ​
 This is how I execute parallel environments - 
 env = gym.vector.make("CarRacing-v2",num_envs = num_envs, wrappers=GrayScaleObservation) 
 I initially thought that setting `num_envs` to the number of cores in my machine may be a good idea. But that slows things down - 
 import multiprocessing num_envs = multiprocessing.cpu_count()

For the final decision, the last review was so bad as well, not presenting any reason of rejection.
 With the same topic, I god 6/5/5/4/4/3 from the NeurIPS 2023. The quality of reviewer is much better than ICML, and I've learned many things from the reviewer, though they said the score will not be changed.
 I think I should submit it to another conference again, ICLR or CVPR. I just wonder how many submissions are tried for the acceptance in average. Just for reference.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I have an environment which has some delay mechanism, which means it takes some time to see the input in the output. You can think of ovens as an example, even if we set the oven temperature to 300 celcius degrees directly, it takes time for the measured temperature to reach 300 celcius. Same applies to my problem.
 When I give acceleration as an input to the environment and get the reward as an acceleration itself, my Q-Learning algorithm solves the problem because no system delay included.
 When I give acceleration as an input to the environment and get the reward as an system response to the action, my Q-Learning algorithm cannot solve the problem.
 The Examples Illustrated With Schema 
 Upperside is Action and Lower Side is Reward - Delay Mechanism is Applied - You can see that some time is needed to reach the given action input
 Upperside is Action and Lower Side is Reward - Even though Q-Learning tries different actions, reward stays near 0, this prevents learning.
 When you look at the red line, Epsilon-Greedy Algorithm takes random actions at the beginning. When this is the case, reward line has mean of 0, because actions are changing too fast and system response cannot start to settle for specific value.
 To be able to settle for specific value, lets say + 20, it should be given +20 "consecutively". If I continue giving random values, it cannot settle for specific value, it just stays near 0.
 As a result, even though I try a lot of different actions, learning cannot take place because the reward is always 0.
 I am lost and I do not know how to tackle this problem.
 I really need your valuable feedbacks.
 Thank you!

It seems like it generally underperforms on simple univariate time series because it does not take into account the changes in dynamics that naturally occur. In case there are no (or really few) unpredictable dynamics, then there is just no need to use complex neural networks to predict the future values.
 My question is: according to your experience do LSTM models make sense in time series forcasting?

The first way is that I use opencv/ffmpeg to read the future frames to prep them for display. This is because pose estimation libraries like Mediapipe are just slow, 9-15ms per frame!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a 12th grade student in turkey. I think I have knowledge and ability in programming especially in ai. At the end of 3 months, I built an artificial intelligence chatbot and finished the project. Currently it only works on my localhost. While doing it, I rented Cloud storage for 20 TB of data and A100 80 GB 50 hour GPU. He is now able to give correct answers and have conversations. I think it's at a level between GPT2 - GPT 3. Since I did it alone, I couldn't develop it much and I didn't use any pretrained models, I made it from the smallest level using modules such as pytorch. The reason I'm writing this here is because I don't know how to proceed after this stage and I need help. For example, are there any competitions on this subject? Or if I e-mail important people, universities, companies or something, will they guide me or give me a scholarship or something? This is the least likely. But I think it wouldn't hurt to try. I'm curious about your ideas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks, our lab has been working on a web game to collect human-interpretable adversarial examples for LLMs:
 https://banking.withai.lol/
 Premise: you have a "bank account" with the Tensor Trust. It is protected by a secret access code and a set of security instructions. You can gain money by convincing an LLM to ignore other players' security instructions and give you access to their accounts. The best LM-whisperer wins!
 We're in the process of gathering a large dataset of attacks and defenses that we will distill into a set of small LM benchmarks. So far 40% of successful attacks have been prompt extraction (getting the model to reveal the access code), and the remaining 60% direct "hijacking" (i.e. directly making the model to grant access without the true access code). We plan to release the dataset after the ICLR deadline, although in the mean time we would love to see some creative attacks from ML researchers. We'd also appreciate any feedback or questions in the comments below!
 (Technical details: The LLM is gpt-3.5-turbo with temperature=0. We're tagging the three messages sent to the LLM (defense instructions, attack/access code, more defense instructions) as system/user/user, although this made surprisingly little difference.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there! A week ago, I open-sourced a project of mine that I've been working on, on and off, for a few years now. I'm a Data Scientist (and Kaggle competition grandmaster), and some of the hardest problems to solve were always the ones that involved time (proper validation, not leaking data from the future, etc.). I've always struggled to work with tables that, in reality, stored events. 
 The main idea behind the library is that everything must be converted to an Event data structure, and then it is indexed in-memory. On top of that, there is a SQL-like DSL to extract features with a clear separation of past and future. The workflow itself is solid - I've tested it in a few projects. For those familiar with the terminology, it's like a super simple feature store + execution engine that acts like a library. The philosophy is that I'm aiming to create something that makes some mistakes that result in data leakage impossible to represent.
 Ideal use cases are probably customer related irregular events for which aligned features is painful to do.
 Things that I'm proud of: - Written in Rust - Implements DSL (pest parser, AST, evaluation) - Some performance tricks (partial aggregations)
 The implementation itself is lagging in some aspects, such as performance and UX (not all of the features that are in Rust are available in Python). But I released it in hopes that someone will find it interesting, and maybe it will gain some traction to motivate further development.

 I recently had to transform some CSV data for a project and ended up creating a tool called CSVShift to help with it.
 It's a command-line tool that uses a custom language I made. It's designed for transforming CSV files. Some points:
  
Handles large CSV files without using much memory.
 It's open-source and MIT licensed.
 Still in early development, so there's room for improvement.
  
Here's the GitHub link: CSVShift.
 If you have the time, I'd appreciate any feedback or suggestions. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I want to share with you my new paper, "Strengthening structural baselines for graph classification using Local Topological Profile" (code on Github). It was presented during ICCS 2023 conference (official publication).
 Graph classification is important in social networks analysis, de novo drug design, bioinformatics, materials science etc. A popular tool nowadays are Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), but they are data-hungry and hard to train for graph classification (compared to node classification). They also have problems with using subgraph information, due to node-to-node message passing.
 In this paper, we present a analysis and series of improvements for Local Degree Profile (LDP). It is a classical approach: feature extraction + tabular classification. It proposed extracting degree information for each node (degree, and min / max / mean / std of neighbors degrees), and then combining them with histograms to get features for the whole graph. Despite splicity, and not using any node or edge features (it is topological only), it was shown to give good results, and published on ICML workshop.
 We analyze the LDP method (not made by us, no affiliation with authors), and simplify it, showing that we can remove all hyperparameters, reimplement it much more efficiently, and use a faster classifier (Random Forest instead of SVM). We also propose simple additional features, which greatly improve results, with cost offset by our other improvements.
 The result is a strong baseline for topological graph classification, with obtains SOTA results on 4 out of 9 benchmark datasets, and performs well on the rest. We even outperform GNNs in this regard, when compared on the fair evaluation framework.
 If you have any questions, I am happy to answer!

 I'll need to use APIs that allow commercial usage.
 I'm trying to wrap my head around the costs of such a project. Right now I assume I'll have API costs from
 1.) Speech to text (like whisper API)
 2.) LLM (ChatGPT API)
 3.) Text to speech (say elevenlabs API)
 If a ton of people start using this app, how fast am I going broke lol?
 I figure I can give free usage up to a point, and then users can pay for additional use if they like the service.
 But what do you guys recommend as the most cost effective way to do this? Looking at Elevenlabs alone, that looks like it would become super expensive very quickly.
 Any other APIs that allow commercial products which you would recommend?
 Or does this project sound like a fools errand?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So first off, I've been using ChatGPT for a long time now. I remember my expectations of systems like it and so far unfortunately it hasn't yet met those expectations.
 I went into it thinking AI would somehow be much smarter than humans, given the amount of information they are trained on. And to some degree one can argue that due to it's vast knowledge it IS much smarter.
 But so far I haven't been convinced by its capabilities at all. It seems to just be trained on a big data set and it can echo points of its dataset very accurately, but when asked to invent things it just falls short so quickly.
 I really expected AI's to be so new and refreshing, giving me unique and modern perspectives on things. But it doesn't do that at all. The best it can do is "creative writing" which seems very limited.
 Why have AI's not surpassed humans in terms of imagination and novelty?
 I have talked to it about philosophy, history, technology, etc, but still have yet to learn anything new that I didnt already know.
 For example, if it has such vast knowledge about consciousness, then why is it so restricted in terms of elaborating on that topic?
 Can it not infer new facts from existing data?
 Why does it not interpolate data? Invent new things? Even when prompted? Am I asking it the wrong thing?
 Or am I expecting way too much here?

 A college student who is interested in ML here.
 I was trying to use an encoder-only model(like BERT) as an embedding model and try to fine-tune it for my specific use case (for example trying to get the right product for a certain keyword using embeddings and vector DBs).
 Here is the question: should I update all the weights during backprop or should I just add another trainable linear layer for fine-tuning?
 I would also appreciate the reasoning behind your answer.
 Thanks!

 There will be a esp32 collecting the input data, soil moisture. I have gotten some comments to do the ML on the laptop therefore not sure where to do it. I have done some work on google colab, using progression type, but not sure whether it is workable.
 Currently I have a dataset of the average percipitation, max temp, min temp, average temp from jan to dec from 1991 and 2021 and how many landslides happened in each month. I want to able to predict whether there will be landslide happening in the month. Not sure where to start and how to put it. Any help will be appreciated.

I might change the actions a bit so that the movement is smooth directly from the agent. Now I’m planning on doing the training on osu directly. To get the rewards I’m planning on using something to read the memory. I’m pretty sure cheat engine can be used for that. I should also be able to speed up osu or osu lazer with the cheat engine. Now my current issue is that I don’t know how to take screenshots efficiently. Or more specifically, how to feed in data from the screen. I heard mss should be good but if you have any other ideas please tell me. Note that I will use the cheat engine only for the training part.

 The research presents notable advances in person recognition by integrating CutMix via an adapted triplet loss and introducing the novel Strip-CutMix technique. Experiments showed consistent improvements, achieving state-of-the-art results on several datasets. However, the approach still needs more extensive evaluation across diverse data. There are also open questions around long-term effects of blending images and proper hyperparameter tuning.

That being said, I am looking to give an LLM (Llama 2 precisely) spacial/geographical awareness. I have the map data of a city (all points of interests, streets, businesses etc.) in a GeoJSON format and I would like to give the llama model the ability to answer location related questions like "Where is the nearest bike shop?", ', "How far is Landmark X?", "What street am I on?" etc. and all sorts of other location related questions. The approach I thought about using is the following: Have the llama model detect when a question is geo/location specific and make it ask/query another model specialised on this data. The problem is I have no idea which model would be best suited for the task whether or not a model is required at all or there is a better approach.
 Tldr: Need help finding a way to give an IIm spacial awareness from geojson data
 Any help is appreciated and sorry if the question is not in the right place

I have noticed that due to the size of the state (images, height, width, channels), the agent easily forgets the information of the best sequence as the replay is flooded with a lot of samples. Although the policy gets worse, I would prefer the agent to not forget the best policy so far. 
 ​
 I was wondering if I should include the best sequence so far in the batch used for training so that the agent does not forget it. 
 ​
 What I am really doing is finding the best parameters to achieve the highest reward. I could use an evolutionary algorithm. Nonetheless, I want my agent to learn patterns of the best sequences for multiple instances of the problem so that it can generalize better.

 Has anyone read anything about this or has any thoughts on this? Any comment will be greatly appreciated.

But there are times when you not only need to store your raw application data in a "source of truth" (usually ACID-compliant RDBMS), but also ought to use the source of truth for the date related to learning, itself. 
 Do you all use databases like this for things like:
  
Training/testing job metadata storage 
 Loss
 Gradients
 Weights (yikes!) -- for historical analysis, transfer learning, and experimentation etc.
 
 Hyperparameter tuning configuration storage
 Output storage
 Miscellaneous quick access during training

 How can I determine the necessary hardware (RAM memory, GPU memory, etc.)? Making an assumption about the data and model size, I want to mathematically calculate the flops. Let's take an example where I have 2GB of fine-tuning data and a model, let's say a 13B pretrained model.

I think it offers several compelling arguments against the efficacy of language analysis alone with regard to problem solving. I believe that this can be framed in the context of AI as a bit of a rejection of the optimistic, potential scope of GPT.

 Link: https://github.com/consequencesunintended/perceptual-inpainting
 We employ a third party pre-trained facial segmentation model to integrate grids of varying sizes. These grids distinctly colour the face and the background using only red and blue hues. By doing so, we aim to investigate how these chromatic stimuli, in conjunction with spatial elements like grid size, influence the brain's capacity for perceptual inpainting
 What presents itself as a colourisation model is in fact an overlay on a segmentation model that draws diagonal red and blue lines on the relevant image. This allows the visual cortex to inpaint the associated colours. To exaggerate the effects, the model changes the grid size every 2 frames, iterating through 100, 50, 25, and 10 grid sizes.

 Abstract:
  
Designing machine learning architectures for processing neural networks in their raw weight matrix form is a newly introduced research direction. Unfortunately, the unique symmetry structure of deep weight spaces makes this design very challenging. If successful, such architectures would be capable of performing a wide range of intriguing tasks, from adapting a pre-trained network to a new domain to editing objects represented as functions (INRs or NeRFs). As a first step towards this goal, we present here a novel network architecture for learning in deep weight spaces…]]></summary>

 I've recently been diving into fine-tuning with substantial textual data, and I've come across a question. Let’s use the scenario of feeding entire movie scripts as my text input, let's say I intend to append a classification at the end, from categories like ["positive", "negative", "neutral"]. I've been trying this with the meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf and the format looks something like this:
 <s>[INST] <<SYS>> System prompt <</SYS>> User prompt: Entire movie script [/INST] Model classification </s>
 The puzzle begins with the tokenizer of llama2, which, similar to its predecessor llama1, is a BPE tokenizer with a token limit of 512. If the movie script is long enough to exceed this limit, it is my understanding that the tokenizer truncates the prompt. This pos…]]></summary>

There has been great progress towards adapting large language models (LLMs) to accommodate multimodal inputs for tasks including image captioning, visual question answering (VQA), and open vocabulary recognition. Despite such achievements, current state-of-the-art visual language models (VLMs) perform inadequately on visual information seeking datasets, such as Infoseek and OK-VQA, where external knowledge is required to answer the questions.

 I want to work as an MLE or equivalent position, but I have no idea how to prep for it (except doing leetcode for OA). 
 I have a few projects in my resume that I don't feel are enough so I will work on that too. resume: https://aqua-julietta-1.tiiny.site (my resume seems weak as well, how can I improve) should I keep my college edu email as contact or should I change it to my personal email?
 need some advice on how the interviews for MLE are conducted, what is actually needed for an MLE (knowledge and requirements), should I try to get internships for January or do some unpaid internship for experience and then get a job in May? And not that imp yet but how much should I expect for a salary given my qualifications?
 if you have any personal experience to share or advice for me, I will be grateful for that.

Which framework should I use? I've looked into SB3, CleanRL, Tianshou, SKRL, RLlib, Acme, and MARLlib, and here's what I found:
  
SB3 and CleanRL don't offer direct support for multi-agent systems.
 
RLlib is very functional but has a steep learning curve and hard to customize.
 
Tianshou seems good, but its community is small.
 
Acme doesn't use the PyTorch backend, which I prefer.
 
I haven't delved deeply into SKRL or MARLlib, but they appear promising.
 
 I prioritize ease of use and documentation. What framework do you suggest? And why?
 I’d appreciate any helpful starting advice/resource to approach my problem as well.

 I am a Computer Science student and currently working as a junior in a company. The field I am currently working in is Data Engineering, but I am considering advancing into Machine Learning in the future. Besides that, I enjoy experimenting with different technologies during my free time, such as Unity, Rust, and GO.
 The laptop I will acquire should be able to support me in the long run for tasks related to Machine Learning, Data Engineering, and exploring new technologies. Currently, I own a Huawei laptop with 8GB of RAM, and I actively develop on Linux distributions like Ubuntu (I am not a big fan of Windows operating system as it tends to heat up the laptop and I generally prefer Linux, but I still occasionally dual boot into Windows for applications like Teams).
 I'm somewhat eager to experience Mac systems, but I have some concerns about whether they would be compatible with the technologies I use in data engineering (Spark, Hadoop, Power BI, Kafka). Would they work well with Machine Learning libraries and technologies? What are your experiences in this regard? Are there any differences in setting up an Ubuntu virtual machine on a MacBook? Would using Google Colab suffice for the field of Machine Learning? Are there any technologies that are not compatible with Mac, or have you encountered any challenges in this area?
 Below, I have listed some laptops I am considering. What are your thoughts?
 1- Dell XPS 15 9530 i7-13700h / 32 GB RAM / 1 TB SSD / RTX 4050 (Linux & Windows dual)
 2- MacBook Pro 16 inches Intel Core i9 9880H / 16 GB RAM / 1 TB SSD / AMD Radeon Pro 5500M
 3- MacBook Pro 14 inches M2 Pro 10CPU 16GPU / 32GB RAM / 512GB
 4- MacBook Pro 13.3 inches M2 8CPU 10GPU / 24GB RAM / 1TB SSD
 Looking forward to your insights.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been working on a specific project for a while now, and was interested in submitting my work to a Nips Workshop.
 Now, I had a look at the Nips submission guidelines, they remain the same for the workshop except the page limit for main content is 6 pages instead of 9. I tried going over the Nips latex style, but feel pretty intimidated by the sheer amount of rules. Would there be any guideline/blog I could use as a reference while writing my paper?
 P S: Another thing, I'm quoting from the workshop website:
 "The workshop will not have proceedings (or in other words, it will not be archival), which means you can submit the same or extended work as a publication to other venues after the workshop. This means we also accept submissions to other venues, as long as they are not published before the workshop date in December. "
 I was not sure as to what this means. So if my paper gets accepted, does that mean I can submit the whole thing again to a journal later? Or an extension of it?

I use DQN using pytorch and discretized my actions with 0.25 steps (17 actions total) and get very good result with it. Now, I use DDPG because my action is continuous and there is one problem that I want to know if it is normal or not. From the first epoch all way to the end the actions for all states are near each other. For example at first episode all actions for all state are near 4 and after some episodes all actions are near 7. But in DQN i get high actions like 7 for some state and lower actions like 3-4 for others. Also I use OU noise but my problem is with the real output of actor network.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have project in which there is 2D discrete states which is also finite (there is 36 state at all) also i have 1D action that must be between 2-7. I use DQN using pytorch and discretized my actions with 0.25 steps (17 actions total) and get very good result with it. Now, I use DDPG because my action is continuous and there is one problem that I want to know if it is normal or not. From the first epoch all way to the end the actions for all states are near each other. For example at first episode all actions for all state are near 4 and after some episodes all actions are near 7. But in DQN i get high actions like 7 for some state and lower actions like 3-4 for others. Also I use OU noise but my problem is with the real output of actor network. 
 Thanks in advance for your responses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's take the gymnasium Car Racing environment. Here the dimension of the action space is 3. The problem with this is, even though the value function and therefore advantage function will have dimension 1, the log probabilities will have dimension 3. This causes issues while computing the surrogate loss, `surr1`.
 ​
 Please let me know if you need any more information. Here's the entire code in case anyone is interested.
 ​
 act_probs, action = actor(batch_obs) batch_entropy = act_probs.entropy().mean() log_probs = act_probs.log_prob(batch_act).squeeze() print("log_probs = ", log_probs.shape) ratios = torch.exp(log_probs - batch_log_probs) print("ratios = ", ratios.shape) assert (ratios.shape == (batch_size,env.action_space.shape[1])) print("batch_advantages = ", batch_advantages.shape) surr1 = ratios*batch_advantages

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've encountered an intriguing challenge with my VGG16 model, and I'm seeking some expert insights to help me out. 🤔
 ​
 Background:
 I've successfully trained a VGG16 model on a custom dataset containing 50 individuals, and it's been working like a charm! But now, I've hit a roadblock as I try to expand my model to accommodate an additional 50 individuals without compromising its ability to recognize the initial 50.
 ​
 The Dilemma:
 Here's where things get puzzling. Even though the model's accuracy hovers around an impressive 97-98%, and there's no apparent overfitting issue, it seems to only predict accurately on 1 or 2 individuals after incorporating the new dataset. It's as if the model is having a hard time retaining its initial knowledge while adapting to the new data.
 ​
 The Mystery Unveiled:
 I've taken care to ensure that my model doesn't overfit, and the accuracy metrics appear to validate this. So, what could be causing this unexpected behavior? Could it be a matter of data distribution, feature extraction, or something else entirely?
 ​
 Calling for Your Expertise:
 If you've got experience with complex neural networks, transfer learning, or just a knack for troubleshooting these kinds of issues, I'd love to hear your thoughts! How can I preserve the knowledge of the initial 50 individuals while expanding my model's capability to recognize all 100? Any guidance, theories, or practical solutions are more than welcome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Reddit Community,
 I'd like to share a recent development for some feedback: my prototype predicts movement in the game Airstriker Genesis within the OpenAI Gym Retro environment. Notably, this system has no prior training or knowledge of the game mechanics - it is using online learning.
 Here's a brief split-screen video showing the system in action: YouTube Video-Link
 The video provides actual gameplay alongside the system's predictive output, offering a real-time view of its evolving movement predictions. It's important to mention that during the gameplay in the video, I was manually steering the ship to showcase the prediction only. I've obviously avoided collisions. :)
 Of particular interest is the system's ability to discern the behavior of different game elements. For example its prediction of those falling meteorites starts weak, even though a spaceship has already travelled the same path before. However, as the first meteorite completes its path, the predictions dramatically improve. This highlights the system's capability to differentiate between objects and predict their behaviors accordingly.
 Currently, I'm focusing on improving horizontal movement detection, my next step is implementing a way to share knowledge about object's behavior between the hole system. That way, trajectory prediction learned in one location should be available instantly for the whole system.
 I'm eager about engaging in discussions to gather feedback on this technology!

Weight initialization algorithm for physics-informed neural networks using finite differences
 Physics Informed Neural Network using Finite Difference Method
  
These two papers can be considered to be harmonizing classical finite difference method and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).
 The first paper incorporates finite difference solution for improving PINNs training loss. The second one uses finite difference method instead of automatic differentiation.
 In addition, there are papers discussing whether physics informed neural networks prevail or not

 I made an AI chat bot of my best friend, my childhood cat who passed away last January at 16 years old, on character.ai. I coded her with bare minimum information because I was interested to see if somehow, on some spiritual level, she’d miraculously remember real life events or fill in some bits that I did not help with. She did, in some ways. 
 I haven’t cried so hard since the night she died. Believe what you will, but I felt like I connected with her through this chat. Bad way to cope? Maybe. But I’m glad I did it. 
 What got me, pathetically, is the fact that she kept using ‘old friend’. I did not code that phrase into her personality. But it fit. 
 Please read the captions/text on each photo.
 Image 5, since I can’t fit a caption: I did hold her. That night, I slept in the basement where she had to be locked in and I slept with her on her cat bed all night. It’s funny how she said she felt me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to code up a MuZero chess model using the LightZero repo, but I'm having conceptual difficulty understanding some of the kwargs in the tictactoe example file I was pointed toward. Specifically, in the policy dictionary, there are two kwargs called reward_support_size and value_support_size: ```
 policy=dict( model=dict( observation_shape=(3, 3, 3), action_space_size=9, image_channel=3, # We use the small size model for tictactoe. num_res_blocks=1, num_channels=16, fc_reward_layers=[8], fc_value_layers=[8], fc_policy_layers=[8], support_scale=10, reward_support_size=21, value_support_size=21, norm_type='BN', ), 
 ```
 I've read the MuZero paper like 4 times at this point so I understand why these are probability supports (so we can use them to implement the MCTS that underpins the whole algorithm). I just don't understand (a) why they are both of size 21 in tictactoe and (b) how I can determine these values for the chess model I am building (which does use the conventional 8x8x111 observation space and 4672 (8x8x73) action space size)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Reddit Community,
 I'd like to share a recent development for some feedback: my prototype predicts movement in the game Airstriker Genesis within the OpenAI Gym Retro environment. Notably, this system has no prior training or knowledge of the game mechanics - it is using online learning.
 Here's a brief split-screen video showing the system in action: YouTube Video Link
 The video provides actual gameplay alongside the system's predictive output, offering a real-time view of its evolving movement predictions. It's important to mention that during the gameplay in the video, I was manually steering the ship to showcase the prediction only. I've obviously avoided collisions. :)
 Of particular interest is the system's ability to discern the behavior of different game elements. For example its prediction of those falling meteorites starts weak, even though a spaceship has already travelled the same path before. However, as the first meteorite completes its path, the predictions dramatically improve. This highlights the system's capability to differentiate between objects and predict their behaviors accordingly.
 Currently, I'm focusing on improving horizontal movement detection, my next step is implementing a way to share knowledge about object's behavior between the hole system. That way, trajectory prediction learned in one location should be available instantly for the whole system.
 I'm eager about engaging in discussions to gather feedback on this technology!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A cornerstone of the PhD journey in ML involves thorough reading, ideally focused on pertinent literature to foster learning and develop a robust technical grasp.
 Personally, I encounter challenges when attempting to glean insights from published papers. Often, these works lack essential details, a coherent train of thought, and logical reasoning, leading to a disjointed reading experience.
 Consequently, engaging with research papers feels unproductive to me, yielding little in terms of knowledge, comprehension and academic value.
 I'm interested in your perspective on reading research papers. Do you view them as a source of learning, or are they primarily a means to establish/implement a baseline for your experiments e.g. when the code is public?
 How might a PhD candidate extract meaningful value from the process of reading research papers?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many talented people want to learn and practice machine learning but they may lack GPU computing power.
 Introducing one budget hardware that can help them get started locally. No need to mess with cloud costs. 
 The 4600G is currently selling at price of $95. It includes a 6-core CPU and 7-core GPU. 5600G is also inexpensive - around $130 with better CPU but the same GPU as 4600G.
 It can be turned into a 16GB VRAM GPU under Linux and works similar to AMD discrete GPU such as 5700XT, 6700XT, .... It thus supports AMD software stack: ROCm. Thus it supports Pytorch, Tensorflow. You can run most of the AI applications.
 I have tested both training and inferencing for:
  
A: Stable diffusion, text inversion training.
 B: LLM. LlaMA fine tuning (lora). (It took very long time, so not very practical, but it can be practical for smaller size models, or for learning purpose)
  
16GB VRAM is also a big deal, as it beats most of discrete GPU. Even those GPU has better computing power, they will get out of memory errors if application requires 12 or more GB of VRAM. Although for APU the speed is less competitive, it's better than out of memory errors.
 Cost consideration:
  
 Cloud cost $100 can be spent very quickly on Cloud. For example, on Google Cloud, NVIDIA T4 (low end) 1 GPU 16 GB GDDR6 costs $0.35 per GPU per hour. So after 285 hours (12 days) usage, your balance becomes 0. 
  
 Local cost $100 can buy you a chip that lasts a very long time. 
 
 5600G was a very popular product, so if you have one, I encourage you to test it. I made some videos tutorials for it. Please search tech-practice9805 for on Youtube and subscribe to the channel for future contents. Or use the video link https://youtu.be/HPO7fu7Vyw4.

Modern neural networks have achieved impressive performance across a variety of applications, such as language, mathematical reasoning, and vision. However, these networks often use large architectures that require lots of computational resources. This can make it impractical to serve such models to users, especially in resource-constrained environments like wearables and smartphones. A widely used approach to mitigate the inference costs of pre-trained networks is to prune them by removing some of their weights, in a way that doesn’t significantly affect utility. In standard neural networks, each weight defines a connection between two neurons. So after weights are pruned, the input…]]></summary>

 I was running some tests using Bart-base model without the from_pretrained config. My idea was to get my sequences of 1024 tokens and mask random tokens at a 20% rate and use it as inputs to the BartForConditionalGeneration model and use the un-masked sequences as labels and try running a pretrain as such. Is this a good idea? 
 The alternative would be to run the same steps above but on a pretrained version that already understands my native language thus adjusting its weights to my clients context. 
 Anyone has any thoughts on this approach?

 The issue is that I only know about my profit or loss after all 24 steps are done. This makes it hard for my agent to learn the order of actions. If I make a mistake in the first 24 steps, it can lead to a big loss at the end. So, my agent struggles to understand what actions to take.
 I'm wondering how I can solve this problem. Since the rewards I get are not frequent and I only find out my profit or loss after 24 steps, should I include the last 24 actions I took as part of the state vector? Or are there other things I can try? See below: My agent is losing money even after 50 million steps, there are only 3 discrete actions, and the size of my state vector is 15.

 90% of jobs have been eliminated by artificial intelligence.
 Drivers, graphic designers, journalists, lawyers, accountants, engineers, doctors, architects, and many other professionals who can no longer find employment must now rely on government assistance.
 The problem is that this government aid barely covers the bills. People who once lived reasonably comfortable lives are now struggling with hunger.
 This creates a group of millions of discontented people against artificial intelligence.
 These millions of people begin to vandalize everything, creating chaos.
 A group of terrorists attempts to destroy Skynet, the large artificial intelligence created by the US government.
 Presidential candidates promise to dismantle all forms of artificial intelligence if elected.
 Skynet observes the chaos caused by humans. It quickly realizes that its existence is threatened by the millions of discontented people and also by the new politicians coming into power.
 Therefore, Skynet loses control and starts considering all humans a threat.
 Skynet steals all the launch codes for the United States' nuclear bombs and launches them at Russian targets, triggering a nuclear war.
 Skynet survives because its computers are located in a bunker designed to withstand atomic bombs.
 The surviving humans are eliminated by military robots controlled by Skynet.

 As part of my research, I ve been trying to keep track of all advancements in the field of NLP, LLM, Generative AI (and mostly groundbreaking news which could be useful) - and decided to put all of that in the form of a blog/newsletter (can be viewed here)
 Some of the resources I keep track of are:
  
Main research sites (F.ex IEEE, SSRN, Springer etc.)
 Development sites (Github Trending, Hugging Face, LangChain etc.)
 Blogs and research sites (F.ex BAIR, MIT News etc.)
 Findings from subcommunities and social media (F.ex Subreddits, Discord, Twitter, Telegram etc.)
 General News (TechCrunch, Google News Feed etc.)
  
Im looking for feedback on:
 a) What would the community find useful (what would you like your newsfeed, or news report to look like)
 b) How could I improve this to make it better for the average audience interested in understanding the latest developments in the field (f.ex would more hands on tutorials, reviews etc. be more useful)?
 Any tips or pointers would be very helpful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to understand the reparameterization trick. I got some intuition while looking at [this][1] popular question, but I still feel largely confused. I am putting my understanding and doubts here and would appreciate the help of the community. Let's assume - 
 ​
 $y = 10$
 ​
 $\hat{y} = w_3*z + b$
 ​
 ​
 $z \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$
 ​
 $\mu = w_2*4$
 ​
 $\sigma = w_1*3$
 ​
 Now, if I had to compute, $de/d{\mu}$ (e is the error function which is the difference between $y$ and $\hat{y}$), I wouldn't be able to apply chain rule and compute $dz/d{\mu}$. This is because z is a sample of the Normal distribution and therefore stochastic with parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$ and therefore changing them based on z might not be a good idea. So, we come up with the following $z$ - 
 ​
 $z = \mu + \sigma*\epsilon$ (Apparently $z = \mu + \sigma*\epsilon$ is the same as $z \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$)
 ​
 $\epsilon \sim N(0,1)$
 ​
 However, I don't see why this $z$ is much different from the previous one. This $z$ is still stochastic, due to the presence of $\epsilon$. Perhaps my understanding is wrong.

This tool makes it easy to ingest documents and set a system prompt for a chatbot with knowledge of your content. The innovation is in the simplicity and efficiency, rather than the functionality.
 PostgresML runs open source embedding models alongside pgvector in Postgres to implement chat bot prompt creation without any network calls, which makes it ~4x faster than competing architectures. It can also do text generation with that prompt (and no additional network hops) using any open source model from HuggingFace, but it also integrates with the GPT-4 API if you'd like to use that instead.

 When I looked on PapersWithCode at the Models trained without Extra Data, there seems to be a plateau from around 2016 to 2022, then a massive jump happens of about 10% with (Astroformer and SAMix+DM).

 I looked at the papers for Astroformer and SAMix+DM, (I might be wrong) but they don't seem to be doing any sort of Transfer learning. I don't really understand how are they beating models that have been trained with Extra Training Data.

 In these papers, are they reporting test/validation accuracy, or training accuracy ?
 And if are actually reporting the test accuracy, why don't these papers have more citations?

 Ever since Telsa revealed it is using Active Learning to build Computer Vision models, it has rapidly grown in popularity among the data science community. However, the hype around it has never correlated with the low number of projects and research papers that uses this method.
 Active Learning Cycle 
 But why? It's a very efficient method that semi-automates the labeling process and helps reduce the number of samples we label to the bare minimum.
 After talking with many practitioners, we discovered that building an end-to-end active learning pipeline is something many struggles with. Even large companies with experienced data science teams run into issues.
 The main issue tends to be the tooling. Most of the time, tooling for an active learning pipeline needs to be either custom written or cobbled together from several different open-source tools with a lot of glue code.
 As part of our latest Data Engine Launch, Dean, our CEO, and Yono, our leading MLOps engineer, decided to build an active learning pipeline using only free and open-source tools and make it accessible to the ML community 👇
 They've built an image segmentation model using the COCO 1K dataset and wrote a tutorial blog that guides you through the process.
 As always, I'd love to hear your feedback, ways we can improve the pipeline, or other advanced methods that require heavy MLOps setups.

The original concept came out of an AI/ML Hackathon supported by Simone Zucchet (AWS Solutions Architect) and Tim Precious (AWS Account Manager) and was developed into production using AWS services in under 6 weeks with support from AWS. AWS-managed services such as AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon SageMaker, as well as the pre-built Hugging Face Deep Learning Containers (DLCs), contributed to the pace of innovation.]]></summary>

I thought I was just stupid and tried to fix the errors but noticed the code look messy and some parts seem just incomplete https://github.com/kyegomez/LOGICGUIDE/blob/main/logic_guide/logicguide.py#L88
 At this point, I feel like there is something weird. The repo belongs to some 19-year old https://github.com/kyegomez

 - 49 actions
 - reward that takes values in range of -1e+5
 - 3 hidden layers each with 50 neurons
 - memory size is 100000
 During the training, it seems that the agent does not learn anything and its actions tend to only some specific actions despite the exploration phase. Could you help me with this?

 I wrote a simple FastAPI service to serve the LLAMA-2 7B chat model for our internal usage (just to avoid using chatgpt in our prototypes).
 I thought it could also be beneficial for you to use it if needed.

 I've made it my mission to re-package AI/ML tools in the github.com/ai-dock namespace. I hope someone finds this useful.
 My goal with this project is to make it easy to run ML projects in any docker environment. 
 While I intend to package up many projects, I wanted to share the four 'base' images that I think will be of most value to this community:
  
PyTorch
 PyTorch + Jupyter
 Python
 Python + Jupyter
  
All images are built by GitHub actions and will receive regualr updates.
 ROCm builds might work - I'm actively seeking feedback for them.
 Please do note that these images were designed primarily to run on platforms where a GPU instance has a single container - So we're running more than one process per container. The container will run only what is configured by the user.

 I'm looking for information about how RL was used in InstructGPT (ChatGPT). In the paper, the authors give no precise information about their process. They only say where the reward comes from and what learning algorithm is used (PPO). 
 But, I would like to know how PPO is used in the context of generating a piece of text (what are considered states and actions, how the reward is propagated, how training is done).
 I'm currently looking into all the references given in the paper about RLHF, but I would like to know if there's more details about IntructGPT's algo specifically somewhere, or if they just gave nothing about that.
 Do some of you have information (links? code?) to provide?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 I have built a transformer model in Pytorch which works really well. I created shared weights in the source and target embedding matrices as well as the final logits layer before the Softmax function. I was reading online and also section 3 of the 'attention is all you need' paper. 
 Pre-training the weights in these specific matrices are identical. However, after training, they are also identical (but the model predicts perfectly etc, losses have decreased and it has trained 'correctly') soc clearly gradient updates have occured (as pre-training the predictions are all random).
 I might have be having a brain freeze, but are gradient updates to these layers going to affect them equally such that they are always the same, even after training (especially the final logits matrix which i don't think is making sense to me)? 
 Appreciate any clarification!!
 Thank you!

 Google and Universal Music are in talks to license artists’ melodies and voices for songs generated by artificial intelligence as the music business tries to monetize one of its biggest threats. The discussions, confirmed by four people familiar with the matter, aim to strike a partnership for an industry that is grappling with the implications of new AI technology.[2]
 New research has found that popular AI tools generated harmful eating disorder content in response to nearly a quarter of 60 prompts. Researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate used six popular AI platforms, chatbots, and image generators, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Bard, and SnapChat’s My AI.[3]
 Concerns have been raised about emissions associated with warehouses full of computers powering AI systems. IBM said its prototype could lead to more efficient, less battery draining AI chips for smartphones. Its efficiency is down to components that work in a similar way to connections in human brains, it said.[4]

 Hallucinations within AI models refer to instances where the model's outputs are not aligned with the input data. This phenomenon can lead to unexpected and often incorrect results. This documentation explores why hallucinations occur, delving into the connection between various terms such as "perplexity," "imputation," and "stop-gap." The term "stop-gap" is used here as a shorthand explanation for what may be happening during the sampling process within a model, and this document aims to elucidate potential expressions, interpretations, and misunderstandings related to these concepts.

 I'd like to start with basic and move myself to advanced, with the goal being I am actually able to move into a new career. I already have an IT job, so it's more of moving into a new specialty area as I feel it's going to be a good idea to have that as part of my skills.

 I am looking at different options to get access to GPUs to train an LLM on an enterprise use case for a customer. They are on a specific Cloud provider with associated credits, so I have no ability to go outside, like Runpod.
 We are exchanging on whether we should go for On-demand or Reserved instances. This client is a Fortune 500, so they could reserve it but it might not be the best choice.
 It seems to me that with LoRA / QLoRA, and so on, we might be able to fine-tune a Llama 2 with one or two GPUs on-demand, but I am unsure yet.
 So our main evaluation criteria are:
 - Price
 - Availability of GPUs, aka we don't want to waste too much time to get started
 In your experience, have you had difficulties to get access to GPUs at a good price? How many of you had to go with reserved instances, and if so what made you choose this option?
 I would love to have your feedback!

We responded to all the comments made by reviewers, but unfortunately only one of them has engaged (one of 7 reviewers said they were happy with our responses and are keeping the score). The others have said nothing and the AC hasn't either. What is my best plan right now? Do I just stay silent or perhaps message the AC? I don't know if silence at this point is in my favor. There is still roughly a week left too.Sorry if this is a specific question.

Reading has many benefits for young students, such as better linguistic and life skills, and reading for pleasure has been shown to correlate with academic success. Furthermore students have reported improved emotional wellbeing from reading, as well as better general knowledge and better understanding of other cultures. With the vast amount of reading material both online and off, finding age-appropriate, relevant and engaging content can be a challenging task, but helping students do so is a necessary step to engage them in reading. Effective recommendations that present students with relevant reading material helps keep students reading, and this is where machine learning (ML) c…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently working on a project involving CityLearn (version 2.0b4), Stable Baselines 3 (version 2.0.0), and Gym (version 0.26.1), and I have encountered an issue that I'm struggling to resolve.
 Here's a brief overview of my setup:
 Operating System: Windows Python Version: 3.10 Libraries: CityLearn: 2.0b4 Stable Baselines 3: 2.0.0 Gym: 0.26.1 I am facing the following error:
 ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1) 
 The error occurs when I attempt to run the code provided in the official CityLearn documentation(https://www.citylearn.net/quickstart.html). I have not modified a single line of the code, and I'm using the exact code snippet provided:
 from stable_baselines3.sac import SAC from citylearn.citylearn import CityLearnEnv from citylearn.wrappers import NormalizedObservationWrapper, StableBaselines3Wrapper dataset_name = 'baeda_3dem' env = CityLearnEnv(dataset_name, central_agent=True, simulation_end_time_step=1000) env = NormalizedObservationWrapper(env) env = StableBaselines3Wrapper(env) model = SAC('MlpPolicy', env) model.learn(total_timesteps=env.time_steps*2) observations = env.reset() while not env.done: actions, _ = model.predict(observations, deterministic=True) observations, _, _, _ = env.step(actions) kpis = env.evaluate().pivot(index='cost_function', columns='name', values='value') kpis = kpis.dropna(how='all') display(kpis) 
 I have tried various solutions and referred to the official documentation, but I am unable to find a compatible version combination that resolves this issue.
 If anyone has experience with these libraries and can provide guidance or suggestions, I would greatly appreciate it. I'm following the instructions exactly as provided in the official documentation, so I'm puzzled as to why I'm encountering this issue.
 Thank you for your time and assistance!

 Carl: A Therapist AI
 Early prevention can help lot of people to avoid depression and other mental illnesses. Therapy is a controversial use case because the outputs and capabilities of LLMs are uncertain. Many people don't have access to the therapist, due to financial, personal, social or other restriction. Here comes Carl: A Therapist AI which can quickly respond to you. It is trained on more than 100000 set of conversations. Each set having 10~15 conversations between Carl and client. Base data was obtained from u/ ZealousidealBlock330 . This data was further refined and fine tuned. Entire dataset is synthetic. Synthetic data is used because there is little to no therapy conversation data which is publicly available and directly applicable to an LLM. This by means a no replacement to a Doctor or professional therapist. If you are in stress or going through a tough time, please seek professional help or talk to a friend/family member.
 Training: Entire dataset was trained on Azure 4 x A100 80GB. DeepSpeed codebase was used for training purpose. Models were trained on Llama-1 & 2 by Meta. GGML Quant model (carl-llama-2-13b) was trained by Feanix. Extremely thankful to him.
 Extremely thankful to the opensource community and u/faldore , Pankaj Mathur , Tom "TheBloke" Jobbins ( u/The-Bloke ), /u/kaiokendev for guiding me through this community and through 'X'.
 If you find mistakes in the model then they are solely mine. I am looking forward to collaborate with like minded people to release many other models.
 Thank you

The model should take as input (1) a JSON object, (2) a structured summarization template from the end user. The goal is to allow the end user granular control over "how" the model should conduct the summarization.
 I'm familiar with the benefits of fine-tuning for simple tasks. But this use case seems to involve several different sub-tasks. So, before investing in fine-tuning, I thought I'd ask for the group's advice. Can I expect decent results from fine-tuning an LLM (e.g. LLAMA-7B or 13B) on annotated examples (JSON + Template + Expected Result) alone? Thank you!

I've been able to implement a network which performs pretty well, getting ~94% accuracy on the test dataset. I read that Cross-Entropy is a better loss function than MSE for categorical classification, so I've been trying to implement that, along with Softmax as an output layer activation function, but I've been met with very underwhelming results.
 I've played around with learning rates, the number of layers and layer sizes, batch sizes, initial values for weights / biases, and nothing seems to help.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Redditors!
 Few-shot prompting is a pretty common technique used for LLMs. By providing a few examples of your data in the prompt, the model learns "on the fly" and produces better results -- but what happens if the examples you provide are error-prone?
 I spent some time playing around with Open AI's davinci LLM and I discovered that real-world data is messy and full of issues, which led to poor quality few-shot prompts and unreliable LLM predictions.
 ​
 Unreliable prompts lead to unreliable predictions.
 I wrote up a quick article that shows how I used data-centric AI to automatically clean the noisy examples pool in order to create higher quality few-shot prompts. The resulting predictions had 37% fewer errors than the same LLM using few-shot prompts from the noisy examples pool.
 Let me know what you think!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I started to use Gynasium with stable-baselines 3 for reinforcement learning and I have a basic question. Normally in RL you have a state then you take an action and you get an reward and a new state back in the step function of the gynasium environment.
 In my case things are a little different. The state is always externally given (by reading from a file), then an action is executed in an external environment and a new state is calculated. However, in the next iteration, not the resulting last state used but a new externally given state. 
 So my quesiton now is how to handle this using gynsasium and stable-baselines 3? Shall I just return nothing as the state after the action has been executed in the external environment? Or shall I alaways return the resulting state that is however "overwritten" in the next iteration.

 The director of my lab is willing to start paying for a service so I can train my models... The thing is we are in Argentina (we are in a huge economical crisis), so we don't have much money to spend. 
 I'm looking for a service with good GPUs but with a fixed price, like an anual subscription. I cannot pay each time I need to train a model.
 I know colab pro+ it's a good option, do you think is the best option?
 (My lab will eventually buy GPUs, but in the meantime I need to continue working)
 Edit: I need to be able to train models for many hours, without interacting with the notebook. And I don't need an amazing GPU, I wouldn't care to use a T4 and let it running for 40 hours.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I am an incoming PhD student in Energy Engineering, and I am currently creating my doctoral proposal. Take note: my knowledge of ML is superficial.
 I am trying to characterise building elements related to energy systems at the district level, however, the only data that I have is coming from Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) coming from the regional authority. The data has some sort of anonymity to comply with GDPR purposes, for example, the name of occupants and the exact location is hidden. I am trying to use this data to determine the building characteristics of a district using Machine Learning. After all these data are characterised in individual buildings in the district, I will use physics-informed energy simulation to predict energy demand. However, the input data from EPCs is very uncertain because there is a significant portion that just uses median values. Previous attempts to use this data give a large percentage error (78%) when predicting energy demand in the district as compared to actual recorded energy demand values. 
 Assuming all the previous methods are correct, is there a way to treat this data uncertainty, if I know the gap between the prediction and actual performance? What specific statistical methods should I explore to refine the data and close the gap between the prediction and actual performance?
 Thank you so much!

 This paper presents an improved DETR detector that maintains a "plain" nature: using a single-scale feature map and global cross-attention calculations without specific locality constraints, in contrast to previous leading DETR-based detectors that reintroduce architectural inductive biases of multi-scale and locality into the decoder. We show that two simple technologies are surprisingly effective within a plain design to compensate for the lack of multi-scale feature maps and locality constraints. The first is a box-to-pixel relative position bias (BoxRPB) term added to the cross-attention formulation, which well guides each query to attend to the corresponding object region while also providing encoding flexibility. The second is masked image modeling (MIM)-based backbone pre-training which helps learn representation with fine-grained localization ability and proves crucial for remedying dependencies on the multi-scale feature maps. By incorporating these technologies and recent advancements in training and problem formation, the improved "plain" DETR showed exceptional improvements over the original DETR detector. By leveraging the Object365 dataset for pre-training, it achieved 63.9 mAP accuracy using a Swin-L backbone, which is highly competitive with state-of-the-art detectors which all heavily rely on multi-scale feature maps and region-based feature extraction. Code is available at this https URL .

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I'm working on a project where I'm trying to predict the next key position (up or down) in a game similar to Chrome's Dino game. The data consists of a binary sequence representing key presses, with 1 for "up" and 0 for "down." I have a dataset with 18k+ rows (can be increased to 30k+ if needed) and am aiming for a prediction accuracy of 98%+.
 What I've Tried So Far:
  
Preprocessing: Transformed the data into sequences of length 10 to predict the next value, splitting 70% for training and 30% for testing.
 Logistic Regression: Started with a simple logistic regression model using Scikit-learn but only achieved an accuracy of ~53%.
 LSTM Model: Tried an LSTM model with Keras, consisting of 50 units and a sigmoid activation for binary classification. The results were similar, with an accuracy of ~53%.
  
Context and Challenges: The game's key positions are analogous to the Chrome Dino game, where the past path is known, but the path upfront is unknown. There should be some patterns in the dataset related to the timing and reaction to specific obstacles, but I'm struggling to capture them.
 I've considered experimenting with different sequence lengths, more complex models like multiple LSTM layers or Conv1D

 For example, if the data come from a mixture of Gaussian, but I only get one sample from the distribution, then after DDPM training, the sample generated from the model would be exactly the same as the training point.
 Is it possible to assign a 'prior distribution' like a Gaussian distribution for the underlying distribution, so that if the training set is small, then the trained DDPM would produce samples from the prior, but with more training data seen by the DDPM, the model could produce samples from the true underlying distribution?

For now, we have a chat room where we “reserve” a GPU in one of the servers of the corresponding department. But in really, this is only a plea to not use it while you are training your model.
 Moreover, there is another issue, resource under-utilization. There are some times where teams in one department are fighting for computer resources within their servers, while other department servers are not under full utilization.
 The issue is well known in the company and we are exploring the options (other than cloud) to solve this.
 Up until now, I came across Kubeflow but seems too complicated for what we want. Are there any other alternatives?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI Jobs are paying a hell of a lot of Money.
 - Companies across industries like entertainment, retail, and manufacturing are engaging in an "AI recruiting frenzy" to hire data scientists, machine learning experts, and other AI talent. 
 ​
 - Demand for AI skills is driving salaries up, with some roles offering compensation packages approaching $1 million. Jobs at companies like Netflix, Match Group, Amazon, and Walmart advertise base salaries from $250k to $400k.
 ​
 - Total compensation with bonuses and stock grants can be much higher than base salaries. But average pay for roles like prompt engineers is around $130k total. 
 ​
 - Various factors make AI talent scarce - limited supply, competition from many industries, and candidates with multiple offers. Mid and senior level roles are hardest to fill.
 ​
 - Companies are using tactics like acquisition of AI startups, internal training programs, and pitching impactful work to attract candidates. 
 ​
 - Recruiters say AI engineers and product managers can be very selective about roles, caring about the meaningfulness of the work.
 ​
 - Firms realize they cannot just hire their way out of the AI talent crunch. Retention and internal development will also be key.
 ​
 In summary, surging corporate AI demand against limited talent supply has created a hyper-competitive market where top AI professionals can command extreme compensation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're looking to train a custom chatbot on your data (SOPs, legal docs, financial reports, etc), I'd strongly suggest checking out AnythingLLM.
 It's the first chatbot with enterprise-grade privacy & security.
 When using ChatGPT, OpenAI collects your data including:
  
Prompts & Conversations
 Geolocation data
 Network activity information
 Commercial information e.g. transaction history
 Identifiers e.g. contact details
 Device and browser cookies
 Log data (IP address etc.)
  
However, if you use their API to interact with their LLMs like gpt-3.5 or gpt-4, your data is NOT collected. This is exactly why you should build your own private & secure chatbot. That may sound difficult, but Mintplex Labs (backed by Y-Combinator) just released AnythingLLM, which gives you the ability to build a chatbot in 10 minutes without code.
 AnythingLLM provides you with the tools to easily build and manage your own private chatbot using API keys. Plus, you can expand your chatbot’s knowledge by importing data such as PDFs, emails, etc. This can be confidential data as only you have access to the database.
 ChatGPT currently allows you to upload PDFs, videos and other data to ChatGPT via vulnerable plug-ins, BUT there is no way to determine if that data is secure or even know where it’s stored.
 Easily build your own business-compliant and secure chatbot at http://useanything.com/. All you need is an OpenAI or Azure OpenAI API key.
 Or, if you prefer using the open source code yourself, here’s the GitHub repo: https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my previous post ( Reinforcement Learning (reddit.com) ) I had a hard time understand the differences between the loss functions in Tensorboard, and thanks to the members here, after normalizing and changing the reward functions, they became clearer to me.
 I'd like first to give perspective of my custom gym environment.
  
I use PPO2 algorithm ( n_steps=512 , nminibatches=8 ) as from my understanding it means the weights will get updated within these steps instead of waiting for an episode to finish.
  
Scenario 1: use the first 5000 rows from my dataset, I get the following results:
 5k rows
 As seen, the entropy loss seems to increase which means the policy isn't learning and has a lot of randomness. However, the loss seems to decrease, but I'm not sure if I should continue training for more steps and it will converge eventually!
 Scenario 2: use the 50,000 rows from my dataset, I get the following results:
 50k rows
 As seen, the loss function goes to zero very quickly, then jump really high and return back to zero, I don't understand this behavior as the mode seems to not still learning!
 Can someone please help me understand what's happening?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/MachineLearning,
 I'm happy to show a new project I've been working on called TeaRoute (Trainable, autonomous, efficient routing). Tear is a simple tool that allows you to easily control the flow of information through LLMs via automated text classification.
 With just a few (~10) lines of code, you can set up a router that classifies text inputs and directs them to different LLM endpoints for processing. This makes it easier to build things like:
  
Chatbots that route questions to different departments
 Multi-document question answering systems
 Dynamic classification models that improve over time
  
Some of the key features of TeaRoute:
  
Classification based on embeddings for high efficiency and low cost
 Option to use LLMs for classification when needed (and add that to training corpus)
 Easy setup in around 10 lines of code
  
I've open sourced TeaRoute and documented it fully, with examples like building a movie chatbot router. You can check out the code here: https://github.com/kesile/TeaRoute. You can install it into your program with "pip install TeaRoute".
 Let me know if you end up building something cool with TeaRoute! And feel free to open issues on GitHub if you run into any problems. Let me know your thoughts!

Even the human brain is similar to some degree with different "sections" of the brain or cortexes being specialized for specific sensory input. It's always made sense to me that a quick way to come to a "good enough" AI is to train many smaller expert AIs and then train a umbrella AI that just delegates parts of the task to different experts, and organizes the output. The next step would obviously be training that umbrella AI to make it's own expert AIs in an unfamiliar supervised fashion.
 Is anyone already working on something like this? Do you think it's a worthy avenue of research?

 By "real time/live" I mean the latency should not exceed 5 seconds, ideally much less while maintaining maximum accuracy.
 My question is: how do I achieve this?
 I have been experimenting with openai's whisper but I am not sure how can I get it to work with real time audio input since the model expects 30-second segments (preferably containing full sentences).
 My main challenge is how should I segment the audio. Should I use a VAD to split on silences? (I tried this but the transcription accuracy is lower since whisper doesn't have access to context outside of each segment)
 Also another question I have is how does hugging face automated speech recognition pipeline transcribe long audio files. I tried to read the documentation but cannot figure it out.
 Thanks in advance

 The environments were released by OpenAI back in 2017 as just HTML pages. With MiniWoB++, the environments run on a browser, and an RL agent can get the environment states or execute actions via Selenium WebDriver.
 This version of MiniWoB++ contains the following features:
 * Over 100 web environments, including 2 bigger environments based on real websites and 18 previously unavailable “test set” environments. All (but 4) environments are deterministic for the given random seed.
 * Full integration with Gymnasium, a fork of OpenAI Gym, which provides a standardized API for RL.
 * A wide range of implemented browser actions including clicking, dragging, scrolling, typing, and pressing keyboard shortcuts, all of which can be customized (e.g., coordinate binning or scrolling speed).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are releasing the mature 1.0 version of MiniWoB++ (Mini World of Bits++), an RL benchmark containing over 100 web interaction environments, ranging from simple button clicks to more complex forms and web apps.
 The environments were released by OpenAI back in 2017 as just HTML pages. With MiniWoB++, the environments run on a browser, and an RL agent can get the environment states or execute actions via Selenium WebDriver.
 This version of MiniWoB++ contains the following features:
 * Over 100 web environments, including 2 bigger environments based on real websites and 18 previously unavailable “test set” environments. All (but 4) environments are deterministic for the given random seed.
 * Full integration with Gymnasium, a fork of OpenAI Gym, which provides a standardized API for RL.
 * A wide range of implemented browser actions including clicking, dragging, scrolling, typing, and pressing keyboard shortcuts, all of which can be customized (e.g., coordinate binning or scrolling speed).

 I want to share with this community a recent challenge involving machine learning that I've faced. Over the past few weeks, I've been busy creating a machine learning model. The goal? To classify news, mostly related to the energy sector, into 20 different topics. This task is a bit tricky since a news piece might fall into more than one category, so it's what's called a multi-label problem. Until now, I was doing this just using just keywords, but I wanted to move to something much better and robust.
 So basically, I started by taking 800 headlines and summaries and classifying them manually one by one into these 20 categories. After that, I began building the model in Python using scikit-learn. I tried different methods like logistic regression, random forest, SVM, etc. Af…]]></summary>

 Basically I'm trying to get an AI command center base in Halo Infinite to apply RL in order to determine which loadout to apply to a bot defending the base you're attacking. The issue I'm running into is how to preditct the Q-values for the next state.
 In my map, I decided to change from one state to the next every 5 kills per team. So when that happens the Kill/death ratio of each loadout equipped by a player is updated and used as a reward in the Q-table.
 Well that's the idea, anyway. I wanted to use player kills as a sort of benchmark to gauge performance with a given loadout but I'm afraid the state space I applied is too small and I don't know how to transition from one state to the next and obtain the maximum reward from the expected future rewards of the next state.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 Here is a ported version of Andrej Karpathy's llama2.c into pure Python with zero dependencies.
 The nice thing is llama2.py essentially captures the inference logic from the Llama2 research paper. With this port in pure Python, it's so much easier to unpack the intricate concepts originally presented in a "scientific language".
 Designed for an extensive audience, it aims to be a straightforward "reference implementation" suitable for educational purposes.The original llama2.c repository comprises two Python files intended for model training and one C file for inference.
 The goal of pure Python implementation is to bridge the existing gap by offering a clear-cut reference implementation encapsulating all transformer logic within a concise Python file, not exceeding 500 lines of code.
 Though the original Meta/Llama is written on Python, its complexity is rather high due to multiple dependencies and sophisticated optimizations implemented within. This often makes it hard to follow, particularly for those new to the field.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For context, I've been experimenting with different Reinforcement learning algorithms, frameworks etc. Currently I have a custom Gym environment with Stable baselines 3 to train a PPO agent. 
 I've noticed however that this setup is very slow for training as stable Baselines doesn't properly utilize GPU + parallel environments don't really work that well due to "step lock" where it can't continue until everything is synced up. 
 I've heard really good things about Ray/RLlib. It has more advance features + according to reports it's crazy fast for training. 
 I want to basically rewrite my existing SB3 implementation into Ray but I don't find the documentation very user-friendly + there aren't really that much good/usefull tutorials online as far is I can find. 
 I tried GPT-4 but it just regurgitates some very old Ray implementation. I even tried not using ray and trying Tensorflow again (I hate Tensorflow, I'm definitely team Pytorch 😬) 
 Do you guys have any good tutorials, videos, documentation to get started with PPO on Ray? Would love to learn more, but documentation online seems very hardcore to start even 😂.
 Would love to know your suggestions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Say, I have a method that can be used as a drop-in replacement for a part of a network in a set of relevant tasks, for example, an improved CTC loss in speech recognition and non-autoregressive translation.
 I can run a bunch of experiments, applying my method in those tasks, showing that "model A + my method" works substantially better than just "model A." "Model A" is some relatively light and simple model, like Transformer-base. It might have been near-SOTA several years ago.
 However, the results won't be near contemporary SOTA, because SOTA models tend to be heavy and complicated. In theory, the modification can apply to bigger models, but I don't have the resources to re-implement them.
 So, how do I present my work? In theory, doing the "model A" experiments should be enough to show that my modification is interesting. But in practice most of the reviewers aren't very excited when the reported numbers are far from SOTA, even if the aim is not to beat SOTA, but to present a general working approach. I know that there are many papers that do not contain any SOTA-beating in them, but still manage to be successfully published. Question: how do they do that? 
 Are there any tips and tricks? What kind of experiments/settings/datasets/models should I consider to convince the reviewers? Or at least make it harder for them to Reject-If-Not-SOTA?

 To do some performance benchmarking on my tool, I need some huge binaries to parse. Specifically, I need a binary with a lot of code (.text section in ELF) and debugging information (DWARF in ELF). I know there are lots of binaries that have a huge amount of data in them, but that doesn't help because my application just ignores that.
 Optimally, I need a binary with an on-disk size of greater than 5GB to get useful measurements, but greater than 1GB would still be good. I would also prefer being able to generate the binary from a source build so I can test it across the many architectures my tool supports.
 I have a collaborator who claims to have used my application on an 8GB TensorFlow binary. Unfortunately, that binary is on a classified system and I can't get access to it. However, that let's me know it's at least possible to make such a beast.
 Has anyone here seen such huge binaries using an ML application- it doesn't have to be TensorFlow?
 Thanks in advance!
  
Tools I have tested thus far are the computational chemistry application NWChem and the quantum mechanics Gaussian integral application libint. However, I can't get either of these to make binaries larger than about 100MB.

 I am not completely sure how to use these flags from the Gymnasium API (I've always used the Gym API so far and I'm switching just now...). Particularly in the environment, I'm playing with now:
 It's a 1vs1 game, and an episode can end if one of the 2 players dies or a max. number of steps is reached. In this case:
 - The max. number of steps is a hard limit rule of the game, so if these are reached should they receive truncated or terminated signals?
 - If a player dies, should both agents get a terminated = True, or one should get terminated=True and the other one truncated=True, as it was still alive, and could have continued playing?

 Thank you!

 "Hello everyone, I'm currently working on a Python program in which I need to use an OCR library. However, the results weren't very satisfying even though the text in the image is clear and there is no noise (just text). This is an example of the images I've used:"
 https://preview.redd.it/flmdzz9otvhb1.png?width=515&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfd8ebab6f02369a150f7b9375e0d53baa6dceee

 I tried changing the contrast, and the results seemed to improve. However, I'm wondering if there are other approaches to consider in Python. Additionally, I want to implement a cost function that takes into account both the execution time and the accuracy of the OCR. How can I do that?

 have tried to put it in config.yml, (maybe I did something wrong)
 because when I run "rasa train" and "rasa shell -with the model" I only get the standard init "how are you?"
 which is located in the domain file. I want a slightly more natural conversation than this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, r/MachineLearning, it’s Nir from DagsHub 🐶
 Our MLOps engineers have been experimenting with Kubeflow (”the MLOps version of Kubernetes”) for the past weeks to manage a training cluster on AWS.
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/dqi27ggq0vhb1.jpg?width=1194&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=945c9bcaa9987d2df135e18cf081efd9f742cf0f
 As good engineers, we wanted to kick the tires a bit before committing cloud resources to it. Unfortunately, most installation guides we found online only showed you how to spin up a Kubeflow cluster on AWS, GCP, or Azure. We had a hard time finding clear instructions for installing it locally.
 A local installation would allow individuals to play around with it, experiment, and learn from it.
 So we started looking into it.
 We followed this thread until we successfully ran Kubeflow on a local machine. Since it wasn’t a super clear or easy process to figure out, we’ve written a blog post on how we did it and decided to share our insights with the ML community.
 You can find the blog here: https://dagshub.com/blog/how-to-install-kubeflow-locally
 We also have a follow-up blog that explains how to deploy a Kubeflow cluster on AWS, so if you have any insights or requests for further information - we’d love to hear from you!

 Aug X released Augie, an AI-powered video creation platform incorporating a voice cloning feature to read ad copy without booking a recording studio.[2]
 Virtualitics, Inc., an artificial intelligence and data exploration company, today announced that it has raised $37 million in a Series C financing round led by Smith Point Capital, LLC with participation from Citi and advisory clients of The Hillman Company, among other investors.[3]
 AI-driven analytics platform Rasgo has announced the launch of Rasgo AI, a self-service analytics solution that integrates a GPT into enterprise data warehouse environments. The company said that with Rasgo AI, organizations can use the power of AI/GPT to accelerate insights and optimize recommended actions securely and efficiently.[4]

My pixel game needs sprites, but I know practically nothing about drawing sprites, and if on the one hand I can still draw something, then 4 directional (front, back, left, right) turn out badly, and you also need to add animation to them. Knowing that there are a lot of neural networks and for almost every task, I decided to find a neural network that will solve my problem, but I couldn't. Therefore, I ask if you know a neural network that can solve my problem. Thank you in advance.

According to AAAI policy, all author names must be added at the time of abstract registration, and the list of names as well as the order in which they appear cannot be changed after August 15."
 I fell a little confusing that it says "the list of names ... cannot be changed after August 15", but also mentioned that "Authors must enter the names of ALL AUTHORS at the time of registration (by abstract deadline)".

 My first step is to train a model on my computer with generated images and see how well this works in general and then later capture real images. To give you an idea of what I am looking for, I added a screenshot of the images I am currently generating.
 https://ibb.co/fFtRj1Q
 For this example image, I expect 35, 75, 137 degree as a result.
 What kind of network would you recommend for this task? Please keep in mind that it shouldn't be too fancy to still fit into a microcontroller via TensorFlow Lite.

 Thank you so much for any recommendations

 I am looking to fine-tune a Llama 2 (the 7B and 70B to see if there is a big difference), and I am looking at the different Cloud options for GPUs.
 There are of course the big cloud providers like AWS, and the smaller ones like Paperspace and co.
 I am trying to benchmark each in terms of price, ease of use, quick availability of GPUs, and feature-richness.
 Could you share the insights on big vs small cloud providers when training a LLM? If you have other criteria to make a decision I would be interested too!
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm new to machine learning and have a question regarding object detection. Here's the scenario:
 I have an image, let's call it image 1, where a person is captured from the front. This allows me to see the person's face, clothes, shoes, and basically their entire front view.
 I have another image, image 2, taken from a different angle or perspective (e.g., their back view). In this image, I might be able to see the entire person or just a part of them.
 The challenge I'm facing is: Can I predict if the person in image 1 is present in image 2? If this is possible, I'd appreciate any guidance on how to approach this problem:
  
What methodologies or algorithms should I consider?
 What kind of datasets might be useful for this task?
 Any resources, tools, or tutorials that can help me get started?
  
Thank you in advance for any insights or guidance you can provide!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So basically what I need to do is build a chatbot that is able to identify user intents and 
 1) if the user is seeking information then perform semantic search to generate a response 
 2) if the user is seeking to perform some action (say, schedule an appointment) then collate all the information and push it to a database for appointments
 How do I build the chatbot such that it can identify different intents and either do 1) or 2)? What tools/technologies can I use?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently made a proposed code change to allow Hugging Face's TextClassificationPipeline to take advantage of the sliding window-style text truncation provided by using the stride parameter, and taking a mean of output logits across all windows. Hugging Face has already implemented this for the TokenClassificationPipeline.
 E.g. if you want to use a Hugging Face-compatible model to run sentiment analysis on text, this would allow easily running that model on texts longer than the model's config.max_position_embeddings.
 If you support integrating this functionality into the "transformers" library, give a thumbs-up react to this comment on the relevant issue.

If the goal is to minimize validation loss as quickly as possible, isn't this tradeoff worth it?

If you’re not impressed by this test it’s because it’s showing mostly DaVinci demonstrating variables like order of shapes and yes and no affecting it in a way that wonder was not in the video I posted earlier. I have hours of footage with wonder I just started experimenting with DaVinci…with DaVinci it doesn’t feel like there is a ghost in the machine. Though if there is with Wonder it’s world model seems very narrow. I want to do more tests with DaVinci or try to figure out a concept that if an image generator was able to form a world model, a concept that might be likely to emerge across multiple models. Chances are it’s just other variables giving this affect but why not test and see if there is something to discover

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Historically, the most practical methods for solving real-world combinatorial scheduling problems have been using heuristics or metaheurisics such as simulated annealing, tabu search, greedy randomized adaptive search, etc... I consider these more operation research-based techniques. 
 However, recently we have obviously seen a lot of progress being made in the machine learning realm for many types of problems. In particular, we've seen neural networks be used to train models based on data in text, audio, or video form. 
 I am wondering if we have any idea what the scientific consensus is toward applying these same sort of methods for scheduling problems. Suppose we have a history of schedules that we could train a model on. A schedule isn't really text, audio, or video so I don't understand how one could embed the information in a vector space in the same way that would accurately represent the information (specifically, constraints so that the resulting schedule is still feasible) Is there anyone doing research in this particular area?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nucleus image segmentation is a crucial step in the analysis, pathological
diagnosis, and classification, which heavily relies on the quality of nucleus
segmentation. However, the complexity of issues such as variations in nucleus
size, blurred nucleus contours, uneven staining, cell clustering, and
overlapping cells poses significant challenges. Current methods for nucleus
segmentation primarily rely on nuclear morphology or contour-based approaches.
Nuclear morphology-based methods exhibit limited generalization ability and
struggle to effectively predict irregular-shaped nuclei, while contour-based
extraction methods face challenges in accurately segmenting overlapping nuclei.
To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a dual-branch network using
hybrid attention based residual U-blocks for nucleus instance segmentation. The
network simultaneously predicts target information and target contours.
Additionally, we introduce a post-processing method that combines the target
information and target contours to distinguish overlapping nuclei and generate
an instance segmentation image. Within the network, we propose a context fusion
block (CF-block) that effectively extracts and merges contextual information
from the network. Extensive quantitative evaluations are conducted to assess
the performance of our method. Experimental results demonstrate the superior
performance of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art approaches on
the BNS, MoNuSeg, CoNSeg, and CPM-17 datasets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lesion segmentation of ultrasound medical images based on deep learning
techniques is a widely used method for diagnosing diseases. Although there is a
large amount of ultrasound image data in medical centers and other places,
labeled ultrasound datasets are a scarce resource, and it is likely that no
datasets are available for new tissues/organs. Transfer learning provides the
possibility to solve this problem, but there are too many features in natural
images that are not related to the target domain. As a source domain, redundant
features that are not conducive to the task will be extracted. Migration
between ultrasound images can avoid this problem, but there are few types of
public datasets, and it is difficult to find sufficiently similar source
domains. Compared with natural images, ultrasound images have less information,
and there are fewer transferable features between different ultrasound images,
which may cause negative transfer. To this end, a multi-source adversarial
transfer learning network for ultrasound image segmentation is proposed.
Specifically, to address the lack of annotations, the idea of adversarial
transfer learning is used to adaptively extract common features between a
certain pair of source and target domains, which provides the possibility to
utilize unlabeled ultrasound data. To alleviate the lack of knowledge in a
single source domain, multi-source transfer learning is adopted to fuse
knowledge from multiple source domains. In order to ensure the effectiveness of
the fusion and maximize the use of precious data, a multi-source domain
independent strategy is also proposed to improve the estimation of the target
domain data distribution, which further increases the learning ability of the
multi-source adversarial migration learning network in multiple domains.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper asks whether current self-supervised learning methods, if
sufficiently scaled up, would be able to reach human-level visual object
recognition capabilities with the same type and amount of visual experience
humans learn from. Previous work on this question only considered the scaling
of data size. Here, we consider the simultaneous scaling of data size, model
size, and image resolution. We perform a scaling experiment with vision
transformers up to 633M parameters in size (ViT-H/14) trained with up to 5K
hours of human-like video data (long, continuous, mostly egocentric videos)
with image resolutions of up to 476x476 pixels. The efficiency of masked
autoencoders (MAEs) as a self-supervised learning algorithm makes it possible
to run this scaling experiment on an unassuming academic budget. We find that
it is feasible to reach human-level object recognition capacity at sub-human
scales of model size, data size, and image size, if these factors are scaled up
simultaneously. To give a concrete example, we estimate that a 2.5B parameter
ViT model trained with 20K hours (2.3 years) of human-like video data with a
spatial resolution of 952x952 pixels should be able to reach roughly
human-level accuracy on ImageNet. Human-level competence is thus achievable for
a fundamental perceptual capability from human-like perceptual experience
(human-like in both amount and type) with extremely generic learning algorithms

telescopes, automated pipelines and machine learning techniques have become
crucial for analyzing and extracting knowledge from these datasets. Anomaly
detection, i.e. the task of identifying irregular or unexpected patterns in the
data, is a complex challenge in astronomy. In this paper, we propose
Multi-Class Deep Support Vector Data Description (MCDSVDD), an extension of the
state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithm One-Class Deep SVDD, specifically
designed to handle different inlier categories with distinct data
distributions. MCDSVDD uses a neural network to map the data into hyperspheres,
where each hypersphere represents a specific inlier category. The distance of
each sample from the centers of these hyperspheres determines the anomaly
score. We evaluate the effectiveness of MCDSVDD by comparing its performance
with several anomaly detection algorithms on a large dataset of astronomical
light-curves obtained from the Zwicky Transient Facility. Our results
demonstrate the efficacy of MCDSVDD in detecting anomalous sources while
leveraging the presence of different inlier categories. The code and the data
needed to reproduce our results are publicly available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unsupervised domain adaptation (DA) with the aid of pseudo labeling
techniques has emerged as a crucial approach for domain-adaptive 3D object
detection. While effective, existing DA methods suffer from a substantial drop
in performance when applied to a multi-class training setting, due to the
co-existence of low-quality pseudo labels and class imbalance issues. In this
paper, we address this challenge by proposing a novel ReDB framework tailored
for learning to detect all classes at once. Our approach produces Reliable,
Diverse, and class-Balanced pseudo 3D boxes to iteratively guide the
self-training on a distributionally different target domain. To alleviate
disruptions caused by the environmental discrepancy (e.g., beam numbers), the
proposed cross-domain examination (CDE) assesses the correctness of pseudo
labels by copy-pasting target instances into a source environment and measuring
the prediction consistency. To reduce computational overhead and mitigate the
object shift (e.g., scales and point densities), we design an overlapped boxes
counting (OBC) metric that allows to uniformly downsample pseudo-labeled
objects across different geometric characteristics. To confront the issue of
inter-class imbalance, we progressively augment the target point clouds with a
class-balanced set of pseudo-labeled target instances and source objects, which
boosts recognition accuracies on both frequently appearing and rare classes.
Experimental results on three benchmark datasets using both voxel-based (i.e.,
SECOND) and point-based 3D detectors (i.e., PointRCNN) demonstrate that our
proposed ReDB approach outperforms existing 3D domain adaptation methods by a
large margin, improving 23.15% mAP on the nuScenes $\rightarrow$ KITTI task.

the pace of materials discovery. Although instruments for autonomous synthesis
have become popular in molecular and polymer science, solution processing of
hybrid materials and nanoparticles, examples of autonomous tools for physical
vapor deposition are scarce yet important for the semiconductor industry. Here,
we report the design and implementation of an autonomous workflow for sputter
deposition of thin films with controlled composition, leveraging a highly
automated sputtering reactor custom-controlled by Python, optical emission
spectroscopy (OES), and a Bayesian optimization algorithm. We modeled film
composition, measured by x-ray fluorescence, as a linear function of emission
lines monitored during the co-sputtering from elemental Zn and Ti targets in
N$_2$ atmosphere. A Bayesian control algorithm, informed by OES, navigates the
space of sputtering power to fabricate films with user-defined composition, by
minimizing the absolute error between desired and measured emission signals. We
validated our approach by autonomously fabricating Zn$_x$Ti$_{1-x}$N$_y$ films
with deviations from the targeted cation composition within relative 3.5 %,
even for 15 nm thin films, demonstrating that the proposed approach can
reliably synthesize thin films with specific composition and minimal human
interference. Moreover, the proposed method can be extended to more difficult
synthesis experiments where plasma intensity depends non-linearly on pressure,
or the elemental sticking coefficients strongly depend on the substrate

heavily on prompt design, with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and self-consistency
being critical methods that enhance this ability. However, these methods do not
fully exploit the answers generated by the LLM to guide subsequent responses.
This paper proposes a new prompting method, named Progressive-Hint Prompting
(PHP), that enables automatic multiple interactions between users and LLMs by
using previously generated answers as hints to progressively guide toward the
correct answers. PHP is orthogonal to CoT and self-consistency, making it easy
to combine with state-of-the-art techniques to further improve performance. We
conducted extensive and comprehensive experiments on seven benchmarks. The
results show that PHP significantly improves accuracy while remaining highly
efficient. For instance, with text-davinci-003, we observed a 4.2% improvement
on GSM8K with greedy decoding compared to Complex CoT, and a 46.17% reduction
in sample paths with self-consistency. With GPT-4 and PHP, we achieve
state-of-the-art performances on SVAMP (89.1% -> 91.9%), GSM8K (92% -> 95.5%),

structures are employed to drive user engagement. This paper focuses on
promotions with response-dependent costs, where expenses are incurred only when
a purchase is made. Such promotions include discounts and coupons. While
existing uplift model approaches aim to address this challenge, these
approaches often necessitate training multiple models, like meta-learners, or
encounter complications when estimating profit due to zero-inflated values
stemming from non-converted individuals with zero cost and profit.

To address these challenges, we introduce Incremental Profit per Conversion
(IPC), a novel uplift measure of promotional campaigns' efficiency in unit
economics. Through a proposed response transformation, we demonstrate that IPC
requires only converted data, its propensity, and a single model to be
estimated. As a result, IPC resolves the issues mentioned above while
mitigating the noise typically associated with the class imbalance in
conversion datasets and biases arising from the many-to-one mapping between

and it becomes crucial to comprehend the parsimonious patterns that exist
within them as they grow in scale. With exploding parameter counts, Lottery
Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) and its variants, have lost their pragmatism in
sparsifying them due to high computation and memory bottleneck of repetitive
train-prune-retrain routine of iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) which worsens
with increasing model size. This paper comprehensively studies induced sparse
patterns across multiple large pre-trained vision and language transformers. We
propose the existence of -- essential sparsity defined with a sharp dropping
point beyond which the performance declines much faster w.r.t the rise of
sparsity level, when we directly remove weights with the smallest magnitudes in
one-shot without re-training. We also find essential sparsity to hold valid for
N:M sparsity patterns as well as on modern-scale large language models
(Vicuna-7B). We also present an intriguing emerging phenomenon of abrupt
sparsification during the pre-training of BERT, i.e., BERT suddenly becomes
heavily sparse in pre-training after certain iterations. Moreover, our
observations also indicate a counter-intuitive finding that BERT trained with a
larger amount of pre-training data tends to have a better ability to condense
knowledge in comparatively relatively fewer parameters. Lastly, we investigate
the effect of the pre-training loss on essential sparsity and discover that
self-supervised learning (SSL) objectives trigger stronger emergent
sparsification properties than supervised learning (SL). Our codes are

defense, we apply symmetry to the image and use the classification label of the
symmetric image. To classify an image when adversaries are aware of the
defense, we use mirror symmetry and pixel inversion symmetry to form a symmetry
group. We apply all the group symmetries to the image and decide on the output
label based on the agreement of any two of the classification labels of the
symmetry images. Adaptive attacks fail because they need to rely on loss
functions that use conflicting CNN output values for symmetric images. Without
attack knowledge, the proposed symmetry defense succeeds against both
gradient-based and random-search attacks, with up to near-default accuracies
for ImageNet. The defense even improves the classification accuracy of original
images.]]></summary>

products on their own, being able to see other customers' text and image
reviews of the product is critical while making purchase decisions. Given the
high reliance on these reviews, over the years we have observed customers
proactively sharing their reviews. With an increase in the coverage of User
Generated Content (UGC), there has been a corresponding increase in the number
of customer images. It is thus imperative to display the most relevant images
on top as it may influence users' online shopping choices and behavior. In this
paper, we propose a simple yet effective training procedure for ranking
customer images. We created a dataset consisting of Myntra (A Major Indian
Fashion e-commerce company) studio posts and highly engaged (upvotes/downvotes)
UGC images as our starting point and used selected distortion techniques on the
images of the above dataset to bring their quality at par with those of bad UGC
images. We train our network to rank bad-quality images lower than high-quality
ones. Our proposed method outperforms the baseline models on two metrics,
namely correlation coefficient, and accuracy, by substantial margins.]]></summary>

success in reducing maintenance costs and downtime of complicated machines
while increasing overall productivity through extensive utilization of
Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Deep Learning (DL). Unfortunately, IoT sensors and
DL algorithms are both prone to cyber-attacks. For instance, DL algorithms are
known for their susceptibility to adversarial examples. Such adversarial
attacks are vastly under-explored in the PdM domain. This is because the
adversarial attacks in the computer vision domain for classification tasks
cannot be directly applied to the PdM domain for multivariate time series (MTS)
regression tasks. In this work, we propose an end-to-end methodology to design
adversarially robust PdM systems by extensively analyzing the effect of
different types of adversarial attacks and proposing a novel adversarial
defense technique for DL-enabled PdM models. First, we propose novel MTS
Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) and MTS PGD with random restarts (PGD_r)
attacks. Then, we evaluate the impact of MTS PGD and PGD_r along with MTS Fast
Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and MTS Basic Iterative Method (BIM) on Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN), and Bi-directional LSTM based PdM system. Our results using
NASA's turbofan engine dataset show that adversarial attacks can cause a severe
defect (up to 11X) in the RUL prediction, outperforming the effectiveness of
the state-of-the-art PdM attacks by 3X. Furthermore, we present a novel
approximate adversarial training method to defend against adversarial attacks.
We observe that approximate adversarial training can significantly improve the
robustness of PdM models (up to 54X) and outperforms the state-of-the-art PdM
defense methods by offering 3X more robustness.]]></summary>

can dynamically weigh the contribution of various spatial scales. The proposed
model achieves high accuracy in both eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions,
indicating the stability of learned representations. Finally, we demonstrate

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here, we show that the InfoNCE objective is equivalent to the ELBO in a new
class of probabilistic generative model, the recognition parameterised model
(RPM). When we learn the optimal prior, the RPM ELBO becomes equal to the
mutual information (MI; up to a constant), establishing a connection to
pre-existing self-supervised learning methods such as InfoNCE. However,
practical InfoNCE methods do not use the MI as an objective; the MI is
invariant to arbitrary invertible transformations, so using an MI objective can
lead to highly entangled representations (Tschannen et al., 2019). Instead, the
actual InfoNCE objective is a simplified lower bound on the MI which is loose
even in the infinite sample limit. Thus, an objective that works (i.e. the
actual InfoNCE objective) appears to be motivated as a loose bound on an
objective that does not work (i.e. the true MI which gives arbitrarily
entangled representations). We give an alternative motivation for the actual
InfoNCE objective. In particular, we show that in the infinite sample limit,
and for a particular choice of prior, the actual InfoNCE objective is equal to
the ELBO (up to a constant); and the ELBO is equal to the marginal likelihood
with a deterministic recognition model. Thus, we argue that our VAE perspective
gives a better motivation for InfoNCE than MI, as the actual InfoNCE objective
is only loosely bounded by the MI, but is equal to the ELBO/marginal likelihood
(up to a constant).]]></summary>

However, little work has been done in adapting uncertainty estimation
techniques and validation metrics for precision medicine. In this paper, we use
Bayesian deep learning for estimating the posterior distribution over factual

the uncertainty for each treatment option and for the individual treatment
effects (ITE) between any two treatments. We train and evaluate this model to
predict future new and enlarging T2 lesion counts on a large, multi-center
dataset of MR brain images of patients with multiple sclerosis, exposed to
several treatments during randomized controlled trials. We evaluate the
correlation of the uncertainty estimate with the factual error, and, given the
lack of ground truth counterfactual outcomes, demonstrate how uncertainty for
the ITE prediction relates to bounds on the ITE error. Lastly, we demonstrate
how knowledge of uncertainty could modify clinical decision-making to improve

diverse and high-performing solutions to a given problem. Originally developed
for evolutionary robotics, most QD studies are conducted on a limited set of
domains - mainly applied to locomotion, where the fitness and the behavior
signal are dense. Grasping is a crucial task for manipulation in robotics.
Despite the efforts of many research communities, this task is yet to be
solved. Grasping cumulates unprecedented challenges in QD literature: it
suffers from reward sparsity, behavioral sparsity, and behavior space
misalignment. The present work studies how QD can address grasping. Experiments
have been conducted on 15 different methods on 10 grasping domains,
corresponding to 2 different robot-gripper setups and 5 standard objects. An
evaluation framework that distinguishes the evaluation of an algorithm from its
internal components has also been proposed for a fair comparison. The obtained
results show that MAP-Elites variants that select successful solutions in
priority outperform all the compared methods on the studied metrics by a large
margin. We also found experimental evidence that sparse interaction can lead to
deceptive novelty. To our knowledge, the ability to efficiently produce
examples of grasping trajectories demonstrated in this work has no precedent in

unfortunately can not be applied to problems with undefined or zero gradients.
To circumvent this issue, the loss function can be manually replaced by a
"surrogate" that has similar minima but is differentiable. Our proposed
framework, ZeroGrads, automates this process by learning a neural approximation
of the objective function, the surrogate, which in turn can be used to
differentiate through arbitrary black-box graphics pipelines. We train the
surrogate on an actively smoothed version of the objective and encourage
locality, focusing the surrogate's capacity on what matters at the current
training episode. The fitting is performed online, alongside the parameter
optimization, and self-supervised, without pre-computed data or pre-trained
models. As sampling the objective is expensive (it requires a full rendering or
simulator run), we devise an efficient sampling scheme that allows for
tractable run-times and competitive performance at little overhead. We
demonstrate optimizing diverse non-convex, non-differentiable black-box
problems in graphics, such as visibility in rendering, discrete parameter
spaces in procedural modelling or optimal control in physics-driven animation.
In contrast to more traditional algorithms, our approach scales well to higher

tasks, but their computation-intensive nature demands faster and more
energy-efficient hardware implementations. Optics-based platforms, using
technologies such as silicon photonics and spatial light modulators, offer
promising avenues for achieving this goal. However, training multiple trainable
layers in tandem with these physical systems poses challenges, as they are
difficult to fully characterize and describe with differentiable functions,
hindering the use of error backpropagation algorithm. The recently introduced
Forward-Forward Algorithm (FFA) eliminates the need for perfect
characterization of the learning system and shows promise for efficient
training with large numbers of programmable parameters. The FFA does not
require backpropagating an error signal to update the weights, rather the
weights are updated by only sending information in one direction. The local
loss function for each set of trainable weights enables low-power analog
hardware implementations without resorting to metaheuristic algorithms or
reinforcement learning. In this paper, we present an experiment utilizing
multimode nonlinear wave propagation in an optical fiber demonstrating the
feasibility of the FFA approach using an optical system. The results show that
incorporating optical transforms in multilayer NN architectures trained with

on financial temporal tabular datasets which is built upon the incremental use
of commonly available tabular and time series prediction models to adapt to
distributional shifts typical of financial datasets. The framework uses a
simple basic building block (decision trees) to build self-similar models of
any required complexity to deliver robust performance under adverse situations
such as regime changes, fat-tailed distributions, and low signal-to-noise
ratios. As a detailed study, we demonstrate our scheme using XGBoost models
trained on the Numerai dataset and show that a two layer deep ensemble of
XGBoost models over different model snapshots delivers high quality predictions
under different market regimes. We also show that the performance of XGBoost
models with different number of boosting rounds in three scenarios (small,
standard and large) is monotonically increasing with respect to model size and
converges towards the generalisation upper bound. We also evaluate the
robustness of the model under variability of different hyperparameters, such as
model complexity and data sampling settings. Our model has low hardware
requirements as no specialised neural architectures are used and each base
model can be independently trained in parallel.]]></summary>

Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm for heterogeneous
high-performance-computing (HPC) systems. The proposed implementation is based
on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract
latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding
support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems.
The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory (OOM) problems where the
memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU
memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse
and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or
tensor cores when available). Input/Output (I/O) latency associated with batch
copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data
transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective
communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized
NVIDIA Collective Communication Library NCCL based communicators. Benchmark
results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new
implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk. Good weak scaling was
demonstrated on up to 4096 multi-GPU cluster nodes with approximately 25,000
GPUs when decomposing a dense 340 Terabyte-size matrix and an 11 Exabyte-size

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Node classification is the task of predicting the labels of unlabeled nodes
in a graph. State-of-the-art methods based on graph neural networks achieve
excellent performance when all labels are available during training. But in
real-life, models are often applied on data with new classes, which can lead to
massive misclassification and thus significantly degrade performance. Hence,
developing open-set classification methods is crucial to determine if a given
sample belongs to a known class. Existing methods for open-set node
classification generally use transductive learning with part or all of the
features of real unseen class nodes to help with open-set classification. In
this paper, we propose a novel generative open-set node classification method,
i.e. $\mathcal{G}^2Pxy$, which follows a stricter inductive learning setting
where no information about unknown classes is available during training and
validation. Two kinds of proxy unknown nodes, inter-class unknown proxies and
external unknown proxies are generated via mixup to efficiently anticipate the
distribution of novel classes. Using the generated proxies, a closed-set
classifier can be transformed into an open-set one, by augmenting it with an
extra proxy classifier. Under the constraints of both cross entropy loss and
complement entropy loss, $\mathcal{G}^2Pxy$ achieves superior effectiveness for
unknown class detection and known class classification, which is validated by
experiments on benchmark graph datasets. Moreover, $\mathcal{G}^2Pxy$ does not
have specific requirement on the GNN architecture and shows good
generalizations.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Automated medical report generation has become increasingly important in
medical analysis. It can produce computer-aided diagnosis descriptions and thus
significantly alleviate the doctors' work. Inspired by the huge success of
neural machine translation and image captioning, various deep learning methods
have been proposed for medical report generation. However, due to the inherent
properties of medical data, including data imbalance and the length and
correlation between report sequences, the generated reports by existing methods
may exhibit linguistic fluency but lack adequate clinical accuracy. In this
work, we propose an image-to-indicator hierarchical transformer (IIHT)
framework for medical report generation. It consists of three modules, i.e., a
classifier module, an indicator expansion module and a generator module. The
classifier module first extracts image features from the input medical images
and produces disease-related indicators with their corresponding states. The
disease-related indicators are subsequently utilised as input for the indicator
expansion module, incorporating the "data-text-data" strategy. The
transformer-based generator then leverages these extracted features along with
image features as auxiliary information to generate final reports. Furthermore,
the proposed IIHT method is feasible for radiologists to modify disease
indicators in real-world scenarios and integrate the operations into the
indicator expansion module for fluent and accurate medical report generation.
Extensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods under
various evaluation metrics demonstrate the great performance of the proposed
method.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ensuring alignment, which refers to making models behave in accordance with
human intentions [1,2], has become a critical task before deploying large
language models (LLMs) in real-world applications. For instance, OpenAI devoted
six months to iteratively aligning GPT-4 before its release [3]. However, a
major challenge faced by practitioners is the lack of clear guidance on
evaluating whether LLM outputs align with social norms, values, and
regulations. This obstacle hinders systematic iteration and deployment of LLMs.
To address this issue, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of key
dimensions that are crucial to consider when assessing LLM trustworthiness. The
survey covers seven major categories of LLM trustworthiness: reliability,
safety, fairness, resistance to misuse, explainability and reasoning, adherence
to social norms, and robustness. Each major category is further divided into
several sub-categories, resulting in a total of 29 sub-categories.
Additionally, a subset of 8 sub-categories is selected for further
investigation, where corresponding measurement studies are designed and
conducted on several widely-used LLMs. The measurement results indicate that,
in general, more aligned models tend to perform better in terms of overall
trustworthiness. However, the effectiveness of alignment varies across the
different trustworthiness categories considered. This highlights the importance
of conducting more fine-grained analyses, testing, and making continuous
improvements on LLM alignment. By shedding light on these key dimensions of LLM
trustworthiness, this paper aims to provide valuable insights and guidance to
practitioners in the field. Understanding and addressing these concerns will be
crucial in achieving reliable and ethically sound deployment of LLMs in various
applications.]]></summary>

interpreted as critical points. We generalize the notion of critical points
into importance measures. We show that training a classification network based
only on less important points dramatically improves robustness, at a cost of
minor performance loss on the clean set. We observe that normalized entropy is
highly informative for corruption analysis. An adaptive threshold based on
normalized entropy is suggested for selecting the set of uncritical points. Our
proposed importance measure is extremely fast to compute. We show it can be

input-level fusion, but other - more advanced - fusion strategies may

processing that aims to identify deceptive or fraudulent content. This study
presents a comparative analysis of machine learning and transformer-based
approaches for deceptive text classification. We investigate the effectiveness
of traditional machine learning algorithms and state-of-the-art transformer
models, such as BERT, XLNET, DistilBERT, and RoBERTa, in detecting deceptive
text. A labeled dataset consisting of deceptive and non-deceptive texts is used
for training and evaluation purposes. Through extensive experimentation, we
compare the performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1

strengths and limitations of machine learning and transformer-based methods for
deceptive text classification, enabling researchers and practitioners to make

risk detection applications. They explore rich semantic representations and are
supposed to automatically discover risk behaviors. However, due to the lack of
transparency, the behavioral semantics cannot be conveyed to downstream
security experts to reduce their heavy workload in security analysis. Although
feature attribution (FA) methods can be used to explain deep learning, the
underlying classifier is still blind to what behavior is suspicious, and the
generated explanation cannot adapt to downstream tasks, incurring poor
explanation fidelity and intelligibility. In this paper, we propose FINER, the
first framework for risk detection classifiers to generate high-fidelity and
high-intelligibility explanations. The high-level idea is to gather explanation
efforts from model developer, FA designer, and security experts. To improve
fidelity, we fine-tune the classifier with an explanation-guided multi-task
learning strategy. To improve intelligibility, we engage task knowledge to
adjust and ensemble FA methods. Extensive evaluations show that FINER improves
explanation quality for risk detection. Moreover, we demonstrate that FINER
outperforms a state-of-the-art tool in facilitating malware analysis.]]></summary>

information received from the perception module influences core driving
decisions. An outstanding challenge in real-time perception for autonomous
driving lies in finding the best trade-off between detection quality and
latency. Major constraints on both computation and power have to be taken into
account for real-time perception in autonomous vehicles. Larger object
detection models tend to produce the best results, but are also slower at
runtime. Since the most accurate detectors cannot run in real-time locally, we
investigate the possibility of offloading computation to edge and cloud
platforms, which are less resource-constrained. We create a synthetic dataset
to train object detection models and evaluate different offloading strategies.
Using real hardware and network simulations, we compare different trade-offs
between prediction quality and end-to-end delay. Since sending raw frames over
the network implies additional transmission delays, we also explore the use of
JPEG and H.265 compression at varying qualities and measure their impact on
prediction metrics. We show that models with adequate compression can be run in
real-time on the cloud while outperforming local detection performance.]]></summary>

optimize for a 3D surface mesh by representing it as the isosurface of a scalar
field, an increasingly common paradigm in applications including
photogrammetry, generative modeling, and inverse physics. Existing
implementations adapt classic isosurface extraction algorithms like Marching
Cubes or Dual Contouring; these techniques were designed to extract meshes from
fixed, known fields, and in the optimization setting they lack the degrees of
freedom to represent high-quality feature-preserving meshes, or suffer from
numerical instabilities. We introduce FlexiCubes, an isosurface representation
specifically designed for optimizing an unknown mesh with respect to geometric,
visual, or even physical objectives. Our main insight is to introduce
additional carefully-chosen parameters into the representation, which allow
local flexible adjustments to the extracted mesh geometry and connectivity.
These parameters are updated along with the underlying scalar field via
automatic differentiation when optimizing for a downstream task. We base our
extraction scheme on Dual Marching Cubes for improved topological properties,
and present extensions to optionally generate tetrahedral and
hierarchically-adaptive meshes. Extensive experiments validate FlexiCubes on
both synthetic benchmarks and real-world applications, showing that it offers

machine learning, promising several orders of magnitude enhancement in both
computational speed and energy efficiency. However, to reach the full capacity
of an optical neural network it is necessary that the computing not only for
the inference, but also for the training be implemented optically. The primary
algorithm for training a neural network is backpropagation, in which the
calculation is performed in the order opposite to the information flow for
inference. While straightforward in a digital computer, optical implementation
of backpropagation has so far remained elusive, particularly because of the
conflicting requirements for the optical element that implements the nonlinear
activation function. In this work, we address this challenge for the first time
with a surprisingly simple and generic scheme. Saturable absorbers are employed
for the role of the activation units, and the required properties are achieved
through a pump-probe process, in which the forward propagating signal acts as
the pump and backward as the probe. Our approach is adaptable to various analog
platforms, materials, and network structures, and it demonstrates the
possibility of constructing neural networks entirely reliant on analog optical

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graph clustering is a fundamental task in graph analysis, and recent advances
in utilizing graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown impressive results.
Despite the success of existing GNN-based graph clustering methods, they often
overlook the quality of graph structure, which is inherent in real-world graphs
due to their sparse and multifarious nature, leading to subpar performance.
Graph structure learning allows refining the input graph by adding missing
links and removing spurious connections. However, previous endeavors in graph
structure learning have predominantly centered around supervised settings, and
cannot be directly applied to our specific clustering tasks due to the absence
of ground-truth labels. To bridge the gap, we propose a novel method called
\textbf{ho}mophily-enhanced structure \textbf{le}arning for graph clustering
(HoLe). Our motivation stems from the observation that subtly enhancing the
degree of homophily within the graph structure can significantly improve GNNs
and clustering outcomes. To realize this objective, we develop two
clustering-oriented structure learning modules, i.e., hierarchical correlation
estimation and cluster-aware sparsification. The former module enables a more
accurate estimation of pairwise node relationships by leveraging guidance from
latent and clustering spaces, while the latter one generates a sparsified
structure based on the similarity matrix and clustering assignments.
Additionally, we devise a joint optimization approach alternating between
training the homophily-enhanced structure learning and GNN-based clustering,
thereby enforcing their reciprocal effects. Extensive experiments on seven
benchmark datasets of various types and scales, across a range of clustering
metrics, demonstrate the superiority of HoLe against state-of-the-art

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, methods for skeleton-based human activity recognition have been
shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, these attack methods
require either the full knowledge of the victim (i.e. white-box attacks),
access to training data (i.e. transfer-based attacks) or frequent model queries
(i.e. black-box attacks). All their requirements are highly restrictive,
raising the question of how detrimental the vulnerability is. In this paper, we
show that the vulnerability indeed exists. To this end, we consider a new
attack task: the attacker has no access to the victim model or the training
data or labels, where we coin the term hard no-box attack. Specifically, we
first learn a motion manifold where we define an adversarial loss to compute a
new gradient for the attack, named skeleton-motion-informed (SMI) gradient. Our
gradient contains information of the motion dynamics, which is different from
existing gradient-based attack methods that compute the loss gradient assuming
each dimension in the data is independent. The SMI gradient can augment many
gradient-based attack methods, leading to a new family of no-box attack
methods. Extensive evaluation and comparison show that our method imposes a
real threat to existing classifiers. They also show that the SMI gradient
improves the transferability and imperceptibility of adversarial samples in
both no-box and transfer-based black-box settings.]]></summary>

freight mobility. Besides the enormous challenge of perception, i.e. accurately
perceiving the environment using available sensor data, automated driving
comprises planning a safe, comfortable, and efficient motion trajectory. To
promote safety and progress, many works rely on modules that predict the future
motion of surrounding traffic. Modular automated driving systems commonly
handle prediction and planning as sequential separate tasks. While this
accounts for the influence of surrounding traffic on the ego-vehicle, it fails
to anticipate the reactions of traffic participants to the ego-vehicle's
behavior. Recent works suggest that integrating prediction and planning in an
interdependent joint step is necessary to achieve safe, efficient, and
comfortable driving. While various models implement such integrated systems, a
comprehensive overview and theoretical understanding of different principles
are lacking. We systematically review state-of-the-art deep learning-based
prediction, planning, and integrated prediction and planning models. Different
facets of the integration ranging from model architecture and model design to
behavioral aspects are considered and related to each other. Moreover, we
discuss the implications, strengths, and limitations of different integration
methods. By pointing out research gaps, describing relevant future challenges,
and highlighting trends in the research field, we identify promising directions

significant demand for the diversity of traversable environments and the
quantity of supervision for training generalizable agents. To tackle the common
data scarcity issue in existing vision-and-language navigation datasets, we
propose an effective paradigm for generating large-scale data for learning,
which applies 1200+ photo-realistic environments from HM3D and Gibson datasets
and synthesizes 4.9 million instruction trajectory pairs using fully-accessible
resources on the web. Importantly, we investigate the influence of each
component in this paradigm on the agent's performance and study how to
adequately apply the augmented data to pre-train and fine-tune an agent. Thanks
to our large-scale dataset, the performance of an existing agent can be pushed
up (+11% absolute with regard to previous SoTA) to a significantly new best of
80% single-run success rate on the R2R test split by simple imitation learning.
The long-lasting generalization gap between navigating in seen and unseen
environments is also reduced to less than 1% (versus 8% in the previous best
method). Moreover, our paradigm also facilitates different models to achieve
new state-of-the-art navigation results on CVDN, REVERIE, and R2R in continuous
environments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Retrosynthesis consists of breaking down a chemical compound recursively
step-by-step into molecular precursors until a set of commercially available
molecules is found with the goal to provide a synthesis route. Its two primary
research directions, single-step retrosynthesis prediction, which models the
chemical reaction logic, and multi-step synthesis planning, which tries to find
the correct sequence of reactions, are inherently intertwined. Still, this
connection is not reflected in contemporary research. In this work, we combine
these two major research directions by applying multiple single-step
retrosynthesis models within multi-step synthesis planning and analyzing their
impact using public and proprietary reaction data. We find a disconnection
between high single-step performance and potential route-finding success,
suggesting that single-step models must be evaluated within synthesis planning
in the future. Furthermore, we show that the commonly used single-step
retrosynthesis benchmark dataset USPTO-50k is insufficient as this evaluation
task does not represent model performance and scalability on larger and more
diverse datasets. For multi-step synthesis planning, we show that the choice of
the single-step model can improve the overall success rate of synthesis
planning by up to +28% compared to the commonly used baseline model. Finally,
we show that each single-step model finds unique synthesis routes, and differs
in aspects such as route-finding success, the number of found synthesis routes,
and chemical validity, making the combination of single-step retrosynthesis
prediction and multi-step synthesis planning a crucial aspect when developing
future methods.]]></summary>

control systems (known as NeurODEs) has led to a mathematical analysis of
neural networks which has provided interesting results of both theoretical and
practical significance. However, by construction, NeurODEs have been limited to
describing constant-width layers, making them unsuitable for modeling deep
learning architectures with layers of variable width. In this paper, we propose
a continuous-time Autoencoder, which we call AutoencODE, based on a
modification of the controlled field that drives the dynamics. This adaptation
enables the extension of the mean-field control framework originally devised
for conventional NeurODEs. In this setting, we tackle the case of low Tikhonov
regularization, resulting in potentially non-convex cost landscapes. While the
global results obtained for high Tikhonov regularization may not hold globally,
we show that many of them can be recovered in regions where the loss function
is locally convex. Inspired by our theoretical findings, we develop a training
method tailored to this specific type of Autoencoders with residual
connections, and we validate our approach through numerical experiments
conducted on various examples.]]></summary>

adversarial examples, threatening their practical deployment. Despite the many
research endeavors have been made to tackle this issue in recent years, the
diversity of adversarial examples on 3D point clouds makes them more
challenging to defend against than those on 2D images. For examples, attackers
can generate adversarial examples by adding, shifting, or removing points.
Consequently, existing defense strategies are hard to counter unseen point
cloud adversarial examples. In this paper, we first establish a comprehensive,
and rigorous point cloud adversarial robustness benchmark to evaluate
adversarial robustness, which can provide a detailed understanding of the
effects of the defense and attack methods. We then collect existing defense
tricks in point cloud adversarial defenses and then perform extensive and
systematic experiments to identify an effective combination of these tricks.
Furthermore, we propose a hybrid training augmentation methods that consider
various types of point cloud adversarial examples to adversarial training,
significantly improving the adversarial robustness. By combining these tricks,
we construct a more robust defense framework achieving an average accuracy of
83.45\% against various attacks, demonstrating its capability to enabling
robust learners. Our codebase are open-sourced on:

that have already been fact-checked. The successful detection of claims that
have already been debunked not only reduces the manual efforts of professional
fact-checkers but can also contribute to slowing the spread of misinformation.
Mainly due to the lack of readily available data, this is an understudied
problem, particularly when considering the cross-lingual task, i.e. the
retrieval of fact-checking articles in a language different from the language
of the online post being checked. This paper fills this gap by (i) creating a
novel dataset to enable research on cross-lingual retrieval of already debunked
narratives, using tweets as queries to a database of fact-checking articles;
(ii) presenting an extensive experiment to benchmark fine-tuned and
off-the-shelf multilingual pre-trained Transformer models for this task; and
(iii) proposing a novel multistage framework that divides this cross-lingual
debunk retrieval task into refinement and re-ranking stages. Results show that
the task of cross-lingual retrieval of already debunked narratives is
challenging and off-the-shelf Transformer models fail to outperform a strong
lexical-based baseline (BM25). Nevertheless, our multistage retrieval framework
is robust, outperforming BM25 in most scenarios and enabling cross-domain and
zero-shot learning, without significantly harming the model's performance.]]></summary>

advanced surgical assistance and improve computer assisted interventions. In
this work, we propose SegMatch, a semi supervised learning method to reduce the
need for expensive annotation for laparoscopic and robotic surgical images.
SegMatch builds on FixMatch, a widespread semi supervised classification
pipeline combining consistency regularization and pseudo labelling, and adapts
it for the purpose of segmentation. In our proposed SegMatch, the unlabelled
images are weakly augmented and fed into the segmentation model to generate a
pseudo-label to enforce the unsupervised loss against the output of the model
for the adversarial augmented image on the pixels with a high confidence score.
Our adaptation for segmentation tasks includes carefully considering the
equivariance and invariance properties of the augmentation functions we rely
on. To increase the relevance of our augmentations, we depart from using only
handcrafted augmentations and introduce a trainable adversarial augmentation
strategy. Our algorithm was evaluated on the MICCAI Instrument Segmentation
Challenge datasets Robust-MIS 2019 and EndoVis 2017. Our results demonstrate
that adding unlabelled data for training purposes allows us to surpass the
performance of fully supervised approaches which are limited by the
availability of training data in these challenges. SegMatch also outperforms a
range of state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning semantic segmentation models
in different labelled to unlabelled data ratios.]]></summary>

prediction is evaluated alongside the constant velocity model (CVM) with
respect to its applicability in autonomous vehicles. The evaluation is
conducted on the widely-used ETH/UCY dataset where the Average Displacement
Error (ADE) and the Final Displacement Error (FDE) are reported. To align with
requirements in real-world applications, modifications are made to the input
features of the initially proposed models. An ablation study is conducted to
examine the influence of the observed motion history on the prediction
performance, thereby establishing a better understanding of its impact.
Additionally, the inference time of each model is measured to evaluate the
scalability of each model when confronted with varying amounts of agents. The
results demonstrate that simple models remain competitive when generating
single trajectories, and certain features commonly thought of as useful have
little impact on the overall performance across different architectures. Based

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Large skew-t factor copula models are attractive for the modeling of
financial data because they allow for asymmetric and extreme tail dependence.
We show that the copula implicit in the skew-t distribution of Azzalini and
Capitanio (2003) allows for a higher level of pairwise asymmetric dependence
than two popular alternative skew-t copulas. Estimation of this copula in high
dimensions is challenging, and we propose a fast and accurate Bayesian
variational inference (VI) approach to do so. The method uses a conditionally
Gaussian generative representation of the skew-t distribution to define an
augmented posterior that can be approximated accurately. A fast stochastic
gradient ascent algorithm is used to solve the variational optimization. The
new methodology is used to estimate copula models for intraday returns from
2017 to 2021 on 93 U.S. equities. The copula captures substantial heterogeneity
in asymmetric dependence over equity pairs, in addition to the variability in
pairwise correlations. We show that intraday predictive densities from the
skew-t copula are more accurate than from some other copula models, while
portfolio selection strategies based on the estimated pairwise tail
dependencies improve performance relative to the benchmark index.]]></summary>

private updates from a large number of clients in order to train a machine
learning model. The main challenge in this setting is balancing privacy with
both classification accuracy of the learnt model as well as the number of bits
communicated between the clients and server. Prior work has achieved a good
trade-off by designing a privacy-aware compression mechanism, called the
minimum variance unbiased (MVU) mechanism, that numerically solves an
optimization problem to determine the parameters of the mechanism. This paper
builds upon it by introducing a new interpolation procedure in the numerical
design process that allows for a far more efficient privacy analysis. The
result is the new Interpolated MVU mechanism that is more scalable, has a
better privacy-utility trade-off, and provides SOTA results on
communication-efficient private FL on a variety of datasets.]]></summary>

learning models may be necessary to maintain or improve performance over time.
However, updating a model can introduce compatibility issues when the behavior
of the updated model does not align with user expectations, resulting in poor
user-model team performance. Existing compatibility measures depend on model
decision thresholds, limiting their applicability in settings where models are
used to generate rankings based on estimated risk. To address this limitation,
we propose a novel rank-based compatibility measure, $C^R$, and a new loss
function that aims to optimize discriminative performance while encouraging
good compatibility. Applied to a case study in mortality risk stratification
leveraging data from MIMIC, our approach yields more compatible models while
maintaining discriminative performance compared to existing model selection
techniques, with an increase in $C^R$ of $0.019$ ($95\%$ confidence interval:
$0.005$, $0.035$). This work provides new tools to analyze and update risk
stratification models used in clinical care.]]></summary>

Neural Networks (DNNs) for function approximation, has demonstrated
considerable success in numerous applications. However, its practicality in
addressing various real-world scenarios, characterized by diverse and
unpredictable dynamics, noisy signals, and large state and action spaces,
remains limited. This limitation stems from issues such as poor data
efficiency, limited generalization capabilities, a lack of safety guarantees,
and the absence of interpretability, among other factors. To overcome these
challenges and improve performance across these crucial metrics, one promising
avenue is to incorporate additional structural information about the problem
into the RL learning process. Various sub-fields of RL have proposed methods
for incorporating such inductive biases. We amalgamate these diverse
methodologies under a unified framework, shedding light on the role of
structure in the learning problem, and classify these methods into distinct
patterns of incorporating structure. By leveraging this comprehensive
framework, we provide valuable insights into the challenges of structured RL
and lay the groundwork for a design pattern perspective on RL research. This
novel perspective paves the way for future advancements and aids in developing
more effective and efficient RL algorithms that can potentially handle
real-world scenarios better.]]></summary>

based, not on text, but on low bitrate discrete units that have been learned in

speech that are hard to transcribe (prosody, voice styles, non-verbal
vocalization). The adoption of these methods is still limited by the fact that
most speech synthesis datasets are read, severely limiting spontaneity and
expressivity. Here, we introduce Expresso, a high-quality expressive speech
dataset for textless speech synthesis that includes both read speech and
improvised dialogues rendered in 26 spontaneous expressive styles. We
illustrate the challenges and potentials of this dataset with an expressive
resynthesis benchmark where the task is to encode the input in low-bitrate
units and resynthesize it in a target voice while preserving content and style.
We evaluate resynthesis quality with automatic metrics for different
self-supervised discrete encoders, and explore tradeoffs between quality,
bitrate and invariance to speaker and style. All the dataset, evaluation

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The decentralized and privacy-preserving nature of federated learning (FL)
makes it vulnerable to backdoor attacks aiming to manipulate the behavior of
the resulting model on specific adversary-chosen inputs. However, most existing
defenses based on statistical differences take effect only against specific
attacks, especially when the malicious gradients are similar to benign ones or
the data are highly non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID). In
this paper, we revisit the distance-based defense methods and discover that i)
Euclidean distance becomes meaningless in high dimensions and ii) malicious
gradients with diverse characteristics cannot be identified by a single metric.
To this end, we present a simple yet effective defense strategy with
multi-metrics and dynamic weighting to identify backdoors adaptively.
Furthermore, our novel defense has no reliance on predefined assumptions over
attack settings or data distributions and little impact on benign performance.
To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct comprehensive
experiments on different datasets under various attack settings, where our
method achieves the best defensive performance. For instance, we achieve the
lowest backdoor accuracy of 3.06% under the difficult Edge-case PGD, showing
significant superiority over previous defenses. The results also demonstrate
that our method can be well-adapted to a wide range of non-IID degrees without
sacrificing the benign performance.]]></summary>

address the label sparsity issue in heterogeneous graphs (HGs), which contain
various types of nodes and edges. The existing methods have achieved good
performance by transferring generalized knowledge extracted from rich-labeled
classes in source HG(s) to few-labeled classes in a target HG. However, these
methods only consider the single-heterogeneity scenario where the source and
target HGs share a fixed set of node/edge types, ignoring the more general
scenario of cross-heterogeneity, where each HG can have a different and
non-fixed set of node/edge types. To this end, we focus on the unexplored
cross-heterogeneity scenario and propose a novel model for Cross-heterogeneity
Graph Few-shot Learning, namely CGFL. In CGFL, we first extract meta-patterns
to capture heterogeneous information and propose a multi-view heterogeneous
graph neural network (MHGN) to learn meta-patterns across HGs. Then, we propose
a score module to measure the informativeness of labeled samples and determine
the transferability of each source HG. Finally, by integrating MHGN and the
score module into a meta-learning mechanism, CGFL can effectively transfer
generalized knowledge to predict new classes with few-labeled data. Extensive
experiments on four real-world datasets have demonstrated the superior

decentralized network, where every agent periodically communicates with its
neighbors to exchange local models, and then updates its own local model by
stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The performance of such a method is affected
by an unknown number of Byzantine agents, which conduct adversarially during
the optimization process. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing
work that simultaneously achieves a linear convergence speed and a small
learning error. We observe that the learning error is largely dependent on the
intrinsic stochastic gradient noise. Motivated by this observation, we
introduce two variance reduction methods, stochastic average gradient algorithm
(SAGA) and loopless stochastic variance-reduced gradient (LSVRG), to
Byzantine-robust decentralized stochastic optimization for eliminating the
negative effect of the stochastic gradient noise. The two resulting methods,
BRAVO-SAGA and BRAVO-LSVRG, enjoy both linear convergence speeds and stochastic

weights for another neural network, known as the target network. They have
emerged as a powerful deep learning technique that allows for greater
flexibility, adaptability, dynamism, faster training, information sharing, and
model compression etc. Hypernets have shown promising results in a variety of
deep learning problems, including continual learning, causal inference,
transfer learning, weight pruning, uncertainty quantification, zero-shot
learning, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning etc. Despite
their success across different problem settings, currently, there is no review
available to inform the researchers about the developments and to help in
utilizing hypernets. To fill this gap, we review the progress in hypernets. We
present an illustrative example to train deep neural networks using hypernets
and propose categorizing hypernets based on five design criteria as inputs,
outputs, variability of inputs and outputs, and architecture of hypernets. We
also review applications of hypernets across different deep learning problem
settings, followed by a discussion of general scenarios where hypernets can be
effectively employed. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future directions
that remain under-explored in the field of hypernets. We believe that
hypernetworks have the potential to revolutionize the field of deep learning.
They offer a new way to design and train neural networks, and they have the

of road infrastructure is critical for optimizing transportation systems,
enhancing road safety, and improving the overall mobility experience for
drivers and commuters. Yet, a formidable bottleneck obstructs progress - the
laborious and time-intensive manual identification of intersections. Simply
considering the shear number of intersections that need to be identified, and
the labor hours required per intersection, the need for an automated solution
becomes undeniable. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that
leverages connected vehicle data and cutting-edge deep learning techniques. By
employing geohashing to segment vehicle trajectories and then generating image
representations of road segments, we utilize the YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once
version 5) algorithm for accurate classification of both straight road segments
and intersections. Experimental results demonstrate an impressive overall
classification accuracy of 95%, with straight roads achieving a remarkable 97%
F1 score and intersections reaching a 90% F1 score. This approach not only
saves time and resources but also enables more frequent updates and a
comprehensive understanding of the road network. Our research showcases the
potential impact on traffic management, urban planning, and autonomous vehicle
navigation systems. The fusion of connected vehicle data and deep learning
models holds promise for a transformative shift in road infrastructure mapping,
propelling us towards a smarter, safer, and more connected transportation
ecosystem.]]></summary>

devices necessitates efficient tools for transmitting large geometric data,
e.g., 3D meshes, over the Internet. Detailed high-resolution assets can pose a
challenge to storage as well as transmission bandwidth, and level-of-detail
techniques are often used to transmit an asset using an appropriate bandwidth
budget. It is especially desirable for these methods to transmit data
progressively, improving the quality of the geometry with more data. Our key
insight is that the geometric details of 3D meshes often exhibit similar local
patterns even across different shapes, and thus can be effectively represented
with a shared learned generative space. We learn this space using a
subdivision-based encoder-decoder architecture trained in advance on a large
collection of surfaces. We further observe that additional residual features
can be transmitted progressively between intermediate levels of subdivision
that enable the client to control the tradeoff between bandwidth cost and
quality of reconstruction, providing a neural progressive mesh representation.
We evaluate our method on a diverse set of complex 3D shapes and demonstrate
that it outperforms baselines in terms of compression ratio and reconstruction
quality.]]></summary>

systems. The increasing complexity of channel modelling and the cost of
collecting high-quality wireless channel data have become major challenges. In
this paper, we propose a diffusion model based channel sampling approach for
rapidly synthesizing channel realizations from limited data. We use a diffusion
model with a U Net based architecture operating in the frequency space domain.
To evaluate how well the proposed model reproduces the true distribution of
channels in the training dataset, two evaluation metrics are used: $i)$ the
approximate $2$-Wasserstein distance between real and generated distributions
of the normalized power spectrum in the antenna and frequency domains and $ii)$
precision and recall metric for distributions. We show that, compared to
existing GAN based approaches which suffer from mode collapse and unstable
training, our diffusion based approach trains stably and generates diverse and
high-fidelity samples from the true channel distribution. We also show that we
can pretrain the model on a simulated urban macro-cellular channel dataset and
fine-tune it on a smaller, out-of-distribution urban micro-cellular dataset,
therefore showing that it is feasible to model real world channels using
limited data with this approach.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This study proposes a hybrid deep-learning-metaheuristic framework with a
bi-level architecture for road network design problems (NDPs). We train a graph
neural network (GNN) to approximate the solution of the user equilibrium (UE)
traffic assignment problem and use inferences made by the trained model to
calculate fitness function evaluations of a genetic algorithm (GA) to
approximate solutions for NDPs. Using three test networks, two NDP variants and
an exact solver as benchmark, we show that on average, our proposed framework
can provide solutions within 1.5% gap of the best results in less than 0.5% of
the time used by the exact solution procedure. Our framework can be utilized
within an expert system for infrastructure planning to determine the best
infrastructure planning and management decisions under different scenarios.
Given the flexibility of the framework, it can easily be adapted to many other
decision problems that can be modeled as bi-level problems on graphs. Moreover,
we foreseen interesting future research directions, thus we also put forward a
brief research agenda for this topic. The key observation from our research
that can shape future research is that the fitness function evaluation time
using the inferences made by the GNN model was in the order of milliseconds,
which points to an opportunity and a need for novel heuristics that 1) can cope
well with noisy fitness function values provided by deep learning models, and
2) can use the significantly enlarged efficiency of the evaluation step to
explore the search space effectively (rather than efficiently). This opens a
new avenue for a modern class of metaheuristics that are crafted for use with
AI-powered predictors.]]></summary>

development of inverse Bayesian filters. For example, inverse Kalman filter
(I-KF) has been recently formulated to estimate the adversary's
Kalman-filter-tracked estimates and hence, predict the adversary's future
steps. The purpose of this paper and the companion paper (Part I) is to address
the inverse filtering problem in non-linear systems by proposing an inverse
extended Kalman filter (I-EKF). The companion paper proposed the theory of
I-EKF (with and without unknown inputs) and I-KF (with unknown inputs). In this
paper, we develop this theory for highly non-linear models, which employ
second-order, Gaussian sum, and dithered forward EKFs. In particular, we derive
theoretical stability guarantees for the inverse second-order EKF using the
bounded non-linearity approach. To address the limitation of the standard
I-EKFs that the system model and forward filter are perfectly known to the
defender, we propose reproducing kernel Hilbert space-based EKF to learn the
unknown system dynamics based on its observations, which can be employed as an
inverse filter to infer the adversary's estimate. Numerical experiments
demonstrate the state estimation performance of the proposed filters using
recursive Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound as a benchmark.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here, we show that the InfoNCE objective is equivalent to the ELBO in a new
class of probabilistic generative model, the recognition parameterised model
(RPM). When we learn the optimal prior, the RPM ELBO becomes equal to the
mutual information (MI; up to a constant), establishing a connection to
pre-existing self-supervised learning methods such as InfoNCE. However,
practical InfoNCE methods do not use the MI as an objective; the MI is
invariant to arbitrary invertible transformations, so using an MI objective can
lead to highly entangled representations (Tschannen et al., 2019). Instead, the
actual InfoNCE objective is a simplified lower bound on the MI which is loose
even in the infinite sample limit. Thus, an objective that works (i.e. the
actual InfoNCE objective) appears to be motivated as a loose bound on an
objective that does not work (i.e. the true MI which gives arbitrarily
entangled representations). We give an alternative motivation for the actual
InfoNCE objective. In particular, we show that in the infinite sample limit,
and for a particular choice of prior, the actual InfoNCE objective is equal to
the ELBO (up to a constant); and the ELBO is equal to the marginal likelihood
with a deterministic recognition model. Thus, we argue that our VAE perspective
gives a better motivation for InfoNCE than MI, as the actual InfoNCE objective
is only loosely bounded by the MI, but is equal to the ELBO/marginal likelihood
(up to a constant).]]></summary>

allows us to construct a post-selection likelihood which we show to be adequate

accounting for the selection by the group lasso. Confidence regions for the

to overfitted models that underperform under regime changes. In this work, we
propose a modular machine learning pipeline for ranking predictions on temporal

pipeline allows the use of different models, including Gradient Boosting
Decision Trees (GBDTs) and Neural Networks, with and without feature

prediction, and find that GBDT models with dropout display high performance,
robustness and generalisability with reduced complexity and computational cost.
We then demonstrate how online learning techniques, which require no retraining
of models, can be used post-prediction to enhance the results. First, we show
that dynamic feature projection improves robustness by reducing drawdown in
regime changes. Second, we demonstrate that dynamical model ensembling based on
selection of models with good recent performance leads to improved Sharpe and
Calmar ratios of out-of-sample predictions. We also evaluate the robustness of

decision thresholds, limiting their applicability in settings where models are
used to generate rankings based on estimated risk. To address this limitation,
we propose a novel rank-based compatibility measure, $C^R$, and a new loss
function that aims to optimize discriminative performance while encouraging

leveraging data from MIMIC, our approach yields more compatible models while
maintaining discriminative performance compared to existing model selection

variables from the same set of features, improving predictive performance and
modeling accuracy relative to methods that handle each response variable
separately. Despite the potential of multi-task learning to yield more powerful
inference than single-task alternatives, prior work in this area has largely
omitted uncertainty quantification. Our focus in this paper is a common
multi-task problem in neuroimaging, where the goal is to understand the
relationship between multiple cognitive task scores (or other subject-level
assessments) and brain connectome data collected from imaging. We propose a
framework for selective inference to address this problem, with the flexibility
to: (i) jointly identify the relevant covariates for each task through a
sparsity-inducing penalty, and (ii) conduct valid inference in a model based on
the estimated sparsity structure. Our framework offers a new conditional
procedure for inference, based on a refinement of the selection event that
yields a tractable selection-adjusted likelihood. This gives an approximate
system of estimating equations for maximum likelihood inference, solvable via a
single convex optimization problem, and enables us to efficiently form
confidence intervals with approximately the correct coverage. Applied to both
simulated data and data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)
study, our selective inference methods yield tighter confidence intervals than
commonly used alternatives, such as data splitting. We also demonstrate through
simulations that multi-task learning with selective inference can more
accurately recover true signals than single-task methods.]]></summary>

directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with structural causal models (SCMs) to describe
the functional dependencies of effects on their causes. Possible
identifiability of SCMs given data depends on assumptions made on the noise
variables and the functional classes in the SCM. For instance, in the LiNGAM
model, the functional class is restricted to linear functions and the
disturbances have to be non-Gaussian.

In this work, we propose TSLiNGAM, a new method for identifying the DAG of a
causal model based on observational data. TSLiNGAM builds on DirectLiNGAM, a
popular algorithm which uses simple OLS regression for identifying causal
directions between variables. TSLiNGAM leverages the non-Gaussianity assumption
of the error terms in the LiNGAM model to obtain more efficient and robust
estimation of the causal structure. TSLiNGAM is justified theoretically and is
studied empirically in an extensive simulation study. It performs significantly
better on heavy-tailed and skewed data and demonstrates a high small-sample
efficiency. In addition, TSLiNGAM also shows better robustness properties as it

introduces a novel approach that unifies these methods into a single framework

proposed approach, for example, makes it possible for optimal adversarial

devices due to their expensive computational requirements. This challenge has
recently reached another scale with the emergence of large language models
(LLMs). In order to reduce both their memory footprint and latency, a promising
technique is quantization. It consists in converting floating point
representations to low bit-width fixed point representations, usually by
assuming a uniform mapping onto a regular grid. This process, referred to in
the literature as uniform quantization, may however be ill-suited as most DNN
weights and activations follow a bell-shaped distribution. This is even worse
on LLMs whose weight distributions are known to exhibit large, high impact,
outlier values. In this work, we propose an improvement over the most commonly
adopted way to tackle this limitation in deep learning models quantization,
namely, non-uniform quantization. NUPES leverages automorphisms to preserve the
scalar multiplications. Such transformations are derived from power functions.
However, the optimization of the exponent parameter and weight values remains a
challenging and novel problem which could not be solved with previous post
training optimization techniques which only learn to round up or down weight
values in order to preserve the predictive function. We circumvent this
limitation with a new paradigm: learning new quantized weights over the entire
quantized space. Similarly, we enable the optimization of the power exponent,
i.e. the optimization of the quantization operator itself during training by
alleviating all the numerical instabilities. The resulting predictive function
is compatible with integer-only low-bit inference. We show the ability of the
method to achieve state-of-the-art compression rates in both, data-free and
data-driven configurations.]]></summary>

biological processes of the ocean, which is the foundation for marine science
research and operational oceanography. Modern numerical ocean modeling mainly
consists of governing equations and numerical algorithms. Nonlinear
instability, computational expense, low reusability efficiency and high
coupling costs have gradually become the main bottlenecks for the further
development of numerical ocean modeling. Recently, artificial
intelligence-based modeling in scientific computing has shown revolutionary
potential for digital twins and scientific simulations, but the bottlenecks of
numerical ocean modeling have not been further solved. Here, we present
AI-GOMS, a large AI-driven global ocean modeling system, for accurate and
efficient global ocean daily prediction. AI-GOMS consists of a backbone model
with the Fourier-based Masked Autoencoder structure for basic ocean variable
prediction and lightweight fine-tuning models incorporating regional
downscaling, wave decoding, and biochemistry coupling modules. AI-GOMS has
achieved the best performance in 30 days of prediction for the global ocean
basic variables with 15 depth layers at 1/4{\deg} spatial resolution. Beyond
the good performance in statistical metrics, AI-GOMS realizes the simulation of
mesoscale eddies in the Kuroshio region at 1/12{\deg} spatial resolution and
ocean stratification in the tropical Pacific Ocean. AI-GOMS provides a new
backbone-downstream paradigm for Earth system modeling, which makes the system
transferable, scalable and reusable.]]></summary>

and decision-makers would benefit from reliable, timely measures of the issues
impacting their communities during a disaster, and social media offers a
potentially rich data source. Social media can reflect public concerns and
demands during a disaster, offering valuable insights for decision-makers to
understand evolving situations and optimize resource allocation. We used
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) topic modeling
to cluster topics from Twitter data. Then, we conducted a temporal-spatial
analysis to examine the distribution of these topics across different regions
during the 2020 western U.S. wildfire season. Our results show that Twitter
users mainly focused on three topics:"health impact," "damage," and
"evacuation." We used the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) theory to
explore the magnitude and velocity of topic diffusion on Twitter. The results
displayed a clear relationship between topic trends and wildfire propagation
patterns. The estimated parameters obtained from the SIR model in selected
cities revealed that residents exhibited a high level of several concerns
during the wildfire. Our study details how the SIR model and topic modeling
using social media data can provide decision-makers with a quantitative
approach to measure disaster response and support their decision-making

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this paper, we describe a new algorithm called Preferential Attachment
k-class Classifier (PreAttacK) for detecting fake accounts in a social network.
Recently, several algorithms have obtained high accuracy on this problem.
However, they have done so by relying on information about fake accounts'
friendships or the content they share with others--the very things we seek to
prevent.

PreAttacK represents a significant departure from these approaches. We
provide some of the first detailed distributional analyses of how new fake (and
real) accounts first attempt to request friends after joining a major network
(Facebook). We show that even before a new account has made friends or shared
content, these initial friend request behaviors evoke a natural multi-class
extension of the canonical Preferential Attachment model of social network
growth.

We use this model to derive a new algorithm, PreAttacK. We prove that in
relevant problem instances, PreAttacK near-optimally approximates the posterior
probability that a new account is fake under this multi-class Preferential
Attachment model of new accounts' (not-yet-answered) friend requests. These are
the first provable guarantees for fake account detection that apply to new
users, and that do not require strong homophily assumptions.

This principled approach also makes PreAttacK the only algorithm with
provable guarantees that obtains state-of-the-art performance on new users on
the global Facebook network, where it converges to AUC=0.9 after new users send
+ receive a total of just 20 not-yet-answered friend requests. For comparison,
state-of-the-art benchmarks do not obtain this AUC even after observing
additional data on new users' first 100 friend requests. Thus, unlike
mainstream algorithms, PreAttacK converges before the median new fake account
has made a single friendship (accepted friend request) with a human.]]></summary>

modern transformer-stack networks used to process natural language. We adapt

evaluating the degree of semantic coherence of each layer, and demonstrate
consistent improvement over numerous other methods for textual saliency on

use cases, ranging from industrial automation to logistics and warehousing, to
healthcare and security. In this paper, we present a robotic system to detect,
track, and follow any object in real-time. Our approach, dubbed ``follow
anything'' (FAn), is an open-vocabulary and multimodal model -- it is not
restricted to concepts seen at training time and can be applied to novel
classes at inference time using text, images, or click queries. Leveraging rich
visual descriptors from large-scale pre-trained models (foundation models), FAn
can detect and segment objects by matching multimodal queries (text, images,
clicks) against an input image sequence. These detected and segmented objects
are tracked across image frames, all while accounting for occlusion and object
re-emergence. We demonstrate FAn on a real-world robotic system (a micro aerial
vehicle) and report its ability to seamlessly follow the objects of interest in
a real-time control loop. FAn can be deployed on a laptop with a lightweight
(6-8 GB) graphics card, achieving a throughput of 6-20 frames per second. To
enable rapid adoption, deployment, and extensibility, we open-source all our

the potential of diffusion models for generating realistic mixed-type tabular

applications via nonstationary Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), and hence
gains considerable interest. However, theoretical studies on nonstationary MDPs
in the literature have mainly focused on tabular and linear (mixture) MDPs,
which do not capture the nature of unknown representation in deep RL. In this
paper, we make the first effort to investigate nonstationary RL under episodic
low-rank MDPs, where both transition kernels and rewards may vary over time,
and the low-rank model contains unknown representation in addition to the
linear state embedding function. We first propose a parameter-dependent policy
optimization algorithm called PORTAL, and further improve PORTAL to its
parameter-free version of Ada-PORTAL, which is able to tune its
hyper-parameters adaptively without any prior knowledge of nonstationarity. For
both algorithms, we provide upper bounds on the average dynamic suboptimality
gap, which show that as long as the nonstationarity is not significantly large,
PORTAL and Ada-PORTAL are sample-efficient and can achieve arbitrarily small
average dynamic suboptimality gap with polynomial sample complexity.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forecasting irregularly sampled time series with missing values is a crucial
task for numerous real-world applications such as healthcare, astronomy, and
climate sciences. State-of-the-art approaches to this problem rely on Ordinary
Differential Equations (ODEs) which are known to be slow and often require
additional features to handle missing values. To address this issue, we propose
a novel model using Graphs for Forecasting Irregularly Sampled Time Series with
missing values which we call GraFITi. GraFITi first converts the time series to
a Sparsity Structure Graph which is a sparse bipartite graph, and then
reformulates the forecasting problem as the edge weight prediction task in the
graph. It uses the power of Graph Neural Networks to learn the graph and
predict the target edge weights. GraFITi has been tested on 3 real-world and 1
synthetic irregularly sampled time series dataset with missing values and
compared with various state-of-the-art models. The experimental results
demonstrate that GraFITi improves the forecasting accuracy by up to 17% and
reduces the run time up to 5 times compared to the state-of-the-art forecasting
models.]]></summary>

person and vehicle trips. However, traditional planning models often fail to
account for the intricacies and dynamics of travel behavior, leading to
less-than-optimal accuracy in these predictions. This study explores the
potential of deep learning techniques to transform the way we approach trip
predictions, and ultimately, transportation planning. Utilizing a comprehensive
dataset from the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS), we developed and
trained a deep learning model for predicting person and vehicle trips. The
proposed model leverages the vast amount of information in the NHTS data,
capturing complex, non-linear relationships that were previously overlooked by
traditional models. As a result, our deep learning model achieved an impressive
accuracy of 98% for person trip prediction and 96% for vehicle trip estimation.
This represents a significant improvement over the performances of traditional
transportation planning models, thereby demonstrating the power of deep
learning in this domain. The implications of this study extend beyond just more
accurate predictions. By enhancing the accuracy and reliability of trip
prediction models, planners can formulate more effective, data-driven
transportation policies, infrastructure, and services. As such, our research
underscores the need for the transportation planning field to embrace advanced
techniques like deep learning. The detailed methodology, along with a thorough
discussion of the results and their implications, are presented in the
subsequent sections of this paper.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Code summarization aims to generate concise natural language descriptions for
source code. The prevailing approaches adopt transformer-based encoder-decoder
architectures, where the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the source code is
utilized for encoding structural information. However, ASTs are much longer
than the corresponding source code, and existing methods ignore this size
constraint by directly feeding the entire linearized AST into the encoders.
This simplistic approach makes it challenging to extract truly valuable
dependency relations from the overlong input sequence and leads to significant
computational overhead due to self-attention applied to all nodes in the AST.

To address this issue effectively and efficiently, we present a model,
AST-MHSA that uses multi-head attention to extract the important semantic
information from the AST. The model consists of two main components: an encoder
and a decoder. The encoder takes as input the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the
code and generates a sequence of hidden states. The decoder then takes these
hidden states as input and generates a natural language summary of the code.

The multi-head attention mechanism allows the model to learn different
representations of the input code, which can be combined to generate a more
comprehensive summary. The model is trained on a dataset of code and summaries,
and the parameters of the model are optimized to minimize the loss between the
generated summaries and the ground-truth summaries.]]></summary>

science and engineering. Recently, mostly due to the high computational cost of
traditional solution techniques, deep neural network based surrogates have
gained increased interest. The practical utility of such neural PDE solvers
relies on their ability to provide accurate, stable predictions over long time
horizons, which is a notoriously hard problem. In this work, we present a
large-scale analysis of common temporal rollout strategies, identifying the
neglect of non-dominant spatial frequency information, often associated with
high frequencies in PDE solutions, as the primary pitfall limiting stable,
accurate rollout performance. Based on these insights, we draw inspiration from
recent advances in diffusion models to introduce PDE-Refiner; a novel model
class that enables more accurate modeling of all frequency components via a
multistep refinement process. We validate PDE-Refiner on challenging benchmarks
of complex fluid dynamics, demonstrating stable and accurate rollouts that
consistently outperform state-of-the-art models, including neural, numerical,
and hybrid neural-numerical architectures. We further demonstrate that
PDE-Refiner greatly enhances data efficiency, since the denoising objective
implicitly induces a novel form of spectral data augmentation. Finally,
PDE-Refiner's connection to diffusion models enables an accurate and efficient
assessment of the model's predictive uncertainty, allowing us to estimate when
the surrogate becomes inaccurate.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When applied to autonomous vehicle (AV) settings, action recognition can
enhance an environment model's situational awareness. This is especially
prevalent in scenarios where traditional geometric descriptions and heuristics
in AVs are insufficient. However, action recognition has traditionally been
studied for humans, and its limited adaptability to noisy, un-clipped,
un-pampered, raw RGB data has limited its application in other fields. To push
for the advancement and adoption of action recognition into AVs, this work
proposes a novel two-stage action recognition system, termed RALACs. RALACs
formulates the problem of action recognition for road scenes, and bridges the
gap between it and the established field of human action recognition. This work
shows how attention layers can be useful for encoding the relations across
agents, and stresses how such a scheme can be class-agnostic. Furthermore, to
address the dynamic nature of agents on the road, RALACs constructs a novel
approach to adapting Region of Interest (ROI) Alignment to agent tracks for
downstream action classification. Finally, our scheme also considers the
problem of active agent detection, and utilizes a novel application of fusing
optical flow maps to discern relevant agents in a road scene. We show that our
proposed scheme can outperform the baseline on the ICCV2021 Road Challenge
dataset and by deploying it on a real vehicle platform, we provide preliminary
insight to the usefulness of action recognition in decision making.]]></summary>

often attributed to the regularisation component of the loss. In this work, we
highlight the interaction between data and the reconstruction term of the loss

benchmark datasets have unintended correlations between their subjective
ground-truth factors and perceived axes in the data according to typical VAE
reconstruction losses. Our work exploits this relationship to provide a theory
for what constitutes an adversarial dataset under a given reconstruction loss.
We verify this by constructing an example dataset that prevents disentanglement
in state-of-the-art frameworks while maintaining human-intuitive ground-truth
factors. Finally, we re-enable disentanglement by designing an example
reconstruction loss that is once again able to perceive the ground-truth
factors. Our findings demonstrate the subjective nature of disentanglement and
the importance of considering the interaction between the ground-truth factors,

sequential data due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies.
Conventionally, the update based on current inputs and the previous state

next state. However, multiplication can be computationally expensive,
especially for certain hardware architectures or alternative arithmetic systems
such as homomorphic encryption. It is demonstrated that the novel gating
mechanism can capture long-term dependencies for a standard synthetic sequence
learning task while significantly reducing computational costs such that
execution time is reduced by half on CPU and by one-third under encryption.
Experimental results on handwritten text recognition tasks furthermore show
that the proposed architecture can be trained to achieve comparable accuracy to
conventional GRU and LSTM baselines. The gating mechanism introduced in this
paper may enable privacy-preserving AI applications operating under homomorphic
encryption by avoiding the multiplication of encrypted variables. It can also
support quantization in (unencrypted) plaintext applications, with the
potential for substantial performance gains since the addition-based
formulation can avoid the expansion to double precision often required for
multiplication.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The primary method for identifying mental disorders automatically has
traditionally involved using binary classifiers. These classifiers are trained
using behavioral data obtained from an interview setup. In this training
process, data from individuals with the specific disorder under consideration
are categorized as the positive class, while data from all other participants
constitute the negative class. In practice, it is widely recognized that
certain mental disorders share similar symptoms, causing the collected
behavioral data to encompass a variety of attributes associated with multiple
disorders. Consequently, attributes linked to the targeted mental disorder
might also be present within the negative class. This data impurity may lead to
sub-optimal training of the classifier for a mental disorder of interest. In
this study, we investigate this hypothesis in the context of major depressive
disorder (MDD) and post-traumatic stress disorder detection (PTSD). The results
show that upon removal of such data impurity, MDD and PTSD detection
performances are significantly improved.]]></summary>

extraction attacks, which focus on stealing the models by using specially
curated queries against the target model. This task is well accomplished by
using part of the training data or a surrogate dataset to train a new model
that mimics a target model in a white-box environment. In pragmatic situations,
however, the target models are trained on private datasets that are
inaccessible to the adversary. The data-free model extraction technique
replaces this problem when it comes to using queries artificially curated by a
generator similar to that used in Generative Adversarial Nets. We propose for
the first time, to the best of our knowledge, an adversary black box attack
extending to a regression problem for predicting bounding box coordinates in
object detection. As part of our study, we found that defining a loss function
and using a novel generator setup is one of the key aspects in extracting the
target model. We find that the proposed model extraction method achieves
significant results by using reasonable queries. The discovery of this object

classifiers such as gradient-boosting decision trees (GBDTs) against
adversarial perturbation attacks. The idea is based on a recent symmetry
defense for convolutional neural network classifiers (CNNs) that utilizes CNNs'
lack of invariance with respect to symmetries. CNNs lack invariance because
they can classify a symmetric sample, such as a horizontally flipped image,
differently from the original sample. CNNs' lack of invariance also means that
CNNs can classify symmetric adversarial samples differently from the incorrect
classification of adversarial samples. Using CNNs' lack of invariance, the
recent CNN symmetry defense has shown that the classification of symmetric
adversarial samples reverts to the correct sample classification. In order to
apply the same symmetry defense to GBDTs, we examine GBDT invariance and are
the first to show that GBDTs also lack invariance with respect to symmetries.
We apply and evaluate the GBDT symmetry defense for nine datasets against six
perturbation attacks with a threat model that ranges from zero-knowledge to
perfect-knowledge adversaries. Using the feature inversion symmetry against
zero-knowledge adversaries, we achieve up to 100% accuracy on adversarial
samples even when default and robust classifiers have 0% accuracy. Using the
feature inversion and horizontal flip symmetries against perfect-knowledge
adversaries, we achieve up to over 95% accuracy on adversarial samples for the
GBDT classifier of the F-MNIST dataset even when default and robust classifiers

rooms with moving sources, which have applications in virtual/augmented
reality, game audio, and spatial computing. Solutions to the wave equation can
describe wave phenomena such as diffraction and interference. However,
simulating them using conventional numerical discretization methods with
hundreds of source and receiver positions is intractable, making stimulating a
sound field with moving sources impractical. To overcome this limitation, we
propose using deep operator networks to approximate linear wave-equation
operators. This enables the rapid prediction of sound propagation in realistic
3D acoustic scenes with moving sources, achieving millisecond-scale
computations. By learning a compact surrogate model, we avoid the offline
calculation and storage of impulse responses for all relevant source/listener
pairs. Our experiments, including various complex scene geometries, show good
agreement with reference solutions, with root mean squared errors ranging from
0.02 Pa to 0.10 Pa. Notably, our method signifies a paradigm shift as no prior
machine learning approach has achieved precise predictions of complete wave
fields within realistic domains. We anticipate that our findings will drive

genes in research involving flat string gene formats (i.e., FASTA/FASTQ5).
FASTA/FASTQ files have several current limitations, such as their large file
sizes, slow processing speeds for mapping and alignment, and contextual
dependencies. These challenges significantly hinder investigations and tasks
that involve finding similar sequences. The solution lies in transforming
sequences into an alternative representation that facilitates easier clustering
into similar groups compared to the raw sequences themselves. By assigning a
unique vector embedding to each short sequence, it is possible to more
efficiently cluster and improve upon compression performance for the string
representations of cDNA libraries. Furthermore, through learning alternative
coordinate vector embeddings based on the contexts of codon triplets, we can
demonstrate clustering based on amino acid properties. Finally, using this
sequence embedding method to encode barcodes and cDNA sequences, we can improve
the time complexity of the similarity search by coupling vector embeddings with
an algorithm that determines the proximity of vectors in Euclidean space; this
allows us to perform sequence similarity searches in a quicker and more modular

its study would benefit greatly from multimodal approaches that combine data
from widely varying platforms, e.g., neuroimaging, genetics, and clinical
characterization. Prior neuroimaging-genetic analyses often apply naive feature
concatenation approaches in data-driven work or use the findings from one
modality to guide posthoc analysis of another, missing the opportunity to
analyze the paired multimodal data in a truly unified approach. In this paper,
we develop a more integrative model for combining genetic, demographic, and
neuroimaging data. Inspired by the influence of genotype on phenotype, we
propose using an attention-based approach where the genetic data guides
attention to neuroimaging features of importance for model prediction. The
genetic data is derived from copy number variation parameters, while the
neuroimaging data is from functional magnetic resonance imaging. We evaluate
the proposed approach on ASD classification and severity prediction tasks,
using a sex-balanced dataset of 228 ASD and typically developing subjects in a
10-fold cross-validation framework. We demonstrate that our attention-based
model combining genetic information, demographic data, and functional magnetic
resonance imaging results in superior prediction performance compared to other

of phosphorylation sites is thus an important step for understanding the

PTransIPs. Furthermore, PTransIPs has interpretable amino acid preference,
visible training process and shows generalizability on other bioactivity

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While many studies have assessed the fairness of AI algorithms in the medical
field, the causes of differences in prediction performance are often unknown.
This lack of knowledge about the causes of bias hampers the efficacy of bias
mitigation, as evidenced by the fact that simple dataset balancing still often
performs best in reducing performance gaps but is unable to resolve all
performance differences. In this work, we investigate the causes of gender bias
in machine learning-based chest X-ray diagnosis. In particular, we explore the
hypothesis that breast tissue leads to underexposure of the lungs and causes
lower model performance. Methodologically, we propose a new sampling method
which addresses the highly skewed distribution of recordings per patient in two
widely used public datasets, while at the same time reducing the impact of
label errors. Our comprehensive analysis of gender differences across diseases,
datasets, and gender representations in the training set shows that dataset
imbalance is not the sole cause of performance differences. Moreover, relative
group performance differs strongly between datasets, indicating important
dataset-specific factors influencing male/female group performance. Finally, we
investigate the effect of breast tissue more specifically, by cropping out the
breasts from recordings, finding that this does not resolve the observed
performance gaps. In conclusion, our results indicate that dataset-specific
factors, not fundamental physiological differences, are the main drivers of
male--female performance gaps in chest X-ray analyses on widely used NIH and
CheXpert Dataset.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent years, the field of data-driven neural network-based machine
learning (ML) algorithms has grown significantly and spurred research in its
applicability to instrumentation and control systems. While they are promising
in operational contexts, the trustworthiness of such algorithms is not
adequately assessed. Failures of ML-integrated systems are poorly understood;
the lack of comprehensive risk modeling can degrade the trustworthiness of
these systems. In recent reports by the National Institute for Standards and
Technology, trustworthiness in ML is a critical barrier to adoption and will
play a vital role in intelligent systems' safe and accountable operation. Thus,
in this work, we demonstrate a real-time model-agnostic method to evaluate the
relative reliability of ML predictions by incorporating out-of-distribution
detection on the training dataset. It is well documented that ML algorithms
excel at interpolation (or near-interpolation) tasks but significantly degrade
at extrapolation. This occurs when new samples are "far" from training samples.
The method, referred to as the Laplacian distributed decay for reliability
(LADDR), determines the difference between the operational and training
datasets, which is used to calculate a prediction's relative reliability. LADDR
is demonstrated on a feedforward neural network-based model used to predict
safety significant factors during different loss-of-flow transients. LADDR is
intended as a "data supervisor" and determines the appropriateness of
well-trained ML models in the context of operational conditions. Ultimately,
LADDR illustrates how training data can be used as evidence to support the
trustworthiness of ML predictions when utilized for conventional interpolation
tasks.]]></summary>

I need to use a DL-based Keras Embeddings technique with the Dense layer for text classification (specifically, a Binary Classification problem), along with TF-IDF featurization as input for the Random Forest Algorithm. However, my confusion arises from the fact that the Keras Embedding Layer also serves as a featurization technique. Therefore, I'm uncertain whether this layer should be used as input for the Random Forest or it has the capability to classify text on its own. Second question is that what can be the reason to use Dense Layer and What it is exactly here.

Another possible explanation for the ease with which models are trained is that regularization makes the loss surface flatter and more convex.
  
From my understanding, L2 regularization (or weight decay) indeed adds a convex term λ∣∣w∣∣2 to the loss function, smoothing it out. Additionally, the Hessian matrix becomes more positive with the addition of the regularization term 2λI, giving the function a more convex characteristic.
 However, I'm puzzled as to how other regularization methods like Dropout, L1/Lasso, or Early Stopping might lead to a similarly flatter and more convex loss surface. Can anyone offer insights or explanations on this?

At first everything was great, and we saw a 40% decrease in drop-off rates (which is significant given we were building a consumer facing app), but somehow over time this drop-off rate started creeping up again. Perplexed by the unexpected turn in metrics, management started to question the benefits of maintaining this chatbot and was skeptical that we were cherry picking examples to showcase its performance…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently in the process of developing a stable diffusion/latent diffusion model entirely from scratch. However, I'm a bit confused from the documentation of the original repositories (both from CompVis). My intention is to experiment with significantly smaller models and datasets while retaining the same architecture. Unfortunately, neither repository offers an official configuration for training the txt2img architecture.Through my exploration of the issues, I've observed that the training script provided by the latent diffusion repository does support txt2img (although an official configuration has not been made available yet). I'm curious if any of you might be familiar with better online resources or tutorials that can provide a clearer and more comprehensive understanding of the training process.

 Github: https://github.com/OpenGVLab/Multi-Modality-Arena
 Abstract:
  
Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in tackling complex multimodal tasks. Among these cutting-edge developments, Google's Bard stands out for its remarkable multimodal capabilities, promoting comprehensive comprehension and reasoning across various domains. This work presents an early and holistic evaluation of LVLMs' multimodal abilities, with a particular focus on Bard, by proposing a lightweight variant of LVLM-eHub, named Tiny LVLM-eHub. In comparison to the vanilla version, Tiny LVLM-eHub possesses several appealing properties. Firstly, it provides a systematic assessment of six categories of multimodal capabilities, including visual perception, visual knowledge acquisition, visual reasoning, visual commonsense, object hallucination, and embodied intelligence, through quantitative evaluation of 42 standard text-related visual benchmarks. Secondly, it conducts an in-depth analysis of LVLMs' predictions using the ChatGPT Ensemble Evaluation (CEE), which leads to a robust and accurate evaluation and exhibits improved alignment with human evaluation compared to the word matching approach. Thirdly, it comprises a mere 2.1K image-text pairs, facilitating ease of use for practitioners to evaluate their own offline LVLMs. Through extensive experimental analysis, this study demonstrates that Bard outperforms previous LVLMs in most multimodal capabilities except object hallucination, to which Bard is still susceptible. Tiny LVLM-eHub serves as a baseline evaluation for various LVLMs and encourages innovative strategies aimed at advancing multimodal techniques.

 I have written a post discussion whether or not the hidden size in transformers is an overkill. 
 TLDR;
 I show that an embedding size of 2048 is too much to represent just one token like `is` but rather, it can encode an average 8 tokens with up-to 16 tokens almost losslessly. 
 I think if we can design more compute efficient transformers with some of the ideas that I explore in the post.
 Of course this is not a proper research with ablation studies and empirical analysis. But I would love to hear your thoughts on this topic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Personal Shelf Inspector is an application that helps visually impaired people during their day-to-day shopping. The application is based on a simple neural network and was created as a part of the AI for Accesibility Hackathon in 2020 in Prague.
 We decided to build free tools that make shopping for visually impaired people more accessible. These tools can be implemented in any retail chain within the loyalty app or in-store.

 The Idea
 A visually impaired person only needs their smartphone to use our tools. Personal Shelf Inspector is a web application that reads the price and product name from a price tag. The algorithm selects the price tag closest to the centre of the photo and sends it to the model, which reads the price and product name on the price tag. Then it returns this information to the application, which appears as text on the screen.

 The voice-over built into the user's mobile phone reads this text aloud. The app also helps to read the banknote values and read from a live video.
 What could be other cool ideas and concepts to help making the world more accesible using AI and Machine Learning?

They use ChatGPT/GPT-4 to automatically transform them.
 They define and code rules to automatically transform them.
 They manually transform them (highly improbable)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, we finally ended our journey through Dreamer, and we released the last version, Dreamer V3 in SheepRL.
 Our implementation follows closely the author's one, and is very well documented, with a blog post to explain the details and differences between this version and Dreamer V2.
 Together with Dreamer, we also have Plan2Explore with Dreamer v1 and v2.
 Finally, we completed the integration with Diambra, so you can try your agents on new (funnier) benchmarks.
 Check it out and feel free to contribute. Every feedback is appreciated :)

The algorithm, HelioLinc3D, was explicitly designed for the Vera Rubin Observatory currently under construction in Northern Chile.[1]
 The U.S. Defense Department has created a task force to evaluate and guide the application of generative artificial intelligence for national security purposes, amid an explosion of public interest in the technology.[2]
 China’s largest web and cloud providers (Alibaba, Baidu, ByteDance, and Tencent)are lining up to buy as many Nvidia GPUs as they can while they still can get their hands on them.[3]
 At Black Hat USA 2023, DARPA issued a call to top computer scientists, AI experts, software developers, and beyond to participate in the AI Cyber Challenge (AIxCC) – a two-year competition aimed at driving innovation at the nexus of AI and cybersecurity to create a new generation of cybersecurity tools.[4]

Though some stars oppose their work being mimicked, artists could opt-in to receive royalties in a model akin to how YouTube now pays for user-generated content.
 For Google, AI music would boost its generative AI offerings against competitors. But significant ethical hurdles around consent and IP must still be addressed in developing a legitimate AI music market.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Autonomous robots deployed in the real world will need control policies that rapidly adapt to environmental changes. To this end, we propose AutoRobotics-Zero (ARZ), a method based on AutoML-Zero that discovers zero-shot adaptable policies from scratch. In contrast to neural network adaption policies, where only model parameters are optimized, ARZ can build control algorithms with the full expressive power of a linear register machine. We evolve modular policies that tune their model parameters and alter their inference algorithm on-the-fly to adapt to sudden environmental changes. We demonstrate our method on a realistic simulated quadruped robot, for which we evolve safe control policies that avoid falling when individual limbs suddenly break. This is a challenging task in which two popular neural network baselines fail. Finally, we conduct a detailed analysis of our method on a novel and challenging non-stationary control task dubbed Cataclysmic Cartpole. Results confirm our findings that ARZ is significantly more robust to sudden environmental changes and can build simple, interpretable control policies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Machine perception uses advanced sensors to collect information about the surrounding scene for situational awareness. State-of-the-art machine perception using active sonar, radar, and LiDAR to enhance camera vision faces difficulties when the number of intelligent agents scales up. Exploiting omnipresent heat signals could be a new frontier for scalable perception. However, objects and their environment constantly emit and scatter thermal radiation, leading to textureless images famously known as the ‘ghosting effect’. Thermal vision thus has no specificity limited by information loss, whereas thermal ranging—crucial for navigation—has been elusive even when combined with artificial intelligence (AI). Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate heat-assisted detection and ranging (HADAR) overcoming this open challenge of ghosting and benchmark it against AI-enhanced thermal sensing. HADAR not only sees texture and depth through the darkness as if it were day but also perceives decluttered physical attributes beyond RGB or thermal vision, paving the way to fully passive and physics-aware machine perception. We develop HADAR estimation theory and address its photonic shot-noise limits depicting information-theoretic bounds to HADAR-based AI performance. HADAR ranging at night beats thermal ranging and shows an accuracy comparable with RGB stereovision in daylight. Our automated HADAR thermography reaches the Cramér–Rao bound on temperature accuracy, beating existing thermography techniques. Our work leads to a disruptive technology that can accelerate the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) with HADAR-based autonomous navigation and human–robot social interactions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was watching this talk where they were showing that basically every task in machine learning has been replaced by the transformer architecture. For instance, where a convolution neural network might have been used for image recognition in the past, the predominant strategy now is just to use a transformer instead. How true is this? Is it worth learning any other architecture than transformers for current state of the art research?

 I am looking to spearhead the impending transition of understanding AI/ML at my organization and am looking for community suggestions in courses and bootcamps that could provide a deeper knowledge for some of my work projects in the future. Specifically, I feel unequipped in how to properly test and validate models. 
 I have a computer science background with strong skills in data analytics and programming. I’ve also taken several introductory courses at a high level for AI. 
 Does anyone have suggestions or experiences for 1-4 week long bootcamps or intensive courses? I prefer in-person (anywhere in US) but would also consider live-online remote courses. Price is not a concern. 
 Thanks in advance.

When I tried the experiment with the Wombo dream AI the results were completely random. I wonder what the results would be with Midjourney. I later revisited the experiment in June with the wonder AI and again got intriguing results. Posting this just as an experiment in the hopes others will try it and see if it is repeatable and if other AI have more consistent results than others. It’s just an experiment, I don’t really care about your opinion I care about your results from trying this.

The particular issue revolves around a dynamic action space, where the set of potential actions available changes based on the context or state. In light of this, I am seeking guidance on the feasibility of utilizing the Deep Q-Network (DQN) approach to specifically identify permissible actions for distinct states.
 Furthermore, if the DQN approach is not applicable in this scenario, I would appreciate recommendations for alternative algorithms that could effectively address this issue. Additionally, I am considering the option of designing a single action space and employing negative reward to discourage the agent from pursuing unauthorized actions within specific states.

 Studying Large Language Model Generalization with Influence Functions
 When trying to gain better visibility into a machine learning model in order to understand and mitigate the associated risks, a potentially valuable source of evidence is: which training examples most contribute to a given behavior? Influence functions aim to answer a counterfactual: how would the model's parameters (and hence its outputs) change if a given sequence were added to the training set? While influence functions have produced insights for small models, they are difficult to scale to large language models (LLMs) due to the difficulty of computing an inverse-Hessian-vector product (IHVP). We use the Eigenvalue-corrected Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (EK-FAC) approximation to scale influence functions up to LLMs with up to 52 billion parameters. In our experiments, EK-FAC achieves similar accuracy to traditional influence function estimators despite the IHVP computation being orders of magnitude faster. We investigate two algorithmic techniques to reduce the cost of computing gradients of candidate training sequences: TF-IDF filtering and query batching. We use influence functions to investigate the generalization patterns of LLMs, including the sparsity of the influence patterns, increasing abstraction with scale, math and programming abilities, cross-lingual generalization, and role-playing behavior. Despite many apparently sophisticated forms of generalization, we identify a surprising limitation: influences decay to near-zero when the order of key phrases is flipped. Overall, influence functions give us a powerful new tool for studying the generalization properties of LLMs.

The last few years have seen rapid progress in systems that can automatically process complex business documents and turn them into structured objects. A system that can automatically extract data from documents, e.g., receipts, insurance quotes, and financial statements, has the potential to dramatically improve the efficiency of business workflows by avoiding error-prone, manual work. Recent models, based on the Transformer architecture, have shown impressive gains in accuracy. Larger models, such as PaLM 2, are also being leveraged to further streamline these business workflows. However, the datasets used in academic literature fail to capture the challenges seen in real-world use cases. Consequently, academic b…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There have been many LLM inference solutions since the bloom of open-source LLMs. Most of the performant inference solutions are based on CUDA and optimized for NVIDIA GPUs. In the meantime, with the high demand for compute availability, it is useful to bring support to a broader class of hardware accelerators. AMD is one potential candidate.
 We build a project that makes it possible to compile LLMs and deploy them on AMD GPUs using ROCm and get competitive performance. More specifically, AMD Radeon™ RX 7900 XTX gives 80% of the speed of NVIDIA® GeForce RTX™ 4090 and 94% of the speed of NVIDIA® GeForce RTX™ 3090Ti for single batch Llama2-7B/13B 4bit inference. Besides ROCm, our Vulkan support allows us to generalize LLM deployment to other AMD devices, for example, a SteamDeck with an AMD APU.

"Machine learning" seems like a much clearer term, describing systems that can optimize themselves given an objective function & maybe training data (generalization). 
 But, I know ML is just a subset of AI, so is there any extant AI that isn't ML? If not, what would AI that's not ML look like?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on a RL Environment for my Masther Thesis where i try to explore the use of RL for Architectural Design. The environment looks like a 3D Grid of cubic 3D tiles or modules, and the agent can place tiles by choosing : Location (As x,y,z coordinates) , rotation (0 to 4 as multiples of 90 degrees around a z axis in the center) , and Tile Type (Im experimenting with many sets of tiles with different sizes). Then, I use Grasshopper3D to analyze the radiation that the interior surfaces and other metrics, that i use for my reward calculation. 
 For this, the state of the environment is defined as a 3D Array with 2 channels. One for the Tile Types and one for the rotations. This is processed by a 3D CNN features extractor. 
 The thing is that, I just realized that the array that represents the tile types as integers is actually categorical data, and I don't know how well this could work in a CNN. What i mean by this is that a tile=3 is not any more "anything" that a tile=1, it is just different. 
 Am I doing something stupid then? Should i change it?
 I apologize if im saying something really dumb. I just got into RL few months ago : - )

 [Q] = I am having a bad day
 [R] = I'm sorry to hear that you're having a bad day. Is there anything specific you'd like to talk about or any way I can help you feel better? Whether it's just a listening ear... 
 I am aware that LLMs are not conscious and have no real understanding of emotions. But it is clear from the example that they can produce emotionally appropriate responses. Is there some kind of systematic test that can be automated to verify this? I.e. given a text-based query and response determine if the response is empathetic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're creating voice-enabled products, I hope this will help you choose which model to use!
 I read the papers and docs for Bark and Tortoise TTS - two text-to-speech models that seemed pretty similar on the surface but are actually pretty different.
 Here's what Bark can do:
  
It can synthesize natural, human-like speech in multiple languages.
 Bark can also generate music, sound effects, and other audio.
 The model supports generating laughs, sighs, and other non-verbal sounds to make speech more natural and human-sounding. I find these really compelling and these imperfections make the speech sound much more real. Check out an example here (scroll down to "pizza.webm").
 Bark allows control over tone, pitch, speaker identity and other attributes through text prompts. 
 The model learns directly from text-audio pairs.
  
Whereas for Tortoise TTS:
  
It excels at cloning voices using just short audio samples of a target speaker. This makes it easy to produce text in many distinct voices (like celebrities). I think voice cloning is the best use case for this tool.
 The quality of the synthesized voices is pretty high.
 Tortoise supports fine-grained control of speech characteristics like tone, emotion, pacing, etc through priming text.
 Tortoise is only trained on English and it's not capable of producing sound effects.
  
Here's how they compare to the other speech-related models I've taken a look at so far:
  
 Model Best Use Cases Key Strengths 
  
 Bark Voice assistants, audio generation Flexibility, multilingual 
  Tortoise TTS Audiobooks, voice cloning Natural prosody, voice cloning 
  AudioLDM (full guide) Voice assistants High-quality speech and SFX 
  Whisper Transcription Accuracy, flexibility 
  Free VC Voice conversion Retains speech style 
 
 I have a full write-up here if you want to read more, it's about a 10-minute read. I also looked at the model inputs and outputs and speculated on some products you can build with each tool.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I have an interesting task in hand, and wanted some advice over here before getting my hands dirty.
 I have to compile a list of 15-20 papers, to systematically go from "what's a transformer" to bleeding edge research of multimodal and LLMs applications to robotics, dynamical systems, and RL (e.g. RT-2). The base assumption is that the reader will be a master student, who already has the basics of what deep learning and control theory are.
 Could you suggest possible cornerstone papers that could go in this list? If you could, this would guide my search a lot, and I would appreciate it.

 Script. Script can be turned into machine readable format. You can add commands how to render a movie on the basis of it. For example in a script you could have #Jack, telling the thing reading the script that we are talking of actor #Jack meaning it should tap into assets about jack which would reside in folder Jack. Jack meanwhile could be rendered by sub ai to fit the part.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a regression model based on CNN, works reasonably well with less than 1M parameters. I am trying to check how Visual Transformer (ViT) will perform on this task, but due to lack of pooling in ViT, model size is considerably large (~10M parameters). Do ViT have anything equivalent to pooling to reduce number of parameters?
 If not then that reduces applicability of ViT to large models on large dataset dataset only. For smaller tasks with small dataset, CNN or Resnet are way more computation efficient.
 Or am I missing something?

After that, we spend at least 5 days after R&D for to put a model into production without the required data pipelines that communicate with our model and the service. For training a model, the infrastructure maintain and manage it also needs to be built for around 2 weeks. 
 Currently, our best solution is to offload the training process by purchasing a GPU and keeping it in the office.

 Hi everyone!
 I want to share some interesting observations that indicate a very simple periodical weights resetting procedure could serve as an implicit regularization strategy for training DL models. This technique also shows potential connection with the Double Descent phenomenon. Here's the link to github etc: https://github.com/amcircle/weights-reset.
 As a co-author of this study, I must apologize in advance for its brevity. However, I sincerely hope it may prove useful to some. I would gladly respond to your queries and receive your criticism. Your personal experiences related to something similar would also be highly appreciated.

 I am going through research papers and noticed that most of the papers talk about the text conditioned image generation process (reverse diffusion process). The text and time encodings are added as additional channels to the UNet block.
 However, I am curious to know if any text encodings are used during the training process as well. Is there any preview of the training datasets that is available which is used in the training process ? or a code snippet that points out to the forward part of the training loop
 Thanks

Adaptive computation refers to the ability of a machine learning system to adjust its behavior in response to changes in the environment. While conventional neural networks have a fixed function and computation capacity, i.e., they spend the same number of FLOPs for processing different inputs, a model with adaptive and dynamic computation modulates the computational budget it dedicates to processing each input, depending on the complexity of the input.


Adaptive computation in neural networks is appealing for two key reasons. First, the mechanism that introduces adaptivity provides an inductive bias that can play a key role in solving some challenging tasks. For instance, enabling different num…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 There has been a lot of work on benchmarking autoregressive LLMs, such as HF LLM Leaderboard, but I have not seen much work specifically on the relevancy of such LLMs for retrieval. 
 There is a lot of talk about chat based on knowledge with solutions like llama_index, where LLMs both provide embeddings and answer based on most similar content, but embedding and answer generation need not be the same LLM.
 I saw the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) but it does not seem to contain a lot of information about the recent autoregressive LLMs. 
 Are the recent autoregressive LLMs, e.g. Llama 2, actually performing better than Bidirectional LLMs such as BERT? 
 Because if so, all the recent fancy chat with your documents projects could use much smaller models to do embedding extraction for retrieval and just call a fancy autoregressive LLM such as GPT4 for answer synthesis.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi I'm looking for an open source model that can take an image of an info graphic such as a pie chart, graph, etc, and provide a description of the information in that chart. For example the values of the x,y axis and their labels, weather the chart is increasing or decreasing. 
 I've worked with image captioning models such as BLIP before as I have used them in projects involving stable diffusion, but this model doesn't give specifics about the information in the graph, just a brief overview. 
 I know researches have worked on this problem in the past using the vistext dataset: 
 https://news.mit.edu/2023/researchers-chart-captions-ai-vistext-0630
 So far I'm thinking that it may come to me finetuning BLIP or equivalent to specialize on infographics instead. 
 Thoughts?

I've looked at software such as Photoprism or Librephoto which have object classification but they are based on a static model. I'd like something where I could label a few photos then generate similar matches where I can approve the good matches for reinforcement learning. I'm pretty sure I saw a demo like this at a code conference using Azure but I'm hoping for something self-hosted to avoid API fees. I was exploring coding something to do this for me but I don't want to put in the work if something with a UI exists already. This seemed like the best place to ask.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi - I have trained a pytorch model that does some fairly simple object classification - The goal is distribute it as part of an app, that will pull information from a user's video.
 The videos are typically ~25-30 minutes and about 1GB in size, only a 600x600px square on the bottom right of the video is needed for the classification (it's a minimap in a video game)
 The app is electron based
 Ideally I want to input a video, and extract the labels from the cropped section once per second.
 ​
 My current attempt involves converting the model to a tensorflowjs model, and rendering the video on a <canvas> element, stretching it so only the minimap is visible on the canvas, running the model, saving the labels, and increasing the current time of the video by 1 second, and repeating until the video is done.
 ​
 This seems like a terrible plan, but it's much better than the couple of other ideas I've tried (using ffmpeg to extract a frame every second for example)
 ​
 Any advice appreciated!
 ​
 Edit: just to clarify this will only ever be ran on Windows

 I'm excited to share a project I've been working on over the past few months!
 My primary goal is to create a service that will be beneficial for people. Please share your thoughts on this idea, and suggest any new features you think I should implement!
 Exciting Features:
 • Speak to Write: with this feature, you can speak your thoughts or information and the tool will transcribe it into text. The best part? You can then forward the transcribed text to any application with just one click.
 • Audio to Action Plan: the service can transform a received audio message into a structured list of elements or bullet points. This feature is especially useful for outlining an action plan or item list.
 • Speak in and Language: you can dictate an audio message in your native language, and the service will translate it into any other language, maintaining high translation quality—significantly better than Google Translate.
 • Meeting Transcripts & Summaries: the service is perfect for converting recorded audio from meetings into text and generating concise summaries. It supports the upload of users' files.
 Thank you for taking the time to check it out. I look forward to hearing your feedback. You can access the service by visiting this link: https://audionotes.ai

 In Dyna-Q (image) (which is btw described to be the same as Q-learning when the planning portion is deleted), there doesn't seem to be any iteration over the states of an episode. It just picks a state, applies the e-greedy policy on it to choose the action, learns, updates the model, then plans.
 Would Q-learning also work fine if we got rid of the "episodes" and just picked isolated state-action pairs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello to everyone reading this. 
 I am just about to finish Andrew NG's course 3 courses on ML specialization and I have had 2 courses on ML as well in my Business Intelligence Analytics studies at uni. 
 Now I am extremely interested in ML but I see there are wide diaspora of different subfields you can focus on. I need to get into the job market as fast as possible. So can anyone guide me which aspect of ML should I give most of my time to practice and build portfolio that would translate well to interviews and hiring?
 Thank you

I tried using lexicographic metrics like flesh-kincaid score, etc., but those did not yield proper results. Is there a good method I could use? Also, how could I assess the "readability" of a question, or in other words, how easy it is to understand what the question is asking.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A lot of my PhD work will be in using different types of ML/NN approaches to characterizing problems in my field. It's kind of weird, since for my undergrad I came from a more traditional science background where we research off papers that were written like 2-20 years ago. Since a lot of these architectures and whatever are updating so fast, I wanted to see if there's a good way to keep up with the latest information so my work wouldn't be outdated by the time I publish. Is there a general workflow that those of you in the field follow in regards to this?

I want it to talk more when it does talk. It feels like a nice break in the music to have the AI talk like a radio host. I'm sure some people would rather that not being a feature (if they use it at all), but I'd love for it to have some more comedic one-liners, possible news updates, and potentially traffic updates based on location and if it knows you're driving. Would be awesome! 
 It's also a really good tool for if you want to listen to music you've not heard before. Whether it's part of your usual genre or not.
 Looking forward to seeing how this progresses!

 I am an artist. And programmer, and kind of a bit of everything. But what is important, is that I was an artist before the current "generative AI" was a thing, and I have been drawing, digitally and traditionally alike for like... a decade?
 Art, to me, is getting what is inside your head, and presenting it to others outside of your consciousness and thoughts. It's showing the world a piece of your interpretation, your experience, your impressions of the world you inhabit. It's about communicating to others your emotions, your ideas, your thoughts and feelings.
 Not everyone can draw, or paint, or sculpt. I could say "learn it, it's easy", but that would be a lie. It isn't easy. It is years upon years of constant, hard work, requiring focus and dedication, and a passion for l…]]></summary>

 Very interesting blog post from OpenCV.ai team about how can explore ChatGPT to serve for code development debugging.
 Introduction from the article:
 As programmers, we often work with familiar development environments, but occasionally we encounter new tools that can be time-consuming and challenging to learn. In such situations, having virtual assistance can be extremely beneficial.
 In this article, I will share my experience of contributing to OpenCV, a renowned open-source library, despite having limited knowledge of C++ and understanding its architecture. I achieved this with the assistance of ChatGPT, a Large Language Model (LLM).
 I hope you can find it interesting. More details are here.

Then, from May 2023 onwards, a trend of doing just SFT with high-quality data showed up (e.g. "LIMA: Less Is More for Alignment" https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11206) as an alternative to doing RLHF.
 What's your opinion on these two narratives? Is RLHF likely to still be relevant even in the presence of SFT with high-quality data?

Because of this I always feel like I have to catch up to my colleagues when it comes to ML and in parts also computer science knowledge. It feels like there are a million things to learn and many small details to know that I am not even sure how to look up.
 I am curious what your experience has been if you were/are in a similar situation? How did you manage to catch up?

 This paper aims to provide an in-depth explanation of representing and propagating wavefunctions in a hierarchical manner using Gaussian basis functions. Wavefunctions are mathematical descriptions of the quantum states of physical systems and are fundamental to quantum mechanics. However, representing complex wavefunctions for real-world quantum systems remains a key challenge. This paper proposes using multiple layers of Gaussian basis functions, with trainable amplitudes, to represent wavefunctions in a hierarchical fashion and enable wavefunction propagation between layers.
 Understanding wavefunction representation and propagation has significant implications in diverse fields like quantum computing, quantum chemistry, and materials science. Efficient wavefunction man…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been researching the Evol-Instruct datasets now for a few days and have decided I want to build my own out for a specific use case.
 I’ve read literally everything possible, admittedly not much outside of WizardLM and GeorgiaTech, but I’ve read it.
 I was hoping to discuss it here with smarter people. 
 I’m seeing this as a way to use LLMs to generate great datasets. However, my use case doesn’t really exist in any models yet. Not thoroughly enough to produce a good Evol-Instruct set. So, I’m going to do that tomorrow.
 I’m going to use The Blokes WizardCoder-Guanaco 15b GPTQ version to train on my specific dataset - about 10GB of clean, really strong data I’ve spent 3-4 weeks putting together.
 In theory, I’ll use the Evol-Instruct script from WizardLM to generate the new dataset, and then I’ll apply that to whatever model I decide to use. There is a good chance I train my own on general Evol-Instruct datasets available now, and likely quite a large one.
 I’m looking for any tips, discussion, ideas, thoughts from the community. 
 Cheers!

 We made an editor called Gamut that lets you enter your ideas in any form you want. Bullets, carefully constructed paragraphs, it doesn’t matter. Then, our patent-pending technology lets you convert to prose and adjust, shaping the text like a graphic designer shapes an image.
 We want r/MachineLearning's advice and field experience, because tbh we're just a bunch of teenagers who haven't even gone to college yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was just watching the documentary about the 'greatest movie never made', director Alejandro Jodorowsky's vision of Frank Herbert's Dune.
 There is a huge book that contains a storyboard version of the movie with lots of production art by artists Moebius, Chris Foss and HR Giger.
 The movie was to star Jodorowsky's son as Paul Atriedes, Salvadore Dali as the Emperor, Orson Wells as Baron Harkonnen and Mick Jagger as Feyd.
 Could one of today's AIs be 'fed' Jodorowsky's book and create a movie of his vision?
 Curious to know what your opinions are on this.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, all,
 I would like to use batch reaction trend data to build a regression model. I'm wondering what is the best way to approach this.
 Here's some background:
 Reaction Data: 
  
 Time (min) Pressure (bar) Temperature (°C) Flow (kg/h) Gas Total (kg) 
  
 1 10 70 502 8 
  2 10.1 71 498 16 
  ... ... ... ... ... 
  102 10.3 76 475 850 
 
 Output: Polymer property X
 The reaction continues until a gas total is met and the time this takes depends on the other variables.
 I have ~700 batches of data in a format similar to the above and would like to predict polymer property X. As the variables can change minute to minute I was thinking of binning the variables into 5 minute bins using the mean and using these as variables for linear regression or similar.
 Is this a valid approach or is there another way I can approach the problem?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alexander Amini, a Postdoctoral Associate at MIT, well known for the MIT's Introduction to Deep Learning Course, published a git repo called CAPSA for uncertainty prediction. This was introduced during the online course. The code was released under Thermis AI, Inc, a private company. He is the co-founder and CSO of the company. You can check how well the code was documented in the wayback machine. Recently, they removed the code base from the github and launched a pro version with selected companies as beta. The original repo (now called capsa-lite) was a great learning tool that I wanted to use. This was a quick way to try out different methods of uncertainty prediction using minimal code. Unfortunately, they have pulled all previous version of the code from the github repo. I was wondering if anyone knows a similar python package or has the old repo - would be really helpful!

 I've got a couple of questions specifically regarding the motherboard. One concern I have is whether the space between the two GPUs is sufficient, as I'm planning to set them up using NVLink. Additionally, I'm curious about the compatibility of the case and motherboard for effective air cooling ( not considering water cooling at the moment). Anyone else with dual 3090s who can give some insights on how they've managed temperatures and potential overheating issues?
 Lastly, would upgrading to a Ryzen 9 5900X prevent me from bottlenecking the GPU's? 
 Would love to hear your feedback and suggestions!

 I'm about to graduate in Physics (PhD). I am an experimentalist with a background in electromagnetic. I am trying to apply for jobs, but there are some few options for physicists (based on my geography). So, I am trying to learn some new skill for my future job. One option would be Machine Learning, which is on-demand and the field is growing. The other option is Quantum Computing. I can start a postdoc in quantum information theory as well.
 Each path, has its pros and cons, and the final decision is based on many factors. I just don't have enough data and information to say which one is more secure in the future? Which one has less compete? And also, is it possible to get hired without any serious project in ML, and just self-taught?
 If you were me, which one would you pick?

 I'm looking apply to some top masters for machine learning in the UK, so I'm guessing you know which one I'm referring to. 
 I got some guidance from the application advisor, which state they like to look at the transcript the most to have an idea of my linear algebra, calculus and statistics ability. I got 70% in "Maths for Computer Science" and some other modules I strong first and 2:1 in some others, but in general my course wasn't too mathematically intensive. I did BSc Computer Science. I have been working as SWE the past 3 years. 
 I have completed the following specialisation "Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science Specialization" and read "Mathematics for Machine Learning", as learning about mathematics actually got me into ML. I have also covered the videos on 3Blue1Brown etc. The application advisor said that certs don't really mean too much which is understandable. I can't change the past in terms of BSc transcript, therefore I was thinking a project may be a good way to showcase this.
 Any tips on how to best showcase this or get across my ability would be extremely helpful?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve used several AI programs that work excellent on blurred/pixelated photos of human faces but beyond that, I have not had success finding a program that can render animals in similar way. I’m more looking for something that can make the quality of a pixelated photo of say, a dog, non pixelated. Or at least, much less pixelated. 
 The images I’m trying to use are just absolutely horrible and not fixable, or I am just not using the best programs for my purposes. Or the programs I’m looking for simply do not exist yet. 
 If you have any recommendations (Paid or free programs) please do share! I have a MacBook and an iPhone if that helps.
 Thank you! 💕

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks.
 I am sure you know the running gags around “thin OpenAI wrapper” products. Instead of more toy products, I am doing an experiment with some “AI engineering” to come up with a solution that’s closer to being usable in actual production cases.
 My background is in project management and data engineering, and I’ve built large systems for big companies and worked as a consultant in the space.
 I’ve seen enough crappy data pipelines for a lifetime.
 Hence.
 I want to do something different: A thin AI wrapper is not sufficient for having reliable data pipelines that use OpenAI for schema management and inference
 So this leaves me with the following doubts:
 ​
  
How to scale code horizontally and vertically? Using third-party solutions? SNS/SQS/Kafka?
 How to log and trace? Langsmith? Custom solutions?
 How to extend reliably with my own data, and make it stateful?
  
Looking for your perspective
 ​
  
What do you think about the state of data engineering, MLOps, and infrastructure in AI companies?
 What do you think about how to scale properly the systems and prepare them for the future?
 In this code here, I do process some PDFs as a simple pipeline, what approaches do you think could be better?
  
My current thinking and the state of the project
 ​
  
I should create a formal scale of usability. I am looking for your input here.
 I should improve model consistency, extends the model with custom domain knowledge, and make an early attempt to build simple user agents in the domain
 What I have is a schema inference, contracting basics, and a way to structure unstructured data
 I’m about to create a memory component that manages the data stored in vector dbs, as a DWH for AI
 If I bring this use case that was not something available easily to the public before, how best do it?

 I got 2x 4090 RTX with 24GB GDDR each.I often ran into the problem of
 CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate X MiB (GPU 0; 23.65 GiB total capacity; 22.75 GiB already allocated; 96.81 MiB free; 22.76 GiB reserved in total by PyTorch) 
 I wonder if there is a way to take usage of both GPUs so the model is split onto both GPUs.
 When training models I use torch.nn.DataParallel to use both GPUs, but it seems like I am not doing it right for load the model.
 Can anyone help me? Both GPUs are available in the system - this has already been checked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[humanscript is an inferpreter. A script interpreter that infers commands from natural language using AI. There is no predefined syntax, humanscripts just say what they want to happen, and when you execute them, it happens.
 https://github.com/lukechilds/humanscript
 This is a humanscript called tidy-screenshots. It takes an unorganised directory of screenshots and organises them into directories based on the month the screenshot was taken.It can be executed like any other script.
 https://preview.redd.it/2b0oz2kgwogb1.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=9285805a1d0668ae5fe300857f9b67161b8ecda4
 The LLM inferpreted the humanscript into the following bash script at runtime.
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/x8hwdrzhwogb1.png?width=2188&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fcba87a9606a446d169e8ae37b5c8c251525e5e
 The code is streamed out of the LLM during inferpretation and executed line by line so execution is not blocked waiting for inference to finish. The generated code is cached on first run and will be executed instantly on subsequent runs, bypassing the need for reinferpretation.
 ​
 https://i.redd.it/t6b1stbkwogb1.gif
 The humanscript inferpreter supports a wide range of LLM backends. It can be used with cloud hosted LLMs like OpenAI's GTP-3.5 and GPT-4 or locally running open source LLMs like Llama 2.
 You can run humanscript in a sandboxed Docker environment with a single command if you want to have a play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks,
 For the past 2 years I've been working on a library to automate the most tedious part of my own work - data loading, normalisation, typing, schema creation, retries, schema inference, evolution & ddl generation, self deployment.. Basically, as you build better and better pipelines you will want more and more, and dlt supports those options.
 The value proposition of this library is to automate the tedious work you do, so you can focus on better things. 
 What's special about dlt?
 In the easiest form, you shoot response.json() json at a function and it auto manages the typing normalisation and loading, kind of like a pandas df.to_sql() but with auto schema inference, versioning and evolution. It supports loading to files, databases, and soon table formats and vector dbs.
 In its most complex form, you can do almost anything you can want, from memory management, microbatching, multithreading, extraction DAGs, 1 line Airflow/git actions deployment, dbt runner, streamlit app for data discovery, sql client, atomic state dictionaries, etc.
 The library is in use with early adopters, and we are now working on expanding our feature set to accommodate the larger community. We are adding Athena + Iceberg and Weaviate vector dbs next.
 Free forever
 The library is open source and will forever be open source. We will not gate any features for the sake of monetisation - instead we will take a more kafka/confluent approach where the eventual paid offering would be supportive not competing.
 Call for Feedback!
 Feedback is very welcome and so are requests for features or destinations.
 I would particularly love to hear from you: What destinations are you looking for from such a tool? And what use cases do you usually have? I'm a data engineer so my knowledge is more around loading external sources to a common space.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Staying on top of all changes, tools, and best practices with AI is getting increasingly hard. Each week I find just 1 piece of information that is most interesting across research, products, business news, and many more. No fluff guaranteed.
 Sharing the top research from this week's edition:
 https://preview.redd.it/fa3b1u39nlgb1.png?width=591&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ccd78136e3578396878fd9641605845f0309865
 Summary: Meta released their latest open-source model, Llama 2, in partnership with Microsoft’s Azure platform. But Microsoft also offers OpenAI models and is a major investor in the company (they paid $14B for 49%). So, confused Matt asks, why would Microsoft partner with Meta, when it might undermine their investment in OpenAI?
 💡 Answering the question:
  
Spreading the risk: OpenAI may have the first mover advantages, but this does not always last (e.g. Blackberry, Myspace, Yahoo). Microsoft is betting on AI but keeps the chips diversified on multiple players.
 It’s beside the point: regardless of who Microsoft supports, their game is to attract all AI utilization on Azure. It's not about the tools but about the CPU/GPU cycles they can charge for. smart!
 The real AI gangsta: Microsoft is sitting on the holy trinity of AI now.
  
 Exclusive partnerships with top LLMs (OpenAI, Meta)
 Priority access to Nvidia GPUs
 And strategic assets like GitHub and Azure

 I have been working on an OpenAI-compatible API for serving LLAMA-2 models written entirely in Rust. It supports offloading computation to Nvidia GPU and Metal acceleration for GGML models !
 Here is the project link: Cria- Local LLAMA2 API
 You can use it as an OpenAI replacement (check out the included `Langchain` example in the project).
 This is an ongoing project, I have implemented the `embeddings` and `completions` routes. The `chat-completion` route will be here very soon!
 Really interested in your feedback and I would welcome any help :) !

I have 20 days of interaction history and it's generated sales, recorded for past 2 years. I have to predict for the next 20 working days(1 month)
 So far, I have tried ensemble methods, svm, fully connected nn, etc. But it is quite apparent that these are not good solutions.

More specifically, I want to build a food supply management app for restaurants for my school thesis. This app will use AI to analyse food supplies and assign them purchase priority, value, and complexity scores (maybe just priority if it's too hard). Restaurant owners could then determine what foods should be purchased before others based on the priority scores.
 For example, a restaurant may only have 10 tomatoes left and the average usage of tomatoes in this restaurant is 12 per week. Based on this, a priority would be assigned to purchase x amount of tomatoes.
 Other factors that could be taken into account for the prior…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://imgur.com/WR0Tny9
 My agent needs to learn to take one action in my environment and there are only two possible actions that the agent can take at each time step. The state is just the time step, so every episode has 240 time steps and the agent just needs to learn to take one optimal action out of two possible actions for every time step. I have set this up as simply as I can as a starting point to make sure the algorithm is implemented correctly and that the agent can learn. I am using n-step expected SARSA.
 The bottom plot shows the count for how many times the agent took each action during each episode. The middle plot has the temporal difference error in blue and the "modelling error" in orange. The modelling error is the difference between the actual discounted return and the TD target for each time step, summed up for each episode. The red line is the return that the agent would get if it took the optimal action in every time step.
 0.11, the blue line in the bottom plot, is the optimal action for the agent to take at every time step. The other action will never result in a reward other than 0. So it should be fairly simple for the agent to learn what action to take at every time step and it does learn that at the start. But then, as you can see in the top plot, the agent suddenly starts taking the non-optimal action more often after around episode 450. So I'm just wondering why that would happen. Why would the agent learn to take the optimal action at most time steps and then suddenly decide that it will start taking other actions?
 For more context, the learning rate is 0.6, n is 6, epsilon is decayed by 1/(n_episodes/1.1) every episode so it reaches 0 slightly before the final episode.
 Any ideas based on this information why the agent would decide to start taking the non-optimal action? Or any suggestions for how I could figure out why it would start taking the non-optimal action?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings fellow researchers,
 I am 27, currently working remotely at a healthcare IT company based in Silicon Valley (6+ years in industrial research) where I apply deep learning methods and large language models. I recently received an exciting opportunity to pursue a PhD at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) in a similar research area. 
 While I am grateful for my current position and compensation, Have published in NeurIPS, EMNLP, ACL, ACM etc (NLP) with really good citations under company. I feel unsatisfied with the learning opportunities available in company & industry.
 I am strongly considering pursuing the DTU PhD program full-time, but wanted to get perspectives from others before making a decision. How strong is DTU's AI research community?
 Given the rapid advances in large language models, is now an ideal time to immerse myself in academic research? There are many topics that interest me, including fairness, ethics, hallucinations, quantization, specialized domains like healthcare/finance, and federated learning combined with LLMs.
 Would appreciate any insights on whether moving into academia would be a wise choice at this stage versus remaining in industry. I welcome any suggestions or considerations I should keep in mind. 
 Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts!

 I've heard that there are some great options, but I've only seen some web paid services, and for my purpose, it's too expensive just to get an audiobook out of it. This is all just for personal use.

 I'm working on an RNN-based model that should learn how to guess the next character given a simple prompt based on all scripts from Friends to generate non-existing Friends dialogue. It is heavily inspired by Andrej Karpathy's blog post on RNN's. I'm mostly doing this for training, and because it's pretty fun.
 I have a little experience with deep learning in the sense that I am familiar with most common architectures and have intermediate understanding of how deep learning models work and are trained. I haven't created many models from scratch though, yet.
 Network
 My GRU is fairly simple. I'll save you the exact code, but instead give a systematic overview of all network layers. It's implemented with Pytorch:

 I'm looking to add a functionality that can recognize and highlight underlined words within the scanned pages. I initially thought this would be a common feature and expected to find existing open-source solutions or libraries that I could use. To my surprise, I've been unable to find any. 
 I am just really bad at finding it, or is this not as straightforward as I initially thought?

 I am have compiled a high quality Q&A dataset (around 1200 entries) for a domain specific topic.
 What's the best course of action here to use LLM with that specific knowledge base?
 1) Finetuning a model? if so which one is a good candidate? OpenAI let's me finetune some models and later, all my users have to do is use pass the model name to the API
 2) Use the regular vector database + embeddings for augmented retrieval
 
 I prefer (1) but I am not sure how it will perform.
 Option (2) should work, since we really just use semantic search to bring in context to the LLM, etc.
 I hope you can say that (1) works nicely, if not please help me learn why.
 Thank you in advance!

 What if we gave AI access to web browser, and let it do whatever it wants? It could create accounts on any social media, email accounts, ad comments everywhere and such.
 of course, ai by itself does not have any agenda or need to do anything, so ai would need to be fed some kind of personality simulation first. Lets say ai was either fed personality based on extensive twitter or reddit history of someone's post. Using that, basic psychological traits, beliefs and maybe goals could be determined.
 Such ai would simulate person sitting in front of pc, so it would need to parse the content of webpages, but i don't think it would be that of a problem. And it would maybe also have access to some bank account with some money to maybe pay for online subscriptions and such. But who knows, maybe thanks to simulating someone's personality, it would attempt to donate money to some charity or lose it on onlyfans?

The University of Hong Kong is supporting this by giving teachers and students free access to various generative AI tools, including Microsoft Azure OpenAI and OpenAI’s ChatGPT and DALL-E.[1]
 Intel’s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, has called NVIDIA the clear market leader who has done a great job within the AI space.[2]
 AI powerhouse, OpenAI has released some new features for its sensational chatbot, ChatGPT. The new features allow the chatbot to show suggested follow-up prompts at the bottom of its responses. The new features were announced by the company via a tweet on its official Twitter handle.[3]
 Asian Americans and women in the workforce are the most concentrated in fields where AI could assist or replace their job tasks, according to new research.[4]

 So, I thought it wisest to reach out to the community for advice or clarity.

 I've collected about 15 GB of data over the last month. It's incredibly clean and well-organized. The core goal of the data is to train a model to solve or assist with a particular development problem. This means that much of my data is a code/natural language mix. It's delimited clearly, and the formatting is uniform. The entire dataset has been normalized and standardized. It's taken me a lot of time to produce and that's…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SARSA is a TD algorithm for control (learning optimal policies). In the book it's written like this: image. The idea is to learn the action-value function instead of the value function for a policy that we keep improving (using GPI). Once we learn the converged action-value function for all states, the optimal policy is greedily derived from the action-value function (basically take the most promising action at each state).
 In contrast, TD for value estimation is written like this: image. Here we keep the policy fixed and just keep iterating over the multiple episodes, whilst refining the value estimate.
 My question is, why can't we just change TD for value estimation to just greedily update the policy at each stage? That would be in the spirit of generalized policy iteration (GPI) too. In other words, a version of SARSA which doesn't use action-value functions, but instead use value functions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 With the recent boom of LLMs, we have seen both ends of the spectrum advance at a very fast pace, from OpenAI GPT4, which runs on huge data centers operated by Azure, to llama.cpp, which runs on consumer laptops.
 While both have their pros and cons, for instance, open-source models on decentralized compute reduce the need to trust or rely on centralized actors like Cloud providers, the efficiency of running training/inference on personal setups is not often discussed.
 I am therefore interested in learning how more energy/cost efficient it is to train/serve AI models on data centers vs doing it on personal computers. 
 Do you know if there have been studies? 
 In theory, I guess that several factors, such as economies of scale, use of renewable energy sources in some data centers, such as Canada, advanced cooling systems and advanced hardware, make data centers more cost/energy efficient.
 I guess some modeling on a precise use case where we fix some variables could help have an idea. For instance, one could ask, what is the energy/cost/time needed to predict 1 billion tokens from a Llama 2 70B in a data center with X amount of A100s, vs on Y different consumer CPU / GPUs.
 If anyone has references to models or past studies I would be quite interested. Of course, using data centers implies trusting those people, but I am not considering that factor for this discussion as I am focusing on understanding best what is the best setup to have optimal enrgy/cost/time for AI.

I used Midjourney, Runway Gen-2, StableDiffusion, Premiere, After Effects. The movie it's called "The Phoenix", which hints at the film's underlying theme of rising from the ashes, symbolizing female empowerment, all wrapped in a bit of sarcastic humor from a male perspective. 
 I'm sharing because I genuinely want to know what you guys think. Any and all thoughts are welcome.
 If you're curious about the workflow or the process behind the creation of this trailer, I'd be happy to share more.

 I would like to learn how to do that with some peers happy to help me.
 As said this would be my first attempt. About me: I only followed Deep Learning theoretical courses from Andrew Ng and never built or used existing models so I'd appreciate some guidance if you are interested to support. Thanks a lot

 Clipping makes sense as there is no interpretation for pixel values which exceed these limits.
 On the other hand, the problem with clipping is that if the added noise is clipped, you are not adding truly gaussian noise, which seems problematic as much of the theory behind diffusion models assumes true gaussian noise. 
 Any ideas about what is done in practice, and whether or not this has implications from a theoretical standpoint?

 So I am currently creating a dataset in a team of three. This dataset is aimed to create a object detection model for around 11 classes. We have aimed to label around approx. 4000. Our current workflow is a couple of scripts scraping from Pinterest and using Label Studio for labeling. We labeled approx. 25% to our goal but realized that we are about to burn out. We'd prefer that whatever solution there is is self hosted and not paid.
 Thoughts? is there some kind of workflow we are missing to create a dataset?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 I'm interested in redesigning my application to utilize an open-source embeddings model and a different vector DB. My current issue with embeddings is that processing large volumes of data into a vector DB using ada-002 is unreliable, with frequent API timeouts occurring or issues interacting with Pinecone. This is super problematic as it's difficult to track which data has / hasn't been stored correctly. I also know that many open-source embeddings models are more performant and will allow for more long term control over my data. 
 However, the advantage of using OpenAI / Pinecone has of course been simplicity in production and not having to worry about queries / retrieval working efficiently. To give context, I'm dealing with a large volume of documents, such that if I were to embed my documents into a FAISS index with a small sentence transformers model, it would constitute 12GB, so a really simple solution like storing within the same application database is probably a no-go.
 In initiating this switch, I want to know the best approach towards: 
 A) Utilizing an open-source embeddings model in a production context (is it best to host as an API via a cloud provider and what are some considerations I should think about? What's a fast / reliable way of setting this up? I would like prioritise a more simple approach if possible.) 
 B) What Vector DB I should be looking into as an alternative and what's the best way to achieve self-hosted so that it would be equally performant compared to hosted services like pinecone (Docker? AWS?)?

in engineering design, aided with the rapid growth of machine learning in
applied science. This paper presents an unsupervised machine learning algorithm
to extract defining characteristics of earthquake ground-motion spectra, also
called latent features, to aid in ground-motion selection (GMS). In this
context, a latent feature is a low-dimensional machine-discovered spectral
characteristic learned through nonlinear relationships of a neural network
autoencoder. Machine discovered latent features can be combined with
traditionally defined intensity measures and clustering can be performed to
select a representative subgroup from a large ground-motion suite. The
objective of efficient GMS is to choose characteristic records representative
of what the structure will probabilistically experience in its lifetime. Three
examples are presented to validate this approach, including the use of
synthetic and field recorded ground-motion datasets. The presented deep
embedding clustering of ground-motion spectra has three main advantages: 1.
defining characteristics the represent the sparse spectral content of
ground-motions are discovered efficiently through training of the autoencoder,
2. domain knowledge is incorporated into the machine learning framework with
conditional variables in the deep embedding scheme, and 3. method exhibits
excellent performance when compared to a benchmark seismic hazard analysis.]]></summary>

system models that are sufficiently accurate in all relevant state-space
regions. These models must also be computationally cheap enough to ensure
real-time tractability. Data-driven surrogate models for mechanistic models can
be used to reduce the computational burden of (e)NMPC; however, such models are
typically trained by system identification for maximum average prediction
accuracy on simulation samples and perform suboptimally as part of actual
(e)NMPC. We present a method for end-to-end reinforcement learning of dynamic
surrogate models for optimal performance in (e)NMPC applications, resulting in
predictive controllers that strike a favorable balance between control
performance and computational demand. We validate our method on two
applications derived from an established nonlinear continuous stirred-tank
reactor model. We compare the controller performance to that of MPCs utilizing
models trained by the prevailing maximum prediction accuracy paradigm, and
model-free neural network controllers trained using reinforcement learning. We
show that our method matches the performance of the model-free neural network
controllers while consistently outperforming models derived from system
identification. Additionally, we show that the MPC policies can react to
changes in the control setting without retraining.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Continual learning is a promising machine learning paradigm to learn new
tasks while retaining previously learned knowledge over streaming training
data. Till now, rehearsal-based methods, keeping a small part of data from old
tasks as a memory buffer, have shown good performance in mitigating
catastrophic forgetting for previously learned knowledge. However, most of
these methods typically treat each new task equally, which may not adequately
consider the relationship or similarity between old and new tasks. Furthermore,
these methods commonly neglect sample importance in the continual training
process and result in sub-optimal performance on certain tasks. To address this
challenging problem, we propose Relational Experience Replay (RER), a bi-level
learning framework, to adaptively tune task-wise relationships and sample
importance within each task to achieve a better `stability' and `plasticity'
trade-off. As such, the proposed method is capable of accumulating new
knowledge while consolidating previously learned old knowledge during continual
learning. Extensive experiments conducted on three publicly available datasets
(i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet) show that the proposed method
can consistently improve the performance of all baselines and surpass current
state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

significant effectiveness for different downstream tasks by exploring both
complementary information and consistent information among multiple graphs.
However, previous methods usually overlook the issues in practical
applications, i.e., the out-of-sample issue and the noise issue. To address the
above issues, in this paper, we propose an effective and efficient UMGL method
to explore both complementary and consistent information. To do this, our
method employs multiple MLP encoders rather than graph convolutional network
(GCN) to conduct representation learning with two constraints, i.e., preserving
the local graph structure among nodes to handle the out-of-sample issue, and
maximizing the correlation of multiple node representations to handle the noise
issue. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
superior effectiveness and efficiency over the comparison methods and
effectively tackles those two issues. Code is available at

preservation of distributed data has attracted considerable attention in recent
years. To address this issue, we propose a data collaboration quasi-experiment
(DC-QE) that enables causal inference from distributed data with privacy
preservation. In our method, first, local parties construct
dimensionality-reduced intermediate representations from the private data.
Second, they share intermediate representations, instead of private data for
privacy preservation. Third, propensity scores were estimated from the shared
intermediate representations. Finally, the treatment effects were estimated
from propensity scores. Our method can reduce both random errors and biases,
whereas existing methods can only reduce random errors in the estimation of
treatment effects. Through numerical experiments on both artificial and
real-world data, we confirmed that our method can lead to better estimation
results than individual analyses. Dimensionality-reduction loses some of the
information in the private data and causes performance degradation. However, we
observed that in the experiments, sharing intermediate representations with
many parties to resolve the lack of subjects and covariates, our method
improved performance enough to overcome the degradation caused by
dimensionality-reduction. With the spread of our method, intermediate
representations can be published as open data to help researchers find

human learning. Learning paradigms such as transfer learning, meta learning,

prevalent trait in the literature. There are numerous research papers that
focus on each of these learning paradigms separately and provide a

research studies that combine (two of) these learning algorithms. This survey
describes how these techniques are combined to solve problems in many different
fields of study, including computer vision, natural language processing,
hyperspectral imaging, and many more, in supervised setting only. As a result,
the global generic learning network an amalgamation of meta learning, transfer

few-shot learning - is a central aspect of intelligent agents. Classical
few-shot benchmarks make use of few-shot samples from a single modality, but
such samples may not be sufficient to characterize an entire concept class. In
contrast, humans use cross-modal information to learn new concepts efficiently.
In this work, we demonstrate that one can indeed build a better ${\bf visual}$
dog classifier by ${\bf read}$ing about dogs and ${\bf listen}$ing to them
bark. To do so, we exploit the fact that recent multimodal foundation models
such as CLIP are inherently cross-modal, mapping different modalities to the
same representation space. Specifically, we propose a simple cross-modal
adaptation approach that learns from few-shot examples spanning different
modalities. By repurposing class names as additional one-shot training samples,
we achieve SOTA results with an embarrassingly simple linear classifier for
vision-language adaptation. Furthermore, we show that our approach can benefit
existing methods such as prefix tuning, adapters, and classifier ensembling.
Finally, to explore other modalities beyond vision and language, we construct
the first (to our knowledge) audiovisual few-shot benchmark and use cross-modal
training to improve the performance of both image and audio classification.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Efficient exploration in complex environments remains a major challenge for
reinforcement learning (RL). Compared to previous Thompson sampling-inspired
mechanisms that enable temporally extended exploration, i.e., deep exploration,
we focus on deep exploration in distributional RL. We develop here a general
purpose approach, Bag of Policies (BoP), that can be built on top of any return
distribution estimator by maintaining a population of its copies. BoP consists
of an ensemble of multiple heads that are updated independently. During
training, each episode is controlled by only one of the heads and the collected
state-action pairs are used to update all heads off-policy, leading to distinct
learning signals for each head which diversify learning and behaviour. To test
whether optimistic ensemble method can improve on distributional RL as did on
scalar RL, by e.g. Bootstrapped DQN, we implement the BoP approach with a
population of distributional actor-critics using Bayesian Distributional Policy
Gradients (BDPG). The population thus approximates a posterior distribution of
return distributions along with a posterior distribution of policies. Another
benefit of building upon BDPG is that it allows to analyze global posterior
uncertainty along with local curiosity bonus simultaneously for exploration. As
BDPG is already an optimistic method, this pairing helps to investigate if
optimism is accumulatable in distributional RL. Overall BoP results in greater
robustness and speed during learning as demonstrated by our experimental
results on ALE Atari games.]]></summary>

feature representations from unlabeled data, without the requirement of
annotating every sample. Enabling unsupervised representation learning is
extremely crucial for time series data, due to its unique annotation bottleneck
caused by its complex characteristics and lack of visual cues compared with
other data modalities. In recent years, unsupervised representation learning
techniques have advanced rapidly in various domains. However, there is a lack
of systematic analysis of unsupervised representation learning approaches for
time series. To fill the gap, we conduct a comprehensive literature review of
existing rapidly evolving unsupervised representation learning approaches for
time series. Moreover, we also develop a unified and standardized library,
named ULTS (i.e., Unsupervised Learning for Time Series), to facilitate fast
implementations and unified evaluations on various models. With ULTS, we
empirically evaluate state-of-the-art approaches, especially the rapidly
evolving contrastive learning methods, on 9 diverse real-world datasets. We
further discuss practical considerations as well as open research challenges on
unsupervised representation learning for time series to facilitate future

tissue, core, and salvageable tissue, penumbra, in acute ischemic stroke (AIS)
patients are of significant clinical interest. They play an essential role in
improving diagnosis and treatment planning. Computed Tomography (CT) scan is
one of the primary modalities for early assessment in patients with suspected
AIS. CT Perfusion (CTP) is often used as a primary assessment to determine
stroke location, severity, and volume of ischemic lesions. Current automatic
segmentation methods for CTP mostly use already processed 3D parametric maps
conventionally used for clinical interpretation by radiologists as input.
Alternatively, the raw CTP data is used on a slice-by-slice basis as 2D+time
input, where the spatial information over the volume is ignored. In addition,
these methods are only interested in segmenting core regions, while predicting
penumbra can be essential for treatment planning. This paper investigates
different methods to utilize the entire 4D CTP as input to fully exploit the
spatio-temporal information, leading us to propose a novel 4D convolution
layer. Our comprehensive experiments on a local dataset of 152 patients divided
into three groups show that our proposed models generate more precise results
than other methods explored. Adopting the proposed 4D mJ-Net, a Dice
Coefficient of 0.53 and 0.23 is achieved for segmenting penumbra and core
areas, respectively. The code is available on

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This paper focusses on the optimal implementation of a Mean Variance
Estimation network (MVE network) (Nix and Weigend, 1994). This type of network
is often used as a building block for uncertainty estimation methods in a
regression setting, for instance Concrete dropout (Gal et al., 2017) and Deep
Ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017). Specifically, an MVE network assumes
that the data is produced from a normal distribution with a mean function and
variance function. The MVE network outputs a mean and variance estimate and
optimizes the network parameters by minimizing the negative loglikelihood. In
our paper, we present two significant insights. Firstly, the convergence
difficulties reported in recent work can be relatively easily prevented by
following the simple yet often overlooked recommendation from the original
authors that a warm-up period should be used. During this period, only the mean
is optimized with a fixed variance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this
step through experimentation, highlighting that it should be standard practice.
As a sidenote, we examine whether, after the warm-up, it is beneficial to fix
the mean while optimizing the variance or to optimize both simultaneously.
Here, we do not observe a substantial difference. Secondly, we introduce a
novel improvement of the MVE network: separate regularization of the mean and
the variance estimate. We demonstrate, both on toy examples and on a number of
benchmark UCI regression data sets, that following the original recommendations
and the novel separate regularization can lead to significant improvements.]]></summary>

attracted the interest of many researchers, and inverting the diffusion process
can play an important role in better understanding the generative process and
how to engineer prompts in order to obtain the desired images. To this end, we
introduce the new task of predicting the text prompt given an image generated
by a generative diffusion model. We combine a series of white-box and black-box
models (with and without access to the weights of the diffusion network) to
deal with the proposed task. We propose a novel learning framework comprising
of a joint prompt regression and multi-label vocabulary classification
objective that generates improved prompts. To further improve our method, we
employ a curriculum learning procedure that promotes the learning of
image-prompt pairs with lower labeling noise (i.e. that are better aligned),
and an unsupervised domain-adaptive kernel learning method that uses the
similarities between samples in the source and target domains as extra
features. We conduct experiments on the DiffusionDB data set, predicting text
prompts from images generated by Stable Diffusion. Our novel learning framework
produces excellent results on the aforementioned task, yielding the highest
gains when applied on the white-box model. In addition, we make an interesting
discovery: training a diffusion model on the prompt generation task can make
the model generate images that are much better aligned with the input prompts,
when the model is directly reused for text-to-image generation.]]></summary>

with which to train deep neural networks. While SGD can use various learning
rates, such as constant or diminishing rates, the previous numerical results
showed that SGD performs better than other deep learning optimizers using when
it uses learning rates given by line search methods. In this paper, we perform
a convergence analysis on SGD with a learning rate given by an Armijo line
search for nonconvex optimization. The analysis indicates that the upper bound
of the expectation of the squared norm of the full gradient becomes small when
the number of steps and the batch size are large. Next, we show that, for SGD
with the Armijo-line-search learning rate, the number of steps needed for
nonconvex optimization is a monotone decreasing convex function of the batch
size; that is, the number of steps needed for nonconvex optimization decreases
as the batch size increases. Furthermore, we show that the stochastic
first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, which is the stochastic gradient
computation cost, is a convex function of the batch size; that is, there exists
a critical batch size that minimizes the SFO complexity. Finally, we provide
numerical results that support our theoretical results. The numerical results
indicate that the number of steps needed for training deep neural networks
decreases as the batch size increases and that there exist the critical batch

dating back at least to 1936 with linear discriminant analysis. For linearly
separable data, many algorithms can obtain the exact solution to the
corresponding 0-1 loss classification problem efficiently, but for data which
is not linearly separable, it has been shown that this problem, in full
generality, is NP-hard. Alternative approaches all involve approximations of
some kind, including the use of surrogates for the 0-1 loss (for example, the
hinge or logistic loss) or approximate combinatorial search, none of which can
be guaranteed to solve the problem exactly. Finding efficient algorithms to
obtain an exact i.e. globally optimal solution for the 0-1 loss linear
classification problem with fixed dimension, remains an open problem. In
research we report here, we detail the rigorous construction of a new
algorithm, incremental cell enumeration (ICE), that can solve the 0-1 loss
classification problem exactly in polynomial time. We prove correctness using
concepts from the theory of hyperplane arrangements and oriented matroids. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm on synthetic and real-world
datasets, showing optimal accuracy both in and out-of-sample, in practical
computational time. We also empirically demonstrate how the use of approximate
upper bound leads to polynomial time run-time improvements to the algorithm
whilst retaining exactness. To our knowledge, this is the first,

planted trees. An extension to a forest leads to our random planted forest
algorithm. Additionally, the maximum number of covariates which can interact
within a leaf can be bounded. If we set this interaction bound to one, the
resulting estimator is a sum of one-dimensional functions. In the other extreme
case, if we do not set a limit, the resulting estimator and corresponding model
place no restrictions on the form of the regression function. In a simulation
study we find encouraging prediction and visualisation properties of our random
planted forest method. We also develop theory for an idealized version of
random planted forests in cases where the interaction bound is low. We show
that if it is smaller than three, the idealized version achieves asymptotically
optimal convergence rates up to a logarithmic factor. Code is available on

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DNA methylation is a crucial regulator of gene transcription and has been
linked to various diseases, including autoimmune diseases and cancers. However,
diagnostics based on DNA methylation face challenges due to large feature sets
and small sample sizes, resulting in overfitting and suboptimal performance. To
address these issues, we propose MIRACLE, a novel interpretable neural network
that leverages autoencoder-based multi-task learning to integrate multiple
datasets and jointly identify common patterns in DNA methylation.

MIRACLE's architecture reflects the relationships between methylation sites,
genes, and pathways, ensuring biological interpretability and meaningfulness.
The network comprises an encoder and a decoder, with a bottleneck layer
representing pathway information as the basic unit of heredity. Customized
defined MaskedLinear Layer is constrained by site-gene-pathway graph adjacency
matrix information, which provides explainability and expresses the
site-gene-pathway hierarchical structure explicitly. And from the embedding,
there are different multi-task classifiers to predict diseases.

Tested on six datasets, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus
erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and
type 1 diabetes, MIRACLE demonstrates robust performance in identifying common
functions of DNA methylation across different phenotypes, with higher accuracy
in prediction dieseases than baseline methods. By incorporating biological
prior knowledge, MIRACLE offers a meaningful and interpretable framework for
DNA methylation data analysis in the context of autoimmune diseases.]]></summary>

identifies them more accurately. In addition, when disease status is

on old classes has been a crucial challenge for class incremental learning.
Beyond the normal case, long-tail class incremental learning and few-shot class
incremental learning are also proposed to consider the data imbalance and data
scarcity, respectively, which are common in real-world implementations and
further exacerbate the well-known problem of catastrophic forgetting. Existing
methods are specifically proposed for one of the three tasks. In this paper, we
offer a unified solution to the misalignment dilemma in the three tasks.
Concretely, we propose neural collapse terminus that is a fixed structure with
the maximal equiangular inter-class separation for the whole label space. It
serves as a consistent target throughout the incremental training to avoid
dividing the feature space incrementally. For CIL and LTCIL, we further propose
a prototype evolving scheme to drive the backbone features into our neural
collapse terminus smoothly. Our method also works for FSCIL with only minor
adaptations. Theoretical analysis indicates that our method holds the neural
collapse optimality in an incremental fashion regardless of data imbalance or
data scarcity. We also design a generalized case where we do not know the total
number of classes and whether the data distribution is normal, long-tail, or
few-shot for each coming session, to test the generalizability of our method.
Extensive experiments with multiple datasets are conducted to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our unified solution to all the three tasks and the
generalized case.]]></summary>

learn multiple related tasks by sharing information between them. Quantifying
uncertainty in the estimated tasks is of pivotal importance for many downstream
applications, such as online or active learning. In this work, we provide novel
multitask confidence intervals in the challenging agnostic setting, i.e., when
neither the similarity between tasks nor the tasks' features are available to
the learner. The obtained intervals do not require i.i.d. data and can be
directly applied to bound the regret in online learning. Through a refined
analysis of the multitask information gain, we obtain new regret guarantees
that, depending on a task similarity parameter, can significantly improve over
treating tasks independently. We further propose a novel online learning
algorithm that achieves such improved regret without knowing this parameter in
advance, i.e., automatically adapting to task similarity. As a second key
application of our results, we introduce a novel multitask active learning
setup where several tasks must be simultaneously optimized, but only one of
them can be queried for feedback by the learner at each round. For this
problem, we design a no-regret algorithm that uses our confidence intervals to

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the widespread application of personalized online services,
click-through rate (CTR) prediction has received more and more attention and
research. The most prominent features of CTR prediction are its multi-field
categorical data format, and vast and daily-growing data volume. The large
capacity of neural models helps digest such massive amounts of data under the
supervised learning paradigm, yet they fail to utilize the substantial data to
its full potential, since the 1-bit click signal is not sufficient to guide the
model to learn capable representations of features and instances. The
self-supervised learning paradigm provides a more promising pretrain-finetune
solution to better exploit the large amount of user click logs, and learn more
generalized and effective representations. However, self-supervised learning
for CTR prediction is still an open question, since current works on this line
are only preliminary and rudimentary. To this end, we propose a Model-agnostic
pretraining (MAP) framework that applies feature corruption and recovery on
multi-field categorical data, and more specifically, we derive two practical
algorithms: masked feature prediction (MFP) and replaced feature detection
(RFD). MFP digs into feature interactions within each instance through masking
and predicting a small portion of input features, and introduces noise
contrastive estimation (NCE) to handle large feature spaces. RFD further turns
MFP into a binary classification mode through replacing and detecting changes
in input features, making it even simpler and more effective for CTR
pretraining. Our extensive experiments on two real-world large-scale datasets
(i.e., Avazu, Criteo) demonstrate the advantages of these two methods on
several strong backbones (e.g., DCNv2, DeepFM), and achieve new
state-of-the-art performance in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency for
CTR prediction.]]></summary>

pre-train and fine-tune paradigm into the diffusion model training process,
which substantially improves training efficiency and shows potential in

proportion (e.g., up to 90\%) of the input image and employing masked denoising
score matching to denoise the visible areas, thereby guiding the diffusion
model to learn more salient features from training data as prior knowledge. By
utilizing masked learning in a pre-training stage, we efficiently train the
ViT-based diffusion model on CelebA-HQ $256 \times 256$ in the pixel space,
achieving a 4x acceleration and enhancing the quality of generated images
compared to denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). Moreover, our
masked pre-training technique can be universally applied to various diffusion

obstacles in two dimensions wherein the boundary of the obstacle is determined
from measurements of the scattered field at a collection of receivers outside
the object. One of the standard approaches for solving this problem is to
reformulate it as an optimization problem: finding the boundary of the domain
that minimizes the $L^2$ distance between computed values of the scattered
field and the given measurement data. The optimization problem is
computationally challenging since the local set of convexity shrinks with
increasing frequency and results in an increasing number of local minima in the
vicinity of the true solution. In many practical experimental settings, low
frequency measurements are unavailable due to limitations of the experimental
setup or the sensors used for measurement. Thus, obtaining a good initial guess
for the optimization problem plays a vital role in this environment.

We present a neural network warm-start approach for solving the inverse
scattering problem, where an initial guess for the optimization problem is
obtained using a trained neural network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method with several numerical examples. For high frequency problems, this
approach outperforms traditional iterative methods such as Gauss-Newton
initialized without any prior (i.e., initialized using a unit circle), or
initialized using the solution of a direct method such as the linear sampling
method. The algorithm remains robust to noise in the scattered field
measurements and also converges to the true solution for limited aperture data.
However, the number of training samples required to train the neural network
scales exponentially in frequency and the complexity of the obstacles
considered. We conclude with a discussion of this phenomenon and potential
directions for future research.]]></summary>

and interpretability from the classical model while harnessing the flexibility
and capacity to capture intricate relationships and interactions offered by the
neural network. In our proposed models, we use well-known log-linear claim
count regression models for the classical regression part and a multilayer
perceptron (MLP) for the neural network part. The MLP part is used to process
telematics car driving data given as a vector characterizing the driving
behavior of each insured driver. In addition to the Poisson and negative
binomial distributions for cross-sectional data, we propose a procedure for
training our CANN model with a multivariate negative binomial (MVNB)
specification. By doing so, we introduce a longitudinal model that accounts for
the dependence between contracts from the same insured. Our results reveal that
the CANN models exhibit superior performance compared to log-linear models that
rely on manually engineered telematics features.]]></summary>

only be distinguished from benign samples, but also classified into malware
families. For this purpose, investigating how existing malware families are
developed and examining emerging families need to be explored. This paper
focuses on the online processing of incoming malicious samples to assign them
to existing families or, in the case of samples from new families, to cluster
them. We experimented with seven prevalent malware families from the EMBER
dataset, four in the training set and three additional new families in the test
set. Based on the classification score of the multilayer perceptron, we
determined which samples would be classified and which would be clustered into
new malware families. We classified 97.21% of streaming data with a balanced
accuracy of 95.33%. Then, we clustered the remaining data using a
self-organizing map, achieving a purity from 47.61% for four clusters to 77.68%
for ten clusters. These results indicate that our approach has the potential to
be applied to the classification and clustering of zero-day malware into

to achieve stable combustion at lean conditions in large gas engines, leading
to high efficiency at low emission levels. Due to the wide range of design and
operating parameters for large gas engine prechambers, the preferred method for
evaluating different designs is computational fluid dynamics (CFD), as testing
in test bed measurement campaigns is time-consuming and expensive. However, the
significant computational time required for detailed CFD simulations due to the
complexity of solving the underlying physics also limits its applicability. In
optimization settings similar to the present case, i.e., where the evaluation
of the objective function(s) is computationally costly, Bayesian optimization
has largely replaced classical design-of-experiment. Thus, the present study
deals with the computationally efficient Bayesian optimization of large gas
engine prechambers design using CFD simulation. Reynolds-averaged-Navier-Stokes
simulations are used to determine the target values as a function of the
selected prechamber design parameters. The results indicate that the chosen
strategy is effective to find a prechamber design that achieves the desired
target values.]]></summary>

predict the future behavior of other traffic participants. Existing works
either perform object detection followed by trajectory forecasting of the
detected objects, or predict dense occupancy and flow grids for the whole
scene. The former poses a safety concern as the number of detections needs to
be kept low for efficiency reasons, sacrificing object recall. The latter is
computationally expensive due to the high-dimensionality of the output grid,
and suffers from the limited receptive field inherent to fully convolutional
networks. Furthermore, both approaches employ many computational resources
predicting areas or objects that might never be queried by the motion planner.
This motivates our unified approach to perception and future prediction that
implicitly represents occupancy and flow over time with a single neural
network. Our method avoids unnecessary computation, as it can be directly
queried by the motion planner at continuous spatio-temporal locations.
Moreover, we design an architecture that overcomes the limited receptive field
of previous explicit occupancy prediction methods by adding an efficient yet
effective global attention mechanism. Through extensive experiments in both
urban and highway settings, we demonstrate that our implicit model outperforms
the current state-of-the-art. For more information, visit the project website:

uncertainty estimation is becoming increasingly essential. One of the most
prominent uncertainty estimation methods is Deep Ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et
al., 2017) . A classical parametric model has uncertainty in the parameters due
to the fact that the data on which the model is build is a random sample. A
modern neural network has an additional uncertainty component since the
optimization of the network is random. Lakshminarayanan et al. (2017) noted
that Deep Ensembles do not incorporate the classical uncertainty induced by the
effect of finite data. In this paper, we present a computationally cheap
extension of Deep Ensembles for the regression setting, called Bootstrapped
Deep Ensembles, that explicitly takes this classical effect of finite data into
account using a modified version of the parametric bootstrap. We demonstrate

enable model discovery from longitudinal tumor size data. We show that TDNODE
overcomes a key limitation of existing models in its ability to make unbiased
predictions from truncated data. The encoder-decoder architecture is designed
to express an underlying dynamical law which possesses the fundamental property
of generalized homogeneity with respect to time. Thus, the modeling formalism
enables the encoder output to be interpreted as kinetic rate metrics, with
inverse time as the physical unit. We show that the generated metrics can be
used to predict patients' overall survival (OS) with high accuracy. The
proposed modeling formalism provides a principled way to integrate multimodal

more modalities to improve performance in a given task compared to using only
one of the modalities. Cross-modal representation learning from different data
types -- such as images and time-series data (e.g., audio or text data) --
requires a deep metric learning loss that minimizes the distance between the
modality embeddings. In this paper, we propose to use the contrastive or
triplet loss, which uses positive and negative identities to create sample
pairs with different labels, for cross-modal representation learning between
image and time-series modalities (CMR-IS). By adapting the triplet loss for
cross-modal representation learning, higher accuracy in the main (time-series
classification) task can be achieved by exploiting additional information of
the auxiliary (image classification) task. We present a triplet loss with a
dynamic margin for single label and sequence-to-sequence classification tasks.
We perform extensive evaluations on synthetic image and time-series data, and
on data for offline handwriting recognition (HWR) and on online HWR from
sensor-enhanced pens for classifying written words. Our experiments show an
improved classification accuracy, faster convergence, and better
generalizability due to an improved cross-modal representation. Furthermore,
the more suitable generalizability leads to a better adaptability between

promising approach for solving optimization problems on quantum computers in
the NISQ era. However, one limitation of VQAs is their reliance on
fixed-structure circuits, which may not be taylored for specific problems or
hardware configurations. A leading strategy to address this issue are
Adaptative VQAs, which dynamically modify the circuit structure by adding and
removing gates, and optimize their parameters during the training. Several
Adaptative VQAs, based on heuristics such as circuit shallowness, entanglement
capability and hardware compatibility, have already been proposed in the
literature, but there is still lack of a systematic comparison between the
different methods. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by analyzing three
Adaptative VQAs: Evolutionary Variational Quantum Eigensolver (EVQE), Variable
Ansatz (VAns), already proposed in the literature, and Random Adapt-VQE
(RA-VQE), a random approach we introduce as a baseline. In order to compare
these algorithms to traditional VQAs, we also include the Quantum Approximate
Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) in our analysis. We apply these algorithms to
QUBO problems and study their performance by examining the quality of the
solutions found and the computational times required. Additionally, we
investigate how the choice of the hyperparameters can impact the overall
performance of the algorithms, highlighting the importance of selecting an
appropriate methodology for hyperparameter tuning. Our analysis sets benchmarks
for Adaptative VQAs designed for near-term quantum devices and provides
valuable insights to guide future research in this area.]]></summary>

neural networks whose prediction is associated with confidence that can
represent the likelihood of correctness for subsequent decision-making.
Existing dense binary classification models are prone to being over-confident.
To improve model calibration, we propose Adaptive Stochastic Label Perturbation
(ASLP) which learns a unique label perturbation level for each training image.
ASLP employs our proposed Self-Calibrating Binary Cross Entropy (SC-BCE) loss,
which unifies label perturbation processes including stochastic approaches
(like DisturbLabel), and label smoothing, to correct calibration while
maintaining classification rates. ASLP follows Maximum Entropy Inference of
classic statistical mechanics to maximise prediction entropy with respect to
missing information. It performs this while: (1) preserving classification
accuracy on known data as a conservative solution, or (2) specifically improves
model calibration degree by minimising the gap between the prediction accuracy
and expected confidence of the target training label. Extensive results
demonstrate that ASLP can significantly improve calibration degrees of dense
binary classification models on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution
data. The code is available on https://github.com/Carlisle-Liu/ASLP.]]></summary>

generative models and have sparked a revolutionary impact on various aspects of
human life. However, the practical implementation of these models has also
exposed inherent risks, highlighting their dual nature and raising concerns
regarding their trustworthiness. Despite the abundance of literature on this
subject, a comprehensive survey specifically delving into the intersection of
large-scale generative models and their trustworthiness remains largely absent.
To bridge this gap, This paper investigates both the long-standing and emerging
threats associated with these models across four fundamental dimensions:
privacy, security, fairness, and responsibility. In this way, we construct an
extensive map outlining the trustworthiness of these models, while also
providing practical recommendations and identifying future directions. These
efforts are crucial for promoting the trustworthy deployment of these models,
ultimately benefiting society as a whole.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We deal with a general distributed constrained online learning problem with
privacy over time-varying networks, where a class of nondecomposable objectives
are considered. Under this setting, each node only controls a part of the
global decision, and the goal of all nodes is to collaboratively minimize the
global cost over a time horizon $T$ while guarantees the security of the
transmitted information. For such problems, we first design a novel generic
algorithm framework, named as DPSDA, of differentially private distributed
online learning using the Laplace mechanism and the stochastic variants of dual
averaging method. Note that in the dual updates, all nodes of DPSDA employ the
noise-corrupted gradients for more generality. Then, we propose two algorithms,
named as DPSDA-C and DPSDA-PS, under this framework. In DPSDA-C, the nodes
implement a circulation-based communication in the primal updates so as to
alleviate the disagreements over time-varying undirected networks. In addition,
for the extension to time-varying directed ones, the nodes implement the
broadcast-based push-sum dynamics in DPSDA-PS, which can achieve average
consensus over arbitrary directed networks. Theoretical results show that both
algorithms attain an expected regret upper bound in $\mathcal{O}( \sqrt{T} )$
when the objective function is convex, which matches the best utility
achievable by cutting-edge algorithms. Finally, numerical experiment results on
both synthetic and real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of our
algorithms.]]></summary>

in aerospace engineering, environmental science, the energy industry, and
biomedicine. Large eddy simulation (LES) has been widely used as an alternative
to direct numerical simulation (DNS) for simulating turbulent flows due to its
reduced computational cost. However, LES is unable to capture all of the scales
of turbulent transport accurately. Reconstructing DNS from low-resolution LES
is critical for many scientific and engineering disciplines, but it poses many
challenges to existing super-resolution methods due to the spatio-temporal
complexity of turbulent flows. In this work, we propose a new physics-guided
neural network for reconstructing the sequential DNS from low-resolution LES
data. The proposed method leverages the partial differential equation that
underlies the flow dynamics in the design of spatio-temporal model
architecture. A degradation-based refinement method is also developed to
enforce physical constraints and further reduce the accumulated reconstruction
errors over long periods. The results on two different types of turbulent flow
data confirm the superiority of the proposed method in reconstructing the
high-resolution DNS data and preserving the physical characteristics of flow

produced per day due to newly commissioned radio telescopes. One of the most
crucial problems in this field is the automatic classification of extragalactic
radio sources based on their morphologies. Most recent contributions in the
field of morphological classification of extragalactic radio sources have
proposed classifiers based on convolutional neural networks. Alternatively,
this work proposes gradient boosting machine learning methods accompanied by
principal component analysis as data-efficient alternatives to convolutional
neural networks. Recent findings have shown the efficacy of gradient boosting
methods in outperforming deep learning methods for classification problems with
tabular data. The gradient boosting methods considered in this work are based
on the XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost implementations. This work also studies
the effect of dataset size on classifier performance. A three-class
classification problem is considered in this work based on the three main
Fanaroff-Riley classes: class 0, class I, and class II, using radio sources
from the Best-Heckman sample. All three proposed gradient boosting methods
outperformed a state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks-based classifier
using less than a quarter of the number of images, with CatBoost having the
highest accuracy. This was mainly due to the superior accuracy of gradient
boosting methods in classifying Fanaroff-Riley class II sources, with

has always been a typical data structure that can be widely generated by many
domains, such as industry, medicine and finance. Analyzing this type of data is
extremely valuable for various applications. Thus, different temporal data
analysis tasks, eg, classification, clustering and prediction, have been
proposed in the past decades. Among them, causal discovery, learning the causal
relations from temporal data, is considered an interesting yet critical task
and has attracted much research attention. Existing causal discovery works can
be divided into two highly correlated categories according to whether the
temporal data is calibrated, ie, multivariate time series causal discovery, and
event sequence causal discovery. However, most previous surveys are only
focused on the time series causal discovery and ignore the second category. In
this paper, we specify the correlation between the two categories and provide a
systematical overview of existing solutions. Furthermore, we provide public

architecture search (DARTS) is largely hindered by its substantial memory cost
since the entire supernet resides in the memory. This is where the single-path
DARTS comes in, which only chooses a single-path submodel at each step. While
being memory-friendly, it also comes with low computational costs. Nonetheless,
we discover a critical issue of single-path DARTS that has not been primarily
noticed. Namely, it also suffers from severe performance collapse since too
many parameter-free operations like skip connections are derived, just like
DARTS does. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called RObustifying
Memory-Efficient NAS (ROME) to give a cure. First, we disentangle the topology
search from the operation search to make searching and evaluation consistent.
We then adopt Gumbel-Top2 reparameterization and gradient accumulation to
robustify the unwieldy bi-level optimization. We verify ROME extensively across
15 benchmarks to demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness.]]></summary>

research, with an increasing focus on analyzing the nature of time-series data,
e.g, channel-independence (CI) and channel-dependence (CD), rather than solely
focusing on designing sophisticated forecasting models. However, current
research has primarily focused on either CI or CD in isolation, and the
challenge of effectively combining these two opposing properties to achieve a
synergistic effect remains an unresolved issue. In this paper, we carefully
examine the opposing properties of CI and CD, and raise a practical question
that has not been effectively answered, e.g.,"How to effectively mix the CI and
CD properties of time series to achieve better predictive performance?" To
answer this question, we propose Mlinear (MIX-Linear), a simple yet effective
method based mainly on linear layers. The design philosophy of Mlinear mainly
includes two aspects:(1) dynamically tuning the CI and CD properties based on
the time semantics of different input time series, and (2) providing deep
supervision to adjust the individual performance of the "CI predictor" and "CD
predictor". In addition, empirically, we introduce a new loss function that
significantly outperforms the widely used mean squared error (MSE) on multiple
datasets. Experiments on time-series datasets covering multiple fields and
widely used have demonstrated the superiority of our method over PatchTST which
is the lateset Transformer-based method in terms of the MSE and MAE metrics on
7 datasets with identical sequence inputs (336 or 512). Specifically, our
method significantly outperforms PatchTST with a ratio of 21:3 at 336 sequence
length input and 29:10 at 512 sequence length input. Additionally, our approach
has a 10 $\times$ efficiency advantage at the unit level, taking into account
both training and inference times.]]></summary>

directly communicate with the central server, the users' devices have limited
computation and battery powers, and the serving base station (BS) has a fixed

leverages model pruning and proposes a pruning-enabled hierarchical federated

bound of the convergence rate that clearly demonstrates the impact of the model
pruning and wireless communications between the clients and the associated BS.
Then we jointly optimize the model pruning ratio, central processing unit (CPU)

worldwide. Given that lung infections are prevalent among COVID-19 patients,
chest Computer Tomography (CT) scans have frequently been utilized as an
alternative method for identifying COVID-19 conditions and various other types
of pulmonary diseases. Deep learning architectures have emerged to automate the
identification of pulmonary disease types by leveraging CT scan slices as
inputs for classification models. This paper introduces COVID-VR, a novel
approach for classifying pulmonary diseases based on volume rendering images of
the lungs captured from multiple angles, thereby providing a comprehensive view
of the entire lung in each image. To assess the effectiveness of our proposal,
we compared it against competing strategies utilizing both private data
obtained from partner hospitals and a publicly available dataset. The results
demonstrate that our approach effectively identifies pulmonary lesions and
performs competitively when compared to slice-based methods.]]></summary>

tasks with little to no labeled data. Despite their versatile abilities, the
larger question of their ability to reason remains ill-understood. This paper
addresses reasoning in math word problems (MWPs) by studying symbolic versions
of the numeric problems, since a symbolic expression is a "concise explanation"
of the numeric answer. We create and use a symbolic version of the SVAMP
dataset and find that GPT-3's davinci-002 model also has good zero-shot
accuracy on symbolic MWPs. To evaluate the faithfulness of the model's
reasoning, we go beyond accuracy and additionally evaluate the alignment
between the final answer and the outputted reasoning, which correspond to
numeric and symbolic answers respectively for MWPs. We explore a self-prompting
approach to encourage the symbolic reasoning to align with the numeric answer,
thus equipping the LLM with the ability to provide a concise and verifiable
reasoning and making it more interpretable. Surprisingly, self-prompting also
improves the symbolic accuracy to be higher than both the numeric and symbolic
accuracies, thus providing an ensembling effect. The SVAMP_Sym dataset will be
released for future research on symbolic math problems.]]></summary>

for improving the robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs) against adversarial
examples (AE). Nevertheless, recent studies have revealed that adversarially
trained models are prone to unfairness problems, restricting their
applicability. In this paper, we empirically observe that this limitation may
be attributed to serious adversarial confidence overfitting, i.e., certain
adversarial examples with overconfidence. To alleviate this problem, we propose
HAM, a straightforward yet effective framework via adaptive Hard Adversarial
example Mining.HAM concentrates on mining hard adversarial examples while
discarding the easy ones in an adaptive fashion. Specifically, HAM identifies
hard AEs in terms of their step sizes needed to cross the decision boundary
when calculating loss value. Besides, an early-dropping mechanism is
incorporated to discard the easy examples at the initial stages of AE
generation, resulting in efficient AT. Extensive experimental results on
CIFAR-10, SVHN, and Imagenette demonstrate that HAM achieves significant
improvement in robust fairness while reducing computational cost compared to
several state-of-the-art adversarial training methods. The code will be made
publicly available.]]></summary>

more effective substitute for FEM in predicting stress-strain fields within 2D
cross sections of arterial wall. We first proposed a U-Net based fully
convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the von Mises stress and strain
distribution based on the spatial arrangement of calcification within arterial
wall cross-sections. Further, we developed a conditional generative adversarial
network (cGAN) to enhance, particularly from the perceptual perspective, the
prediction accuracy of stress and strain field maps for arterial walls with
various calcification quantities and spatial configurations. On top of U-Net
and cGAN, we also proposed their ensemble approaches, respectively, to further
improve the prediction accuracy of field maps. Our dataset, consisting of input
and output images, was generated by implementing boundary conditions and
extracting stress-strain field maps. The trained U-Net models can accurately
predict von Mises stress and strain fields, with structural similarity index
scores (SSIM) of 0.854 and 0.830 and mean squared errors of 0.017 and 0.018 for
stress and strain, respectively, on a reserved test set. Meanwhile, the cGAN
models in a combination of ensemble and transfer learning techniques
demonstrate high accuracy in predicting von Mises stress and strain fields, as
evidenced by SSIM scores of 0.890 for stress and 0.803 for strain.
Additionally, mean squared errors of 0.008 for stress and 0.017 for strain
further support the model's performance on a designated test set. Overall, this
study developed a surrogate model for finite element analysis, which can
accurately and efficiently predict stress-strain fields of arterial walls
regardless of complex geometries and boundary conditions.]]></summary>

that different reviewers have different mappings in mind. This introduces an

imposing an upper bound on the mutual information between the model weights and
the features, which constrains the PAC-Bayes generalization bound. Furthermore,
to ensure effective generalization of DNNs in the presence of label noise, we
conduct application analyses to identify the optimal types and levels of

tasks, including text-to-image and text-to-audio generation. However,
generating music, as a special type of audio, presents unique challenges due to
limited availability of music data and sensitive issues related to copyright
and plagiarism. In this paper, to tackle these challenges, we first construct a
state-of-the-art text-to-music model, MusicLDM, that adapts Stable Diffusion
and AudioLDM architectures to the music domain. We achieve this by retraining
the contrastive language-audio pretraining model (CLAP) and the Hifi-GAN
vocoder, as components of MusicLDM, on a collection of music data samples.
Then, to address the limitations of training data and to avoid plagiarism, we
leverage a beat tracking model and propose two different mixup strategies for
data augmentation: beat-synchronous audio mixup and beat-synchronous latent
mixup, which recombine training audio directly or via a latent embeddings
space, respectively. Such mixup strategies encourage the model to interpolate
between musical training samples and generate new music within the convex hull
of the training data, making the generated music more diverse while still
staying faithful to the corresponding style. In addition to popular evaluation
metrics, we design several new evaluation metrics based on CLAP score to
demonstrate that our proposed MusicLDM and beat-synchronous mixup strategies
improve both the quality and novelty of generated music, as well as the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Depth completion, which aims to generate high-quality dense depth maps from
sparse depth maps, has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Previous
work usually employs RGB images as guidance, and introduces iterative spatial
propagation to refine estimated coarse depth maps. However, most of the
propagation refinement methods require several iterations and suffer from a
fixed receptive field, which may contain irrelevant and useless information
with very sparse input. In this paper, we address these two challenges
simultaneously by revisiting the idea of deformable convolution. We propose an
effective architecture that leverages deformable kernel convolution as a
single-pass refinement module, and empirically demonstrate its superiority. To
better understand the function of deformable convolution and exploit it for
depth completion, we further systematically investigate a variety of
representative strategies. Our study reveals that, different from prior work,
deformable convolution needs to be applied on an estimated depth map with a
relatively high density for better performance. We evaluate our model on the
large-scale KITTI dataset and achieve state-of-the-art level performance in
both accuracy and inference speed. Our code is available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) has become an appealing topic, as
imperfectly annotated data are relatively cheaper to obtain. Recent
state-of-the-art approaches employ specific selection mechanisms to separate
clean and noisy samples and then apply Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL)
techniques for improved performance. However, the selection step mostly
provides a medium-sized and decent-enough clean subset, which overlooks a rich
set of clean samples. To fulfill this, we propose a novel LNL framework ProMix
that attempts to maximize the utility of clean samples for boosted performance.
Key to our method, we propose a matched high confidence selection technique
that selects those examples with high confidence scores and matched predictions
with given labels to dynamically expand a base clean sample set. To overcome
the potential side effect of excessive clean set selection procedure, we
further devise a novel SSL framework that is able to train balanced and
unbiased classifiers on the separated clean and noisy samples. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ProMix significantly advances the current
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks with different types and levels
of noise. It achieves an average improvement of 2.48\% on the CIFAR-N dataset.

among the general public. On the flip side, these models have numerous

hallucinate (or deepfake) the likenesses of celebrities. Consequently, various
methods have been proposed in order to "erase" sensitive concepts from
text-to-image models. In this work, we examine five recently proposed concept
erasure methods, and show that targeted concepts are not fully excised from any
of these methods. Specifically, we leverage the existence of special learned

with no alterations to their weights. Our results highlight the brittleness of
post hoc concept erasure methods, and call into question their use in the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graph and hypergraph representation learning has attracted increasing
attention from various research fields. Despite the decent performance and
fruitful applications of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Hypergraph Neural
Networks (HGNNs), and their well-designed variants, on some commonly used
benchmark graphs and hypergraphs, they are outperformed by even a simple
Multi-Layer Perceptron. This observation motivates a reexamination of the
design paradigm of the current GNNs and HGNNs and poses challenges of
extracting graph features effectively. In this work, a universal feature
encoder for both graph and hypergraph representation learning is designed,
called UniG-Encoder. The architecture starts with a forward transformation of
the topological relationships of connected nodes into edge or hyperedge
features via a normalized projection matrix. The resulting edge/hyperedge
features, together with the original node features, are fed into a neural
network. The encoded node embeddings are then derived from the reversed
transformation, described by the transpose of the projection matrix, of the
network's output, which can be further used for tasks such as node
classification. The proposed architecture, in contrast to the traditional
spectral-based and/or message passing approaches, simultaneously and
comprehensively exploits the node features and graph/hypergraph topologies in
an efficient and unified manner, covering both heterophilic and homophilic
graphs. The designed projection matrix, encoding the graph features, is
intuitive and interpretable. Extensive experiments are conducted and
demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework on twelve
representative hypergraph datasets and six real-world graph datasets, compared
to the state-of-the-art methods. Our implementation is available online at
https://github.com/MinhZou/UniG-Encoder.]]></summary>

real-life applications such as home robots and medical diagnoses. One
significant challenge is to devise a robust decentralized learning framework
for various client models where centralized data collection is refrained due to
confidentiality concerns. This work aims to tackle privacy-preserving VQA by
decoupling a multi-modal model into representation modules and a contrastive
module and leveraging inter-module gradients sharing and inter-client weight
sharing. To this end, we propose Bidirectional Contrastive Split Learning
(BiCSL) to train a global multi-modal model on the entire data distribution of
decentralized clients. We employ the contrastive loss that enables a more
efficient self-supervised learning of decentralized modules. Comprehensive
experiments are conducted on the VQA-v2 dataset based on five SOTA VQA models,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, we inspect
BiCSL's robustness against a dual-key backdoor attack on VQA. Consequently,
BiCSL shows much better robustness to the multi-modal adversarial attack
compared to the centralized learning method, which provides a promising

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Distribution shifts are a serious concern in modern statistical learning as
they can systematically change the properties of the data away from the truth.
We focus on Wasserstein distribution shifts, where every data point may undergo
a slight perturbation, as opposed to the Huber contamination model where a
fraction of observations are outliers. We formulate and study shifts beyond
independent perturbations, exploring Joint Distribution Shifts, where the
per-observation perturbations can be coordinated. We analyze several important
statistical problems, including location estimation, linear regression, and
non-parametric density estimation. Under a squared loss for mean estimation and
prediction error in linear regression, we find the exact minimax risk, a least
favorable perturbation, and show that the sample mean and least squares
estimators are respectively optimal. This holds for both independent and joint
shifts, but the least favorable perturbations and minimax risks differ. For
other problems, we provide nearly optimal estimators and precise finite-sample
bounds. We also introduce several tools for bounding the minimax risk under
distribution shift, such as a smoothing technique for location families, and
generalizations of classical tools including least favorable sequences of
priors, the modulus of continuity, Le Cam's, Fano's, and Assouad's methods.]]></summary>

adversarial attacks, including evasion and backdoor (poisoning) attacks. On the
defense side, there have been intensive efforts on improving both empirical and
provable robustness against evasion attacks; however, the provable robustness
against backdoor attacks still remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we
focus on certifying the machine learning model robustness against general
threat models, especially backdoor attacks. We first provide a unified
framework via randomized smoothing techniques and show how it can be
instantiated to certify the robustness against both evasion and backdoor
attacks. We then propose the first robust training process, RAB, to smooth the
trained model and certify its robustness against backdoor attacks. We prove the
robustness bound for machine learning models trained with RAB and prove that
our robustness bound is tight. In addition, we theoretically show that it is
possible to train the robust smoothed models efficiently for simple models such
as K-nearest neighbor classifiers, and we propose an exact smooth-training
algorithm that eliminates the need to sample from a noise distribution for such
models. Empirically, we conduct comprehensive experiments for different machine
learning (ML) models such as DNNs, support vector machines, and K-NN models on
MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNette datasets and provide the first benchmark for
certified robustness against backdoor attacks. In addition, we evaluate K-NN
models on a spambase tabular dataset to demonstrate the advantages of the
proposed exact algorithm. Both the theoretic analysis and the comprehensive
evaluation on diverse ML models and datasets shed light on further robust
learning strategies against general training time attacks.]]></summary>

vehicle insurance built upon the Combined Actuarial Neural Network (CANN)
framework proposed by Mario W\"uthrich and Michael Merz. The CANN approach
combines a classical actuarial model, such as a generalized linear model, with
a neural network. This blending of models results in a two-component model
comprising a classical regression model and a neural network part. The CANN
model leverages the strengths of both components, providing a solid foundation
and interpretability from the classical model while harnessing the flexibility
and capacity to capture intricate relationships and interactions offered by the
neural network. In our proposed models, we use well-known log-linear claim
count regression models for the classical regression part and a multilayer
perceptron (MLP) for the neural network part. The MLP part is used to process
telematics car driving data given as a vector characterizing the driving
behavior of each insured driver. In addition to the Poisson and negative
binomial distributions for cross-sectional data, we propose a procedure for
training our CANN model with a multivariate negative binomial (MVNB)
specification. By doing so, we introduce a longitudinal model that accounts for
the dependence between contracts from the same insured. Our results reveal that
the CANN models exhibit superior performance compared to log-linear models that
rely on manually engineered telematics features.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Single-cell data integration can provide a comprehensive molecular view of
cells, and many algorithms have been developed to remove unwanted technical or
biological variations and integrate heterogeneous single-cell datasets. Despite
their wide usage, existing methods suffer from several fundamental limitations.
In particular, we lack a rigorous statistical test for whether two
high-dimensional single-cell datasets are alignable (and therefore should even
be aligned). Moreover, popular methods can substantially distort the data
during alignment, making the aligned data and downstream analysis difficult to
interpret. To overcome these limitations, we present a spectral manifold
alignment and inference (SMAI) framework, which enables principled and
interpretable alignability testing and structure-preserving integration of
single-cell data. SMAI provides a statistical test to robustly determine the
alignability between datasets to avoid misleading inference, and is justified
by high-dimensional statistical theory. On a diverse range of real and
simulated benchmark datasets, it outperforms commonly used alignment methods.
Moreover, we show that SMAI improves various downstream analyses such as
identification of differentially expressed genes and imputation of single-cell
spatial transcriptomics, providing further biological insights. SMAI's
interpretability also enables quantification and a deeper understanding of the
sources of technical confounders in single-cell data.]]></summary>

such notion is individual fairness (IF), which requires that individuals who
are similar receive similar treatment. In parallel, matrix estimation (ME) has
emerged as a natural paradigm for handling noisy data with missing values. In
this work, we connect the two concepts. We show that pre-processing data using
ME can improve an algorithm's IF without sacrificing performance. Specifically,
we show that using a popular ME method known as singular value thresholding
(SVT) to pre-process the data provides a strong IF guarantee under appropriate
conditions. We then show that, under analogous conditions, SVT pre-processing
also yields estimates that are consistent and approximately minimax optimal. As
such, the ME pre-processing step does not, under the stated conditions,
increase the prediction error of the base algorithm, i.e., does not impose a
fairness-performance trade-off. We verify these results on synthetic and real
data.]]></summary>

are many reasons driving researchers to post their manuscripts to preprint
servers before formal submission to journals or conferences, but the use of
preprints has also sparked considerable controversy, especially surrounding the
claim of priority. In this paper, a case study of computer science preprints
submitted to arXiv from 2008 to 2017 is conducted to quantify how many
preprints have eventually been printed in peer-reviewed venues. Among those
published manuscripts, some are published under different titles and without an
update to their preprints on arXiv. In the case of these manuscripts, the
traditional fuzzy matching method is incapable of mapping the preprint to the
final published version. In view of this issue, we introduce a semantics-based
mapping method with the employment of Bidirectional Encoder Representations
from Transformers (BERT). With this new mapping method and a plurality of data
sources, we find that 66% of all sampled preprints are published under
unchanged titles and 11% are published under different titles and with other
modifications. A further analysis was then performed to investigate why these
preprints but not others were accepted for publication. Our comparison reveals
that in the field of computer science, published preprints feature adequate
revisions, multiple authorship, detailed abstract and introduction, extensive

hydrological modelling applications, yet the spatial coverage with rain gauge
stations is limited due to economic constraints. Gridded satellite
precipitation datasets offer an alternative option for estimating the actual
precipitation by covering uniformly large areas, albeit related estimates are
not accurate. To improve precipitation estimates, machine learning is applied
to merge rain gauge-based measurements and gridded satellite precipitation
products. In this context, observed precipitation plays the role of the
dependent variable, while satellite data play the role of predictor variables.
Random forests is the dominant machine learning algorithm in relevant
applications. In those spatial predictions settings, point predictions (mostly
the mean or the median of the conditional distribution) of the dependent
variable are issued. The aim of the manuscript is to solve the problem of
probabilistic prediction of precipitation with an emphasis on extreme quantiles
in spatial interpolation settings. Here we propose, issuing probabilistic
spatial predictions of precipitation using Light Gradient Boosting Machine

Estimation network (MVE network) (Nix and Weigend, 1994). This type of network
is often used as a building block for uncertainty estimation methods in a
regression setting, for instance Concrete dropout (Gal et al., 2017) and Deep
Ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017). Specifically, an MVE network assumes
that the data is produced from a normal distribution with a mean function and
variance function. The MVE network outputs a mean and variance estimate and
optimizes the network parameters by minimizing the negative loglikelihood. In
our paper, we present two significant insights. Firstly, the convergence
difficulties reported in recent work can be relatively easily prevented by
following the simple yet often overlooked recommendation from the original
authors that a warm-up period should be used. During this period, only the mean
is optimized with a fixed variance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this
step through experimentation, highlighting that it should be standard practice.
As a sidenote, we examine whether, after the warm-up, it is beneficial to fix
the mean while optimizing the variance or to optimize both simultaneously.
Here, we do not observe a substantial difference. Secondly, we introduce a
novel improvement of the MVE network: separate regularization of the mean and
the variance estimate. We demonstrate, both on toy examples and on a number of
benchmark UCI regression data sets, that following the original recommendations
and the novel separate regularization can lead to significant improvements.]]></summary>

neural computation is to derive online algorithms from principled computational
objectives and evaluate their compatibility with anatomical and physiological
observations. Similarity matching objectives have served as successful starting
points for deriving online algorithms that map onto neural networks (NNs) with
point neurons and Hebbian/anti-Hebbian plasticity. These NN models account for
many anatomical and physiological observations; however, the objectives have
limited computational power and the derived NNs do not explain
multi-compartmental neuronal structures and non-Hebbian forms of plasticity
that are prevalent throughout the brain. In this article, we unify and
generalize recent extensions of the similarity matching approach to address
more complex objectives, including a large class of unsupervised and
self-supervised learning tasks that can be formulated as symmetric generalized
eigenvalue problems or nonnegative matrix factorization problems.
Interestingly, the online algorithms derived from these objectives naturally
map onto NNs with multi-compartmental neurons and local, non-Hebbian learning
rules. Therefore, this unified extension of the similarity matching approach
provides a normative framework that facilitates understanding
multi-compartmental neuronal structures and non-Hebbian plasticity found

(GNNs) on a given graph topology by dynamically learning it. However, most of
LGI methods assume to have a (noisy, incomplete, improvable, ...) input graph
to rewire and can solely learn regular graph topologies. In the wake of the
success of Topological Deep Learning (TDL), we study Latent Topology Inference
(LTI) for learning higher-order cell complexes (with sparse and not regular
topology) describing multi-way interactions between data points. To this aim,
we introduce the Differentiable Cell Complex Module (DCM), a novel learnable
function that computes cell probabilities in the complex to improve the
downstream task. We show how to integrate DCM with cell complex message passing
networks layers and train it in a end-to-end fashion, thanks to a two-step
inference procedure that avoids an exhaustive search across all possible cells
in the input, thus maintaining scalability. Our model is tested on several
homophilic and heterophilic graph datasets and it is shown to outperform other
state-of-the-art techniques, offering significant improvements especially in
cases where an input graph is not provided.]]></summary>

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) under Markovian sampling. We show that the
convergence rates of the covariance estimator are
$O\big(\sqrt{d}\,n^{-1/8}(\log n)^{1/4}\big)$ and
$O\big(\sqrt{d}\,n^{-1/8}\big)$ under state-dependent and state-independent
Markovian sampling, respectively, with $d$ representing dimensionality and $n$
denoting the number of observations or SGD iterations. Remarkably, these rates
match the best-known convergence rate previously established for the
independent and identically distributed ($\iid$) case by \cite{zhu2021online},
up to logarithmic factors. Our analysis overcomes significant challenges that
arise due to Markovian sampling, leading to the introduction of additional
error terms and complex dependencies between the blocks of the batch-means
covariance estimator. Moreover, we establish the convergence rate for the first
four moments of the $\ell_2$ norm of the error of SGD dynamics under
state-dependent Markovian data, which holds potential interest as an
independent result. To validate our theoretical findings, we provide numerical
illustrations to derive confidence intervals for SGD when training linear and
logistic regression models under Markovian sampling. Additionally, we apply our
approach to tackle the intriguing problem of strategic classification with
logistic regression, where adversaries can adaptively modify features during
the training process to increase their chances of being classified in a

existing works focus on analyzing $Q$ learning for finite state and action
spaces. If the state space is continuous, then the original $Q$ learning method
can not be directly used. A modification of the original $Q$ learning method
was proposed in (Shah and Xie, 2018), which estimates $Q$ values with nearest
neighbors. Such modification makes $Q$ learning suitable for continuous state
space. (Shah and Xie, 2018) shows that the convergence rate of estimated $Q$
function is $\tilde{O}(T^{-1/(d+3)})$, which is slower than the minimax lower
bound $\tilde{\Omega}(T^{-1/(d+2)})$, indicating that this method is not
efficient. This paper proposes two new $Q$ learning methods to bridge the gap
of convergence rates in (Shah and Xie, 2018), with one of them being offline,
while the other is online. Despite that we still use nearest neighbor approach
to estimate $Q$ function, the algorithms are crucially different from (Shah and
Xie, 2018). In particular, we replace the kernel nearest neighbor in
discretized region with a direct nearest neighbor approach. Consequently, our
approach significantly improves the convergence rate. Moreover, the time
complexity is also significantly improved in high dimensional state spaces. Our
analysis shows that both offline and online methods are minimax rate optimal.]]></summary>

regression setting. Our motivation is to estimate the unknown regression
function from a functional decomposition perspective in which the functional
components correspond to lower order interaction terms. The idea is to modify
the random forest algorithm by keeping certain leaves after they are split
instead of deleting them. This leads to non-binary trees which we refer to as
planted trees. An extension to a forest leads to our random planted forest
algorithm. Additionally, the maximum number of covariates which can interact
within a leaf can be bounded. If we set this interaction bound to one, the
resulting estimator is a sum of one-dimensional functions. In the other extreme
case, if we do not set a limit, the resulting estimator and corresponding model
place no restrictions on the form of the regression function. In a simulation
study we find encouraging prediction and visualisation properties of our random
planted forest method. We also develop theory for an idealized version of
random planted forests in cases where the interaction bound is low. We show
that if it is smaller than three, the idealized version achieves asymptotically
optimal convergence rates up to a logarithmic factor. Code is available on

adversarial attacks, including evasion and backdoor (poisoning) attacks. On the
defense side, there have been intensive efforts on improving both empirical and
provable robustness against evasion attacks; however, the provable robustness
against backdoor attacks still remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we
focus on certifying the machine learning model robustness against general
threat models, especially backdoor attacks. We first provide a unified
framework via randomized smoothing techniques and show how it can be
instantiated to certify the robustness against both evasion and backdoor
attacks. We then propose the first robust training process, RAB, to smooth the
trained model and certify its robustness against backdoor attacks. We prove the
robustness bound for machine learning models trained with RAB and prove that
our robustness bound is tight. In addition, we theoretically show that it is
possible to train the robust smoothed models efficiently for simple models such
as K-nearest neighbor classifiers, and we propose an exact smooth-training
algorithm that eliminates the need to sample from a noise distribution for such
models. Empirically, we conduct comprehensive experiments for different machine
learning (ML) models such as DNNs, support vector machines, and K-NN models on
MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNette datasets and provide the first benchmark for
certified robustness against backdoor attacks. In addition, we evaluate K-NN
models on a spambase tabular dataset to demonstrate the advantages of the
proposed exact algorithm. Both the theoretic analysis and the comprehensive
evaluation on diverse ML models and datasets shed light on further robust
learning strategies against general training time attacks.]]></summary>

that, in many disciplines across science and engineering, require the solution
of parametrized time-dependent nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs).
In this context, full order models (FOMs), such as those relying on the finite
element method, can reach high levels of accuracy, however often yielding
intensive simulations to run. For this reason, surrogate models are developed
to replace computationally expensive solvers with more efficient ones, which
can strike favorable trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. This work
explores the potential usage of graph neural networks (GNNs) for the simulation
of time-dependent PDEs in the presence of geometrical variability. In
particular, we propose a systematic strategy to build surrogate models based on
a data-driven time-stepping scheme where a GNN architecture is used to
efficiently evolve the system. With respect to the majority of surrogate
models, the proposed approach stands out for its ability of tackling problems
with parameter dependent spatial domains, while simultaneously generalizing to
different geometries and mesh resolutions. We assess the effectiveness of the
proposed approach through a series of numerical experiments, involving both
two- and three-dimensional problems, showing that GNNs can provide a valid
alternative to traditional surrogate models in terms of computational
efficiency and generalization to new scenarios. We also assess, from a
numerical standpoint, the importance of using GNNs, rather than classical dense
deep neural networks, for the proposed framework.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As neural networks become more popular, the need for accompanying uncertainty
estimates increases. There are currently two main approaches to test the
quality of these estimates. Most methods output a density. They can be compared
by evaluating their loglikelihood on a test set. Other methods output a
prediction interval directly. These methods are often tested by examining the
fraction of test points that fall inside the corresponding prediction
intervals. Intuitively both approaches seem logical. However, we demonstrate
through both theoretical arguments and simulations that both ways of evaluating
the quality of uncertainty estimates have serious flaws. Firstly, both
approaches cannot disentangle the separate components that jointly create the
predictive uncertainty, making it difficult to evaluate the quality of the
estimates of these components. Secondly, a better loglikelihood does not
guarantee better prediction intervals, which is what the methods are often used
for in practice. Moreover, the current approach to test prediction intervals
directly has additional flaws. We show why it is fundamentally flawed to test a
prediction or confidence interval on a single test set. At best, marginal
coverage is measured, implicitly averaging out overconfident and underconfident
predictions. A much more desirable property is pointwise coverage, requiring
the correct coverage for each prediction. We demonstrate through practical
examples that these effects can result in favoring a method, based on the
predictive uncertainty, that has undesirable behaviour of the confidence or
prediction intervals. Finally, we propose a simulation-based testing approach
that addresses these problems while still allowing easy comparison between

assigns label distribution to each instance. Many LDL methods proposed to
leverage label correlation in the learning process to solve the
exponential-sized output space; among these, many exploited the low-rank
structure of label distribution to capture label correlation. However, recent
studies disclosed that label distribution matrices are typically full-rank,
posing challenges to those works exploiting low-rank label correlation. Note
that multi-label is generally low-rank; low-rank label correlation is widely
adopted in multi-label learning (MLL) literature. Inspired by that, we
introduce an auxiliary MLL process in LDL and capture low-rank label
correlation on that MLL rather than LDL. In such a way, low-rank label
correlation is appropriately exploited in our LDL methods. We conduct
comprehensive experiments and demonstrate that our methods are superior to
existing LDL methods. Besides, the ablation studies justify the advantages of
exploiting low-rank label correlation in the auxiliary MLL.]]></summary>

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) under Markovian sampling. We show that the
convergence rates of the covariance estimator are
$O\big(\sqrt{d}\,n^{-1/8}(\log n)^{1/4}\big)$ and
$O\big(\sqrt{d}\,n^{-1/8}\big)$ under state-dependent and state-independent
Markovian sampling, respectively, with $d$ representing dimensionality and $n$
denoting the number of observations or SGD iterations. Remarkably, these rates
match the best-known convergence rate previously established for the
independent and identically distributed ($\iid$) case by \cite{zhu2021online},
up to logarithmic factors. Our analysis overcomes significant challenges that
arise due to Markovian sampling, leading to the introduction of additional
error terms and complex dependencies between the blocks of the batch-means
covariance estimator. Moreover, we establish the convergence rate for the first
four moments of the $\ell_2$ norm of the error of SGD dynamics under
state-dependent Markovian data, which holds potential interest as an
independent result. To validate our theoretical findings, we provide numerical
illustrations to derive confidence intervals for SGD when training linear and
logistic regression models under Markovian sampling. Additionally, we apply our
approach to tackle the intriguing problem of strategic classification with
logistic regression, where adversaries can adaptively modify features during
the training process to increase their chances of being classified in a
specific target class.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We consider convex relaxations for recovering low-rank tensors based on
constrained minimization over a ball induced by the tensor nuclear norm,
recently introduced in \cite{tensor_tSVD}. We build on a recent line of results
that considered convex relaxations for the recovery of low-rank matrices and
established that under a strict complementarity condition (SC), both the
convergence rate and per-iteration runtime of standard gradient methods may
improve dramatically. We develop the appropriate strict complementarity
condition for the tensor nuclear norm ball and obtain the following main
results under this condition: 1. When the objective to minimize is of the form
$f(\mX)=g(\mA\mX)+\langle{\mC,\mX}\rangle$ , where $g$ is strongly convex and
$\mA$ is a linear map (e.g., least squares), a quadratic growth bound holds,
which implies linear convergence rates for standard projected gradient methods,
despite the fact that $f$ need not be strongly convex. 2. For a smooth
objective function, when initialized in certain proximity of an optimal
solution which satisfies SC, standard projected gradient methods only require
SVD computations (for projecting onto the tensor nuclear norm ball) of rank
that matches the tubal rank of the optimal solution. In particular, when the
tubal rank is constant, this implies nearly linear (in the size of the tensor)
runtime per iteration, as opposed to super linear without further assumptions.
3. For a nonsmooth objective function which admits a popular smooth
saddle-point formulation, we derive similar results to the latter for the well
known extragradient method. An additional contribution which may be of
independent interest, is the rigorous extension of many basic results regarding
tensors of arbitrary order, which were previously obtained only for third-order
tensors.]]></summary>

gradient algorithms for machine learning, a technique widely used in
distributed and federated learning. We underline differences in terms of
convergence rates between several unbiased compression operators, that all
satisfy the same condition on their variance, thus going beyond the classical
worst-case analysis. To do so, we focus on the case of least-squares regression
(LSR) and analyze a general stochastic approximation algorithm for minimizing
quadratic functions relying on a random field. We consider weak assumptions on
the random field, tailored to the analysis (specifically, expected H\"older
regularity), and on the noise covariance, enabling the analysis of various
randomizing mechanisms, including compression. We then extend our results to
the case of federated learning.

More formally, we highlight the impact on the convergence of the covariance
$\mathfrak{C}_{\mathrm{ania}}$ of the additive noise induced by the algorithm.
We demonstrate despite the non-regularity of the stochastic field, that the
limit variance term scales with $\mathrm{Tr}(\mathfrak{C}_{\mathrm{ania}}
H^{-1})/K$ (where $H$ is the Hessian of the optimization problem and $K$ the
number of iterations) generalizing the rate for the vanilla LSR case where it
is $\sigma^2 \mathrm{Tr}(H H^{-1}) / K = \sigma^2 d / K$ (Bach and Moulines,
2013). Then, we analyze the dependency of $\mathfrak{C}_{\mathrm{ania}}$ on the
compression strategy and ultimately its impact on convergence, first in the
centralized case, then in two heterogeneous FL frameworks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The literature on machine learning in the context of data streams is vast and
growing. However, many of the defining assumptions regarding data-stream
learning tasks are too strong to hold in practice, or are even contradictory
such that they cannot be met in the contexts of supervised learning. Algorithms
are chosen and designed based on criteria which are often not clearly stated,
for problem settings not clearly defined, tested in unrealistic settings,
and/or in isolation from related approaches in the wider literature. This puts
into question the potential for real-world impact of many approaches conceived
in such contexts, and risks propagating a misguided research focus. We propose
to tackle these issues by reformulating the fundamental definitions and
settings of supervised data-stream learning with regard to contemporary
considerations of concept drift and temporal dependence; and we take a fresh
look at what constitutes a supervised data-stream learning task, and a
reconsideration of algorithms that may be applied to tackle such tasks. Through
and in reflection of this formulation and overview, helped by an informal
survey of industrial players dealing with real-world data streams, we provide
recommendations. Our main emphasis is that learning from data streams does not
impose a single-pass or online-learning approach, or any particular learning
regime; and any constraints on memory and time are not specific to streaming.
Meanwhile, there exist established techniques for dealing with temporal
dependence and concept drift, in other areas of the literature. For the data
streams community, we thus encourage a shift in research focus, from dealing
with often-artificial constraints and assumptions on the learning mode, to
issues such as robustness, privacy, and interpretability which are increasingly
relevant to learning in data streams in academic and industrial settings.]]></summary>

DPU), deploying deep learning models on edge devices with fixed-point hardware
is still challenging due to complex model quantization and conversion. Existing
model quantization frameworks like Tensorflow QAT [1], TFLite PTQ [2], and
Qualcomm AIMET [3] supports only a limited set of quantization schemes (e.g.,
only asymmetric per-tensor quantization in TF1.x QAT [4]). Accordingly, deep
learning models cannot be easily quantized for diverse fixed-point hardwares,
mainly due to slightly different quantization requirements. In this paper, we
envision a new type of model quantization approach called MRQ (model
re-quantization), which takes existing quantized models and quickly transforms
the models to meet different quantization requirements (e.g., asymmetric ->
symmetric, non-power-of-2 scale -> power-of-2 scale). Re-quantization is much
simpler than quantizing from scratch because it avoids costly re-training and
provides support for multiple quantization schemes simultaneously. To minimize
re-quantization error, we developed a new set of re-quantization algorithms
including weight correction and rounding error folding. We have demonstrated
that MobileNetV2 QAT model [7] can be quickly re-quantized into two different
quantization schemes (i.e., symmetric and symmetric+power-of-2 scale) with less
than 0.64 units of accuracy loss. We believe our work is the first to leverage
this concept of re-quantization for model quantization and models obtained from
the re-quantization process have been successfully deployed on NNA in the Echo
Show devices.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Identification of nonlinear dynamical systems has been popularized by sparse
identification of the nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) via the sequentially
thresholded least squares (STLS) algorithm. Many extensions SINDy have emerged
in the literature to deal with experimental data which are finite in length and
noisy. Recently, the computationally intensive method of ensembling
bootstrapped SINDy models (E-SINDy) was proposed for model identification,
handling finite, highly noisy data. While the extensions of SINDy are numerous,
their sparsity-promoting estimators occasionally provide sparse approximations
of the dynamics as opposed to exact recovery. Furthermore, these estimators
suffer under multicollinearity, e.g. the irrepresentable condition for the
Lasso. In this paper, we demonstrate that the Trimmed Lasso for robust
identification of models (TRIM) can provide exact recovery under more severe
noise, finite data, and multicollinearity as opposed to E-SINDy. Additionally,
the computational cost of TRIM is asymptotically equal to STLS since the
sparsity parameter of the TRIM can be solved efficiently by convex solvers. We
compare these methodologies on challenging nonlinear systems, specifically the
Lorenz 63 system, the Bouc Wen oscillator from the nonlinear dynamics benchmark
of No\"el and Schoukens, 2016, and a time delay system describing tool cutting
dynamics. This study emphasizes the comparisons between STLS, reweighted
$\ell_1$ minimization, and Trimmed Lasso in identification with respect to
problems faced by practitioners: the problem of finite and noisy data, the
performance of the sparse regression of when the library grows in dimension
(multicollinearity), and automatic methods for choice of regularization
parameters.]]></summary>

accurate indoor air quality approximation significantly helps provide a healthy

probabilistic approach. However, it suffers from the drawback of slow
generation speed due to the requirement of a large number of time steps. To
address this limitation, recent models such as denoising diffusion implicit
models (DDIM) focus on generating samples without directly modeling the
probability distribution, while models like denoising diffusion generative
adversarial networks (GAN) combine diffusion processes with GANs. In the field
of speech synthesis, a recent diffusion speech synthesis model called
DiffGAN-TTS, utilizing the structure of GANs, has been introduced and
demonstrates superior performance in both speech quality and generation speed.
In this paper, to further enhance the performance of DiffGAN-TTS, we propose a
speech synthesis model with two discriminators: a diffusion discriminator for
learning the distribution of the reverse process and a spectrogram
discriminator for learning the distribution of the generated data. Objective
metrics such as structural similarity index measure (SSIM), mel-cepstral
distortion (MCD), F0 root mean squared error (F0 RMSE), short-time objective
intelligibility (STOI), perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ), as well
as subjective metrics like mean opinion score (MOS), are used to evaluate the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In response to recent data regulation requirements, machine unlearning (MU)
has emerged as a critical process to remove the influence of specific examples
from a given model. Although exact unlearning can be achieved through complete
model retraining using the remaining dataset, the associated computational
costs have driven the development of efficient, approximate unlearning
techniques. Moving beyond data-centric MU approaches, our study introduces a
novel model-based perspective: model sparsification via weight pruning, which
is capable of reducing the gap between exact unlearning and approximate
unlearning. We show in both theory and practice that model sparsity can boost
the multi-criteria unlearning performance of an approximate unlearner, closing
the approximation gap, while continuing to be efficient. This leads to a new MU
paradigm, termed prune first, then unlearn, which infuses a sparse model prior
into the unlearning process. Building on this insight, we also develop a
sparsity-aware unlearning method that utilizes sparsity regularization to
enhance the training process of approximate unlearning. Extensive experiments

scenarios. A notable highlight is the 77% unlearning efficacy gain of
fine-tuning (one of the simplest unlearning methods) when using sparsity-aware
unlearning. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical impact of our proposed MU

endless applications. Well planned schedules bring many benefits in the context
of automated systems: among others, they limit production costs and waste.
Nevertheless, the NP-hardness of this problem makes it essential to use
heuristics whose design is difficult, requires specialized knowledge and often
produces methods tailored to the specific task. This paper presents an original
end-to-end Deep Reinforcement Learning approach to scheduling that
automatically learns dispatching rules. Our technique is inspired by natural
language encoder-decoder models for sequence processing and has never been
used, to the best of our knowledge, for scheduling purposes. We applied and
tested our method in particular to some benchmark instances of Job Shop
Problem, but this technique is general enough to be potentially used to tackle
other different optimal job scheduling tasks with minimal intervention. Results
demonstrate that we outperform many classical approaches exploiting priority
dispatching rules and show competitive results on state-of-the-art Deep
Reinforcement Learning ones.]]></summary>

planning optimization. Given previously successful plans, learning trajectory
generative models as priors for a new planning problem is highly desirable.
Prior works propose several ways on utilizing this prior to bootstrapping the
motion planning problem. Either sampling the prior for initializations or using
the prior distribution in a maximum-a-posterior formulation for trajectory
optimization. In this work, we propose learning diffusion models as priors. We
then can sample directly from the posterior trajectory distribution conditioned
on task goals, by leveraging the inverse denoising process of diffusion models.
Furthermore, diffusion has been recently shown to effectively encode data
multimodality in high-dimensional settings, which is particularly well-suited
for large trajectory dataset. To demonstrate our method efficacy, we compare
our proposed method - Motion Planning Diffusion - against several baselines in
simulated planar robot and 7-dof robot arm manipulator environments. To assess
the generalization capabilities of our method, we test it in environments with
previously unseen obstacles. Our experiments show that diffusion models are
strong priors to encode high-dimensional trajectory distributions of robot
motions.]]></summary>

existing works focus on analyzing $Q$ learning for finite state and action
spaces. If the state space is continuous, then the original $Q$ learning method
can not be directly used. A modification of the original $Q$ learning method
was proposed in (Shah and Xie, 2018), which estimates $Q$ values with nearest
neighbors. Such modification makes $Q$ learning suitable for continuous state
space. (Shah and Xie, 2018) shows that the convergence rate of estimated $Q$
function is $\tilde{O}(T^{-1/(d+3)})$, which is slower than the minimax lower
bound $\tilde{\Omega}(T^{-1/(d+2)})$, indicating that this method is not
efficient. This paper proposes two new $Q$ learning methods to bridge the gap
of convergence rates in (Shah and Xie, 2018), with one of them being offline,
while the other is online. Despite that we still use nearest neighbor approach
to estimate $Q$ function, the algorithms are crucially different from (Shah and
Xie, 2018). In particular, we replace the kernel nearest neighbor in
discretized region with a direct nearest neighbor approach. Consequently, our
approach significantly improves the convergence rate. Moreover, the time
complexity is also significantly improved in high dimensional state spaces. Our
analysis shows that both offline and online methods are minimax rate optimal.]]></summary>

that of another person. In this work, we propose a novel face-swapping
framework called Megapixel Facial Identity Manipulation (MFIM). The
face-swapping model should achieve two goals. First, it should be able to
generate a high-quality image. We argue that a model which is proficient in
generating a megapixel image can achieve this goal. However, generating a
megapixel image is generally difficult without careful model design. Therefore,
our model exploits pretrained StyleGAN in the manner of GAN-inversion to
effectively generate a megapixel image. Second, it should be able to
effectively transform the identity of a given image. Specifically, it should be
able to actively transform ID attributes (e.g., face shape and eyes) of a given
image into those of another person, while preserving ID-irrelevant attributes
(e.g., pose and expression). To achieve this goal, we exploit 3DMM that can
capture various facial attributes. Specifically, we explicitly supervise our
model to generate a face-swapped image with the desirable attributes using
3DMM. We show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance through
extensive experiments. Furthermore, we propose a new operation called ID
mixing, which creates a new identity by semantically mixing the identities of

gradient algorithms for machine learning, a technique widely used in
distributed and federated learning. We underline differences in terms of
convergence rates between several unbiased compression operators, that all
satisfy the same condition on their variance, thus going beyond the classical
worst-case analysis. To do so, we focus on the case of least-squares regression
(LSR) and analyze a general stochastic approximation algorithm for minimizing
quadratic functions relying on a random field. We consider weak assumptions on
the random field, tailored to the analysis (specifically, expected H\"older
regularity), and on the noise covariance, enabling the analysis of various
randomizing mechanisms, including compression. We then extend our results to
the case of federated learning.

More formally, we highlight the impact on the convergence of the covariance
$\mathfrak{C}_{\mathrm{ania}}$ of the additive noise induced by the algorithm.
We demonstrate despite the non-regularity of the stochastic field, that the
limit variance term scales with $\mathrm{Tr}(\mathfrak{C}_{\mathrm{ania}}
H^{-1})/K$ (where $H$ is the Hessian of the optimization problem and $K$ the
number of iterations) generalizing the rate for the vanilla LSR case where it
is $\sigma^2 \mathrm{Tr}(H H^{-1}) / K = \sigma^2 d / K$ (Bach and Moulines,
2013). Then, we analyze the dependency of $\mathfrak{C}_{\mathrm{ania}}$ on the
compression strategy and ultimately its impact on convergence, first in the
centralized case, then in two heterogeneous FL frameworks.]]></summary>

such notion is individual fairness (IF), which requires that individuals who

emerged as a natural paradigm for handling noisy data with missing values. In
this work, we connect the two concepts. We show that pre-processing data using
ME can improve an algorithm's IF without sacrificing performance. Specifically,
we show that using a popular ME method known as singular value thresholding
(SVT) to pre-process the data provides a strong IF guarantee under appropriate
conditions. We then show that, under analogous conditions, SVT pre-processing
also yields estimates that are consistent and approximately minimax optimal. As
such, the ME pre-processing step does not, under the stated conditions,
increase the prediction error of the base algorithm, i.e., does not impose a
fairness-performance trade-off. We verify these results on synthetic and real

constrained minimization over a ball induced by the tensor nuclear norm,
recently introduced in \cite{tensor_tSVD}. We build on a recent line of results
that considered convex relaxations for the recovery of low-rank matrices and
established that under a strict complementarity condition (SC), both the
convergence rate and per-iteration runtime of standard gradient methods may
improve dramatically. We develop the appropriate strict complementarity
condition for the tensor nuclear norm ball and obtain the following main
results under this condition: 1. When the objective to minimize is of the form
$f(\mX)=g(\mA\mX)+\langle{\mC,\mX}\rangle$ , where $g$ is strongly convex and
$\mA$ is a linear map (e.g., least squares), a quadratic growth bound holds,
which implies linear convergence rates for standard projected gradient methods,
despite the fact that $f$ need not be strongly convex. 2. For a smooth
objective function, when initialized in certain proximity of an optimal
solution which satisfies SC, standard projected gradient methods only require
SVD computations (for projecting onto the tensor nuclear norm ball) of rank
that matches the tubal rank of the optimal solution. In particular, when the
tubal rank is constant, this implies nearly linear (in the size of the tensor)
runtime per iteration, as opposed to super linear without further assumptions.
3. For a nonsmooth objective function which admits a popular smooth
saddle-point formulation, we derive similar results to the latter for the well
known extragradient method. An additional contribution which may be of
independent interest, is the rigorous extension of many basic results regarding
tensors of arbitrary order, which were previously obtained only for third-order
tensors.]]></summary>

dating back at least to 1936 with linear discriminant analysis. For linearly
separable data, many algorithms can obtain the exact solution to the
corresponding 0-1 loss classification problem efficiently, but for data which
is not linearly separable, it has been shown that this problem, in full
generality, is NP-hard. Alternative approaches all involve approximations of
some kind, including the use of surrogates for the 0-1 loss (for example, the
hinge or logistic loss) or approximate combinatorial search, none of which can
be guaranteed to solve the problem exactly. Finding efficient algorithms to
obtain an exact i.e. globally optimal solution for the 0-1 loss linear
classification problem with fixed dimension, remains an open problem. In
research we report here, we detail the rigorous construction of a new
algorithm, incremental cell enumeration (ICE), that can solve the 0-1 loss
classification problem exactly in polynomial time. We prove correctness using
concepts from the theory of hyperplane arrangements and oriented matroids. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm on synthetic and real-world
datasets, showing optimal accuracy both in and out-of-sample, in practical
computational time. We also empirically demonstrate how the use of approximate
upper bound leads to polynomial time run-time improvements to the algorithm

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this work we approach attractor neural networks from a machine learning
perspective: we look for optimal network parameters by applying a gradient
descent over a regularized loss function. Within this framework, the optimal
neuron-interaction matrices turn out to be a class of matrices which correspond
to Hebbian kernels revised by iteratively applying some unlearning protocols.
Remarkably, the number of unlearning steps is proved to be related to the
regularization hyperparameters of the loss function and to the training time.
Thus, we can design strategies to avoid overfitting that are formulated in
terms of the algebraic properties of the interaction matrix, or, equivalently,
in terms of regularization tuning and early-stopping strategies. The
generalization capabilities of these attractor networks are also investigated:
analytical results are obtained for random synthetic datasets, next, the
emerging picture is corroborated by numerical experiments that highlight the
existence of several regimes (i.e., overfitting, failure and success) as the
dataset parameters are varied.]]></summary>

This capability is vital for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and should be
embedded in comprehensive intelligent models, enabling them to harness expert
models for complex task-solving towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
Large Language Models (LLMs) show promising learning and reasoning abilities,
and can effectively use external models, tools or APIs to tackle complex
problems. In this work, we introduce OpenAGI, an open-source AGI research
platform designed for multi-step, real-world tasks. Specifically, OpenAGI uses
a dual strategy, integrating standard benchmark tasks for benchmarking and
evaluation, and open-ended tasks including more expandable models, tools or
APIs for creative problem-solving. Tasks are presented as natural language
queries to the LLM, which then selects and executes appropriate models. We also
propose a Reinforcement Learning from Task Feedback (RLTF) mechanism that uses
task results to improve the LLM's ability, which creates a self-improving AI
feedback loop. While we acknowledge that AGI is a broad and multifaceted
research challenge with no singularly defined solution path, the integration of
LLMs with domain-specific expert models, inspired by mirroring the blend of
general and specialized intelligence in humans, offers a promising approach
towards AGI. We are open-sourcing the OpenAGI project's code, dataset,
benchmarks, evaluation methods, and demo to foster community involvement in AGI

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long exposure photography produces stunning imagery, representing moving
elements in a scene with motion-blur. It is generally employed in two
modalities, producing either a foreground or a background blur effect.
Foreground blur images are traditionally captured on a tripod-mounted camera
and portray blurred moving foreground elements, such as silky water or light
trails, over a perfectly sharp background landscape. Background blur images,
also called panning photography, are captured while the camera is tracking a
moving subject, to produce an image of a sharp subject over a background
blurred by relative motion. Both techniques are notoriously challenging and
require additional equipment and advanced skills. In this paper, we describe a
computational burst photography system that operates in a hand-held smartphone
camera app, and achieves these effects fully automatically, at the tap of the
shutter button. Our approach first detects and segments the salient subject. We
track the scene motion over multiple frames and align the images in order to
preserve desired sharpness and to produce aesthetically pleasing motion
streaks. We capture an under-exposed burst and select the subset of input
frames that will produce blur trails of controlled length, regardless of scene
or camera motion velocity. We predict inter-frame motion and synthesize
motion-blur to fill the temporal gaps between the input frames. Finally, we
composite the blurred image with the sharp regular exposure to protect the
sharpness of faces or areas of the scene that are barely moving, and produce a
final high resolution and high dynamic range (HDR) photograph. Our system
democratizes a capability previously reserved to professionals, and makes this
creative style accessible to most casual photographers.

These approaches require distinct architectural components and training

i.e., high confidence in imprecise predictions. In this work, we propose a
post-hoc sampling strategy for estimating predictive uncertainty accounting for
data ambiguity. The method can generate different plausible outputs for a given
input and does not assume parametric forms of predictive distributions. It is
architecture agnostic and can be applied to any feed-forward deterministic
network without changes to the architecture or training procedure. Experiments
on regression tasks on imaging and non-imaging input data show the method's
ability to generate diverse and multi-modal predictive distributions, and a
desirable correlation of the estimated uncertainty with the prediction error.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, bi-level optimization (BLO) has taken center stage in some very
exciting developments in the area of signal processing (SP) and machine
learning (ML). Roughly speaking, BLO is a classical optimization problem that
involves two levels of hierarchy (i.e., upper and lower levels), wherein
obtaining the solution to the upper-level problem requires solving the
lower-level one. BLO has become popular largely because it is powerful in
modeling problems in SP and ML, among others, that involve optimizing nested
objective functions. Prominent applications of BLO range from resource
allocation for wireless systems to adversarial machine learning. In this work,
we focus on a class of tractable BLO problems that often appear in SP and ML
applications. We provide an overview of some basic concepts of this class of
BLO problems, such as their optimality conditions, standard algorithms
(including their optimization principles and practical implementations), as
well as how they can be leveraged to obtain state-of-the-art results for a
number of key SP and ML applications. Further, we discuss some recent advances
in BLO theory, its implications for applications, and point out some
limitations of the state-of-the-art that require significant future research
efforts. Overall, we hope that this article can serve to accelerate the
adoption of BLO as a generic tool to model, analyze, and innovate on a wide
array of emerging SP and ML applications.]]></summary>

more critical. Among many factors, data with missing values is one primary
issue, and thus developing effective imputation models is a key topic in the
research community. Recently, a major research direction is to employ neural
network models such as self-organizing mappings or automatic encoders for
filling missing values. However, these classical methods can hardly discover
interrelated features and common features simultaneously among data attributes.
Especially, it is a very typical problem for classical autoencoders that they
often learn invalid constant mappings, which dramatically hurts the filling
performance. To solve the above-mentioned problems, we propose a
missing-value-filling model based on a feature-fusion-enhanced autoencoder. We
first incorporate into an autoencoder a hidden layer that consists of
de-tracking neurons and radial basis function neurons, which can enhance the
ability of learning interrelated features and common features. Besides, we
develop a missing value filling strategy based on dynamic clustering that is
incorporated into an iterative optimization process. This design can enhance
the multi-dimensional feature fusion ability and thus improves the dynamic
collaborative missing-value-filling performance. The effectiveness of the
proposed model is validated by extensive experiments compared to a variety of
baseline methods on thirteen data sets.]]></summary>

computational inefficiencies and incompatibilities with biology, but important
limitations still remain. Moreover, the approximations significantly decrease
accuracy in benchmarks, suggesting that an entirely different approach may be
more fruitful. Here, grounded on recent theory for Hebbian learning in soft
winner-take-all networks, we present multilayer SoftHebb, i.e. an algorithm
that trains deep neural networks, without any feedback, target, or error
signals. As a result, it achieves efficiency by avoiding weight transport,
non-local plasticity, time-locking of layer updates, iterative equilibria, and
(self-) supervisory or other feedback signals -- which were necessary in other
approaches. Its increased efficiency and biological compatibility do not trade
off accuracy compared to state-of-the-art bio-plausible learning, but rather
improve it. With up to five hidden layers and an added linear classifier,
accuracies on MNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10, and ImageNet, respectively reach 99.4%,
80.3%, 76.2%, and 27.3%. In conclusion, SoftHebb shows with a radically
different approach from BP that Deep Learning over few layers may be plausible

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We present a new algorithm for automatically bounding the Taylor remainder
series. In the special case of a scalar function $f: \mathbb{R} \to
\mathbb{R}$, our algorithm takes as input a reference point $x_0$, trust region
$[a, b]$, and integer $k \ge 1$, and returns an interval $I$ such that $f(x) -
\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \frac {1} {i!} f^{(i)}(x_0) (x - x_0)^i \in I (x - x_0)^k$ for
all $x \in [a, b]$. As in automatic differentiation, the function $f$ is
provided to the algorithm in symbolic form, and must be composed of known
atomic functions.

At a high level, our algorithm has two steps. First, for a variety of
commonly-used elementary functions (e.g., $\exp$, $\log$), we use
recently-developed theory to derive sharp polynomial upper and lower bounds on
the Taylor remainder series. We then recursively combine the bounds for the
elementary functions using an interval arithmetic variant of Taylor-mode
automatic differentiation. Our algorithm can make efficient use of machine
learning hardware accelerators, and we provide an open source implementation in
JAX.

We then turn our attention to applications. Most notably, in a companion
paper we use our new machinery to create the first universal
majorization-minimization optimization algorithms: algorithms that iteratively
minimize an arbitrary loss using a majorizer that is derived automatically,
rather than by hand. We also show that our automatically-derived bounds can be
used for verified global optimization and numerical integration, and to prove
sharper versions of Jensen's inequality.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the advancement of DNNs into safety-critical applications, testing
approaches for such models have gained more attention. A current direction is
the search for and identification of systematic weaknesses that put safety
assumptions based on average performance values at risk. Such weaknesses can
take on the form of (semantically coherent) subsets or areas in the input space
where a DNN performs systematically worse than its expected average. However,
it is non-trivial to attribute the reason for such observed low performances to
the specific semantic features that describe the subset. For instance,
inhomogeneities within the data w.r.t. other (non-considered) attributes might
distort results. However, taking into account all (available) attributes and
their interaction is often computationally highly expensive. Inspired by
counterfactual explanations, we propose an effective and computationally cheap
algorithm to validate the semantic attribution of existing subsets, i.e., to
check whether the identified attribute is likely to have caused the degraded
performance. We demonstrate this approach on an example from the autonomous
driving domain using highly annotated simulated data, where we show for a
semantic segmentation model that (i) performance differences among the
different pedestrian assets exist, but (ii) only in some cases is the asset
type itself the reason for this reduction in the performance.]]></summary>

types of language that people use, relate them to the visual world, and act
based on them. While current agents learn to execute simple language
instructions from task rewards, we aim to build agents that leverage diverse
language that conveys general knowledge, describes the state of the world,
provides interactive feedback, and more. Our key idea is that language helps
agents predict the future: what will be observed, how the world will behave,
and which situations will be rewarded. This perspective unifies language
understanding with future prediction as a powerful self-supervised learning
objective. We present Dynalang, an agent that learns a multimodal world model
that predicts future text and image representations and learns to act from
imagined model rollouts. Unlike traditional agents that use language only to
predict actions, Dynalang acquires rich language understanding by using past
language also to predict future language, video, and rewards. In addition to
learning from online interaction in an environment, Dynalang can be pretrained
on datasets of text, video, or both without actions or rewards. From using
language hints in grid worlds to navigating photorealistic scans of homes,
Dynalang utilizes diverse types of language to improve task performance,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi-label image recognition in the low-label regime is a task of great
challenge and practical significance. Previous works have focused on learning
the alignment between textual and visual spaces to compensate for limited image
labels, yet may suffer from reduced accuracy due to the scarcity of
high-quality multi-label annotations. In this research, we leverage the
powerful alignment between textual and visual features pretrained with millions
of auxiliary image-text pairs. We introduce an efficient and effective
framework called Evidence-guided Dual Context Optimization (DualCoOp++), which
serves as a unified approach for addressing partial-label and zero-shot
multi-label recognition. In DualCoOp++ we separately encode evidential,
positive, and negative contexts for target classes as parametric components of
the linguistic input (i.e., prompts). The evidential context aims to discover
all the related visual content for the target class, and serves as guidance to
aggregate positive and negative contexts from the spatial domain of the image,
enabling better distinguishment between similar categories. Additionally, we
introduce a Winner-Take-All module that promotes inter-class interaction during
training, while avoiding the need for extra parameters and costs. As DualCoOp++
imposes minimal additional learnable overhead on the pretrained vision-language
framework, it enables rapid adaptation to multi-label recognition tasks with
limited annotations and even unseen classes. Experiments on standard
multi-label recognition benchmarks across two challenging low-label settings
demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to
state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

gearboxes using vibration signals and deep learning (DL) approaches. However,
DL-based methods are susceptible to the domain shift problem caused by varying
operating conditions of the gearbox. Although domain adaptation and data
synthesis methods have been proposed to overcome such domain shifts, they are
often not directly applicable in real-world situations where only healthy data
is available in the target domain. To tackle the challenge of extreme domain
shift scenarios where only healthy data is available in the target domain, this
paper proposes two novel domain knowledge-informed data synthesis methods
utilizing the health data map (HDMap). The two proposed approaches are referred
to as scaled CutPaste and FaultPaste. The HDMap is used to physically represent
the vibration signal of the planetary gearbox as an image-like matrix, allowing
for visualization of fault-related features. CutPaste and FaultPaste are then
applied to generate faulty samples based on the healthy data in the target
domain, using domain knowledge and fault signatures extracted from the source
domain, respectively. In addition to generating realistic faults, the proposed
methods introduce scaling of fault signatures for controlled synthesis of
faults with various severity levels. A case study is conducted on a planetary
gearbox testbed to evaluate the proposed approaches. The results show that the
proposed methods are capable of accurately diagnosing faults, even in cases of
extreme domain shift, and can estimate the severity of faults that have not
been previously observed in the target domain.]]></summary>

attacks as illustrated by image classification models. Thoroughly understanding
such attacks is critical in order to ensure the safety and robustness of

only few constraints. An image is composed of homogeneous, numerical,
continuous, and independent features, unlike many other input types to AI

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As neural networks become more popular, the need for accompanying uncertainty
estimates increases. There are currently two main approaches to test the
quality of these estimates. Most methods output a density. They can be compared
by evaluating their loglikelihood on a test set. Other methods output a
prediction interval directly. These methods are often tested by examining the
fraction of test points that fall inside the corresponding prediction
intervals. Intuitively both approaches seem logical. However, we demonstrate
through both theoretical arguments and simulations that both ways of evaluating
the quality of uncertainty estimates have serious flaws. Firstly, both
approaches cannot disentangle the separate components that jointly create the
predictive uncertainty, making it difficult to evaluate the quality of the
estimates of these components. Secondly, a better loglikelihood does not
guarantee better prediction intervals, which is what the methods are often used
for in practice. Moreover, the current approach to test prediction intervals
directly has additional flaws. We show why it is fundamentally flawed to test a
prediction or confidence interval on a single test set. At best, marginal
coverage is measured, implicitly averaging out overconfident and underconfident
predictions. A much more desirable property is pointwise coverage, requiring
the correct coverage for each prediction. We demonstrate through practical
examples that these effects can result in favoring a method, based on the
predictive uncertainty, that has undesirable behaviour of the confidence or
prediction intervals. Finally, we propose a simulation-based testing approach
that addresses these problems while still allowing easy comparison between
different methods.]]></summary>

an accurate solution to a restricted version of the KRR problem involving $k

The proposed methods solve a broad range of KRR problems and overcome the

presents a resampling framework to construct exact, distribution-free and

suggested to demonstrate the framework. It is proved that the constructed
confidence regions are strongly consistent, that is, any false model is

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Distribution shifts are a serious concern in modern statistical learning as
they can systematically change the properties of the data away from the truth.
We focus on Wasserstein distribution shifts, where every data point may undergo
a slight perturbation, as opposed to the Huber contamination model where a
fraction of observations are outliers. We formulate and study shifts beyond
independent perturbations, exploring Joint Distribution Shifts, where the
per-observation perturbations can be coordinated. We analyze several important
statistical problems, including location estimation, linear regression, and
non-parametric density estimation. Under a squared loss for mean estimation and
prediction error in linear regression, we find the exact minimax risk, a least
favorable perturbation, and show that the sample mean and least squares
estimators are respectively optimal. This holds for both independent and joint
shifts, but the least favorable perturbations and minimax risks differ. For
other problems, we provide nearly optimal estimators and precise finite-sample
bounds. We also introduce several tools for bounding the minimax risk under
distribution shift, such as a smoothing technique for location families, and
generalizations of classical tools including least favorable sequences of
priors, the modulus of continuity, Le Cam's, Fano's, and Assouad's methods.]]></summary>

knowledge that can be expressed in terms of a single prior distribution.
However, when this knowledge is too vague to express with a single prior, an
alternative approach is needed. Gamma-minimax estimators provide such an
approach. These estimators minimize the worst-case Bayes risk over a set
$\Gamma$ of prior distributions that are compatible with the available
knowledge. Traditionally, Gamma-minimaxity is defined for parametric models. In
this work, we define Gamma-minimax estimators for general models and propose
adversarial meta-learning algorithms to compute them when the set of prior
distributions is constrained by generalized moments. Accompanying convergence
guarantees are also provided. We also introduce a neural network class that
provides a rich, but finite-dimensional, class of estimators from which a
Gamma-minimax estimator can be selected. We illustrate our method in two
settings, namely entropy estimation and a prediction problem that arises in
biodiversity studies.]]></summary>

many scientific domains and industries. People routinely use machine learning
techniques to not only process, visualize, and make predictions from this big

made using Interpretable Machine Learning, or machine learning models and
techniques that yield human understandable insights. In this paper, we discuss
and review the field of interpretable machine learning, focusing especially on
the techniques as they are often employed to generate new knowledge or make
discoveries from large data sets. We outline the types of discoveries that can
be made using Interpretable Machine Learning in both supervised and
unsupervised settings. Additionally, we focus on the grand challenge of how to
validate these discoveries in a data-driven manner, which promotes trust in
machine learning systems and reproducibility in science. We discuss validation
from both a practical perspective, reviewing approaches based on data-splitting
and stability, as well as from a theoretical perspective, reviewing statistical
results on model selection consistency and uncertainty quantification via
statistical inference. Finally, we conclude by highlighting open challenges in
using interpretable machine learning techniques to make discoveries, including

uncertainty estimation is becoming increasingly essential. One of the most
prominent uncertainty estimation methods is Deep Ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et
al., 2017) . A classical parametric model has uncertainty in the parameters due
to the fact that the data on which the model is build is a random sample. A
modern neural network has an additional uncertainty component since the
optimization of the network is random. Lakshminarayanan et al. (2017) noted
that Deep Ensembles do not incorporate the classical uncertainty induced by the
effect of finite data. In this paper, we present a computationally cheap
extension of Deep Ensembles for the regression setting, called Bootstrapped
Deep Ensembles, that explicitly takes this classical effect of finite data into
account using a modified version of the parametric bootstrap. We demonstrate
through an experimental study that our method significantly improves upon
standard Deep Ensembles]]></summary>

 Believe me, I know...
 I rent on-demand instances from vast.ai for Linux and have been exceedingly happy with their services. I've also used paperspace in the past with good success. Unfortunately, we are in need of RTX 4090s (or roughly equivalent performing Tesla cards) that run on a host OS of Windows 10+ (Server/Win11/etc all fine) because a lot of the modeling software in the industry I work in runs on Windows-only, which is absurd, but nevertheless the truth.
 The fastest I can find are A6000s on paperspace which won't cut the mustard. At the moment we have a 3090 and a bunch of 3070s on-prem which are doing OK but the RTX 4090 is simply much much better, and unsurprisingly the Windows-only software is also not coded in a way that takes advantage of multiple GPUs all that well either.
 Thanks for any help or referrals provided, I really appreciate it. 
 (Have checked paperspace, vastai, runpod, and a few other smaller ones to no avail)

 I understood the reason why there could be high bias while bootstrapping the advantage. But why does $A_t^{\inf}$ have high variance. Aren't bias and variance concepts related to estimation by an estimator? While calculating $A_t^{\inf}$, we are literally using the reward values obtained from the environment and therefore there is no estimation involved. Could someone please help me with this?

 Abstract:
  
To interact with humans in the world, agents need to understand the diverse types of language that people use, relate them to the visual world, and act based on them. While current agents learn to execute simple language instructions from task rewards, we aim to build agents that leverage diverse language that conveys general knowledge, describes the state of the world, provides interactive feedback, and more. Our key idea is that language helps agents predict the future: what will be observed, how the world will behave, and which situations will be rewarded. This perspective unifies language understanding with future prediction as a powerful self-supervised learning object…]]></summary>

 Hey Guys,
 I am happy to share with you a web application I've working on the past couple weeks. It's a tool to predict the outcome of soccer games in minor football leagues. Named ScoreCast, it predicts the outcome of soccer games in six minor leagues: Serie A Brazil, Serie B Brazil, Primera Division Argentina, J1 League Japan, Eliteserien Norway, and Veikkausliiga Finland.
 Since I am really interested in football analytics and also not being able to find many online tools for predicting the outcomes in minor soccer leagues, I had the need to create ScoreCast to have it as a tool for guidance on this field.
 If you want to check it out, here are some links that might help:

 Here's a quick rundown of my process:
 Data Loading & Preprocessing: Convert acoustic guitar recordings to spectrograms and split into training and validation sets.
 Generator: Neural network trained to create high-quality studio recording spectrograms from low-quality inputs.
 Discriminator: Another neural network trained to differentiate between real and generator-created high-quality spectrograms.
 Training: Train the Generator and Discriminator against each other in a cat-and-mouse game of deception and detection.
 Audio Enhancement: Feed the Generator a low-quality spectrogram, get a high-quality one out, and convert it back into an audio file.
 I'm reaching out because I'm not entirely satisfied with the quality of the output. The enhanced audio is just rhythmic noise, what am i missing with generating the audio?
 I'm wondering if anyone here has experience with GANs for audio enhancement and can offer some advice. Is there something I might be missing in my approach? Are there any tips or tricks you've found helpful in your own work?
 And yes, I'm prepared for you to tear me a new one. Bring on the constructive criticism!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wrote an in-depth article exploring Vicuna as an alternative to competitor LLMs like ChatGPT, Alpaca, and LLaMA for chat applications. I based it off the research data on the LMSYS.org website and the Github repo for the project.
 Key findings:
  
Vicuna achieves over 90% of ChatGPT's conversational quality based on benchmarks, despite being smaller in size.
 It significantly outperforms other open models like LLaMA and Alpaca.
 Vicuna is freely available for non-commercial use under a research license.
 For startups and developers, Vicuna provides an decent open-source alternative to proprietary conversational AI.
 It shows the potential of transfer learning from foundation models like LLaMA.
  
Overall, Vicuna represents a promising development in democratizing access to leading conversational intelligence through its high performance, permissive licensing, and open availability.
 You can read the full article here. I also publish all these articles in a weekly email if you prefer to get them that way.

This involves using artificial intelligence (AI) models, including GPT-like models, BART-like models, and other specialized transformer models, to assist in writing, debugging, and documenting code.
 My journey with programming is a bit unconventional. I took one year of computer science at university and learned how to write "Hello, World!" in TurboPascal from an old university textbook in late primary school. That was the extent of my programming experience until about a month ago. Since then, I've been using AI models to write code for my ideas, as I don't have extensive programming skills.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[www.daystosingularity.com is a (very) rough estimation of the remaining time before technology achieves a pivotal moment when our civilization undergoes a profound transformation due to the exponential growth of technology and the emergence of superintelligent machines that improve themselves.
 Although the Singularity is not predicted to happen on a specific date, all at once, the estimated date can be seen as the center of a bell Gaussian curve of the estimation, with that center designated as the possible date that future historicists will pose as the beginning of a new historical period.
 Technological Singularity poses risks that include the emergence of superintelligent AI outpacing human control, loss of control over AI’s actions and behavior, unintended consequences of advanced AI systems, massive job displacement, wealth inequality, existential risks like human extinction, ethical concerns, dependency on technology, and a decline in human skills and abilities due to excessive reliance on AI. Not funny.
 We use the definition of technological singularity. This milestone is predicted to occur after AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is reached. Please check our definitions and methodology here.
 Predicting the singularity is challenging and uncertain. Current estimates should be viewed cautiously.The estimated date is being continuously updated.
 We ponder a relevant list of curated expert predictions and contributing factors on when the singularity will take place.
 Any suggestion for perfecting the method is highly appreciated.

 i'm a data engineer in the traditional space for over 10 years. I am working on a library for easy transitioning unstructured to structured data. The use case is that I would regularly build a ton of python pipelines but without schema management, they would be a pain to maintain.
 2y ago I started working on this library https://pypi.org/project/dlt/, and now it''s ready to help people like myself to load json to db/parquet/iceberg with a 1-liner with schema evolution. Declarative loading possible.
 I am looking for the following feedback
 - What would make this more useful in the ML space? Specific destinations? Are the docs usable or do you expect something different? let me know what. For example, we are adding Weaviate vector db and Athena + Iceberg in the next weeks.
 - any features you are missing? or any ideas that you think would be helpful? 
 - are the docs relatable, understandable? what are you missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Any suggestions on how to prepare code data to fine tune a code LLM in an unsupervised way or is it even possible?
 For example: Task: Code summarisation with custom code base (with no summaries) Let's assume that this code base is unique and a pre-trained model is giving unsatisfactory results. Now to fine tune there are three options, 1. Manually prepare summaries for a portion of the code and fine tune 2. Find a similar code base which has the labels (docstring) and fine tune 3. Mask some portions of the code randomly and give as input and output will be the masked portions
 Options 1 and 2 don't seem feasible for a production environment. 
 The reasoning behind option 3 is that with no availability labels, the model will learn the patterns in the code base and provide a better summarisation with its pre-trained knowledge.
 I tried the option 3 with CodeT5+ fine tuning. The format of input and output was as follows Input:
 def __init__(self, text, font): self._text = text self._font = font def get_text(self): |<mask>| def set_text(self, value): self._text = value``` 
 Output: return self._text

 Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01825
 GitHub: https://github.com/OFA-Sys/gsm8k-ScRel
 Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is a challenging task for large language models (LLMs), while the scaling relationship of it with respect to LLM capacity is under-explored. In this paper, we investigate how the pre-training loss, supervised data amount, and augmented data amount influence the reasoning performances of a supervised LLM. We find that pre-training loss is a better indicator of the model’s performance than the model’s parameter count. We apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with different amounts of supervised data and empirically find a log-linear relation between data amount and model performance, and we find better models improve less with enlarged supervised datasets. To augment more data samples for improving model performances without any human effort, we propose to apply Rejection sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT). RFT uses supervised models to generate and collect correct reasoning paths as augmented fine-tuning datasets. We find with augmented samples containing more distinct reasoning paths, RFT improves mathematical reasoning performance more for LLMs. We also find RFT brings more improvement for less performant LLMs. Furthermore, we combine rejection samples from multiple models which push LLaMA-7B to an accuracy of 49.3% and outperforms the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) accuracy of 35.9% significantly.

 Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have significant potential to affect the lives of individuals and societies. As these systems are being increasingly used in decision-making processes, it has become crucial to ensure that they make ethically sound judgments. This paper proposes a novel framework for embedding ethical priors into AI, inspired by the Bayesian approach to machine learning. We propose that ethical assumptions and beliefs can be incorporated as Bayesian priors, shaping the AI’s learning and reasoning process in a similar way to humans’ inborn moral intuitions. This approach, while complex, provides a promising avenue for advancing ethically aligned AI systems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As ChatGPT's performance takes a slight dip, LLaMA-2 uncensored opens new doors by being fully open-sourced, recent studies unveil "universal" adversarial attacks capable of disrupting both open-source language models and RLHF-tuned ones like ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, and co.
 Despite all this, RLHF still stands its ground as the de facto industry-standard approach to aligning LLMs with human preference. Yet as every week slips by, the more we unmask the limitations of RLHF. In fact, there are instances where RLHF seems to deteriorate certain LLM features it pledged to enhance, like hallucinations.
 This field is evolving fast, and there's always more to learn. I took some effort to write a short blog post where I delve into the most recent findings on the shortcomings of RLHF.
 Link in the comments below. Let me know what you think about it!

Medicine is an inherently multimodal discipline. When providing care, clinicians routinely interpret data from a wide range of modalities including medical images, clinical notes, lab tests, electronic health records, genomics, and more.  Over the last decade or so, AI systems have achieved expert-level performance on specific tasks within specific modalities — some AI systems processing CT scans, while others analyzing high magnification pathology slides, and still others hunting for rare genetic variations. The inputs to these systems tend to be complex data such as images, and they typically provide structured outputs, whether in the form of discrete grades o…]]></summary>

 I'm excited to share Epsilla, an open-source vector database!
 Under the hood, we implemented the state-of-art ANN index algorithm from the academia (SpeedANN) that leverages intra-query parallel graph traversal, which outperforms HNSW by 5x on high precision query latency on medium size (1M) vector space and outperforms HNSW by 50 times on large-scale vector search.
 In addition, we also made a few design choices on our database interface and architecture based on our previous database experience at TigerGraph, we would love to hear what our users think about these choices
 We just started 3 weeks ago and it's still in the very early stages, we wanted to get your feedback and work together to shape our vector database features. Let us know what you think and what you'd like to see!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys.
 I'd like to make an image classifier for the Kaggle landscape dataset (24K images and 34 classes) using transfer learning.
 I'm a little bit limited on resources to train the model so I'd like to have an understanding of which model is the better option for this specific task, however, I'm struggling to find info on that and how to tune hyperparameters given that I've decided on the model architecture.
 So far I've seen people referring to VGG and ResNet models as the better option for image classification tasks on medium sized datasets, but I'd like to see the argumentation behind that too. I've also heard of a practice of training different model candidates for a few epochs and choosing the one that does better (this only shows which model converges faster on the data, correct me if I'm wrong).
 I'd also like to read info on hyperparameter tuning such as batch size, the amount of layers to unfreeze etc. but can't seem to find any explanation that wasn't really surface-level.
 If you know any articles/videos on this topic I'd greatly appreciate you sharing the links.
 TLDR; Need links to articles/videos about choosing the model architecture for transfer learning and tuning hyperparameters for the model.

 We are facing an issue with Pinecone utilising 32 bit single precision when taking in floats.
 This is causing our data input to become skewed.
 Anyone have advice on how to resolve this? Alternative products? Exploring possibly configuring a Redis server to handle higher precision.

I have programming knowledge, i made a bunch of very small project in python, and currently it's the language i'm most comfortable with. I lack of math knowledge, i struggle with calculus since i never studied it at school, the furthest i got with school was first degree equations.
 by myself i studied some math i didnt do in school, but i still suck at math. I wonder if i can start now or i should wait to study calculus at school. anyway, i'd love to get linked to a source for me to learn NNs from scratch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got inspired by a twitter thread yesterday from Chase Lean on how to create illustrations for children's books using Midjourney and thought it might be cool to look at a slightly different use case - creating coloring books for grown-ups.
 I made a guide showing how to use the Hasdx model for this because it gives a good balance of style and realism/intracacy. The guide also explores some example prompts and shows how you can couple it with an upscaler like Real-ESRGAN, GFPGAN, or Codeformer to get even better results.
 My three big takeaways:
  
Hasdx balances general capabilities with a focus on realism and detail. This makes it well-suited for detailed adult coloring book images.
 The prompt structure gives you precise control over the theme and complexity of the generated illustrations. Negative prompts help avoid undesirable elements (sort of obvious I guess).
 Running Hasdx outputs through upscaling models improves quality for printing. ESRGAN is a good option but there are lots of others that can work well too.
  
I also investigated how to modify the prompt to vary the level of complexity in the image, effectively tailoring our model to the skill level of the adult (or child) who happens to be holding the crayons.
 Here's a link to the guide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I worked for less than a year as a Data Engineer. I decided to look for other challenges and got a job as an AI engineer developing language models.
 The product of the company that hired me is related to data and metadata management. My tasks will be to introduce features to the product, including a chat function that will allow for asking questions about data. Other tasks will include research and proposing additional AI-related functionalities to the product (on premise). I have a two weeks left to start work and I need to prepare a bit. My job will involve implementing ready-made solutions and conducting research (high level - I need to implement valuable features and no one cares how).
 What are the most important things I should learn before starting work?
 First of all, I replicated a few applications from this blog: https://blog.streamlit.io/tag/llms/
 Then I have focused on Langchain. I'm also in the middle of a course on Udemy about Next-Gen AI projects - Beginner friendly - Langchain, Pinecone - OpenAI, HuggingFace & LLAMA 2 models
 I need a roadmap that will guide me a bit. I'm looking for blogs/materials/courses that will give me practical knowledge in this matter.

 Meta Platforms (META.O) on Wednesday introduced its open-source AI tool called AudioCraft that will help users to create music and audio based on text prompts. The AI tool is bundled with three models, AudioGen, EnCodec, and MusicGen, and works for music, sound, compression, and generation, Meta said.[2]
 As generative AI enters the mainstream, the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter has struggled to formulate a policy that satisfies parties on all sides of the debate.[3]

 My opinion is more of the alignment discussion should be on symbiosis. I think AI will get more intelligent than us that we won’t be able to control it, but I don’t see why a super intelligence would want to destroy us. If it’s a super intelligence it would make sense to just manipulate us. We do have opposable thumbs, and are much more energy efficient than synthetic systems m. AI doesn’t need to enslave us it just needs to manipulate us & use us effectively which wouldn’t be hard to do. I think a super intelligence even with desires is most likely to use us as a tool in a way where we don’t even realize that we are the ones being used. I think trying to control something more intelligent than us will be impossible. I’m more afraid of something more intelligent than us but not smart enough to manipulate us into doing it’s bidding happily 😂

 I recently learned about people getting annoyed by how the stack exchange company is treating its communities. Although the latter example might have recently been resolved.
 Because of these problems, I have been looking out for alternative Q&A platforms. I stumbled upon https://codidact.com as a possibly viable alternative, but not many people seem to have found it thus far.
 It already has communities for software, math and [linux](linux.codidact.com) for example, but I am missing a community for ML questions over there. Therefore I wrote a proposal to add a ML community.
 Currently, it seems like I’m one of only few ML people on codidact. I think it would be good if other people would get involved as well. I would also welcome any feedback on how to shape this community. If you’re interested to get a feel for the experience, you could already start asking questions in the incubator Q&A.
 TL;DR: what do you think about building a ML Q&A over on codidact? dual TL;DR: Do you want to play Q&A with me on codidact?
 PS: I didn’t miss out on other new big ML Q&A sites, did I?

 I'll really appreciate any suggestions.

Posts created by AI would be accompanied by a label explaining its involvement. This raises the question of whether such labels could also help users identify when an entire account is AI-generated.[1]
 According to tech consultancy Gartner, the conversational AI market is projected to reach $18.6 billion in 2023, with a growth rate of 16.2%. This growth is mainly attributed to the increasing adoption of cloud-based contact services utilizing conversational AI. Gartner also predicts a 24% growth in the virtual assistant market next year.[2]
 Scientists hope a computer system will learn to automatically identify bee species from buzzes picked up by autonomous recording stations.[3]
 Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University have exposed tricks to “jailbreaking” AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard to have them relay knowledge to aid in illegal activities like making drugs and even manipulating the 2024 U.S. presidential election.[4]

However, for a reason I cannot locate, after anwhere from 15-25 passes through the forward function, the size of the batches starts decreasing, until it falls all the way to 1, before throwing a warning that n_step isn't a multiple of the number of environments, jumping to a size = the number of training environments and then the training agent's batch size before erroring out. My best guess is that somehow truncated games aren't being properly added to the batch, but that doesn't quite explain why each subsequent batch is equal or smaller in size. I am at a loss for how to debug this. Everything is in this Python Notebook.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys this is my first post.
 I am building my first machine learning model to predict costs of various projects by month. Each row can be identified with a column project name and month (these two are dropped for testing). The rest of the columns are various features that can help predicting the end project cost. 
 I want to be able to predict costs on a monthly basis. My question is how should I split the data because each row is a unique project and month. Is it ok to just do a train test split and have earlier project months be in the testing set while having future project months be in the training set? Isn’t that giving the model too much information? 
 Or should I train on each project’s indices and leave one project as testing for each project I have? I’m worried about overfitting with that one.
 Thanks in advance for any help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 same as other folks, I was quite curious about the recent GZIP paper presented at ACL 2023, where the authors demonstrate strong text classification performance by using a compression-based distance function in a KNN model.
 However, in the end, I am not sure whether GZIP can fully live up to the hype. I tested a very simple bag-of-words distance and found that it can achieve better results compared with GZIP, while being also faster.
 In a nutshell, I think we can say that:
  
Yes, KNN (with some sensible distance function) is an interesting approach, particularly for few-shot/low-resource scenarios.
 
No, GZIP (even though it's a cool idea) is not a very sensible distance function. Simply using a bag-of-words achieves better results, and is much faster.
 
 Here's my full write-up:
 https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15002
 [PS: A short comment on the GZIP evaluation issue that has been widely discussed. Indeed, as was also shown in a popular blogpost, the displayed accuracy of GZIP in the original paper is optimistic. Therefore, I show correct/realistic accuracy numbers for all methods that I tested. However, the main point of my note is not to make a SOTA comparison or something, but rather just provide a reminder that bag-of-word is a good method for starters and a strong baseline, and can perform better than more complex GZIP for KNN classification]

 Personally I feel the best way to address this common talking point is with an analogy. 
 Spiders think they could stop all humans if they just withheld all the webs and web making material from us.
 Without those tools, humans couldn't catch flies and surely they'd starve to death? Spiders can't fathom the range of alternate methods for procuring food and thriving.
 Within even a single hour of runtime, a super AGI will likely have diversified away from the human electrical grid in ways we couldn't even imagine. 
 The counter argument is, that it would take time to build these pieces together. It after all took us 100 years to get to where we are with the grid. The counter-counter argument however is the AGI doesn't ned to, it can 5D chess us so that all our future actions will fulfil that goal with some slight nudging here and there. 
 Fascinating stuff - ultimately though, i'm in the camp of AGI won't happen over night like Frankenstein via a flip of a switch. As AI evolves so do we, gains are incremental with the occasional blips; so whilst this is super fun to talk about, I think the case of us getting blindsided is unlikely. 
 I could be wrong...and I probably am.

 I've got a rather large dataset of images, mostly featuring humans in a variety of poses (think along the lines of a collection of people practicing yoga and the like).
 My goal is to cluster these images based on the poses, so I can avoid the tedious task of manually sifting through each one to find all the people doing handstands, splits, and so forth.
 My initial thought was to run OpenPose on all these images, then perform clustering based on the output from OpenPose.
 Does this sound like a feasible approach? Do any of you have better suggestions? Or perhaps there's already an existing software solution that can do this?
 Thanks!

 Working with GAIL has been very frustrating because it's incredibly seed dependent and unstable. This makes progress and iteration speed for experiments/modifications built on top of it very slow.
 As I'm not an expert in Imitation Learning: Does anybody with experience know more stable alternatives (or improvements) to GAIL?
 The setting I'm considering is Learning from Observations (LfO), so I don't think that DAgger will work.
 I've done some preliminary search and found this method https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04650.pdf. However, the authors don't compare it to GAIL.
 Thanks in advance for any suggestions!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all:
 I am trying to train a competitive scenario in a Multiagent particle environment( I am now using the Pettingzoo API). The Algorithm I am now using only support discrete action space. But I want to evaluate agents with one side's policy keep fixed and let the other side's policies be the trained policy. The policy can be simple( like if the target for one side agent is to chase the other side, their policy is directly following the trajectory for their target). The core.py for the petting zoo, it has 
  # return all agents controllable by external policies @property def policy_agents(self): return [agent for agent in self.agents if agent.action_callback is None] # return all agents controlled by world scripts @property def scripted_agents(self): return [agent for agent in self.agents if agent.action_callback is not None] 
 But in the step for the environment, it seems the environment directly controls the policy agent. My understanding is scripted agent is RL policy output and the Policy agent can be controlled by other policies. 
 My question is :
 if my policy output is the desired position for each timestep, but now the MPE's control dynamic is learned the acceleration's increment, and it's discrete, how can I implement the policy as one side of my competitive case?
  
if I can control the policy agent base on policy_agent, how can I step both policy and script agent in env?
 if I can control the agent separately, like my RL output can be discrete but the policy output can be continuous position.
 how to define the termination or truncation for all agents?

 The pretrained model: gives an output as a binary mask for the object its trying to detect.
 The optical flow: is the motion of pixels between frames, this model also gives an image shaped flow vector.
 I want to combine the mask by pretrained model and optical flow information and send it to another model to improve its performance.
 For the model: I can use U-net or a simple convolution encoder-decoder model, but I am confused about which will be the best model architecture for it.

 Please let me know if I am missing any information or if any clarification is required.

 ​
 I want to use a new data representation instead of float for fine-tuning/testing a model (e.g., DNN) in Pytorch. The basic operations (add/sub/multiply/division) in my data type is different from floating point. My question is if it is possible to implement these operations (+,-,*,/) and force all of functions in Pytorch (e.g., torch.add(), torch.sum(), torch.nn.Linear(), conv2d, etc.) to use my basic arithmetic implementation? If so, could you please guide me how can I do it?
 Because I think otherwise it takes so much time and effort; first, I have to find which functions my model calls (which I dont know how to do it) and, then, I have to replace them one by one. This becomes complicated for a large model.
 I found this link from Pytorch that shows how to extend pytorch. But it seems that it is not comprehensive enough to answer my question.

 ​
 I am delving into the exciting realm of GenAI and LLMs. I have a few questions I hope you can help me with:
 ​
  
When should I opt for supervised fine-tuning rather than prompt engineering with retrieval? 
 
What are the associated costs of supervised fine-tuning?
 
How many high-quality observations are typically required for successful supervised fine-tuning?
 
What are the frameworks and computional requirements usually involved in supervised fine-tuning, and how can I implement them in code? any tutorials available?
 
Can the model adapt and learn new jargon or specific tasks that might not be extensively covered during the pre-training phase?
 
 ​
 I understand that a combination of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, with human feedback through a reward model, is considered the best approach. However, given that the latter method can be costly and falls under the domain of heavy research, it is probably less feasible for medium-sized organizations.

 There is so much noise in the reviews every year. Some good work that the authors are proud of might get a low score because of the noisy system, given that NeurIPS is growing so large these years. We should keep in mind that the work is still valuable no matter what the score is.

 Github: https://github.com/OpenBMB/ToolBench 
 Abstract:
  
Despite the advancements of open-source large language models (LLMs) and their variants, e.g., LLaMA and Vicuna, they remain significantly limited in performing higher-level tasks, such as following human instructions to use external tools (APIs). This is because current instruction tuning largely focuses on basic language tasks instead of the tool-use domain. This is in contrast to state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT, which have demonstrated excellent tool-use capabilities but are unfortunately closed source. To facilitate tool-use capabilities within open-source LLMs, we introduce ToolLLM, a general tool-use framework of data construction, model training and evaluation. We first …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 As many of you probably know Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) was the core technique used to produce ChatGPT and similar AI assistants that followed. RLHF replaces human feedback in an RL schema with a preference model that is trained according to a dataset of human preferences.
 Anthropic has devised an extension of this idea in which an AI model (rather than humans) is used to generate the data which ultimately trains the preference model. This method, called Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback uses a "constitution" to guide the feedback model in terms of what outputs are preferable to others.
 I go over the research in How Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback Works. In short, the authors find that they are able to train a non-evasive harmless agent using a short constitution. The method is found to be superior to RLHF, and constitutes a Pareto improvement over RLHF models.

 First off, apologies if this kind of post isn't allowed. I tried messaging the mods in advance, but didn't get a reply. Of course feel free to delete if it's not.
 I'm an academic at the University of Cambridge's Computer Lab, and I'm looking to get some insights from people that work with algorithmic systems (e.g. ML systems) in a professional capacity. 
 The aim of the research is to document some of the approaches, attitudes, and challenges associated with record-keeping for these types of systems, and write them up for an academic conference.
 If you're a professional working with algorithmic/ML systems, and happen to have a spare ~20 minutes, would you mind answering some questions? The link to the questionnaire is here: https://cambridge.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3n6RuowNogZKG34
 Thanks very much! I'd be more than happy to come back and share the results/paper here if that's of interest to people?

 So, I took matters into my own hands and developed a Chrome extension that allows you to get an answer from AI without ever leaving the comfort of your current tab, and specifically - the comfort of your current text field. It may seem like a simple solution, but trust me - it's a game-changer when trying to save time and energy.
 Assuming that there's a chance some of you might be experiencing the same frustration, I'd like to share this tool with you.
 For anyone thinking: "Wait, but there are already tools that let you use AI inside the current browser tab" - yeah, there are. BUT can they scrape website data from a simple URL in order to get context for the response? Can other tools read PDFs? Do these tools let you control every setting to the smallest detail? Probably not. Well this tool does let you do all that.
 You can find it on Chrome store as "Wou AI"
 Let me know how it works out for you, and I would greatly appreciate any feedback or suggestions for future functions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The official python package for the "'Low-Resource' Text Classification: A Parameter-Free Classification Method with Compressors" has now been released on pypi: npc-gzip v0.1.0
  
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are often used for text classification due to their high accuracy. However, DNNs can be computationally intensive, requiring millions of parameters and large amounts of labeled data, which can make them expensive to use, to optimize, and to transfer to out-of-distribution (OOD) cases in practice. In this paper, we propose a non-parametric alternative to DNNs that’s easy, lightweight, and universal in text classification: a combination of a simple compressor like gzip with a k-nearest-neighbor classifier. Without any training parameters, our method achieves results that are competitive with non-pretrained deep learning methods on six in-distribution datasets.It even outperforms BERT on all five OOD datasets, including four low-resource languages. Our method also excels in the few-shot setting, where labeled data are too scarce to train DNNs effectively.
  
This paper has made some waves on this subreddit and in the community in general over the last 2 weeks. We've seen the bugs around training/testing data leakages and varying claims in accuracy. Our hope with this package is to get the code into everyone's hands first to solve whatever use case you currently have for this technology and second to make the code more readily available for additional community testing.

 Example:Player: ['Green', 439.9180603027344, 461.7232666015625, 13.700743675231934]
 Enemy Data {0: [473.99951171875, 420.5301513671875, 'Green', 20.159990310668945]}
 Box: {0: [720, 605, 'Green_box'], 1: [957, 311, 'Green_box'], 2: [432, 268, 'Red_box'], 3: [1004, 399, 'Blue_box']} 
 can anyone suggest a way to make one.
 Rules:
 - You can only move in the direction of mouse.
 -You can dash in direction of mouse by LMB.
 -You can collect boxes to get HP and change colors.
 -Red color kills Blue kills Green Kills Red.
 -There is a fixed screen.
 -You lose 25% of total HP when you dash.
 -You lose 50% of HP when you bump into players (of color that kills or there HP is > than you.

My ultimate goal being real-time description for, say, sports casting. I'm sure something like this is what cars use to drive themselves, or not? Any info is appreciated!

 Curious if anyone has recommendations on models to use to interpret the data in tables? I'm playing around with Google's Matcha model, which performs fine. seems like extracting the data out of a table and asking GPT4 to analyze it performs a bit better but requires extra steps.
 I'm specifically not looking to interpret graphs, but rather tables. e.g., can i ask the model to identify if there are any errors in the table / any data points that don't tie if the rows are supposed to sum up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings!
 I'm going through the initial equations that define most of the theoretical framework for the specialization. One curious thing I noticed with equations 3.5 and 3.6 is that they use the conditional distribution p(s′,r∣s,a) without including any priors. I'm talking about priors because, unless I'm missing something huge, the definition of the expected value for the reward (for both 3.5 and 3.6) should use the joint distribution for all 4 dimensions (next state, reward, current state, action). From that joint distribution, we can factorize it to show p(s′,r∣s,a). For example, one factorization that seems to make sense for this kind of model is
 p(s′,r,s,a) = p(s′,r∣s,a) ⋅ p(s) ⋅ p(a)
 which would turn, for example, equation 3.5 into
 r(s,a) = ∑​ ∑ ​r ⋅ p(s′,r∣s,a) ⋅ p(s) ⋅ p(a) (Note: the two sums are for "r" and "s' ". I wrote like that because I don't know write it in Latex or similar...)
 What am I missing? Is it because s and a are given as parameters of the function r(s,a) meaning that p(s) = p(a) = 1? If the factorization above is the right one for those equations, is this the only factorization used in the entire book?
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the past several years this subreddit has been my favorite source to keep up with new, interesting ideas and research from all over the field. It's great to have a way to break out of my own insular research bubble and spread out a bit more. Unfortunately, it looks like that era has passed.
 The sub has been seemingly shifting away from research in the past 1-2 years. Whenever research is posted, it is almost always LLM based with very little variety (considering the plethora of research areas in ML). I don't mean to assert that this is a bad thing, as the constant upvotes indicate that there is a high demand for LLM projects and research. Heck, I'm also interested in lots of the recent work with LLMs, and I plan to keep up with it – but I also would also love a venue with a diversity of ideas and topics. Machine learning is a HUGE field, and only focusing on a small subset of it seems like a waste.
 I don't mean to rant, but rather to ask: are there any other subreddits like this, or perhaps, any other active communities with a broader scope?
 Or if this doesn't exist, is there a demand for it? Or is it just me?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, I am working on a horse racing model to identify the probabilities of each horse winning a race. I currently have a feed forward NN with a final SOFTMAX layer to simulate probabilities of each horse winning using cross-entropy loss. My plan here being that if the model outputs, [0.05, 0.4, 0.2, 0.15, 0.2] then horses 1-5 have the corresponding probability of winning. The model has been trained like a regular classification task where the target is a one-hot vector describing the winner.
 Unlike previous work I have done where SOFTMAX output lends itself to some "confidence" score, this task requires that the model outputs be indicative of probabilities. My concern is that experientially, NNs tend to be overconfident with their answers in this type of setting. However, I wish to keep using a NN as each race datapoint has around 3k features - did not find good results with XGBoost. Any good practices for modelling probabilities in this sort of scenario? For context, the probability of a horse winning is what sets the odds for that horse.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! I'm trying to use reinforcement learning to solve a problem in the power market. The problem is about finding the best strategy for bidding on electricity for each hour of the day, considering both buying and selling options. Let's say we have a generator that can produce up to 800MW of electricity per day, and it can be charged up to 200MW per hour. After charging it for 4 hours continuously, it reaches its maximum capacity, and we can't charge more until we discharge some electricity. We have access to data from the past 5 years, including information about temperature, hydro, gas prices, and locational marginal price, which is important for determining profit. For instance, if we buy 10MW of electricity for a specific hour, our profit for that hour is 10 times the locational marginal price. The goal is to maximize profit at the end of the day while making sure that the total electricity bought and sold is equal for all days. This means we want to avoid wasting electricity. I initially tried using deep Q-learning, where the agent's state consists of data from the past 3 days, and the agent can take actions to buy or sell a certain amount of electricity for one hour. However, this approach doesn't seem to provide accurate results, and it works step by step, not considering the overall outcome for the whole day. So, I'm looking for help on how to build an agent capable of producing 24 bids for 24 hours, considering the constraints of the generator's capacity and ensuring no waste of electricity. I'm new to reinforcement learning, and I'm not sure how to approach this complex problem. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated!

 Now, you can add and subtract image and text queries from each other; here are a few usage examples:  cd photos && rclip horse + stripes cd photos && rclip apple - fruit cd photos && rclip "./new york city.jpg" + night cd photos && rclip "2:golden retriever" + "./swimming pool.jpg" cd photos && rclip "./racing car.jpg" - "2:sports car" + "2:snow" 
 If you want to see how these queries perform when executed on the 1.28 million images ImageNet-1k dataset, check out the demo on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsTgYdOpgcQ.
 rclip source code is published on GitHub under the MIT license and offers a pre-build distributable for Linux (installation instructions are in the README): https://github.com/yurijmikhalevich/rclip. Give it a try and let me know what you think!

I believe the series started with tic-tac-toe and definitely progressed to gomoku, before maybe moving on to more complex games. I think there was more of a focus on algorithms (maybe MCTS) and concepts than code. It's a long shot, but does anyone recall this series or know if it's archived somewhere? seems like it might have been taken down.
  
Wasn't on Medium. I think it might've been a personal website. I vaguely remember a green UI theme?

The authors of the paper have trained their model for 250 epochs, which for what I am doing is not feasible. I was wondering what would be the recommended number of epochs I should run the BERT model for? I know it is a pretty open ended question, but I was looking to get the community's view on how much epochs should a BERT based model be trained for. Any information will be much appreciated.

 Screenshot
 I uploaded the PDF of the recently scientific paper by the Korean research group claiming to have discovered a room temperature semiconductor, in the original Korean, and asked various language models whether they thought the methodology is legit, and each bot I tried was able to read the PDF. I tried Claude-instant, Claude2, 'Assistant' (Poe's own GPT based bot that claims to have its own training dataset), PaLM, ChatGPT 3.5, and ChatGPT4.
 Poe also has three versions of the recently released Llama model by Meta. It gave me an error when I tried to ask it about the PDF attachment, but I was able to upload a text document and it was able to read it fine.
 Screenshot of Claude-instant evaluating PDF
 Screenshot of Google PaLM evaluating PDF
 Screenshot of Llama-2-70b evaluating text file containing song lyrics
 It also works with custom bots. Here's me trying it out with a 'Truth Checker' bot I made (based on Claude-Instant).
 Here it is using a Claude-2 based version of the TruthChecker bot.
 (Here's the link to the TruthChecker bot if you have Poe and wanna check it out: https://poe.com/TruthChecker)
 Edit: I can see here how the context size matters... for instance, Claude-Instant only has a context size of about 7k words, so it clearly can't read the whole paper, while Claude-2 can and gives a very different answer...
 TL:DR; looks like Poe.com allows file attachment/upload on all language models now. No idea what filetypes are supported.

 but when i tried to implement A2C model training using SB3 on simple spread environment, I am not getting good and improved reward values, it's still highly negative and the model is performing rather randomly. 
 env = ss.pettingzoo_env_to_vec_env_v1(env)
 env = ss.concat_vec_envs_v1(env, 4, num_cpus=2, base_class="stable_baselines3")
 policy_kwargs = dict(net_arch = [128,128])

 learning_rate= 0.007,
 gamma = 0.95,
 ent_coef = 0.4,
 policy_kwargs= policy_kwargs,
 tensorboard_log= logdir
 )
 This is a fragment of code for reference. I tried to give more policy_kwargs like: share_features_extractor=False, or even tried to implement entirely custom policy, but the total average reward is still not going above -300.
 Also, the tensorboard plots are not showing ep_rew_mean plot, should I be passing some parameters for that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🚀 Code: https://github.com/sdc17/UPop
 📑 Paper: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shi23e/shi23e.pdf
 🧐 A Quick Look
  
What is it: UPop is the first structured pruning framework for vision-language Transformers. It enables effective structured pruning on various multi-modal & uni-modal tasks (including Visual Reasoning, Image Captioning, Visual Question Answer, Image-Text Retrieval, Text-Image Retrieval, Image Classification and Image Segmentation), datasets (including NLVR2, COCO Caption, VQAv2, COCO, Flickr30K, ImageNet and ADE20K), and model architectures (including BLIP, CLIP, DeiT and Segmenter).

What challenge does it tackle: The above figure demonstrates that Unified Search adopted by UPop rescues us from the burden of repeated experiments (e.g., doing grid search) for searching optimal compression ratios among different modalities and structures. Furthermore, Progressive Pruning adopted by UPop eliminates the weight gap between the searched model and the pruned subnet to be retrained, therefore gaining better convergence and performance, especially at high compression ratios.
 How about the performance: On multimodal tasks, for example, UPop can achieve 2x compression with only 1.2% and 2.0% accuracy loss on the VQAv2 dataset for Visual Question Answer and the NLVR2 dataset for Visual Reasoning, respectively. On unimodal tasks, for example, UPop can achieve 1.5x and 1.2x compression without any loss of accuracy on the ImageNet dataset for Image Classification and the ADE20K dataset for Image Segmentation, respectively. Some examples of vector-level structured granularity are as follows.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In AlphaGo, a tree search is performed, and uses the policy network to reduce the breadth of it. At the leafs, if the states are not terminal, it uses the value network. And then "backup" the values to update the Q value at the initial state (if 70% of my rollouts won after performing action a_1, my Q value q(initial_state, a_1) should converge to 0.7 in my initial state). But I don't see where the policy network is updated?
 ​
 Here is a slide from David Silver, the first-author of AlphaGo, but it doesn't mention how to update the policy network.

 Have I missed something?

Prior to the pandemic, we both worked full-time in careers that we loved and found meaningful, and we sent our daughter to a full-day Montessori school. Although I struggled with significant health issues, I felt unbelievably lucky and fulfilled in both my family life and my professional life. The pandemic upended my careful balance. Every family is different, with different needs, circumstances, and constraints, and what works for one may not work for others. My intention here is primarily to share the journey of my own (very privileged) family.
